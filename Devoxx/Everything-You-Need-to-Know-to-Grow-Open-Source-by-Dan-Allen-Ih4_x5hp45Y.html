no-brainer actually that's false doing
open source well and growing a
successful ecosystem around it it
requires trust me it requires a lot of
brainpower it's hard and it does not
come for free responding to questions
reviewing issues and code changes
organizing events motivating people it's
it's a daily duty and it does it takes
investment time money you name it but
with all things that produce value
especially in this case tremendous value
it's totally worth doing so open source
we know it's the best model that we've
come up with for producing software do
it poorly though and what you unleashed
on the world amounts to little more than
a code dump do it well and your project
it develops a life a culture of its own
so how do you do it how do you grow you
know how do you give the project spark
how do you grow it two thousand ten
thousand users many many contributors so
I've cultivated very successful open
source communities on sparse budgets in
some case no budgets each experience has
taught me lessons and I'm here today to
share them with you and I'm really
excited because I've waited a long time
to tell this story so I hope you'll be
able to use this advice to make any type
of community building efforts you're
doing wildly successful and for you to
stand out from the crowd the crowd that
doesn't do this so well so perhaps it
kind of goes without saying but if you
want to grow you you gotta have an
effort that is worth joining you know
how many projects have you come across
and you just make you think what in the
heck are they trying to accomplish here
what is this for I don't see the point
so don't be that project you need to
know your own purpose find your purpose
and why do you exist because you're not
going to build a community unless you
really have a reason to do it people
need to know where you're headed they
need they need to have a vision that
they can believe in you know they need
to get a sense of purpose a rally call
we can say a resin Dutch d'être they
want to be able to achieve something you
know that's bigger than themselves
something they can they can't achieve
when themselves alone so they join into
a community so you have to know what
that is
the other thing you have to remember is
that open source is created by people
individuals so to grow open source you
have to understand what motivates people
you need to amp them up so to speak and
in his book dr dan pink identifies three
key factors that basically drive people
and those are autonomy mastery and
purpose hence amp so participation an
open source relies on this because it's
voluntary so you always have to remember
and respect that aspect but don't think
that people working for free because
that would be naive they just aren't
working for direct financial gain in the
traditional model you Tet you gave them
money and you told them to go do
something so they're driven by something
else other purposes people participate
to do what they enjoy what they love far
away from the crap that they don't they
participate to learn from each other and
they value each other's knowledge and to
grow together so that sense of growing
up in in a group and they value the
exchange of the ideas themselves that
they're passing back and forth from each
other is very important but ultimately
all this stuff comes down to is they
they work for personal fulfillment at
least your audience does in open source
so in order to kind of tap into that you
have to craft a call to adventure for
the community who becomes your hero you
want them to come and show up and he'll
go on an adventure and your mission then
becomes a story it becomes your story
your project story it shapes the culture
of your community it serves as a filter
to help you decide ok what are we going
to do what's out of scope and who are
these people that are showing up you
know what makes them get up in the
morning so dogfish head the Brewing
Company one of my favorites has this
fantastic tagline because it's so
concise off-centered ales for all
centered people so that's something that
people can really rally around think
about it it has what they want to
achieve they don't want to create
regular beers at everyone else crates
they want to create unique beers they
have a purpose and it's an identity of
the people that show up
there are off centered people what does
that say it sort of says hey listen we
get you we know that you're not like
everyone else we see you as an
individual so that's the stuff that gets
people behind you so don't let people
pass you by because you lack a purpose
you know get noticed have a purpose have
a resin d'etre and then communicate it
but the thing to keep in mind about this
is that brilliant software alone is not
enough to get people to act you know
oftentimes this you know engineers kind
of get stuck in this thinking and say
myself are so brilliant that people are
going to show up and they're going to
love it no they're not they don't care
because they don't know so to build a
great community you need to communicate
so community notice communicate your
idea is going to be judged initially
based on how well you said what it is
that your idea was there's this great
quote that I came across by Carmen gala
is in a society that values speech free
from income esoteric and comprehensible
 okay they are going to hear the
jargon coming out of your mouth so when
you say when I say communicate what I'm
really saying is your message needs to
be organized authentic and empathetic so
as you when you create a new project on
github your you get this pop-up of this
dialog box and it says help people
interested in this repository so
interested in your project understand
why should they be there why do they
need to know what do they need to know
about the readme isn't necessarily about
all the technical things that does it's
supposed to be your chance to motivate
them and then the user manual or
whatever else can give them those
details beyond that but the readme is
about planning an idea an idea in their
hearts of something that doesn't exist
and now they want to be a part of it so
help them understand because only ideas
that spread only idea is to get
understood or ideas that really have any
legs so to bring them on in you need to
show up so we need to communicate but
you have to be a person behind that
those words so every project starts out
as a ghost town and you're you have to
ask yourself you know are you going to
be a project that never picks up any
activity and gets people behind it or
are you going to kind of flat line so no
activity two people that signals a dead
project I mean almost nowadays it's kind
of a stigma that if you go to github and
you see last activity and he okay this
projects probably dead one year ago
that's probably dead so activities in a
very very very important part of
communicating that you're alive and
you're doing something because people
tend to get kind of aggressive when they
notice that something is dead it's sort
of a natural human reaction sort of kick
something that isn't a lie because
humans only know to respond to things
that are alive and they want to see that
something you know it responds to
external forces so that can often be a
problem for growing a new community if
you don't have activity people get
aggressive right away so what you want
is instead of flatlining we want to have
regular steady intervals of activity
whatever it is we'll talk about a little
bit later but you want to communicate
with the community through this activity
beyond be everywhere you know
communicate openly to a fault so a great
way to get information out there is to
say hey I need to make a decision so
just start talking about it online you
know use everything open because if
you're open it generates activity so
that's a very important thing but also
take the time to meet with the community
to know the individuals you know make
them feel like you have all the time in
the world for every single one of them
the best manager I ever had did this
exactly for me it didn't matter if we
were in the middle of a production fire
if I said oh hey I need to talk to you
he would say production fire can be
dealt with later what do you need to
talk about that's very very important
message and I respected that too and
then I didn't spend too much time with
him because I knew there were other
things too to do so you want to make
each person center of attention because
in the end communication is the water
the synopsis that make up the the life
site the activity in your project and
they make that communication flowing
readily through your project is healthy
for your project but also remember the
communications to a so it's not always
you talking I mean okay so today it's
just I'm talking to you but I'm going to
go home and listen because really in an
open source we're taking advantage of
this idea that hey there are a lot of
people here collective thinking power in
numbers you can't leverage
power numbers if you aren't listening
they have the secret to what can make
you great so to realize that power make
communication extremely easy one of the
main reasons i really love github issues
is because it's so easy to just get my
thoughts out there in a very contextual
way without blasting out an entire
mailing list and so each of the issues
have their own channel so to speak and I
can work on that one channel and we can
be in close contact so Matt Ridley
actually has this very great quote in
this TED talk he gave was what's
relevant to a community and think about
this for a second is how well people are
communicating their ideas not how clever
any individualists okay the clever
individual thing that's proprietary
software we're not interested in that
what we're interested in is the
collective of all the great ideas that
are out there and but we're not going to
get any of those ideas if we're not
communicating so I think that part of
getting them to speak you know sorry
getting them to come forward with these
ideas because if we're going to build on
ideas we need to hear them is that you
want to show them that you want them
there show them that you actually want
to grow that it's not just you and your
kind of annoyed when people come by like
oh don't bother me you know because I've
had that experience and open source
projects you want to make the
communication personal and respect this
is a very important thing think about
this respect that they came and they
shared what is now an irretrievable
slice of their life with your project
they can ever have that part of their
life back so when you when that's met
with hostility that can be a very very
damaging thing so we'll get into more of
that in bed now communication doesn't
necessarily have to mean a lot of words
okay so I've talked about being
listening but when you're talking back
hey listen there's only so much energy
all of us have during a day so plus one
says hey I'm present and support this it
also provides encouragement which we'll
talk about a bit later you can also
communicate simply through like commits
of docs in code I've talked about this
before like you committing is actually
you talking I mean you don't think of it
that way but it really is because they
come from the other side and they see
that activity behind the project they
know this project is being maintained
so be transparent that's the other thing
Trent this is probably the most
important in my mind is the most
important thing and open source
especially if your company or your large
organization running a project be honest
transparent and frank share everything
communicate transparently just be real
and human ok because because humans have
an unbelievable ability to recognize fit
fake behavior words non-authentic things
and frankly if you're that you're dead
to them they don't care they want to
connect to a human even if you're a
large company they want to find a human
within the company to connect to so
leave discussions about your product out
of the community if it's not related to
the community leave it out of the
community contribution should be good
for the good of the project and you
should be focused on the project not
self centered on your needs when you're
doing community do a community one
hundred percent don't don't do this
halfway crap okay because the thing is
then don't do it because you're not
going to get any success so you're
working for a company that sponsors an
open source project for instance be very
aware that when you get caught on the
inside so you they don't hear from you
for a while like they hear from you to
hear from you they love your project
then all of a sudden nothing for a while
like that that speaks volumes even
though you're saying nothing it's the
quickest way for people to disassociate
so in the end for this section show up
and communicate because when you show up
you're there and they're there and you
get to know them and they cease to be
outsiders and instead you're drawing
them in now speaking of drawing the men
you always want to make sure that you're
making people feel welcome be all
inclusive all inclusive to anyone that
really wants to come and join your
project you want to create what you want
to create is a safe space for people
with ideas and there's these budding
ideas that are very delicate like little
flames you know in the beginning that
you're trying to make a flame with
sticks it's very delicate than being
kind of have to give it encouragement so
you you want to make sure that in the
beginning that's easy to get into now on
the other side of things remember this
the very first touch that a person
hasn't a project that's them testing you
okay you have to realize that you're
being tested soon as you see something
for the very first time they have a
question whatever it is they want to see
how you respond they're testing they're
going to
if if this response is good I'll
consider this community if it's bad I'm
out I have I can go anywhere else okay
they don't have to be in your community
so and people are going to have tons and
tons of questions lots of them questions
are interest this is great okay think
about this even the questions that seem
like the dumbest questions mean hey I'm
kind of interested in your project I
didn't know exactly how to ask a good
question but I'm interest I'm here right
that irretrievable slice of their life
again no matter how silly that first
question is or how trivial to come the
contribution just remember something the
leader the next leader of the project
will be one of those people because
every single leader of the project that
came to replace a previous leader
started right there was a day that they
did their first thing my contribution
today ask you dr. project was that I fix
the typo but I'm now been leading it for
three years so I started out that way to
in the projects now how many times you
could come into a project and you've
been told uh yeah can you use the other
front door please this is the wrong
place to start never do that to your
community okay be very careful about
telling them they did something wrong
from the very beginning the issue
tracker this is the homepage for most
people for your project okay they don't
even see your your your glorious
designed home page which you had a
design or do or WordPress or whatever it
is they don't even see it they don't
care because they have they have a need
and they say hey look I try to use your
project I have something I'm getting
right into it so what you do is they
file an issue and there the very first
time and you recognize him never seen
that user name before hey welcome thanks
for coming yeah we'll get to the issue
in a second but thank you for being here
so what you want to do is is you want to
optimize for that first touch because
you never get a chance to make a set
second approach you know first
impression as they always say so you
want to optimize for that you want to
always be welcoming newcomers I mean
growth if we're really what are we
talking about today we're talking about
growth growth is more people coming in
than leaving well you can't have growth
if you're not always trying to grow so
that first touch that's why it's so
critical because it is in essence it is
the lifeblood of growth
you have to keep having that happen now
those are all the kind of posit well
sort of i've talked about the normal way
that people come into projects there's
another way that they come into projects
too and they come in very passionate you
have to understand the formation and
growth is a violent thing okay we are
we're in the business of passion and
passion means that people come in hot
okay the earth as this depicts was once
created by a tremendous collision in
space and our moon sort of came from it
but but the idea was that we wouldn't be
what we are today if the earth wasn't
bombarded with all kinds of comets and
other you know celestial bodies that's
what brought life to earth well these
people that come in hot or bringing life
into your project okay so yes it's dirty
in the beginning but creativity is that
way they're probably though more
frustrated than they are mad keep that
in mind and what you want to do is a
project later so you say okay I'm seeing
the situation what do i do you need to
give them outlets right you need to give
them you don't know what channel that
passion turn it into productivity
challenge them to do something because
your responsibility is to make them
productive if you want to grow you need
to make them productive you don't you
failed them okay this is absolutely the
truth you failed them if they if they
didn't become productive now the other
thing is you'll have dissenters now
dissenters don't alienate chaste them
chastise them okay don't don't don't be
a jerk to them be smart assimilate them
assimilate their ideas because if
they're saying hey that what you do
sucks I have a much better way of doing
it you go oh that's cool that's an idea
can I take that idea we can make our
project better okay be smart about it
because it's just a waste of breath to
you know try to fight with them when
you're interacting with people whether
they're dissenters passionate people or
kind of you know more shy newcomers you
never lose points for professionals I'm
here not sure what to do just don't be
an ass okay because that's the quickest
way to build a toxic community and a
build is sort of an oxymoron there
because he you don't build if you're
talking
ok so just always be professional be
professional to a fault treat everyone
with respect employees especially if you
have if it open source company I don't I
absolutely think that there's absolutely
no excuse that an employee that's
working on open source project treats
anybody poorly I i if I were was running
that company that they'd be going that
next day I don't care that that's a zero
tolerance policy for me there's no
reason not to be awesome to your
community members so communication like
it the it the worst like if you have a
person who's like very very technically
brutal that's okay as long as they're
personally respectful so criticize the
ideas not the person and I'm talking
about the when you criticize the person
that's zero tolerance for me because if
the environment is closed or hostile
they're out and if they're out your
community is going to die so promote
diversity in all always so when I was
some living in maryland there there was
this bumper sticker now I've modified
here but it says choose civility in
Howard County that was what it
originally said and I and I used to
think to myself like but that that seems
like a pretty low expectation that you
can just be civil like couldn't you be
like nice like couldn't you be you know
what does that mean so actually as it
turns out being civil is actually a
little bit more than just not being an
ass it's actually a little bit more than
that and it is sort of comes down to
being inclusive acknowledging people and
you know assuming the best in people
being constructive okay they're these
things that make up civility if you go
to the website choose civility you can
read all about it but what's interesting
is that that is exactly what we need to
do to grow open source is that we need
to be civil we need to do all the things
that are in their in their principles
because that's their building a
community we're building a community too
so the tone you set for your community
it's going to determine its fate let's
be honest I mean they always say well
that project leads set a nice tone and
if he didn't set a nice tone well he
might as well just quit because the
community is not going to grow so put
your best attitude forward and when in
doubt choose civility now once you
receive a contribution acknowledge it
being thanked feels good every single
damn time people didn't never
don't fill up on gratitude they don't go
I'm good actually I'm kind of full and
gratitude today like I'm good I don't
need to be thanks anymore kind of full i
ate a little bit too much thanks no
people love it it feels really good but
you have to be you have to do it
generously and you have to do it
sincerely you should be doing it so much
that you might as well put a key on your
keyboard and if you you know you're
doing it right when you practically no
the user names of all your community
members by heart you know you or
everyone collectively in your modules
and you're mentioning them on Twitter
you're mentioning them on github you're
mentioning the release notes mention
mention mention but what this does is it
says hey contributors I see you I
appreciate your work I value your
contribution and you have ownership
which we're going to get to but what you
have ownership and what's funny is
there's no secrets here like I could say
this I could say this to a group of
people and then I could do it and the
fact that I said it doesn't make it any
less meaningful to them okay this is
because this is just how we work as
humans and it also keeps them motivated
right if you want to sort of motivate
someone to go to the next level you say
thank you and then they and they they
sort of have this reaction of okay cool
i was thank now i'll do the next step so
instead of saying please do this please
do that you say thank you you don't
necessarily ask him what to do next
because they'll bring that going back to
the autonomy mastery purpose they'll
bring their own reason for keeping going
so now i want to tell you a little story
and and hopefully if you remember
nothing from this talk but i really hope
is this story sticks with you so i've
been working in open source communities
for a long time but i can never quite
put my finger on why why a community
worked you know why one work y 1 didn't
what made it tick and until right here
in antwerp in 2013 so two years earlier
i was like notes in the the lead of
their killing project and myself we were
walking with a newcomer to the arc alien
community were just walking down the
kaiser lay heading towards a restaurant
and we kind of got to the restaurant we
said hey we're gonna go eat dinner here
would you like to join us and he said no
no I know I have to go I'm not speaker
like you guys and I probably I probably
shouldn't join you I probably can and
then he kind of walked off and I was
like and I looked at each other kind of
bewildered for a second what's going on
here and then instinctually we agreed go
get him go get him like and I was like
Randolph and pulled him back bartosz was
just as much a part of our Killians is
either one of us his interest that day
you know that month or whatever to get
involved in our Killian made him just as
much of this community as anyone who'd
been working on it for years so you fast
forward two years later bartosch had
become a speaker deadlox he was a
debauch seein he was speaking in fact
about getting involved in open source so
that year we were actually all rooming
together in an apartment and we left the
apartment four different times the
morning of his talk for reasons that I
can share with you that's a story for
beer central okay but we anyway we
attended is another talk I was over it
in one of the other rooms before
bartocci's so I and I was chatting with
someone in the corridor afterwards I got
to get held up and so I ended up being a
few minutes late getting to par Tasha's
talk as I entered into the room the room
under is shaking your head at me going
uh mm-hmm and I'm practically I'm
stepping over people you know just to
kind of get you know these quarters just
to get up enough to see bartosch
standing down on the stage and the room
was completely packed to the backs of
the rooms and there were no seats at all
so two years earlier bartosh viewed
himself is I'm just another person in
the crowd and I'm not worthy of note and
now as one of the leadership in the hour
Killian project I can't even get into
the room to see my community member
speaking you know we we believed in him
before he was ready to believe in
himself I mean we never even questioned
it and now he's a celebrity I can't even
go go go in to see him but that is not
the amazing part of the story that's
just the intro right because the focus
of his talk was to encourage other
people to get involved in open source
because it had changed his life so much
in those two years so about half way
through the talk he puts up this slide
and it's the names and faces of other
open source contributors and he said
these are the people that inspire me but
they weren't the project leaders they
were they were other community members
they were other people like him that had
come in and joined the project and he
was talking about projects that they
worked on but then he went a step
further despite only having a quickie so
he's only got a 15 minute talk here okay
he decides well I'm gonna give up five
minutes at the end of my talks leaving
him only 10 minutes because there was
this guy in the hacker garden that he
was that he was working with who was
working on this open-source project in
the open source project really inspired
him so he gave him the stage and allowed
him to talk about what he was doing his
project and said this is this is the
type of thing that I think that you know
is really amazing about open source is
people that do work like this guy so at
this moment I realized what it is that
makes community work this is what makes
it grow you're directing the limelight
on other people that should be
recognized but aren't being recognized
yet you're making opportunities for the
other people in the group and he and
bartosh had responded to the call the
community to kind of follow in in the
culture that Isaac and I had sort of
started of passing on and helping these
people become successful then he was
doing that for others so in 2012 our
ta's received a JBoss community award
for his work on our Killian and now he's
the community manager for killing
remember that first touch thing you know
so now today Alec Soto who was one of
the people on the slide and you can now
see in this picture is the lead of their
killing cube project which is a very
critical sub-module to our Killian and
he's also the co-author of our Killian
action and he's a debauch seein and he
spoke this year more times than I've
ever spoken at any conference okay so
what's good for the community members is
amazing for the project what's amazing
for the project is amazing for the
community members by passing these
opportunities you you're investing in
the project's future and what you build
is not just a community because we're
talking about growing no no okay growing
community that's uninteresting we grow a
devoted community we grow a community
that is bound basically for life okay
these people are not only working
together they're extremely close friends
and they help each other have new ideas
all the time like our Killian cube so
recognition is something to be passed
all
each leader has recognition to share
leaders are going to get attention
because their names on the project Alex
now gets attention because he's working
on her Killian Cuban his name is on the
the the the module and now he's a mirror
he passes on that to other people who
deserve the light and you orchestrate
the growth of the community through this
but this is how the community scales you
see because i said before being personal
knowing every individual yes and you're
going to say to me hey after a hundred
people how can you keep track of all
those people you don't you live on
through the other contributors and the
other contributors do it and they do it
to other contributors and that's how it
is is that you basically get to be
everywhere in the project through the
culture that you built and Thomas
Jefferson has this famous quote to say
you know though that person who receives
an idea for me that they receive that
idea and I don't lose anything it's sort
of like a person who likes someone
else's candle your candle doesn't become
more dim because their candles now lit
and that's exactly what we're talking
about once the community is committed to
grow this is the key so the other thing
that you have to think about is that
open source is about you not doing it
alone so you're never going to get to
that if it at some point you you you
realize you're a Wallflower project
you're stuck to the wall you're always
confined to the edges of the pool so to
speak there are ways to make this less
scary you automate liberally but in the
end you want to empower people because
that's really what allows your community
to have this for that ownership to scale
out in you and you aren't limited by
your own time and abilities but you pass
it on but you can't pass it on if you
don't give them leadership so notice I
was saying that Alec Soto had become the
the lead of the of this module this is a
very important thing in our community
building is that we we pass on the
ownership of segments of the project to
newcomers that come in and show interest
and it's a great way to get lots of
leadership so it's not just one person
each person has their thing that they
maintain and then they have these many
communities within the community so what
we're doing here is we're promoting
contributors in de liters because trust
creates leaders and leaders become the
heroes of your project
so it's about empowerment I mean if you
think about every athlete is old that
it's ever existed it has had a coach at
some point and coaches help us believe
in ourselves before we're ready to
believe in ourselves you know there are
mentor and so those are what the
community leaders are they're the
coaches they guide and nudge and they
help the people become productive
members of the community and then they
show them hey what you do matters and it
matters so much that I want you to be
the lead of that thing so no other way
is sustainable so growing a community
isn't something that you want to do it's
really something that you have to do or
else your project will never get off the
wall of the pole it'll always be
confined to that and success you know is
is something that that's the business
you're in right you're in the business
of success I say no you're in the
business of success for your community
because success is infectious when
people see their peers being celebrated
hey and they achieve success for being
part of a project where do you think
they want to be in that project the
success of the community it translates
into siska success of the project and
that translates into success of the
business but all that success that comes
to the business that's because you did
the main thing well so if you're not
focused on that you're not doing that
well you're not going to get all those
other benefits you know we recently
celebrated the the back to the future
day and one of the things I thought was
interesting about back to the future ii
and we think of the car but the other
thing was this picture every time that
he that the the protagonist made
mistakes in going back in the past then
the future picture started to fade don't
let this happen to your community you
may start out with you know that energy
and then you sort of say well we've had
success so now I'm kind of I'm kind of
pulling back a little bit and as you
pull back what you're going to notice is
your community members are going to
start fading away okay they were devoted
before they were interested the activity
or project was good you show less
interest it fades away so it's going to
be very easy to forget about your
community as you start having success
and that's the death now of your project
do not let that happen you almost want
to treat every every phase of your
project as
first phase you know in terms of how
much passion you put into it one of the
ways we do that is we put up faces faces
faces of all the contributors that have
been a part of the project on the
project pages I don't think there's a
reason that there's a project that
exists an open source it should be doing
this every project should do this okay
there's no reason not to first of all
it's easy to do it but it's also very
important it's about sharing that
prosperity because sharing the
prosperity is what builds the ethos of
the project and it's what allows it to
be sustained long-term so look social
events like this one are you getting
together with just people in your
company and you sort of leave the the
community members out are you saying hey
community members what are you doing for
dinner let's let's get together okay so
you you don't want to be above them
you're not above them just like we
weren't above bartosch even though he
was just starting out so he came up with
this this chart that I'll finish up with
this is basically what I think if we put
it to sort of a chart this is our secret
for growing communities is that first
you need to inspire them there's a
reason that they're there and then
immediately as soon as they show up
because you inspire them and there's
like cool this thing is awesome I want
to be part of it recognize them hello
welcome them recognize their
contribution but then that's not enough
you need to encourage them can you can
you do a little bit more in the project
you know I read I see you I want you to
be part of it do you want to do a talk
on it can I help you do your talk etc
there's things you can do and then
empower them they become eventually
leaders and then finally the most
important thing is that when once you
make them leaders and they do this for
the next generation then your project is
able to become sustainable you want
contributors to be successful because
they chose to join your community and
you want other people's to see that
right because if you make them
successful then other people will want
to be successful and that's how you gain
devotion that's how you grow you care
about the individuals thank you and good
