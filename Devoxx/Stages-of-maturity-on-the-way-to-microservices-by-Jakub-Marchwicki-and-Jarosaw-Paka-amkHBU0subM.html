this is not the first time we are
collaborating with CRA Khan the
presentation it's actually the second
time but it makes it even harder we
would like you to we would like to
welcome you to talk about stages of
maturity and the micro services with to
begin with this will be almost like we
are honest people direct opinionated
biased view on kind of a sustainable
industry having a micro service
everywhere Christ in the background yeah
more more more or less and of course
there is a there's a disclaimer
disclaimer yes okay so we'll have like
50 minutes I think so we'll try to not
mention the technology during this to 20
50 minutes so no source code it's okay
for you it's still okay and we will not
try to convince you that micro services
or several surveillance next year or
reactive next year is a good technology
okay we will not try to convince you so
you will not leave this room with any
opinion or micro-services are good or
bad okay will not solve any of your
questions you have because and this is
my slide Cooper didn't want the slide
for a reason
who knows timothy leary so to which
people who don't know timothy he was
really famous person and he is my
personal coach for one reason in 70s he
discovered LSD and he was one of the
greatest promoters of LSD and that's why
he is my persona here and he in his book
you're in tune in tune out written this
statement that it is important to
question authority you are on the
conference and in front of you there are
some outrageous in different rooms not
invested and you have to question
whatever you hear because some people
are selling something for you some
people want to be nice and you need to
be you need to question whatever they we
are telling the truth we are not always
right but always honest and my our wives
are saying sometimes funny okay but it's
my wife's opinion and kebapi ah my spell
okay we don't know the order of the
slides why we are talking about
micro-services since 2015 on every
conference in on corridors over coffee
with our spouses partners children with
everybody
everything is micro for last two three
years what is the reason
I think I know the answer every year do
you know Sesame Street and at the end of
every every part of the Sesame Street
there is the sentence but this piece was
sponsored by the letter A and number
thirteen and this is like in our
industry every year there is something
new shiny why we are going crazy about
this new stuff because our work is
boring just admit it you can say it out
my work is boring and it's okay I do
write rest services do you think it's
great work how many rough surfaces you
can write before you are going to die or
retire every time I write micro service
I have a small scratch on my desk with a
knife so I have a lot of small scratches
when the free space is out of my desk it
means that you had to change job okay
because our work is boring and we knew
Annie need something but brings promise
and hope because usually the
architecture have you introducing it you
implement new architecture you think it
will solve your problem and six months
later you sit with your friends and say
it doesn't solve any of the problems
let's choose new architecture so we are
implementing all these things because we
are bored I think so there are other
reasons as well yeah and these other
regions can take different forms and can
express itself in a different way so
will work walk walk through some of
those one of those is there is a concept
of a cargo called architecture and yes
it takes many forms and it has been said
many times on this conference already
that it can be your in-house framework
you know these small shiny thing that
you've been build out into building
internally and then you feel very
emotional it's like every PHP developer
had to write CMS at some point of life
yes yes that's that's a chorus of
programmer and then then then we have
like we have this framework because our
domain our business our company is
specific you know who heard that you
know yeah we do it differently because
you know we are specific that's every
time and still you know on the other
hand we are about to protect the
existing state you know there is this
architect who's not coding for past ten
years already but at some point he did
this made Navin archetype that defines
the service and your company and now
after five or six years you are still
using it
nobody knows why but he just keeps doing
it you know he just keeps forcing it you
know there's this this this Kolkata deal
we want to escape it we don't want to be
in this this word anymore because you
know at the same time as we are forced
to do the same things in a way we don't
exactly understand why the competition
never sleeps there's a running running
away the cost of maintaining this hedge
Ralph you know cargo cult in the company
is ever-growing you know it has many
forms it has it can be expressed in what
many ways like now we don't open we
don't take open source and to our
project it's it's not safe so we will
just copy the open source into comm
company's internal package in our
application so we don't have this
external dependence it probably seemed
it not once not twice okay and as this
kind of cloud-based keeps growing it it
becomes harder and harder to attract new
people to the company and what we start
to see is that there's this concept of
resilient organization of ability to
adapt to change to respond to change and
it's not happening you know the business
comes over and say you know we've
measured and we've spoken with our users
and this button it should be on the left
and it should be blue not red because
you know it will work better with users
they're humans and you look at it and
say yeah I know but it's 30 days it's 30
days to move a button from right-hand to
left-hand side and then they came and
say no that's not resilient organization
that's not the way we'd like you to work
you're not responding to change in a way
that we would like to you to respond to
change so then they come with this thing
called a droid you know we will be other
we will respond to change but the thing
is that as long as we don't loosen the
dependency between people and software
we won't change much as long as you
still have this single person in a
company this bus factor one that is very
important not to lose him because that's
the only person who knows how the
mainframe works that's that's not you
know that's not possible to change the
organization and that's why we start to
think maybe we can just make a giant hop
and jump to a new architecture but
that's not the only vision look at this
picture you know who it is it is you and
this is the legacy system and you know
why it's snake
have you read Bible read it it's a devil
it's a Satan it's like a see the thing
is that your organization is not special
and your project is not special
everybody has it
every organization because I'm changing
job quite often for various reasons you
know me and every time they say we are
better than anyone else when you join
this component they give you access to
your to the weapon they say oh my god
again and usually C++ tuxedo ColdFusion
who knows could fill confusion any
active confusion developers I know I
work with you is about this company in
Krakov
Italy so PHP Delphi I started as a deaf
at Delphi developer who knows TPS
transaction processing facility Sabre
they always they also have this
Barberton yeah nobody tells you look at
the job descriptions they don't say we
have a TP f we have fancy new
technologies but as we were doing the
slides with Koba
this is the moment when when I started
to cry I am old emotional people because
I understood that varies behind every
legacy there is a tragedy not only you
know people working over hours but
another tragedy let's look at it you
have like I see the first thing that
happens the hips of developers don't
want to work with it you know you know
the hips of developers you know what we
do if something with if framework has a
title stable it not it's not cool
anymore but why in JavaScript is
changing frameworks often because
somebody said it's stable a personal
problem they will go away sooner or
later to Starbucks doing coffee or
finding a nice place in the sturdy
mountains so they will go away the
problem is and this is the challenge but
when you have legacy you can't use any
new stuff because you can't you know try
to run Mongo with tables for point -
lucky you and what happens is the
organization goes into this state of
equilibrium that profess everybody knows
it is a problem we know we have a legacy
yeah we have a business needs new
features because they always need new
features executives needs business
continuity they don't care your CEO a
CTO doesn't care about your product no
as long as it makes money and it's
called business continuity this is
making money nothing more hipsters
developers don't want to touch it
seniors don't want to touch it either
because this is called job security if
they fix it somebody can have fire them
okay so as long as you don't add you
don't fix it you have your work so where
is the tragedy yeah everybody knows it
is a problem nobody wants to touch it it
makes money unfortunately
the legacy system make a up of
money but there are the reasons not
purely organizational organizational not
purely human related we would like to
move away from legacy from existing
services we are on the way to micro
services because that's the way for us
to time fires to keep things separated
and avoid this black hole down thing
because if in our application the
payment doesn't work in our e-commerce
site the payment doesn't work it's bad
because don't say ecommerce say hologram
then I'll nothing personal I don't worry
that if it doesn't work obviously
customers cannot buy stuff but it
doesn't mean that they cannot search
through the side look for new products
and just explore the existing the
existing product it doesn't mean they
cannot look through the history the
problem with the legacy systems is that
we keep all those things together and
when one for the product everything else
just usually stopped working the other
thing that is the problem or the reason
for that is that not all features are
equal you know different features have a
different access patterns different
features have different scaling needs
and the thing is that an monolith in our
legacy we just keep them together and we
think that well maybe on the way to
micro services we can separate them and
we can use them differently that's
that's very tempting that's that's how
we would like to arm to approach it
because for example we have this part of
our application that is used one of the
year it's for reporting but it still
with the whole our legacy system and we
just you know key
maintaining it and if we could have
separated it maybe it'll be easier at
some point maybe not
once more we go for this atomic releases
we release everything together we have a
feature that is ready but we are not
releasing it because oh the feature is
ready but we are not releasing it it's
not used by the customer so it's like
flashing money in the toilet who had
this you know delay in releasing the
feature because some other feature that
we were not entirely dependent upon but
it was it was in the queue for release
just felt over and the release and the
deployment cycle we miss the deployment
window and then we have another three
month for another deployment we window
and we're just waiting with this feature
and then after half a year somebody
finally deploys it and there is a back
in there and they call you you say like
you know we deployed this and there is a
bargain like what like I did like half a
year ago no and we had those atomic
releases and and we would like to also
avoid it we would like to move away from
that and then then the architect came
and said the architect this is usually
lonely architect nobody talked with
people do you top of your architects no
but he sees in his lonely tower made of
ivory uncertainity and sadness and he's
selling things yeah we're screwed
let's do micro services he's lonely
without the dark you know the rubber
duck because even the rubber duck does
want to talk with him and he says that
creates more modules which only have one
reason for a change and he said let's
communicate over well-defined interfaces
and almost shouting let the output of
the one micro service becomes the input
of another one let's create tools to
automate our work let's create new micro
slavery's rather than the refactor the
old one when requirements change you
know and he's happy smiling he wants to
get out of his tower to developers as
lesson birthday of our distributed
you think let's move fast and break
things and developers oh and the thought
it was good everybody wanted to adopt it
so let there be micro services and our
intention is not to analyze whether it's
a good movement or it's a bad movement
whether it will solve all your problems
or it will just create another bunch of
that you have never thought about we
just would like to point out several
things that we find important and it
won't be a checklist like Joel Spolsky
checklist that you have to run through
but it will be just for us to let you
see use for yourself whether you are
ready to embrace the micro services or
whether there are certain things that
you should have been doing upfront
before you jump on this bond for them so
the first thing that we thought about is
do things more often because if it hurts
do it more often if you have your
release cycle once a month and always
always after going on production you
have this hectic night of fixing
everything then do not do it once a
quarter once half a year do you have the
week because it's if it hurts just it
more often because it will hurt so much
that you will finally finally fix it and
the microservices thing says the short
feedback loops are essential there are
foundation of the micro services so if
you are now deploying after half a year
maybe that's something you should change
upfront and then think about micro
services because no deploying micro
services over half a year that doesn't
really doesn't we make sense if you have
one service or two services yeah that
might be fine you know but then you can
deploy the manual but if you have like
20 or 40 or 400 that will be simply
unmanageable so do it more often maybe
do it automatically and then
what we thought that maybe before
jumping on the microservices there are
certain questions that we should ask
ourselves like how should we automate
our deployment
No ultimate ultimate like what packaging
what deployment mechanism how to switch
over whether we should go for green blue
deployments or whether Mac does matter
you know how to do how to roll back how
to roll back automatically or whether
just go on for just keep on rolling no
dye decisions and we should make them we
should make them kind of up front we
don't need to say yeah we'll be doing
like this we just have to rethink what
is most suitable for us and have this
has this upfront you know how to keep
the backward compatibility of our API
should we all we don't care you know
that's something to think about
so maybe kind of a revolution before
resolution before we don't go on to the
micro services that I will never ever
have to recompile and repackage the
application to change configuration no
or I will never ever have instances of
my application tied to a single api's
think it'd be a single I think your IP
addresses or I will never ever wake up
in the morning in the middle of the
night to roll back the deployment know
if I don't do that then maybe I kind of
more ready for the micro services you
work in organizations yeah so the
question is in the last six months how
often you heard this term let's break
silos every every city oh they have a
hidden book 20 things every city or
should say at least once a year they say
break silos the thing is but they don't
know but we are creating the silos not
they they are just you know figures we
are creating silos and I will tell you
how every day at stand up
my job is done here I have pushed code
to the repo and it works on my machine
ever organization this is how you create
silos not city earth here because the
thing is somebody told us but we are
developers and this is the problem so we
think we develop software we don't care
if it runs as long as it develops it's
okay
running is not my business the thing is
and I spent a lot of years in different
organizations developers tend to ignore
infrastructure they say somebody will
run it you know they even things but
there is no CPU but there is a secret
machine with small draw you know or
something running and mangling this bite
inside because there is no silicon ok a
kid so the truth is that infrastructure
the network the storage is a blood
stream of your organization not your
code okay if you ignore infrastructure
the infrastructure at some point of time
will ignore you and they will say you
know you can't deploy the software as in
one of my cases when I decided oh it
would be lovely to have infinite spawn
the Deo technology name if we span the
data grid in Maya in my application and
ID thousand finished bun and I struggled
like six months to get it working
because I didn't talk with the guys from
or network operations but actually
multicast doesn't work in our network so
infinite span can connect and I ignored
the infrastructure this is the moment
when you have to say can I change people
or should I change people you know
because not everyone is ready mentally
to think about infrastructure who is on
duty today
could youcould and i sorry guys this is
not the way you will make something
because if you do the architectural
transformation you also have to change
people it is not only the technology
problem it also it is also a problem
with people with people like my friend
who didn't know how to assess how to
machine and he was proud of it stupid
the problem is also that if you go to
any architecture you have to learn new
tools you'll have to learn new practices
you will have to discover new patterns
within your organization you will have
to make a ton of mistakes because what's
in some humans book is not everything
this is the perfect scenario the happy
path is the evil business in this book
the problem is that it takes time and
usually the organization have one thing
in common
they don't have time and the thing that
happens is do you know the third Newton
and law of change management it sounds
if you push people they will push back
even harder if you come to somebody and
say Scala from tomorrow go he will say
you know what we will say the f-word you
can't force people to use technology
with its approval supporting them hmm
so there are some questions you will
have to ask yourself what is your
deployment unit because you will be not
shipping the zip file over email to some
secret operations department this is how
some organizations in Warsaw deployed
the software by sending zip file over
email two people are sitting the
downstairs now and they don't talk to
each other so it's fine how to
externalize configuration how to make
your services discoverable because you
will have plenty of micro services and
it's not only discoverable for humans
but also for machines
and this is the things you will have to
remember I will never ever make manual
change on production environment
automate because someday the bus can hit
you and people will don't know what you
did
I will not assign people at all but
rather responsibilities I will not say
to you you are senior principal
front-end angular2 type script developer
you're a software engineer okay and you
do everything you can to make system
work and you will not accept status quo
which is sometimes called organization
structure and then you have to under way
to make your services you have to
understand your system because in our
monolithic code base of 2 millions lines
of code or 20 and a half there are 300
half millions line of code there are
areas that you don't even care about you
don't care what's happening over there
that's not your problem but that's even
worse because very often you don't
really get how your system works because
no matter how perfect it is it will
break at some point as we break badly
and then we need to understand you know
what's going underneath our application
you know and we need to understand the
operating system we need to understand
the container technology for a using one
we need to understand the JVM the Java
machine why this part is taking so slow
just randomly at some different points
in time and then we have to understand
the application framework you know who
cares how spring actually works
underneath no as long as it works as
long as it works we don't recur but then
if suddenly different beans get injected
in different places we say like what's
happening it is broken we will change
the framework because it doesn't work
and then finally we have to understand
our business our application and then if
we go on the micro services work for
each
servus this whole stack might be
different we try to standardize on
different things which is wise which is
good but sometimes the requirements are
just different and we have this
something built in Python or in tuplets
well they say it's good because you can
change the languages you can go for a
scholar then you have to understand some
different things in your application are
we ready for that no because once we
assume that everything can fail and it
can fail in the micro-services we're in
turn said in any other monolithic
application there are some patterns in
the microservices work which we can
explore which we can explore already now
we don't have to wait until you have
this small discreet services doing one
thing deployed as individual units there
are things like circuit breakers like
phobics retry policies when we go for
integration with external services who
does it at the moment in their
monolithic code base you know who cares
whether this external call to remote EJB
will actually fail or will not and who
does some additional precautions that it
might fail and we will just secure
ourselves against it against this
failure we don't want it we don't do it
we don't care whether this Message
Queuing that we are just pumping data
will ever be filled and we don't care
about things like pressure that it can
tell us that yeah I am full don't send
anything more no we just assumed that
everything will work like the happy path
because for Meniere's different
technologies like Java EE just made a
lot of effort to hide all those
complexities like this is a web service
call but you just wrap it in a stab and
expose it as a JB and you inject this
EJB locally so you will never ever know
that it's actually a remote HTTP call
until it fails or until it will be
unbelievably long and just low because
we didn't care and now Before we jump
onto this micro services bandwagon maybe
you should think about how it actually
works and
start doing the things already now
monolithic code base in our legacy
systems because then that will be the
tool that we will not be able to live
without in the micro services work and
if we don't use you and maybe you should
start using it now so some questions to
ask you know how it works how things
work know how the containers
technologies working you know if we spun
out different docker images how actually
the networking goes underneath whether
we should curl or we shouldn't you know
how the framework works you know how the
injection or how its wrapping different
things or whether it's single threaded
or multi threaded should recur what are
the principles behind the frame whether
the beans are singlet ins or they are
pulled and whether it makes any
difference and how we document these
decisions that impact our architecture
in the past so that we can learn from
the past so now you should never ever
treat remote systems as local first and
then we should never ever assume that
there is only the happy path in our
application you know a little fail and
we should never ever treat our framers
as a black box
know how we got carried springs job now
it isn't I always have the slides with
people because you hate people yeah
because I hate people in other it is
these are the architects and people who
don't want to learn living your
organization's once you migrate to micro
services because you have to change the
way you interact with people when there
is a problem in your organization the
system is not accessible the Frankfort
DC is down what happens in your
organization usually these things with
your fault it's always your fault and
then he goes back and says oh no no no
it's test test fault
with this kind of behavior because you
will have failures not once a month but
every day almost because the failure in
micro services is the new normal
you can't have the blaming culture
because you have to start focusing on
fixing things not finding the people who
are guilty it's not a problem
anybody think break things we have bad
days I have bad days I will have bad day
tomorrow
after today drinking and probably will
commit something to the repository and
things will happen sometimes you just
want to leave your wife or husband or
cat you have to okay
stop this not with presentation so you
have to focus on fixing things and no
improving not on finding guilty people
because it's not our goal to make
perfect system okay our goal is to make
system which is resilient if it fails we
can quickly fix it okay not 24 hours
down time we will have to and this is
what IR makes me angry people don't care
what happens with a system focus access
to matrix not good and you are making
your software like a booth blind fault
because you don't know how it works the
other thing is the matrix can tell you
where to refactor a when were to fix
system and people don't do it because we
don't care I just ship the gold close
move the ticket India and I'm God we
should isolate failures okay when one
part of the system is down it doesn't
have it means it means everything has to
be down because you will work with the
distributed system and this is Leslie
Lamport this is my true hero and his
definition of distributed system that
the sale of computer you didn't know
even existed
can render your own computer unstable
things will break so the questions we
have to ask are we were ready as an
organization to do this maybe we will
have to fire the middle management
because they are the root of all evil in
every organization
are you tied to your job title do you
have situation in your organization when
somebody says a can you implement this
test now I was hired as a programmer I
want to test it we have this kind of I
want implemented in Python because in my
job title is Senor Java back-end sprint
to developer so in that spring 3 games
you are no longer needed
are you ok to fail or do they have a
blaming culture are you product or
project oriented are you focus on
delivering projects and deadlines or are
you focus on delivering products this is
different but it doesn't always mean if
you deliver project what you deliver
product so I will never ever say UNIX
metrics and logs I will not say dopa in
lakhs anymore because what is what you
do guys I do it so this is the most
important debug statement it expresses
your emotions what you feel about it I
will never ever let my system failure
without my deliberate decision this is I
I have a control I am software engineer
and I decide you fail this now not the
system
I will not ignore things that go wrong
you know this floating under the carpet
everybody knows but you shouldn't walk
to this machine but you know don't tell
it anyone and I will not sacrifice
system resilience for any other
unexpressed goals so are the model is
here to stay
they say micro services are simple but
they aren't easy so maybe maybe models
are not as bad as we faked massive other
one said that
start with the monolith but then heroes
start with the micro services it depends
who pays at the moment they are probably
but many our model is are just slightly
less distributed system and we should
try to treat them as such
no because say
scan file and things will fail you know
we have databases who has database in
their system for everybody and it's it's
communicating over network and it's a
part of our system so we have at least
two components like my sequel or Oracle
and then we have Mongo who has like
sequel and non sequel database in their
system yes so now we have three parts
even though we've our our code base is
very monolithic it's usually you'll have
load balancers in front of your sister
yes because we have we are on fixed
nodes on 29,000 40 nodes so then we have
like messaging queues who has messaging
in their systems yeah so another parts
or so fourth part and then external
systems integration that's that's all
coming together and it's distributed
system but still in this distribution we
don't really treat it as a distributed
system so maybe we should start doing
that now and if we are fine with that
then we should think about micro
services because why not apply the
circuit breaker then our monolithic code
base at search one it's not new that's
something from 2004 mmm probably it's a
yeah well you said you can't use circuit
breaker if you can small non if nobody
no it's fine and then and then my name
is AJ be wrapped in his fixed comments I
can see it so maybe we should after
night after night after night now has
everything automated even if we deploy
an enterprise archive but we deploy it
on 20 servers why are we doing it manual
but we should automate it now so the
changes and so should we doing changes
to the infrastructure even though if we
are running on the application server
weather will be J balls or websphere or
WebLogic we usually tend to tune this
application server because we always
change some libraries we change some
configuration we tune XML files and
shoot out that automatically now how
many people how many of you are doing
just manually just locked those six over
the label six emelina's the end
it's already in production and another
very server you have different version
of the j-bot xml and maybe we should
wish we don't need this concept of
enterprise architecture whether it's a
role or whether it's a problem
maybe we can already automate the the
governance process of our enterprise
just have it from the logs and from the
tracing just have the image of how the
application actually works now whether
it's a monolith or whether it's just
multiple instances we should already try
how it works how the request goes where
it goes and what every Enterprise
architects do they are drawing they want
to pay people for drawings if you can
draw everything from the source code
from from log file why can't we use
Zipkin in our semi distributed system
you can use it king jalis yeah my next
open source project you can do it over
rest will emphasize that it's not that
hard no why don't we use consumer-driven
contracts just now with all the external
integrations no it's external it has a
certain there is a provider we are the
consumer why can't we use already this
concept of CDC the consumer different
contracts just now our model is has an
API it exposed some API why aren't we
testing it in a way that we are going to
test multiple micro services we'll just
embrace those those concepts and then
that's your favorite my favorite that's
everything but it's not about people now
it's not about people so you know evens
are really sexy when you do micro
services the even 3 mean even storming
event log and as even this everywhere
the question is why we can't use events
with monoliths because when it usually
when I talk to people about migration to
monolith way the first thing they want
to do is to cut out the small module and
do the micro services they extract the
code and as far as you can go to the
micro services what if we stay with
JBoss but on every call to our EJB we
push events to whatever we have it can
be JMS active and queue
fine and then once we have all the
business event on the queue then we
start to create microservices who
consumes the event why not go to call
this way why can't we have centralized
logging
I had 86 J buses find a bug with 86 log
files this was called distributed grep
you are doing SCP and calling over SCP a
grep command on a CD seek services this
is MapReduce the bash way
you can have elastic sides of the
objects and have locks in elastic search
so now we there yet with the micro
services surely so shall we go there now
or whether we should wait a little bit
I don't know our message is that this is
yes the things we've learned with micro
services and our industry that we think
can be applied in the monolithic word it
can trigger your migration it can make
certain think faster it can change your
attitude that can make you look at
things differently so why don't we just
use it now with whatever colorways we
are having I think this is the right
moment because you know the hype cycle I
promise I won't use this example back
sorry do you know the hype cycle when
the now new technology arises where is a
peak everybody uses it and then there is
this valley of despair when everybody
says all it doesn't work I think this
year we're with micro services reaching
this tipping point because if in fact in
POC your article says micro sized
business doesn't solve all the problems
it begins
but we understood finally but this is
not the solution to all our problems but
we can still use the things we
discovered yeah
yes it will make us our life just a
little bit easier easier happy faces yes
so we will leave you with that message
thank you very much
we were
six minutes what happened
there's tons of questions this is the
Attic the attic works in Allegro and has
400 micro services under his hood and my
name is the occupant I don't work in
Allegan but have micro services yes you
laughed about it you can you can reach
us on Twitter and we are hopeful for any
questions you might have
it's a good venue for having questions
it's not that huge as the other ones
which was yes I recently implemented
service discovery on on my driver's ed
works and circuit breakers whereas as
well I think this is for me I can speak
about the organisation rules okay
I never did it but this is the first
company are there's no finger-pointing
you are just focused on making things
better and there are no middle managers
yeah so thank you thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
