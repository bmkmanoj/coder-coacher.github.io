otherwise you wouldn't be here I mean
I'm a Java developer and I actually do
enjoy writing JavaScript purchased in
small projects and nothing really that
that matters because it's a great
language to explore stuff but it's
really bad when you want to write an
application that you need to maintain
for 10 years or more that you have to
develop in a large team with team
members with different skill sets for
these kinds of environments javascript
is really an awful choice now I don't
want to go on and rant about JavaScript
because javascript is just too easy
often target for that so just imagine
your favorite JavaScript rent at this
point and we'll just move on and look at
alternatives there are several
alternatives available maybe actually
too many and every time when we start a
new project always wondering which
language which we should actually use
instead of JavaScript and for that
reason I started to analyze the two most
popular ones in my opinion typescript
and coffee script and the most
interesting one egg most grip 2015
because I think it has a bright future
um my name's Michael I work for canoe in
Switzerland I'm a speaker and sometimes
I block if I find the time you can find
me on Twitter but mostly I'm actually a
UI developer by passion I really love
writing user interfaces it's technically
challenging because there if you have a
complex you I it's really hard to get it
right but also there are so many
different aspects you have to know about
you have to know about graphical design
you have to know about usability and you
obviously also have to know about coding
so I just love doing UI development no
matter what technology poly mirror
angular javax.swing whatever I just
enjoyed and canoe is
a good place for that because canoes
also am focused on providing superior
user interfaces with all kinds of
technologies now in this talk first I
want to give a short introduction into
the contender is just a very brief
overview of these languages and then I
will store the tournament I selected
five disciplines containable code
JavaScript pitfalls shortcuts tooling
and community and at the very end we're
going to declare a winner so let's start
with the continuous first one
coffeescript this one is proton the
oldest it it's been around for quite a
while and it's also the the one which is
less or it looks very different than
JavaScript there are lots of users here
are two for example dropbox users
coffeescript and get up users
coffeescript so there are large
companies are betting on CoffeeScript
and to understand what coffeescript is I
found this really interesting quote on
on the coffee sprig website so coffee
script is an attempt to expose the good
parts of JavaScript in a simple way you
really have to read it a couple of times
and you won't still wonder if this is
actually a joke or if this is serious
but um I think the author should
actually mean it when you look at
javascript there are many good parts you
have lots of power when you use it it's
very flexible it's is very small there
there are many good parts but there are
so many pitfalls and so many things you
can do wrong when you use javascript
it's really a pity and CoffeeScript
really tries to make the good parts
easily approachable while I'm trying to
hide away the bad parts here's an
example script i'm calculating
calculating the factorial of number so
we have a method this is how or how a
function is defined we have the
parameter list and this
and here's the function body there are
two parameters one is optional has a
default value so if it's not set it will
be set to one and then here we have an
if-else construct which calculates the
value based on em there are a number of
things you notice immediately if you
don't know coffeescript but but you know
JavaScript one thing is there are no
curly braces anywhere this is intended
CoffeeScript tries to implement a ruby
like syntax and also there no there's no
return statement here in this function
in CoffeeScript everything is an
expression or almost everything so
almost everything returns something and
it's not really needed to write in a
return statement up here this will
return whatever comes out of this if
else statement or expression actually in
this case and this is how we can call
this function which is pass in one
parameter here because the other one is
optional next contender is typescript
I'm types care type script has been
around for some time not as long as
coffeescript but also a couple of years
which is pretty long for the web
development world the most famous user
is probably the angular team but in
other users also on jetbrains according
to the typescript website so you can
also see here that there are large
companies using typescript it's a
serious language that you can consider
for your project arm to understand what
types grip is I found this interesting
code which really sums it up easily so
typescript is a type superset of
javascript that complies to plain
JavaScript there are two key words here
most important to most important typed
and superset so one thing is typescript
adds types to javascript that's one of
the main purposes of typescript and the
other one is
it's a super set so any kind of
JavaScript code can be compared with the
time or the typescript compiler any
JavaScript program that's correct is
also correct type script program which
has an interesting consequence it means
that everything everything that's added
to type script is actually optional so
if there are type definitions as we can
see in this example here and they are
actually optional because you can remove
then then it would be valid a jealous
fit program and it still compiles so
here we can see the same function with
typescript it looks almost like
JavaScript except we have types here for
the parameters every time or the return
type of this function but otherwise I
think it looks very familiar here's a
ternary expression which calculates the
value pretty much straightforward and
the last contenders egmore script egmore
script 2015 is extremely knew it was
just the specs were just finalized in
the summer this year and therefore there
are no users yet it's just too new I
mean there are people exploring it when
you look at new projects at github
they're often using acma script 2015 but
to my knowledge there's nobody no large
project no large company completely
betting on ECMO using ECMO script yet
but many are evaluating it and will
switch to it probably very soon yeah
there's another quote this is from the
Bible website they provide a compiler
for JavaScript 48 most web 2015 so it
takes akma script 2015 code and compiles
that to current JavaScript code so that
you can use it in your browser and it
says egg my script 2015 is a significant
update to the language and the first
major update to the language since xmas
group 5 were standardized in 2009
socially a long time since
the last version came out at some six
years now and you notice immediately
there are lots of changes not a lots of
new things coming in ECMO script 2015 um
here we have a program written in egmore
script 2015 you don't really see much
here because it is just it looks like
javascript there's just one change
compared to javascript 5 and that's the
default parameter here which has been
added to acma script but we'll see later
that akma script 2015 actually adds lots
of new features to javascript so this
was just a very rough and short overview
of the three languages and now let's go
into the details and check out how they
compete with each other the first the
first discipline is maintainable code if
you're working on a large project which
we want to maintain for 10 years or more
it's crucial that the code is
maintainable you need to be able to have
developers with very different skill
sets from junior developers to very
senior developers all the way up they
need to be able to work with the code
and don't mess with it too much it's
really important that the language
allows you to write good code one way or
one important feature of of language for
maintainable code is that you can split
your coat in different modules
javascript doesn't have this feature out
of the box when javascript was invented
way way back i mean we used it for doing
things like writing small animations
some nice effects for the website it was
really was just very small tiny script
and there was no need to maintain large
large code base it was never intended to
be used to write large applications as
we do today there are solutions
obviously because we needed solutions
common J's and AMD or two possibilities
how we can structure your code and
divide it into modules the problem with
this kind of approach is that it's not
really standard and if you use one
approach it doesn't really work with the
other one UMD is is an effort trying to
combine on these different approaches
how you can divide your code into
modules but it all already shows that
this is the wrong approach this should
be supported by the language and pretty
much all other languages do have this
kind of concept so let's take a look at
how these different languages deal with
it CoffeeScript doesn't support modules
there is no way how we can define
modules within the language they just
unforward you to the to the libraries we
just saw common jst AMD modules or you
midi modules typescript does support
modules so if you want to split your
code in different files let's say we
have a greeter ts1 file here and there
we can write export the function to make
it available to other modules and then
in another file we can import that
greeter and then use it so we have words
if needed it's actually not much we just
need to be able to define parts of the
code that need to be isolated from the
rest we need to be able to define a
clear interface which we can with the
eggs with the explorer keyword and we
need to be able to import these modules
into other modules and use them there so
typescript does support that egg my
script is very similar the syntax is
just slightly different here the import
statement works a little different in
egmore script 2015 but otherwise it
works the same way so we can check that
as well object orientation is another
important feature if you want to write a
large application you need to be able to
structure it in some way in some
meaningful way and it turns out at least
for now that object oriented the object
object oriented approach is the easiest
and most successful ones it works for
people with very different skill sets
and for large projects with large teams
object orientation is a key feature so
the language we want to choose needs to
support or a object orientation in order
so we can use it it doesn't mean that
everything we do need to be done in an
object-oriented way there are also use
cases and parts of the application we
need to write what we can use a
functional programming for example but
to structure the overall application
being able to do it in an
object-oriented way is definitely plus
so let's take a look at the different
languages starting with coffeescript
coffeescript allows us to write classes
so here we have a class frog it has a
method say hello which prints out quack
then we have a class Kermit which
inherits from frog so we have classes
and we have inheritance and we can
override this method because Kermit can
speak in CSG says hello we can create
new instances of this class and we can
call the method on say hello so first
sight on first sight it seems
CoffeeScript gives us what object
oriented or gives us object orientation
and we can use it but actually when we
look closer we notice that it's not real
object orientation the problem is that
coffeescript just builds on top of the
prototyping system of JavaScript
prototyping is a valid approach but it's
um it's people struggle with it so you
usually you usually want to use some
classes instead but this prototype
approach leaks through and what you can
do in your code at any point is you can
access the prototype of Kermit and then
you can change the method and when you
call Kermit say hello now he will me out
and not only that every new Kermit you
create will say meow and this can happen
at any place within your application not
just in the class definition so there
are classes but they are not really
strictly enforced so it's like half a
point maybe for object orientation in
CoffeeScript there is some but it's not
strictly enforced in a large project you
actually want to have as much help from
the compiler as possible okay let's take
a look at typescript typescript has
classes it has inheritance and you can
override method and it actually even has
more you can define interfaces there
generics available they are function
types so it's compared to the other one
to the other language is a very
sophisticated type system now I mean
it's really it depends on the the front
wall where you're looking at from other
languages looking at typescript the type
system is obviously a joke but when you
look from from the point of view of
javascript is actually very
sophisticated and you can do pretty much
anything you want and even more
importantly you cannot circumvent the
system there's no way you can change
this class at any point later it will
just not be allowed by the typescript
compiler so here we can say clearly yes
um typescript supports object
orientation now egmore script arm looks
almost the same we have the classes we
have the methods we have inheritance and
we can override methods the syntax is
the same so on first sight it looks good
again but again we can actually change
the prototype or we could access the
prototype and change methods later so
it's the same problem as CoffeeScript we
can use classes to simplify or creating
objects and instances but it's actually
not strictly enforced and you can mess
with it if you want anywhere within your
application so again it's a half point
for egmore script
and the large part has seen maintainable
code are compiled time checks there are
also very important for large projects
because the sooner you can find a bug
the better so if you can find a drink
compile time that's the best thing you
can happen to you because most IDEs are
actually able to show you compile errors
while you type if you find bugs in your
automated tests that's still okay it's
no obviously not as good as during
compile time but it's still good if your
bugs will will be found later in manual
tests or even entering production that's
obviously worse so you want to push your
bugs s to an early state as possible and
you want to check you compile time as
soon as possible when you do large
projects so let's see how the different
language is behavior type checking and
coffee script is not supported there are
no types in typescript obviously I mean
it's giving it's getting its name from
that we have types and they're enforced
but what I actually like a lot about it
is it's optional if you want you can use
this or you can specify the string type
for variable but you don't have to so
this is combining the best of both
worlds you have from you have types from
the like you have instead it statically
typed languages but you don't have to
specify them when it's obvious like you
doing dynamically a dynamically typed
languages and the compiler checks it so
if you try to do something like this
this will give a compile-time error and
you cannot use the wrong types within
your application if you specify them
ECMO script it doesn't have types it
just enhances JavaScript but it doesn't
add any types another very critical
features in lab application or constants
for some reason they are missing in
JavaScript and coffeescript doesn't
support them as well but typescript
actually does support constants in the
newer versions so I think starting with
typescript 1.5 the Const keyword is
supported and you can define two types
that you can define constants so that
this year will fail this will give you a
compile-time error and you will not be a
you you're not able to change the value
of a constant ECMO script the same thing
I mean it's this is coming from egmore
script to typescript actually you have
constants they are being checked during
compilation and enforced so we have
constants here enums isn't it another
important feature in larger applications
you use them almost in every application
I've worked with we needed I enums at
some point so um they're not supported
in JavaScript and they're also not
support in CoffeeScript typescript
actually does have enemies so we can
have define an enum language which has
three values CoffeeScript typescript in
egmore script and then we can define a
variable which is of type language and
design on one of the values of that
language so of that enum ECMO script
doesn't have any announced so let's wrap
up the first discipline maintainable
code on third place we have CoffeeScript
it's really it's very flexible syntax it
allows you to do many things but it
doesn't really help you to find your
bugs early on ECMO script is slightly
better it's not as flexible and it has
more features and more checks to ring
compile time but the clear
winners typescript that's really the
major strength of typescript it gives
you it allows you to write good
maintainable code so here we can see
though the overview typescript succeeded
in all disciplines atmos script missed
some it doesn't have real object
orientation and it's also missing what
some of the features coffeescript
clearly doesn't have a focus in this
area ok the next discipline or
javascript pitfalls javascript has many
um let's call them features thinks that
you get wrung easily especially when you
start with javascript you will always
fall prey orange everybody falls into
these pitfalls at some points and even
experienced developers even to them it
sometimes happens that they miss one of
these pitfalls and the language that's
supposed to help me and that's supposed
to be better than JavaScript should help
me to avoid these pitfalls so I think
the most critical one and the one that
probably everybody working with
JavaScript fell into is the meaning of
this what we're just this point to and
its really it really depends as it turns
out here we have a JavaScript program we
have a class pick which has a name a
method name and then we have this method
which prints out or it's supposed to
print out this name right it points to
this and prints out that name we create
an instance of that pic and when we call
it directly on the pic it really prints
out piggy so far no surprises but the
interesting thing is if we assign this
method to a functional and then we call
this function it prints out undefined
because what's happening now is that
this method method or this function has
an execution context if you call it like
this the execution context is actually
the objects
that where the method is in but if you
use it on a function the execution
context is different it's usually the
global scope and they're this under dot
underscore name is not defined so while
this kind of setup is very unlikely
people don't use it very often this one
is actually critical this happens all
the time in all kinds of application
I've seen if you use a method as an
event handler the method will be called
in a different execution context and
usually it's the execution context of
the window so what we would try to do up
here is we would call window dot
underscore name and that's only find and
that's probably one of the the most or
one of the issues I think that a lot of
people fall into all the time so let's
see how the different languages to
coffeescript when we define a class we
do it like this we define the method of
the field here and then we define the
method and if we use this operator here
to define the method then this method
gets bound to the object I mean we can
do that here as well that's actually the
solution to solve this we need to bind
this this method to to the to the
execution context but the code that is
required from that it's not really
obvious it's hard to read and you can
still forget it even if you know that
you have to do it so oops CoffeeScript
um gives us this very simple syntax and
with that show name is bound to that
object and one we call F down here or
when we use for method as an event
handler it will this will actually point
to the object so this is solved by
CoffeeScript typescript looks very
similar we define this class here
show name it becomes this method and
when we use this upper end here the lamp
the the lambda syntax it's gets bound to
the object and then we call F down here
it prints the right name and also if we
use it as an event handler it will print
the right name so typescript succeeds
here as well egmore script looks almost
the same and it also saw I'm solves the
issue so here we have the lambda syntax
and it helps us to avoid this kind of
problem we still have to remember to do
it but actually it's quite simple if you
use this expression every time when you
declare a class when you define a class
you're on the safe side and it will
never run into this issue again that
this certainly points to something else
than you expected another pitfall is
generating functions in loops let's look
at an example so here we have an array
we we run over loop count from 0 to 4
and what we create a function that
prints the the loop variable and then we
push that function on to the air in the
array and when we call a on the index 0
we would expect that this would print 0
because that was the the loop variable
when we created it but actually Prince 5
because I is not really fixed here and
as it moves on and it becomes 5 while we
run through the loops it will call this
will call the function with the eye
which is five now and again the solution
is quite simple we have to bind or we
have to create a closure around it which
makes sure that the values get fixed but
again you have to know it you have to
know the syntax and you have to remember
it so let's see on how the different
languages help with this coffeescript
actually has a solution when you use
this
instruct you can't do with the
parameters you want to fix and the
function around here then it will
generate this closure for you and if we
call a for the with index 0 it will
actually print 0 at this point and you
still have to remember it you still have
to do it but it's a lot easier than the
syntax you would have to use in plain
JavaScript typescript doesn't have a
solution acma script doesn't have a
solution as well another pitfall is the
equals equals operand if we compare zero
in quotes as a string with zero using
the equals equals operand this will
return true if we compare zero with the
empty string this will also return true
but if we compare zero in quotes as a
string with the empty string obviously
this is not equal and return false and
this is actually quite shocking when you
think about it it's really it means that
the equals equals our print is not
transitive which is one of the basic
principles of an equals operation
mathematics wouldn't work with our
transit rancidity trans to whatever at
this point so and there is a simple
solution never use equals equals always
use equals equals equals the difference
is this one does type conversion under
the hood so if you compare different
types there's some type conversion going
on and if you really want to understand
what's going on here you have to
understand type conversion from
JavaScript and you don't really want to
do that so what you should do is use
equals equals equals or to check for
unequals it's the the ! equals equals
because this one will not do the type
conversion so if you compare zero as a
string with 0 is a number this will be
false if you compare 0 with an empty
string it will be false and this one
down here is
as well so now we have real working
mathematics quite simple no problem
actually but people tend to forget
especially if you work with different
languages so for example your java is
written in your service written in java
and you have to implement some stuff
there then you switch to javascript and
you implement some stuff there people
forget all the time not to use equals
equals because it's just so common
you're just used to it so it would be
nice if there's some help with this
coffeescript does have a solution here
in CoffeeScript if you use equals equals
it will be translated to the to the
equals equals equals and equals equals
equals doesn't even exist in
CoffeeScript so you can even mix these
two things up you always use what you're
used to from other languages in
CoffeeScript will make sure that this is
working correctly in JavaScript
typescript no solution nagma script
again also no solution another problem
that you often have with javascript is
checking for the for the existence of an
object especially people usually doing a
lot of Java when they want to check if
value set they just do this up here but
this is actually incorrect because X
could also be undefined and the right
way to check if X is defined in any way
is this long expression down here right
you have to do type f of X you have to
compare that to a string and hopefully
you don't misspell anything here and
then you can also to the null check so
this is actually what's needed all the
time when you want to check if a value
is set again this is hard you get it
wrong easily and you tend to forget
easily so let's see if these languages
have a solution for that and actually
they do a link at least CoffeeScript
there is the Elvis operator here if you
do at if ax ? it is translated to
exactly the strating that we were
looking at before
you can just write this and CoffeeScript
make sure that the the existence is
checked correctly typescript an ECMO
script don't have any solution here and
to wrap it up we have arm two languages
on second place actually and
coffeescript here is the clear winner
and when you think about it is actually
quite obvious because types group in
egmore script don't really want to
improve or it's not their mission to
improve the language and help you to
avoid pitfalls if it just fits into the
concepts they provide such a such a
helper but it's not the explicit stated
goal unlike coffeescript where the
authors really try to improve your
experience using javascript okay the
next point or shortcuts so far we just
looked at how you can write a
maintainable code how you can write
better more correct code but another
discipline you're always interested in
when you want to evaluate the languages
how efficient are you well how much can
the language help you to write to get to
your goal faster at this point I'm not
going to compare these languages feature
by feature that much anymore only where
it makes sense but I'll just present you
different features these languages have
how they can help you writing better
code in in a shorter way so one thing we
already saw it in the very beginning is
default parameters that makes it a lot
easier than what you usually do in
javascript usually you would have to
check if names undefined here and then
you would set it this makes it way
easier to deal with them default
parameters default parameters are also
supported by ECMO scripting typescript
and the syntax it's very much the same
because here this was introduced into
egg mascara
am bored kids is migrated into
typescript over time like many other
features so we've seen it in the
beginning we have the default parameter
if name is in set we'll set it to the
two devoxx if it is set like here we
would say hello world at this point the
rest operant very often in JavaScript
you want to deal with functions where
the the number of arguments isn't really
clearly defined you can do that in
JavaScript there's the arguments
property within a function that he can
use to extract what you want but it's
really kind of cumbersome and an error
prone to use it so what coffeescript
introduced is the rest operant and if
you do that then these uh parameters
that are passed in here are passed to
you as a field and then you can for
example loop over that calculate the
square of all the interest of all the
entries and return an array of the of
the square so it makes your code a lot
easier to read and simpler egg my script
and typescript also support them the
main difference is that the dots are
behind cover behind the parameter name
in CoffeeScript and there in front of it
for egmore scripting typescript those
this is actually doing the same thing as
the CoffeeScript code before it creates
an array loops over all the operands and
for each one of them it calculates the
square and pushes that to the to the
array in returns that array spread is
another interesting feature this is
pretty much the opposite now we have a
function here with a fixed number of
parameters but actually in our
application code will want to call this
this method we have an array so what we
can do we can call the we can use the
spread or brand and this will spread the
array and
for it or call the function with the
different parameters again you can do
this certainly in JavaScript as well but
it's a lot more cumbersome and a lot
more error-prone egmore script also
supports the spread of rent at this
point and again the main difference is
actually that they are before the the
era here why for coffeescript they are
after the parameter typescript doesn't
support this feature yet but they plan
to template strings also an interesting
feature very useful if you have a string
and you want to you want to calculate it
dynamically you can do something like
this in CoffeeScript you have to use
double quotes and then you can use this
this hashtag with the curly braces and
you can pass in a variable name you can
calculate an expression and this will
calculate the string so at this point it
will print hello dialogues egg my script
and typescript have it as well the
syntax is slightly different you have to
use back takes here and then you have to
use the dollar sign at this point but
otherwise it works exactly the same way
and you really get the impression when
you look at this that a lot of ECMO
script was inspired by the change is
done in CoffeeScript destructuring
assignments um that's a really awesome
feature and it helps you to avoid to
write lots of code what this does is if
we have a function for example that
returns an array we can use this kind of
syntax and then the values of the array
get assigned to the to the different
variables here so at this point we call
get names this returns an area with snow
and jon snow will be or that last name
will be set to snow and first name will
be set to John
the same also works for objects so here
we return an object which has three
properties title last name and first
name and here we define which properties
we actually want to set and there's a
match between the property name and the
and the variable name down here and then
again last name will be snow first and
we'll be done when we call this and what
makes literally very interesting is that
you can mix those two ways to call to
define destructuring assignments and you
can dive very deep into the object
hierarchy it's actually something like
like a query language on object
hierarchies you can if this is another
object somewhere down here you can
specify it and say I want actually this
particular property three three levels
down in this object hierarchy and I want
to have it assigned to this particular
value so it makes it very easy to
extract a number of variables from a
complex object tree it's also available
in egmore script and typescript the
syntax is slightly different it's it's
um it's the same except that we have to
use the VAR keyword up here which we
usually don't know what we never use in
CoffeeScript actually because in
CoffeeScript it's added automatically
same goes for the objects syntax is
almost the same except for the VAR
keyword up here down here and we also
have a destructuring assignment and
again we can also use it in a nested
structure to dive really deep into this
object hierarchy loop comprehension
that's an interesting feature that only
CoffeeScript supports if we have a loop
or if we run over a loop and we
calculate a value then cube cubic will
be a new array which has all the
different values here so here we run
from zero to three calculate the cubic
value from that and
cubic will have these in an array it's
also a good feature that helps you to
write in often use functionality in a
short amount of code same comparison
that's another feature that's only
available in CoffeeScript if you want to
test variable again and a lower and an
upper bound you can do it like this in
CoffeeScript you right if min smaller
than x which is smaller than and smaller
man max then alert it fits you also have
a lot more of variations on Elvin the
pelvis operator so for example this one
sets x to default if X isn't set yet so
it checks if X is undefined or null it
will be set to default otherwise it will
keep its current value this one will
check if Y is set if it is X will be set
to the value of y otherwise we'll set
the default values both our futures that
you use very often and makes it really
convenient and to write it like this
street allows you or I mean this ? dot
operand allows you to dive into your
object hierarchy and and check for null
in between usually you would have to
check if person is now if address if
null and then you go step further you
can go to the street and it's really it
makes very ugly code because you have to
check each step very often and this
operand does that for you if adverse is
set Street will be set to Street
otherwise it will be null notify is very
similar it checks if nota five-set if it
said we'll call it if it's not set it
will just ignore this on this call every
slicing another interesting feature so
if we have an array we can slice it
easily with this kind of approach it's
kind of bad in my opinion that there's
just that there are three dots to do an
exclusive upper bound and
for an inclusive upper bound but that's
the way it it is it causes some pain
sometimes but in projects you should
usually just define which of these two
you want to use and then you should just
stick to this one airy splicing also an
interesting feature to change arrays
very quickly with a small amount of code
you can set the indexes of an array and
set the value so if you have numbers
which is an area from 0 to 4 and you
call this then you will replace these
three empty entries with the minus 1 all
of these features I showed at the at the
end are not available in egmore script
2015 now we come to one feature which is
just available in egmore script and
partially in typescript and these are
the enhanced object literals with the
new object literals you can actually set
the prototype that's a new feature in
egmore script and very useful this is a
shortcut if you want to set handler to
in variable which is handler you can
just write that here's another shortcut
if you want to define a method in an
object literal you can use it like this
and now you actually have this super
keyword available because you're able to
define the prototype you can also
reference it here already and down here
you can see how that you can even define
dynamic properties so the property names
are calculated on the fly while this
object literal is supported this is
fully supported a prescrip 2015 and is
partially compa supported in typescript
so to wrap it up typescript comes in
last here it's it's daunting the changes
ECMO script brought about but it's
running behind so it's on third place
egmore script comes in second and
CoffeeScript actually has the most
features to make it to make you more
efficient writing your code okay next is
the plane or tools pro you one of the
most important disciplines because
language can be nice and elegant and
whatnot but doesn't really matter if you
don't have to support at least in large
projects so let's take a look at that IT
support is great for three languages I'm
using IntelliJ it supports our languages
out of the box other IDEs either support
these languages or they're working on a
solution and they will support them very
soon build tools I'm just looking at
gulp and grunted at this point there are
plugins for all languages and you can
use them right away starting today with
that for egmore script actually by the
way I usually use bubble which is
probably the most famous and most use
one to compile ECMO script into current
JavaScript code but there are plugins
for that available as well for gulp and
for grunt debugging works great you just
have to remember to call to create map
files while you do the compilation and
if they are available in the browser you
can debug your source code so you can
really step through your coffee script
code through your typescript code or
through your egg my script code and see
the changes there you can set
breakpoints you see the variable on the
the the content of the variables that
are being used at this point and ever
that all of that works for three
languages testing also works for three
languages out of the box I usually use
smoker and chai for the assertions and
the sign on or sinan framework not sure
how it's actually pronounced for mocking
and that works with all three languages
right away so we have very interesting
result here all languages come in first
because all of them or tools support for
all three languages is just excellent
community that's another important thing
to consider because if you run into an
issue you
to and you need some help you want to be
able to find people who know the
language and who can help you with the
problem so community port support is
something that you should consider when
you look at language so here are the
google trends for at this point i used
the name of the language plus the
keyword tutorial to get an idea how many
people are actually interested in a
certain language and try to learn that
language because if you just look for
the language it could mean all all kinds
of things and the google trends aren't
really expressing anything but if you
use the language with the keyword
tutorial together you get a good idea of
how people are using we're learning the
language what we can see is coffeescript
came in first it has a very good
adoption here typescript came later at
first it didn't have the adoption but
here all of a sudden it just skyrocketed
the the the interest and what's actually
happening here is this is the point when
the angular team announced that they are
using typescript to implement angular 2
that's when a typescript actually became
more exciting for developers than
CoffeeScript until then it was really I
mean that was it was gaining traction
but it wasn't much and this was the
decision point here I searched for
JavaScript six and the keyword tutorial
because if you use ECMO script 2015
other any other combination you don't
really get any good results we can see I
mean there's some interest but it just
started I mean the specs were were
finalized this summer so interest is
just starting for this language Stack
Overflow also an interesting website to
take a look at these are the number of
questions that are tacked with the div
with a specific language so we have
almost 9,000 questions which are tagged
with CoffeeScript we have somewhere
between five and six thousand questions
for
for typescript and we just have 1500 or
something for questions which are
stacked with akma script 2015 obviously
you can see that coffeescript has been
around the longest so they are the most
questions being asked answered egmore
script just became popular now so it's
um it's no wonder that the distribution
looks like this at this point and then
the last statistics for getting an
impression of what the community is like
for these different languages is some
get hat get hat gives you statistics
about usages or how languages are used
on github so this is the number of
repositories that are in github using
coffeescript and the number of
repositories using typescript at the end
of 2014 I have to I have to say there is
no differentiation between different
JavaScript version and that's why I acma
script 2015 is missing you as we can see
there are a lot of repositories or using
coffeescript but actually what's
probably more important is how does this
change over time and here we have this
two tix statistics for that
unfortunately again it's just until the
end of 2014 so it's missing this huge
spike when am the angular team announced
that they are betting on typescript but
what we can see is that both actually
we're actually CoffeeScript has had a
very steady state of adoption this is a
logarithmic scale so it's actually
looking very nice here typescript wasn't
actually doing so well it's here it's
actually even going down it will be very
interesting to see the numbers with
changes for this year at the end of this
year's when when people became so
excited about typescript and maybe even
started new projects using typescript so
when we look at the community adoption
we
have ECMO script coming in last it's
just a new language so there is not much
of a community yet typescript comes in
second CoffeeScript comes in first but
actually we have to take a look at it
and see how it evolves over time so
let's see the results counting
everything together we have xmas Krypton
third place typescript on second place
coffeescript coming in on first place
which means for all your arm oh now the
animation starts again follow your
projects you should use coffee script
now that's certainly not the right
approach that's overly overly simplified
especially when we look at the numbers
all three languages were very close to
each other until the very end when we
looked at the community support that's
actually were coffeescript created this
gap and cutting in front of everybody
else but as we know this especially the
community support this can change very
quickly so one has to keep that in mind
when looking at the numbers and
therefore I try to create a kind of
decision flow chart which you can see
here for selecting language the first
question you should ask yourself in my
opinion is do you want to do rapid
prototyping which really means to build
something fast and you throw it away at
the end so you have an idea for a new
business you want to develop something
over the weekend or within very few
weeks and you need to get the results
quickly in that case CoffeeScript is
your best choice there's a huge
community supporting it we have
questions you will get answers there's
lots of help avoiding you doing the
typical mistakes you would do with with
JavaScript and it also has lots of nice
little features to make you a more
efficient well it's actually not that
simple you certainly have to value do
you like the syntax it is very different
than coffee than JavaScript or Java or
other languages like this and if you say
come the CoffeeScript syntax it's
okayish then you should use coffee
script
my opinion but if you just hate it don't
bother with it the next question you
should ask is what's more important for
you type safety or the new features
coming with akma script 2015 there are a
bunch of features that are just
development in ECMO script 2015 that are
not supported in typescript yet and
depending on that choice you should
either use egg my script 2015 or
typescript but actually which one you
choose doesn't matter that much in my
opinion because it is a clear stated
goal of typescript to integrate all the
features that are new in ECMO script
2015 so at some point we're going to
have something like typescript 2015
which means we have all the nice
features of typescript which we need to
build large maintainable applications
like type system a real object or intent
oriented implementation which is
strictly enforced by the compiler we
have all these features plus we have the
new features of ECMO script 2015 so I
think in the end where you should
actually go to is this typescript 2015
and which migration path you actually
choose doesn't matter that much you can
start using the new features if you
prefer right acma script code and then
once the typescript compiler supports
all the features you're using you can
just take your ahmed script code and run
the typescript compiler on that because
as mentioned in the beginning typescript
is a superset of javascript and it will
also be a superset of ECMO script 2015
so you can just take your Atma script
2015 sources and run them to the
typescript compiler and start to
integrate new features from typescript
or you go the other way you start using
typescript right now because you think
types are more important you want to
focus on that and over time more and
more features will be added with each
version of typescript and then you will
have the same features available as well
once we're done
so that was my conclusion it really
surprised me because I didn't like
typescript very much before and I
haven't really used it before I have
done lots of coffee script things I
liked egmore script 2015 I never really
liked typescript but actually the
conclusion for me with that this is the
way to go for the future thank you very
much for your attention so we have three
minutes for questions does anybody have
a question otherwise I'll check the
website okay
um sorry no it is so the question was if
angular 2 will just support typescript
also other languages that is the
decision to minus thing was that they
just use typescript to implement angular
2 but you can still use any kind of
language that you would use in web
development to use angular 2 later any
other question there are no questions
online okay thanks again for your
attention I'll be around so if you have
any questions later just stop by and ask
me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
