coming my name is Patrick Karen I am the
chairperson of the java community
process organization and excuse me i
will talk briefly about how you can get
involved and help java to evolve I do
have a longer Boff session this evening
so if you want to ask questions or learn
more please come to that I forget the
time but you can look it up anyway
welcome thank you for coming this is
juggy the mascot for Java user groups
created by Bruno Sosa from Brazil um
where does java come from doesn't come
like this hand it down from on high like
Moses going up the mountain and coming
down with with the answer that's not the
way it works this isn't windows with
windows basically what you get is what
you get wysiwyg Microsoft decides and if
you're a very big customer they may
consult you but basically what you get
is what they decide you will get hence
the disaster that was Windows 8 Java has
not done that way Java has developed by
everybody so what you get is what we all
create collectively we develop standards
for Java through the java community
process organization standard is
basically a particular specification for
a piece of java technology we have a
formal process for developing these
standards i won't go into details here
you can look it up online if you go to
JCP org you will find a link to the
process document which defines the
formal process of proposal review voting
and so on and so on and the
specification is published at several
stages and there are formal votes by the
executive committee of the JCP and
eventually the other end after
collective work by a number of people we
end up with a standard for a for a new
or revised Java technology so I'm not
going to talk more about how the process
works I'm going to talk about how you
can get involved
so first of all let's talk about the way
it works we have what I call our
Constitution it's a document well there
are two documents actually that define
how we do our work let's talk we'll talk
for a moment about how we change those
documents because we've made a series of
changes over the past few years to make
it easier for people to participate we
use the process itself to to change the
way we operate we figured okay we have
documents that define how the
organization is structured there are two
of them the first is called the JSP a
Java specification participation
agreement this is the legal contract
that you sign when you when you join the
organization the second one is a process
document that I just talked about and in
order to change the way the JCP works we
have to change one or both of these
documents since we have a process for
creating and revising documents that's
the process itself we use that same
process to change the documents that
define how we operate so as I say we
file a JSR basically to say we're going
to revise one or other of these
documents and this JSL goes through the
same process as a JSR for any technical
specification over the past few years as
I said we've created a we've launched a
series of j SRS for all together which
collectively we call JCP next meaning
their way to define the next version of
the way the JCP functions and I'll talk
briefly about those that we've been
working on and those that we are still
working on the first one was simple this
is how people used to think that the
expert groups which are the groups
within the JCP that devised the
specifications this is how people used
to think they operated a bunch of guys
in a closed room working in secret there
was some truth to that certainly some
expert groups did operate in a rather
secluded manner we said no more of that
we want you to do all your work out in
the open
we want you to publish all your
materials we want you to have a public
issue tracker so that people can see the
things that you're concerned with the
people can actually comment on them you
must respond to comments that you get
from the public and so on we do this
back in 2011 it was very
non-controversial everybody said yeah
obviously things should be done out in
the open and completed very quickly and
the result was a significant increase in
interest on the part of regular
developers to participate in and to
watch in to help with what was going on
and in particular we got a large number
of Java user groups began to get
involved and they created a program we
call adopt adopt to jsr which I'll talk
about in a moment the second of these
jss was very simple we used to have two
executive committee's one for Java ME
one for java SE and heath combined we
smashed them together into one don't
need to say anymore about that that was
an even simpler one the third one JCP
next three years we got a tour jsr
number 358 is big and complicated and
scary and the reason for that is that we
are going to be modifying the jsb a
which is that legal document that i
talked about hasn't been significantly
modified in more than 10 years it times
are different now from when this was
first created so clearly we understand
we need to change it but it's kind of
like legacy code you've got to be really
careful with legal documents you often
don't understand exactly why certain
words of terms were used and if you're
not careful you're going to break it so
we have to be very careful plus it is a
legal document so all the lawyers for
all the executive committee members of
the JCP are also involved and of course
it takes forever it is important because
this is the document that defines the
way intellectual property rights are
granted and how things are licensed and
so on I would say more about that other
than to say we are continuing to work on
this but in the process of working on
this we realized it was going to take a
long time there were certain other
things we were working on the we thought
were important and we wanted to get them
complete it more quickly so we spun off
yet another GSR 364 and this one focuses
on membership and basically changes in
the membership classes to make it easier
for individuals such as yourselves to
participate so basically the goal is to
encourage more individuals to
participate while still making sure that
we have all the appropriate IP
commitments we're going to create a new
membership class we call associate
members membership you'll be able to
sign this membership agreement by
yourself at the moment if you want to be
a full member the JCP you have to get
your employer's permission which can be
difficult and in particular there's one
benefit that will come with this
associate member class you will be able
to get formal if you're participating
and helping with a particular jsr you
would be able to get formal recognition
as a contributor to that jsr today the
only way to get that kind of recognition
is to be a full member of the expert
group which takes a significant time
commitment and does require significant
expertise we now have an easier way for
people to make smaller contributions and
to get formal recognition for them and
obviously if you're going out it's going
to be good for your career if you're
going out looking for a job you have two
candidates both of them say I know this
technology but one of them says noting
not only do I know it but I hope to
create it there's my name up on the web
page on JCP org obviously that's going
to help you get the job so we're doing
all this stuff out in the open you'll be
able to follow us if you go to java.net
we're trying to make sure that the JCP
really is a community driven
organization trying to reduce barriers
to entry so that everybody can
participate so we're encouraging
everybody to get involved as an
individual we want you to do this not
just because it is a good thing to do
but actually because it will be good for
you we used to encourage people to
enjoin as individuals and we discovered
that when they did they got kind of lost
I didn't know okay now i'm a member now
what do i do i can't be an expert on an
expert group we realized eventually that
joining through java user groups is the
way to go the collectively a Java user
group can't
side to help to take part in a
particular jsr and this way you have
someone to hold you hand someone to
learn from and so on we have a
significant number of Java user groups
who are active participants we have all
of these guys are user groups that are
members of the JCP it's easy to join the
JCP there no fees associated with it we
have to Java user groups or on the
executive committee so Java from Brazil
and the London java community and both
of them have made significant
contributions to the work of the JCP
primarily by creating this program adopt
a GSR which is a simple way for Java
user groups to say we're interested in a
particular technology let's see what we
can do to help there are number reasons
why this is a good idea I don't need to
go into them here because I think we all
recognize that things that are driven
and and we're developers contributi much
more likely to get something that is
useful and useful in the real world and
something that was designed by a bunch
of people from big corporations in back
room somewhere it's good for the user
group itself it brings your publicity
but from your own personal point of view
it's good for your career you build your
network you not only advance your
technical skills but more importantly
you build a whole bunch of what I call
soft skills verbal written
communications negotiation collaboration
teamwork and so on all of these things
are skills which distinguish a good
engineer from a really skillful
successful engineer who was likely to be
promoted and so on so you know doing
this work is good for you we've a large
number of user groups have already
participated from all over the world
South America and North America Europe
Asia Africa Middle East they've created
a number of things including the Belgium
jug here did some work for java ee 7 so
there's several examples here of the
kind of things that people are doing
there can be building test cases that
can be building test applications they
can be helping to debug the
implementation as its developed and so
on we had a total of eighteen user
groups participate in
java ee 7 from all over the world as I
said here are some of their logos and
there are a number of things that you
can do you start by joining oops joining
the JCP as a user group there are ways
that you can talk directly to the spec
lead you can ask them what help they
need and you can do anything from
something simple like commenting on a
mailing list or doing lightning talks or
helping with documentation down to more
complicated and technical things
organizing hack days helping with
triaging issues giving feedback on the
design writing test application was to
verify that the API is a well-designed
even build the conformance test we'd so
number of ways to participate from the
very simple not so technical to quite
technical so you don't have to be a
super expert in a particular technology
to do something useful if you just read
the spec and give some feedback and if
you don't understand it that's not your
fault it's the fault of the guys who
wrote it because they're writing these
ap is and the specifications for people
like you and if they're not
understandable by people like you
they've done something wrong they want
to know that and you can tell them we
have a number of jsr s that are working
their way through the process at the
moment that you could get involved with
here are some examples and just some
screenshots here showing we have a home
page for the top to jsr on java.net
there is a page for java ee where you
can see what is ours are available and
what help people are looking for there
is a matrix where you can kind of enter
some data about what you're working on
this is a sample jsr page on JCP org and
people do share resources test cases
applications and so on on github so
there's quite a lively community out
there already and they're looking for
you to join them you can also if you're
interested participating the actual
implementation as opposed to the design
of the the platforms of the technologies
by working through openjdk which is an
open source project that develops the
implementation of java SE or by project
glassfish which develops the
implementation of java
so large number of ways you can get
involved I'm almost out of time here so
the overall message is Java has been
around now 20 years as you know this is
the 20th anniversary I don't know if
it's going to last to the 25th century
but was certain last for a long time and
what Java is going to look like in the
future is going to be determined
hopefully by you guys because it's you
who are going to help everybody else who
is in the java community to develop java
and to move it forward so that's it from
me I'll be talking again and more
informally at above this evening so you
have questions or feedback or whatever
or just want to learn more please come
along then thank you that's it for me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
