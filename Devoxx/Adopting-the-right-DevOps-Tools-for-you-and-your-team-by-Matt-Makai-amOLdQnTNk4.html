a developer evangelist at schoolio much
means that work on open source projects
and travel and speaking tech conferences
that sort of thing i'm based out of the
bay area and i also write a site called
full stack python which is read by about
a hundred thousand developers every
month so they can build deploy and
operate there python applications and
i've been working on that for about five
years it's an open source project on
github in case you're ever interested in
not only doing building python
applications but also python devops
tools like ansible things like that of
audit orioles on that you know assuming
my clicker actually works here so i
primarily program in python and in swift
so i don't have a ton of more recent
java experience so this talk is going to
be a little bit higher level on the
devops I'd I do about fifteen percent of
my time fifteen to twenty five percent
of my time in Java but I mostly work in
like micro frameworks like spark as
opposed to you know really heavy with
heavy frameworks like I used to like
struts and quit so I spend most of my
time building Python applications but
also building and and then releasing
mobile applications and the reason why I
bring this up is because the way that
you do that in those two ecosystems is
completely different so even from waking
up in the morning and being like oh I
got to write some Python code like I'm
firing up them on linux versus writing
some swift code either in a playground
and xcode or actually just firing up the
xcode editor itself and then of course
the release process for a mobile
application is very different from
deploying a web application so part of
this is the way even that I do like
throw the DevOps the the built that
deploying any operation even just in
these two ecosystems is very different
and while i would say that in the java
ecosystem it's probably mostly like
python and we can draw the parallels
between all the concepts you're still
going to have a lot of differences in
sort of the way that you're operating
your your projects at scale now i bring
up java partially because I used to just
do java development so this was like
fairly old school
back in the day this was like my first
job out of school I was doing just pure
Java development and I've been doing
Java through high school and then in
college and so I got my first Java gig
professionally and this to me like was
like my Dark Ages and this was in 2004
so I say like to me that it was like the
dark ages and for some people they're
going to be like that's really offensive
like the Dark Ages were like the 80s or
they were the 60s or something like that
or some you know Millennials are going
to be like dude you're really old like
you've been programming for a long time
this is my personal Dark Ages where I
basically knew nothing like I was coming
out of computer science and I was like
what is even out there and i discovered
the first tool that I think kind of
brings some people along on this DevOps
journey their own personal journey of
whether they really care about just kind
of building the application or whether
they care about the entire life cycle of
the application not that one is
necessarily better than another but just
do you really care about building the
features and constantly building and
releasing new features or do you care
about kind of like the deployment the
operations side as well as building the
features and then you kind of
specialized in your own career as to how
you want to do that so the tool that I
discovered which many of us kind of just
take for granted now but i thought was
mind-blowing at the time was source
control also known as version control
and of course we didn't have like
amazing gorgeous web application user
interfaces back then i was working with
ibm's rational clearcase which still
kind of i don't know i have bad feelings
about that one but now we get tools like
it which are like spectacular along with
the diff views that they give us and
just kind of the way that we can develop
our applications and not have to always
sync with the centralized repository we
can actually just go off to do our own
development and merge later so source
control is kind of like that
foundational technology which I think
often gets taken for granted like 10
years ago source control actually wasn't
all that common because a lot of the
open-source sort and free versions were
not that good i mean had sort of svn CVS
but we've gotten a lot better so what i
always like to say is like pat yourself
on the back if you were using source
control because it actually is like this
foundational
technology that kind of like allows you
to do all of the automation on top of it
and people often forget this like I
often talk to many college students and
like yeah sure they like kind of
understand like what get is but they're
not really like they're not really
thinking about it as like the building
block on which you build other things on
top of it so if you don't have your
source code in version control like how
are you going to use continuous
integration and either compile your
application if you're using a compiled
language or run your automated tests or
test that your application dependencies
or actually installing properly and that
you peg to the correct versions how are
you going to then figure out how to
automate your deployment and manage the
state of your servers like all of these
things kind of build on top of just
having some sort of source control
repository to work from and then of
course we talk about something like
monitoring logging measuring so that is
sort of the foundational layer for doing
everything else that oftentimes just
gets lost among all the tools that we
talked about at conferences that are all
you know nice nice tools to use but
there's also that foundational layer
that we need to know about so I've got
10 questions here and these 10 questions
the first one of them is do you know a
developer who strongly recommends a tool
after insert generic number of years
here but after a significant period of
time that they really can tell you you
can say like do you recommend this tool
and then they like tell you about how
great it is and then you're like no no
no like tell me what's really bad about
it and then they tell you all these like
you know oh it doesn't do all these
things but they're still really love
using this tool and so what I've done
here is I've created these ten questions
that are kind of a little bit
introspective into our own environments
for how do we going back to the title
how do we adopt tools and our own
organization for our own personal use or
in organizations and so if you know a
developer who's been using something for
a long time and I'll give one example
here and I'll give a few others but for
me that's good like I used all the
version control systems or a lot of the
version control systems out there I love
using it awesome that that provides like
that foundational layer for me if
there's something better in the future
cool I will totally use that
but for me as far as a version control
implementation like this is fantastic so
all the times with gets lost especially
at conferences when I'm talking to
people people come and they're like hey
I really want to learn about X tool
right but this is also like a step and I
think a lot of people's evolution where
you have to ask yourself do you know
what the difference is between concepts
and an implementation so this is a shift
that has happened over the past maybe
10-15 years that I think a lot of
developers don't talk about which is
there are companies large companies that
hype up and get really excited and I I
work for like I've really I mean I'm
subjective but I objectively really
enjoy using the toilet API but there are
large companies that are billion-plus
dollar companies that hype up their own
tools and people will go to conferences
and they'll talk about like hey I want
to really use docker right like oh man
doctor is amazing look I want to learn
about docker without at like at all
understanding like there is a conceptual
idea that doctor is implementing doctor
is one of many philosophies behind
implementing a conceptual idea which is
known as paint containers and this
happens to be the logo for lxc which is
containers on top of Linux but like if
you don't separate the hype for a tool
like doctors like that a billion-dollar
valuation all that stuff they've got
great marketing people they've got a lot
of great developers as well and I go to
their meetups well like if you don't
separate the fact that like doctor is
just one tool one philosophy and
implementation of how you use container
service like then you're never going to
be able to understand how to
appropriately fit in a conceptual idea
into your own team and your own
environment you have to understand the
concept before you worry about what
tools you're going to be adopting so as
you go to other talks throughout the
next couple days think about like okay
yeah sure they're talking about like
spring MVC that's pretty cool or spring
boots something like that what is it
really implementing and the reason why I
think this is like just really important
is like this this forms a lot of the
foundation for when I write full sack
Python there are many tools in the
Python ecosystem that are out there so
just take a look at this under web
development people will often just like
especially coming out of coding boot
camps they'll be like oh I use Django
and you're like cool like why do you use
Django and they're like well you know
it's short it was kind of like the best
tool but like Django is one
implementation of the web frameworks
concepts and we can translate this into
the Java world as well like i really
liked using spark because it reminds me
of flask and it's a nice micro framework
for building really simple java web
applications and quit is really good as
well and you know you can kind of like
go through the laundry list of all these
different tools but if you don't
understand what a web framework is and
the fundamental foundation behind web
development like you're kind of just
getting lost among the hype among the
tools you're not really like picking out
the right maybe you're not picking out
the right tools for your own job you're
just going along with what other people
are saying is like the best thing to use
and that's like I think someone else
coin the phrase hype driven development
that's where a lot of software comes now
like it's not thinking about like the
ideas and how you put them together it's
just like well what company is like
really excited about a certain tool that
they are promoting so let's go to the
next question about sort of adopting
tools in your own environment so how
many people like just kind of knowing
and this is like a little bit more
geared towards like tech leads senior
developers but like how many people get
really stoked about making incremental
fixes to your technical environment so
there's like sort of you can kind of
tell a little bit about the state of
your team based off of people that are
like you know you're working with a
bunch of a bunch of tools and you've got
sort of things that you're working on
and you're making small improvements
every single day versus like and so you
can kind of lets you have 10 people on
the team 10 developers and like eight
people are like really excited about all
the change that you've made like every
week we're making progress every sprint
we're making like some fixes and then
that you've got like a couple people
that are like we gotta like just throw
everything out and rewrite it and some
people are just more geared towards one
or the other but if everyone on your
team is like we need to just throw like
throw everything out and start over like
that's going to tell you a little bit
about whether like how like what you're
like doing on your like how your team is
doing overall like the probably the best
situation is everyone is excited about
making small incremental improvements to
your environment and then you celebrate
those small wins
um another question is and then so they
kind of align with it ask yourself like
are you working with software people or
process people now this often comes in
very large organizations like I've
worked for like some very large
financial institutions and the answer to
like every problem that came up like if
we had a failed build failed deployment
with the hotfix something we had to you
know we had a bug in production was like
whoa whoa whoa whoa there's too much
change we need to change Control Board
like we need to like understand the
change like manual controls those are
not software people you have to kind of
understand in your own organization how
many software people there are versus
how many manual process people there are
and it's going to vary by industry but
the software people are going to be like
something got messed up can we write a
unit test to make sure that we can check
and make sure it doesn't happen again
can we put monitoring in place can we
put a software automated solution in
place to make sure that this doesn't
happen and this is going to helpfully
impact your ability to adopt any sort of
tools when you're building deploying and
operating web applications because if
you're dealing with a whole bunch of
process people you're going to spend and
this sucks as a developer a lot of
political capital which we don't really
talk about but like you have to have the
political capital in order to adopt
those tools and your organization and my
personal recommendation is developers
especially with the economy being very
good if you if you get frustrated in
those environments like I got
frustrating those environments you
should probably leave you should
probably just go fly because there are
so many companies there they're filled
with software people and that don't put
all the roadblocks in the processes in
place and chances are when I like to
give this talk what I like to do is when
I give a talk I like to have about half
the people in the room you like really
pissed off and what I just said and
hopefully they can kind of think about
it and be like no you're wrong because
of all these reasons but by and large
like this is just stuff that I've seen
over time as a developer and so like the
reason why I bring it up is because this
is a lot of like what we don't really
talk about we don't really talk about
political capital we don't talk about
software people and process people and
why that's really bad like I just like
to bring it up and if you're like really
uncomfortable right now that's a great
thing I'm sorry that I made you
uncomfortable but like
you should really think about why your
organization is the way that it is
because it really does impact your
ability to deliver quality software so
we went back to source control let's
talk a little bit more about what we
build on top of source control that
allows us to deliver quality software um
a lot of this comes around like you've
got your source control in some sort of
you know way that you can interact with
it programmatically so let's say get for
example as the tool and the conceptual
ideas like source control and so now you
put these other conceptual ideas in
place like continuous integration
automated testing and handling of your
application dependencies to make sure
that like things are not breaking over
time so these are some you know
implementations there are many hosted
solutions out there I personally not
really a huge fan of hosted continuous
integration but maybe it's just because
that's not like something that I've
really worked with the time in the
Python ecosystem some people like swear
by some of the tools that are out there
I certainly have used Travis for open
source projects because it happens to be
free AWS I have not used their their
particular tool but if you're on AWS
completely as a platform maybe that's
the right way to go I personally use
Jenkins a lot and I think that the go CD
continuous still deployment pipelines
are an interesting concept I just
haven't seen like a really big practical
use for them but these like the tools
that you know you potentially put in
place that are going to allow you to
then check the quality of your software
but if you're not really like I mean
I'll be down compiling like you're
really going to be doing a lot of
testing and this is often where like
people are like yeah I do continuous
integration but I don't have like a ton
of tests going on but this can really
happen like in any environment like I
was working in military intelligence
project we had tons of tests everywhere
like this is not like you can only have
tests like automated testing in like you
know an Internet company like any
environment can benefit from testing and
can absolutely do testing in the Python
ecosystem the implementations that we
use our like unit tests hi test use
knows as a test runner so you kind of
have like what is using what is actually
running your tests versus like mocking
things out versus code coverage these
are kind of the important concepts and
in that space
so I was on a project where we had
fantastic continuous integration really
great test coverage great reports for
that and then they said hey like we want
to automate our deployments and this is
like way before like puppet or chef or
anything like that so I end up writing
and it worked wasn't create it was very
brittle but were a lot of like bash
scripts to do that right and bash
scripts like you know they can get the
job done like they can totally get your
coat out of like that that source
control repository and into your into
your test or production environment and
that's really cool but there's a lot
better tooling now to do this and the
first one that I kind of came across
which was really a rapper it's really a
wrapper around SSH and this is the
Python ecosystem but I will say that
this is totally applicable to any java
application that you're also writing
like the DevOps tools by and large tend
to be either written in Ruby or Python
anyway so you don't really necessarily
have to learn those languages but most
people tend to at least get a little bit
comfortable with them so that they can
they can actually do the deployments in
there and for whatever ecosystem that
they're working in so I really enjoyed
using fabric fabric is really just a
wraparound SSH that allows you to
execute shell commands but you can
execute shell commands as Python
functions so arbitrary Python function
arbitrary shell functions arbitrary
shell execution in Python functions but
again still kind of riddle not that much
different from bash and that's why
really now I've adopted using ansible
ansibles an open source project written
in in Python that i've been using now
for about well about almost four years
so i guess i would say that I strongly
recommend it even though it certainly
does have some warts so these are just
some of the implementations that I
personally use in my own like my own
projects especially for on the web
development side so let's say you and a
lot of people are probably in the
situation where they've already okay
fine all that stuff we've got to di
we've got our testing with all that
stuff right so and that once you start
to get into ansible then you're getting
into the configuration management space
which is a little bit more the the
managing the state of the servers and
the deployment pipelines themselves
and there's a bunch of tools out there
these are open source you know again the
tooling itself you have to make sure
that you're choosing the right thing for
you but these are all implementations of
the configuration management concept and
roughly what what you're doing here is
like instead of you know writing a bash
script that would say like apt-get
install Python dev or supervisor or
whatever app system packages you need
you're going to use some sort of
intermediate language may be necessarily
a programming language maybe maybe a DSL
like a domain-specific language in the
case of like chef but the reason why I
particularly like ansible is you're
really just writing gamal yet another
markup language I wasn't really a huge
fan of yema when I first started writing
it but it's really grown on me and the
idea here is you're converting from you
know just the pure shell command into
something that is repeatable not only on
ubuntu but also potentially on other
systems now some of that stuff does
depend on which out like this won't
necessarily run on Windows but it does
give you a little bit further of an
abstraction as opposed to just running a
straight bunt to command without or hats
too so it's kind of the idea behind the
configuration management tools I do
think that likes asking yourself how
many times a day do you deploy to
production how many times a day do you
want to deploy to production what's kind
of like think about where like sort of
separate like your own organization from
like where you actually want to be I
have seen a lot of environments where a
lot of a lot of technical environments
where it is it's not really possible to
move from deploying quarterly to
deploying a dozen times a day it's just
it's not possible and the reason is
because you've got a whole lot of
process people you've got too many
process people that outweigh the
software people and so it's like you
really care about deploying a lot and
that's something that you know you want
your you want change to happen fast at
least internally if not the X the
interfaces to your external customers
but you want like change to happen
rapidly like then really you're going to
be you should really be thinking more
about potentially being in an
organization that has a lot more
software people we are very fortunate
this is kind of like a plug for what we
do but like we're very fortunate that
like every year on our in our conference
like our CEO gets up on stage and talks
about the number of deployments we did
to production the year before and these
are not things so we did six thousand
643 last in 2015 it's much more in 2016
I actually don't know the number off top
of my head but one caveat to this is
these are not changes that enforce
external customers to like implement a
new interface or something like that a
lot of this is performance improvements
a lot of this is like new features that
you can adopt and some of them are just
like hey whatever we had is default
before like there's a you can now flip a
flag and you get something new right but
it's I i don't know maybe this is the
fetus attitude i really don't think you
can go from like deploying quarterly
like in the environment that i've been
in to doing this like I just don't think
you can get there and any sort of
reasonable career amount of time like I
think you just kind of have to leave
your company and I don't know maybe
that's not they may have to defeatist
attitude but that's just kind of how I
feel so but this stuff is totally
possible and anyone he tells you that
like no you can't employ it dozens of
times a day or like that's the sign of
bad software like has obviously not been
in an environment where that is actually
the case I do think that like there are
certain people that get really excited
about continuous delivery and working on
projects where they're actually helping
to you know do the deployment by improve
the deployment pipeline those sorts of
things so thinking about who the people
on your team who are in your
organization actually gets excited about
this stuff like those are probably the
people that should be working on it I do
think that in some ways there are
application people who get really
excited I think maybe of Randall's like
this Randall gets really excited about
like shipping software or shipping
nothing and when I say shipping software
i mean like building application
features he's like dude just like give
me Heroku I just want a platform sir I
just want the stupid thing to work right
but I actually like really like working
on the deployment pipelines themselves
so for me like I'm probably the person
that should be working on some of the
deployment pipeline stuff on a team and
Randall should be shipping the
application features a lot of teams are
sort of arbutus pecially in the days of
like now in the days of like everyone
being a full stack developer like Oh
everyone works on everything but like
really is that really the most
productive way to like
or Shin people's time like certain
people get really excited about this and
if you're in the audience and you're
like I don't really care i'll just use
like a platform as a service like you're
probably not the person who should be
working on this stuff like there are
people who like totally geeked out about
this stuff like I ran a meetup group
called DC continuous delivery where all
we did was talk about this stuff like
cultural change and tooling and ideas
and stuff like that I got really excited
to go every single month and some people
just don't care like I have no interest
in going that meetup group so knowing
who actually does care and who doesn't
that's probably going to determine who
should be working on various features in
your team now part of it is like some
people look at this map and they're like
this is amazing this is a map of like a
lot of the stuff you can do with a web
application deployment and pipe and
particularly in the Python ecosystem I
get I got really excited i drew this
other piece I could tell the people who
got really excited about this we're like
they're the people that should be
working on my continuous delivery stuff
and some people are like this is really
annoying I don't care i just want to
ship some software like I just want my
stuff to work in production so that's a
good litmus test if you show this to
somebody if you show this the screenshot
that someone and they're like this is
really cool I want to learn more there
probably is sort of like a continuous
delivery type of person i do think
they're just kind of knowing the top
specific impediment to completely
automating your deployments and always
knowing what that is and being worked
and working towards fixing that is
really important so just always having
that top of mine especially if you are
like a tech lead and you're trying to
figure out like what what are the
incremental improvements we can make as
a team what are the you know what are
those impediments or what is that top
impediment and always kind of knocking
out that top impediment some people I
don't know or like really big like
planner people I am really not I like I
go one sprint at a time and I always
like to know what the top problem is
let's knock that top problem out if that
top problem is not solved in a few
Sprint's well we need to break this
problem down into some smaller
increments so that we can actually you
know solve something and make feel like
we're making some progress so on top of
you know sort of the configuration
management deployments which is where
like a lot of people a lot of people
just like assume like DevOps is like
configuration management tools
which is kind of weird or like just the
deployment pipeline but really like
operating it is you know it's like the
second half of DevOps so like the
operation stuff like for a lot of
continuous delivery people also still
really gets them excited um I was
working on a consulting project they
brought me in they were like hey we need
to like ships a new app features and
stuff right and I was like okay cool i
started working on it and then i took a
look at their production environment
they're running a modern tool called New
Relic and I discovered they like every
single page that had anything to do with
Unicode that they were pulling out of
database was just like not working like
it was like 500 airing at least it was
giving like a reasonable sort of like
error page but they were made a very
large international audience and they
had no idea that like none of their
international audience could read any
other pages because most of those pages
had unicode like they just had no clue
and it wasn't appearing in google
analytics because google analytics
snippet was on their error page so that
they didn't see any problems with the
traffic they really like just had no
idea they were getting thousands and
thousands of errors every single week
and their entire international audience
base could not like basically read their
website and that's why I think that like
if you are a developer like just knowing
what these monitoring tools are and like
knowing the percentage if you can I
don't know it's kind of an interesting
way to look at it like what are the
percentage of errors that you know about
before your users right because like if
the users are the ones who are reporting
errors like you've kind of done a bad
job every time I see somebody report an
error with twilio like I get frustrated
because like we should know about that
before they do and you should always try
to be proactive about that because
otherwise like the people downstream are
the ones that were getting frustrated
and who knows you have no idea how long
those errors have been occurring or if
you don't know how long those errors of
incurring that's like a huge problem so
on the monitoring side I often use
sentry the reason why bring up a
specific tool is just because century
also happens to be open source and I do
think that when you look at sort of like
the business models of various
monitoring tools like monitoring tools
will basically suck out all this
instrumented data out of your
applications and will store it right
it's kind of hard to get them out of the
tools so if they go up market like
certain so
companies like I don't know like app
dynamics just got bought by Cisco do you
think their prices are going to go down
no they're not they're going to go up a
lot if you've got all of your data in
their service and there's no open source
version of that monitoring tool what are
you going to do like you kind of have to
pull it out and try to shove it in a
different tool which is like an
engineering nightmare so the reason why
I actually think using some open source
tools even if you're using like I use
the hosted version of century but I know
that it's like that project just doesn't
take off and I don't want to put any
budget towards it like then I can just
set up my own server with sentry and
then okay then I have another place to
store my data that is exactly the same
as the hosted version also sentry works
really well Python projects but it works
across all different ecosystems so
that's one reason why I really enjoy
using that particular tool and also as
you're collecting like your your errors
or your monitoring your environment like
what which ones are feeding back into
every single sprint like a lot of times
Sprint's are just about only about new
features but if you're not actually
looking at like how do we decrease the
number of errors that we have in
production how do we decrease maybe the
404 is that user users are getting
because they're not actually done by
just crawling bounce or something like
that if you you need to like find some
way to feed these metrics into every
spring and this is actually how I found
that like most teams are able to kind of
complete that DevOps loop because like
if they're just so if developers are
always just building new features like
that's okay that's fine but you haven't
really changed your process for how
you're actually building software and so
I think just asking yourself like what
metrics are we using from production to
actually feed back into our into our
sprint development cycles like that I
don't know just asking that question of
yourself and your team like what are
just calling them out I thinking help
try to figure out like okay how are we
closing this loop from production to
actually our development cycles this is
a random one but like when I was like a
22 year old developer or 16 year old
developer I would have said zero money I
will loot all myself but as you start to
build more complicated projects
sometimes asking yourself like what can
I spend money on and just use a hosted
service can
be really helpful like and it's not the
case of like you have to go and spend
like a thousand dollars a month on some
monitoring solution like you can spend
like twenty bucks a month and get some
fantastic monitoring and just take that
off of your plate a lot of it just
depends on your team like you may not
care if you've got 50 developers in your
team you've got entire fluid developers
that are focused on you know monitoring
tools or something like that you know
you're already kind of spending money
you're spending their their time and
resources on it but as like if you're
doing a lot of like your own development
projects you're running your own
applications I found this to be more and
more valuable as I've allowed myself as
a developer to ask myself what where to
spend money so that was kind of a random
walk down some of the different
conceptual ideas and trying to ask some
questions that like probably a lot of
people find uncomfortable and are a
little bit high level but just kind of
going through you know source control is
sort of that foundational layer you have
some programmatic access to your code as
like your code essentially becomes data
at that point you're executing your code
because you can pull it out of source
control programmatically then you are
testing it in an automated way with CI
testing your application dependencies
making sure there's not negative
interactions and continue and then we
talked a little bit about some of the
conceptual ideas behind configuration
management tools some of what those
tools are and using them to do server
state management and deployments and
then we talked a little about monitoring
logging and measuring on your
applications and some of the pressures
and why why I strongly believe in using
open source tools that I can switch over
to in case their company decides to go
up market and I do not have the money to
spend and I do not feel like getting my
data out of their service so anyway
that's a random walk about adopting some
DevOps tools for you and your team my
name is Matt Makai i'm a developer
evangelist with twilio i'm also the
creator of full sack python calm so if
you're interested in these topics in
more depth particularly in the Python
ecosystem that's actually where i right
the details of the tutorials on those
sorts of things if you like to stalk or
if you hated it you can also email me
makai at
Leo calm and I'm Matt mikhay on github
thank you all very much if you have
questions and stuff might as well just
like we'll just go outside the room and
take questions also I think lunch is
served so get out early for lunch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
