we read mo CK and I'm with Heather who
has one of the most interesting new
title top of the key conference and so
before we get into music I want to ask
you what Alito's well to me a leader is
someone that well leads people to do
something exceptional so it doesn't
matter
what that is if you're going to get up
there and lead it better be something
good okay so something out of the
ordinary it doesn't have to be something
out of the ordinary but it needs to have
meaning if we go some looking at
something with meaning and something
really leading you then the real life
patch cool on the ground in the trenches
managers I've had in the past no no how
do you as someone who's managed teach
your manager to be a leader so that's
actually an interesting thing I actually
do a top cut or a workshop called
leadership skills for the non manager
and and that's there because there
you're right there are so many managers
that are not leaders they're missing
that vital skill of being able to
inspire people to actually do something
meaningful and and and that's really the
key that if you're a leader you need to
unlock that thing within somebody else
to move the needle to get them to act if
you're a manager and you're just simply
saying do this thing do this thing and
you're not motivating them to to act
you're not giving them you're not
sparking something within them so make
them want to do it then you're not
leading if you're a leader then you're
touching on something within another
person that that's resonating with them
and saying oh yeah yeah
get it I get it now I'm going to get up
and act and do something so you know
when you're being led by somebody else
and you know when you're just being
managed do you think a lot of management
courses and management tips hinder
people's ability to unlock themselves as
a leader because just an example I was
over here two conversations and we had a
new employee another thing I want you to
always ask why you're doing something
important always ask why do you so the
thing he was doing was like the most
boring thing in the world it was like
searching
it's like data entry or something like
that I wrote those details but but I was
listening into this thinking I'm really
glad I'm not in that position because
well as the stress is doing is super
boring repetitive task I don't want to
ask why I'm doing it because it's not
going to make it anymore I just do it
yeah but well so I think that right
there when when you get the the problem
that people are doing when they say the
word why you immediately get defensive
and you have to prove something when you
say why why this why that because you go
back into toddler mode then why but if
you just transform that to what is the
purpose is this then you can start
opening your mind up to a motivational
reason for it and you can find a purpose
to doing it so it's they're getting
they're getting close with that
management ship but they're they're not
quite there because if you start asking
so oh my god why do I have to do this as
opposed to well what is in this what can
I do to make this go by and if you start
asking what questions then you can find
a motivation for it and it sounds like a
semantic difference but your mind starts
opening up to possibilities that can
then get you through your day faster
what's the biggest challenge that you
find being a leader because you've been
it six times six epic time video
so it's when when people bring me in as
a CTO or an interim CTO on their project
it's it can be challenging because like
they have a team in place a lot of times
already that I didn't pick and I have to
go in and prove myself right away to
people that I don't know and they don't
know who I am and and what I've done and
and so that's one of the big challenges
as as a leader and managers coming in
and and you you don't always get to pick
your teeth yeah
so if if you have to manage people where
you don't know their skills you don't
know anything about them and they don't
know your skills getting somebody to
trust you quickly so that they can do
the job that you need them to do is the
hardest thing that I have had to deal
with and thankfully I have had the I
guess good fortune of every team that
I've ever worked with has been amazing
and has has been able to get more than
the job done for me well you know that
might be you I'm going to stick that
this next time it could be it could be
I could I could be able to get past that
trust barrier really fast maybe maybe
that's it I was reading a book called
team geek I can member of stuff my head
to do pizza and but it's a good book and
if there's an analogy there's a story
about a female member of a team and
somebody said just doesn't look like
she's doing as much work so colleagues
and so they said actually the whole app
not necessarily one or she was a shear
but the whole atmosphere is something
that she changed so that she bought a
different dimension to zoom so maybe
maybe you have that atmosphere well
actually in one of the the last
companies that I started working with as
their CTO they brought me in and I had
to do the dance with their senior
developer
to get him to trust me real quick of
course because that's what happened and
and after a couple weeks somebody came
in and they're like I don't I don't see
her doing stuff she just seems to be in
a lot of meetings and he said for them
like that's her job
that's your job leave her alone that's
awesome I can do my work now thank God
you took away their you should quite a
tedium no yes yeah it's like because he
was now free to not have to answer all
of the tedious questions and he could
get all of the the stuff that he needs
to be done as a developer and I was now
in all of the meetings being able to
send stuff to him so it was the burden
was now off of him I like that he was
very grateful he was so grateful and I
mean and that's a lot of what a CTO does
you have to like get that road map plan
make sure that everything's on time make
sure that all of the that everybody's
functioning and keep it all in my head
and it was funny because most of my job
if you watch me in an office is I'm
walking around constantly like with my
eyes closed just in circles because I
have everything like I keep the roadmap
in my head I always know like where the
moving parts are and my team is always
like don't bother her right now okay
he's making do it make sense</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
