intellij 15 as much enhanced support for
lambda debugging in Java 8 you have like
little run tests icons nor in the editor
so you can just click on them and run a
test or whatever we have online
appliqued analysis on the code so as you
type you will have highlighting of

great thing you don't have to run
inspections manually and stuff like that
and yeah much much more of course
improved support for existing frameworks
and stuff like that so also upgrade to
upgrade to enter Jeff if Dean thanks for
your time all right let's move on okay
so next on the next on the agenda we're
gonna go talk to pivot us go talk to the
people two guys now there's been a lot
in recent conferences particularly at
javaone DevOps about about the cloud now
there are many cloud vendors which are
the important cloud vendors let's see
who we can talk to a pivotal who have we
got hey we have the big hey Josh long
again how you doing man kids happen to
you Oliver how's things buddy could see
you right so Oliver Josh why I like you
guys right you my good friends I'm gonna
ask you I'm not gonna ask anyone else
what makes pivotal cloud foundry
superior to the Oracle cloud and to open
shift in 15 seconds or less it's the
platform that's built fork and optimized
for continuous delivery of applications
safely and quickly into production so
it's got dem up features runtime support
for micro services and everything in
between and it's open source yeah that's
it listen for there we go right love the
stand favorite stand by the way okay
great job right let's move on let's talk
to the Oracle guys okay now Oracle 2009
have been the host of Java so who have
we got here to speak to and the bag on
let's talk to sha sha shells on the main
man of Java sure how you doing buddy
yeah now you're one of my favorite
people in Java ok so I'm going to ask
this question i'm looking to ask anyone
else all right so what makes oracle
cloud superior over pivotal cloud
foundry and over openshift top to bottom
that's integrated together you have the
software as a service layer platform as
a service layer and infrastructure so
you a full integrated stack from top to
bottom so I go anywhere else great
answer shop and this is my favorite
boots by the way awesome be awesome cool
ok let's go over to the Red Hat guys now
now now the Red Hat guys massive on
their open source they love everything
about developers so who can be taught to
hear marker
hey dude Marcus great to see with that
beer in your hand Marcus Wright say
soaked market oh you want my best mates
in the community so I'm gonna ask you
I'm not asking anyone else what makes
openshift the superior cloud platform to
Oracle's cloud and also to pivotal cloud
foundry I think the answer is pretty
simple it is because we're open
everything we do is developed in the
open so open shift has the commercial
offering which is like the enterprise
version but we do work in the open as
openshift origin and it's not only Red
Hat actually it is google it is our
customers so we basically take
everything fancy that google has and
work together with them and bring in the
enterprise aspect of it so whatever we
run is stable and perfect well that's a
great answer by the way I love this down
this is probably my favorite stand right
man right now let's move on now this is
this has been thirsty work so i'm going
to go i think i think it's time to grab
a beer don't you so if we actually look
I think this is actually my favorite
stand now so may open that yes and look
at this bar now we're talking and by the
way my favorite stand the zero turn
around stand Cheers DevOps</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
