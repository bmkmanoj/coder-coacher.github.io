scientific instrument on the planet the
Large Hadron Collider studying the
tiniest particles it's truly worldwide
effort you have over 3,000 scientists
and from is it nearly 200 universities
oh yes at least that number yes with
this comes from heavy computational
requirements from administration to
outreach to profiling beams of particles
and they also have cloud computing but
not in the way that you might understand
the software developers because I'm
standing actually do computations based
on real-life cloud formations rather
than the cloud experiment experiment
called the claw at CERN and the goal is
20 to investigate the studied see what
is the impact of cosmic rays and the
production of clouds and of course that
what is the impact on the climate change
in the world so I'm here at bus station
miss Cherrell and Derek hello and you
work in the IT department so you have a
not not the IT department no he's
correct me so we are work in the finance
and administrative processing department
although we do I T which is only it's
I'm very confusing it's learn yes we
actually do administered computing so
all the IT for sharon's administration
is done with a nerd department so we we
were very closely with the IT department
but IT departments got much broader
scope than us okay so the goal is
basically to IT provides to us
infrastructure so the servers databases
etc and we needed to develop itself
where it splits off work that's a IT
itself departments does all the
infrastructure and then us the
developers are spread across CERN in the
physics departments in the domestic
sector in experiments everywhere
literally so you have a huge huge
responsibility yes I mean sarin is 1
billion swiss francs for your
organization so where this is money
coming in to turn so we spend other
people's money basically so yes we have
a huge responsibility to make sure that
is spent wisely efficiently and all the
right stuff basically
so what is your day to day job involved
from a development perspective well I'm
basically the technical aid so the group
leader responsible basically for running
a team of developers so I'm trailer and
50 developers within my team drow is one
of the team leaders within that team so
he basically those more the day-to-day
actually running of the software
projects tony is difficult i force of
the developers so i have assistant to
maintain you walk it's called EDH it
stands for electronic buttman handling
system is the system at cern where you
go if you want to do any kind of a
mystery procedure so say you want to go
on a training on the safety cars or
learning about spring or java then you
go to the system in a platter for course
so you want to take holidays i want to
buy some materials a a pen drive or a
mouse you go to the system so we get
every procedure of the succeed at CERN
in a single system called EDH and I'm
the fully developed of this so my
responsibilities are doing not just
development also programming all the
functionalities coordinating all the
work from other developers from June
develop because of course CERN we get
people from all over the world in terms
of students which very very little
experiments so of course one of our
goals is to teach them how to use these
tools how to become better developers
and how to become a product that when
they return to their home country after
the experiment is finished here then
they can apply that knowledge in their
industries in the local countries
another is really important as one of
CERN's missions but although we're also
here obviously do fundamental physics
research that we also very important
element which is education we have
hundreds of students actually come to
CERN every year just to do their
practice work or find out what we're
doing and all different fields not just
physics we're also computing engineering
you name the topic there's someone
probably working on it is Sir how do the
students apply to do you experience here
okay there's basically several different
programs they all star via the
University there's different program set
up some pair country but there's also
general program so there's a summer
student program which is i can remember
i think it's a it's three months to over
the summer we have a few hundred
students who will apply and come and
basically not only do they get to work
on technical projects but there's also
whole lecture series with world-leading
physicists and scientists are actually
actually give lectures every afternoon
on particle physics and all the
engineering that goes on it
so the real wonderful education
experience today is much in the morning
they work on the projects in the
afternoon they have lectures and of
course in evening that you're parking
somewhere and down those things over
there yeah we have the largest one of
the largest hotels an area so there's a
550 rooms in the hotel just across the
road is he sleeping and they actually
live and work here so they live at CERN
and work it sir it's really
fantastically teenager absolutely and
can you go to the lectures as well yes I
that's one of the nice things actually
working at certain as all these things
are open so we're working a certain if
you want to find it a bit more about the
technology behind what we're doing
you're free to walk into any of the
lectures and listen and take notes as
well so I can I ask you about particle
physics that you can I don't have any
answers no but I think this is really
one of the unique parts are certain is
that you can be having lunch downstairs
and just in a table across from you will
be a Nobel Prize winning physicist it's
all a Lumia a Nobel Prize winner in
facts yeah and they're basically just
using the same facilities of the rest of
us and and you can go up and ask them so
tell me about this Higgs boson or
whatever it's really wonderful place
really I agree not you can see my boss I
really be is a great place because of
all these after the barrack mentioned
education part diversity so you go to
the restaurants and you see you from
Russia from Spain from Portugal from
Germany from by laboratory from all over
the world and she fantastically
segregation of culture which can take
place in here I had the valleys and
being one of the largest scientific
communities and because of the truly
multicore multicultural aspect its own
you also been studied by social
scientists that's true there's their
studies going on all the time
particularly just in terms of working or
what the impact is absurd because these
are things which are much harder to
measure but what the social impact of
sarin is so yes we can see what we've
done in terms of how many collisions
we've done or how much Engineering's
been done the tragic trying to measure
the actual benefits of the newly
educational aspects and what was certain
brought to society is really quite tough
and so there's lots of studies going on
about that I mean the best example of
course with things like the World Wide
Web what did that do to the rest of the
world to me when we when we invented the
web as a thing which sarin needed for
scientists to talk together of course we
give away to the rest of the world
that transformed the world i mean you
can hardly imagine what the world would
be like without the world wide web
started here I wouldn't have a job oh
thank you very much thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
