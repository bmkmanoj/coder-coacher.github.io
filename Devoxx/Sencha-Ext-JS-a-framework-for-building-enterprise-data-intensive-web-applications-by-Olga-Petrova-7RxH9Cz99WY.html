lunch break it's really nice to see him
my name is Olga I'm working as a sales
engineer at Central right now before I
have been working as software and web
developer for like 13 years old and
certain yesterday and today I will talk
about change exe dress it's a childhood
framework for building enterprise data
intensive web applications so this track
is called modern web and I would like to
talk to you about modern web for
enterprises you may wonder why what is
the difference between modern web in
general and modern web for enterprises
and difference is that enterprises have
a special requirements as they need to
develop fast complex business critical
applications that have to be alive for
several years and every vault in this
definition is important and I would like
to clarify them what means fast fast
means that to be competitive enterprises
have to shorten time to market as well
as release time for every new version of
application
what means complex application is
complex when and have several modules
tens of sub modules hundreds or
thousands of user stories and huge
codebase and many years of development
and what makes application business
critical application is business
critical when it needs to be stable and
reliable walk like 24 hours a day seven
days a week and suit all changing
business requirements and it's quite
often that business critical
applications enterprise applications
have to handle huge datasets huge
enterprise data sets means be very
data-intensive and when we talk about
business critical applications we talk
more about
development instead of application
development and what means to be alive
for several yes it means that
application should be easy mantain
humble and supportable follow all modern
technologies modern techniques and work
with all new browsers and devices and
seneschal suits perfectly into this
enterprise requirement it provides
JavaScript framework and all tools
around for rapid development of complex
business critical dental intensive
cross-platform enterprise applications
so how central could help enterprises to
manage these requirements our main
product is called ext J's it's
JavaScript framework pretty much view it
so all of the eleven gets old has six
main major abortions and current version
is 6.5 and the biggest advantage of XE
dress I would say is a rich set of
robust components all components are
perfectly compatible to each other and
optimized to work with the huge data
sets huge enterprise data sets to handle
these data sets we have advanced data
package that could be configured to work
with any back-end or database could
communicate with web server using like
REST API age X
any other technology and XE dress is
completely cross-platform framework we
support all browsers starting from
modern one and down to Internet Explorer
8 and 9 and for enterprises it could be
sometimes really important and we
provide architectural patterns that
could clean your code and make
application is maintainable and
supportable semen of ext dress
application could really could be really
easy you just change different variables
like colors fonts in a special graphical
interface and there is not only
framework but also
all set of tolling around it let that
let you build the minimize debug inspect
design and test your web applications
and we support all modern that features
like new gorshins of javascript and
progressive web applications features
and i would like to go a deep a bit
deeper into every point and show you a
couple of examples as I said why our
customers love it suggests it's a huge
set of rich components we have basically
everything that you may need to develop
complex Enterprise web applications
grids trees tree grease pivot grids
charts calendars dashboards any kind of
form fields data visualizations and I
would like you to show you a couple of
examples just to give you an express
impression here we have a grid and our
grid supports raw body out of box you
could insert another component inside of
row body like also grid inside of grid
you have assault and filtering broken
out of box and you could have like
component widgets directly into grid and
another example is calendar component
you could have month week day view and
you could configure different rules if
different events could overlap or not
drag-and-drop different events create
new one so it's just two examples and
all components are perfectly compatible
to each other you don't need to code
something special like to share data
between grid and form for example and
they optimized to work with huge data
sets if you are interested I have an
example when a lot 1 million records in
agreed
of course they are not loaded at the
same time but we use really highly
optimized rendering so for user it looks
like you have 1 million records in the
grid in reality not but it looks like
and it's works extremely fast and all
components are easy accustomed could be
easily customized cross-platform with
exe dress you could have application
with a single code base and touted all
devices like tablets smartphones and
desktop devices of course you could
configure a different views for
different devices or you may choose to
have different data for different
devices or different behavior for
different devices so it's full
flexibilities that you want to have and
common techniques like responsive design
is also supported you could for example
configure at different views to be used
for desktop and mobile version of your
application like grid for desktop
portion and list for mobile Gaussian
advanced data package ext J's includes
all classes that you may need to handle
complex enterprise data like models to
describe your data store to store your
records field types of different filter
data fields of different types proxies
to communicate with server using like
EDX rest or JSONP protocols reader and
writers that could transfer data with
server using JSON XML array or other
formats you could use one to one one to
main your main to many associations to
handle internal data dependencies and
highly customized at validators to
handle data constraints different
operations like create update destroy
read could be combined it into operation
batches and sessions to package data
manipulations I create all patterns we
offer advanced class system as well
I could Heckscher patterns model view
viewmodel or model-view-controller that
help you to separate your view logic
from your data logic from your business
logic and it could be really important
for complex enterprise applications we
also support data binding including
two-way but it's optional if you don't
want you may use only one-way data
binding and it also could help you to
make your application called much
cleaner seaman as I said seaman of VX
serious applications very easy we use
SAS syntactically awesome CSS themes we
have several predefined themes like our
theme or material design theme and you
could configure them by changing
different variables in a special
graphical interface Center simmer and we
also provide JavaScript based source
compiler and you could use it for
runtime seaman when you seem your
application change different variables
like colors and you see results and
browse immediately without page reload
and as I said to exercise its not just a
framework it's also tooling around it
that could help you to increase your
development productivity and improve
application quality since your command
could help you to build and minimize
your application since your architect
could help you to build your application
using drag-and-drop of different
components on converse and configuring
them and plug-ins for different ID help
you to do code generation court out a
completion refactoring essentially
inspector lets you inspect and debug
your application seneschal similar as I
said could make similar fix serious
application strictly easy and last but
not the least sensor test could help you
to write unit and end-to-end tests for
your application and we support all
modern web features like new versions of
Atma script and progressive about
features so you could make your
application installable at least at
Android devices and user could launch
your application
by clicking on an icon at the home
screen instead of manually typing URL in
a browser and we support offline mode
using service workers and all of this
just with simple configuration you do
not need to do any manual cordon
so as I said X address is a full
framework it includes everything that
you may need to develop enterprise
applications class system data package a
collection patterns components area
support data binding etc and it's fast
and stable framework it's ten years old
and we run about ten thousand tests
every day to test it and they have good
news for react developers if you are
dragged developer and you want to use
ext J's components now you could do it
using e now our new product ext react
it's a component library for react and
react developers do not need to do to
learn something special to use ext J's
components inside the reactor
application they could do it just as any
other react component it includes more
than 100 ready to use UI components
they're perfectly compatible tested
supported by sensor and optimized to
work with the huge datasets so at the
end I would like to show you some of our
customers just to give an impression
what kind of companies are using
essential to build their enterprise
applications and I was quite fast and I
have two and half minutes for questions
and I would be happy to talk to you yeah
yes actually we have released like
preview release it's called next angular
and it's available as preview release
it's not production abortion but preview
release yeah extract is a commercial
license but we have repeal portion of
ext dress and we have repeal bortion of
a connector between extjs and react
it's called extract extractor and you
could use it using triple gorshin if you
want if your project is repair licensed
if you use triple portions and it's free
