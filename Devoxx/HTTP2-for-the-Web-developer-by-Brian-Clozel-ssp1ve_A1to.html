this session HTTP two for the web
developer so during this session very
short session i'll try to explain them
very core basics of HTTP two and what
they mean for us as by developers so
very quickly i'm ryan i'm working on the
spring framework and since i only got 15
minutes together a lot so let's get
started so if you only have to know one
thing about HTTP two is that it's all
about solving latency issues HTTP 11 has
some absorb some of those issues and
we've been tackling those with
workarounds in some ways but htp two is
about solving most of those and if you
want to understand how its solving them
then you have to learn the very basics
of HTTP two and that's what we'll do in
more or less five minutes so six steps
to really understand what's HTTP two is
doing and how it is solving those
latency issues number one in HTTP to you
only have one single TCP connection it
means that you don't have many obviously
but it also means that you're spending
the last time doing tcp handshakes
you're spending less time in slow start
and in the initial congestion window in
TCP so basically you're trying to get
the most out of your link as soon as
possible and to maximize the throughput
for your application with that link you
have multiple streams it means that
instead of having several several TCP
connection several CP anticipate
connections and and doing things over
several connections you only have one
but then you have multiple streams over
a single TCP connection it means that
you can send a receive multiple messages
interleaved cut in cut into pieces on
the same TCP connection and a little
unlike HTTP 11 you you don't have the
head of line blocking problem meaning
you don't have to receive the responses
in the same order you send the requests
so that's something new as well in the
left multiple streams and like we said
so since those messages are cutting
is there could they're cut into frames
binary frames so in the spec the HP to
spec defines several types of frames
you've got headers friends you've got
data frames all binary so it means that
the messages are cut into pieces and can
come in several several parts in the
live with other messages and it also
means that you can't really rely anymore
on tools like netcat writing HTTP
protocol by hand over a socket it's not
happening anymore even for you tools is
mean it since its binary you need
specific tools to get access to what's
going on on the wire so to really see
what's going on imagine this is a your
single TCP connection between the server
and the client and imagine the client is
sending a a request so for this you can
just send a headers frame and asking for
the slash Java resource notice that
there is an idea stream ID because a
given request-response exchange is a
given stream so you're asking for that
Java resource and at the same time you
can just post a new resource that a
DevOps resource and since it's supposed
you can send another frame since this
time a data frame so you're sending some
more data and at that point the server
can start responding with a headers
response for the first request you made
so this time just errors and then the
server can continue responding with this
time some data for the response for the
first response and then at some point
maybe the client can send some more
right because it's all interleaved
single TCP connection multiplexed so
everything can happen like this at any
time and then the server can go on and
respond for the second so that's how
things go exchanging frames over the
wire back and forth with the server
between server and client and but there
there's something more because number 4
is about flow control flow control means
just like a bit tcp if you know how to
CP is going now the client and server
can negotiate
window size frame size and how much they
are willing to to receive and take four
messages so it means that the servant in
client can more or less control how much
data they can get and how much request
they can they can accept so that that's
a new mechanism there's also H pack so H
pack is a is a speck on its own it's a
separate spec quite dense actually HVAC
is all about saving space and not
sending and receiving all the time the
HTTP headers because you know with hp11
you're always sending a non user agent
except etc you're always sending the
same the same information sometimes a
lot of duplication so H back is all
about it is all about not sending them
over and over again by sharing some kind
of state between the client and the
server and with some kind of common
understanding of those are the common
headers we're sending and receiving it's
coming values so in the end it's all
about having some flags and very little
data sent over with the headers frames
which are in this case very minimal so
saving saving space and not sending over
and over same data and for the last one
um TLS is not or it is required actually
if you look at the speck h2 the HP to
protocol requires TLS so that's a good
that's good news for our users right it
everything encrypted privacy very good
but there's another variant of that
protocol which which is called h2c both
are specified but many vendors
explicitly the browser vendors they they
don't intend to implement the HTC so h2
encrypted TLS for for most of your needs
another thing that you can look into is
that h2 because it's relying on TLS so
you set up the TLS connection the
encrypted link and then use negotiate
with with the server the protocol you'll
be using so in this case HP too if you
were to use HTC it's a bit like
negotiating WebSocket with the server
you have to use the HP 11 upgrade
mechanism to tell ok i'm going to use HP
to as a protocol and we all know that
for
websockets it's creating some issues
negotiating a different protocol over
over the 480 so many services think that
ok this is GP 11 and this is not the
case so anyway that's the basics if you
want to try to try a couple of things
and really know what's going on you can
go to that example it's a spring booth
application with jetty HTTP two and you
can you can try things out but right now
they're good questions how should we
adapt as web developers what can we do
we already heard that some of the phone
and optimization we've been using won't
be good enough like concatenation it's
it will waste bandwidth and it won't it
won't work with with properly with
caching so concatenation should be out
of the other question here but we should
keep gzip in Compton we should keep eat
eggs cache control and we should
probably look into JavaScript module
loading because this time sending and
receiving you you request are less
expensive here so modularizing our code
the way we're doing on the server on the
client probably a good idea but at that
point you may think ok I've heard about
those new htp two features I heard there
they're really great and you're right
there is HTTP to server push server push
is a new and I insist optional feature
of hcp to the server can now push
responses before the client even ask for
those so usually what people tend to say
or think at that point is okay I know
what I'll good I'm what I'm going to do
whenever a client asked for a page I'm
going to push all the static resources
to the client jnco javascript CSS etc
that will really improve the page load
time because the client won't even ask
to have to parse the page and ask for
those resources I know what's going on
I'll push them it while it may be a good
idea in some cases it can be tricky like
you know if we're back to our server and
client case let's say we want to the
client asked for that particular index
dot HTML page then the server instead of
sending a response headers frame and
with the response this time we're
sending a special type push promise so
we're saying okay for the string 3 i'll
send a stream number eight with this
time that corresponds to the main dot
CSS if you were to send that request
i'll respond that and that's why i'm
going that's what i'm going to push so
i'm pushing this then the headers of
that response and then the data etc and
then also i'm sending that script etc
but if the client already has those
resources in cash then the client has to
go nope I don't want those reset stream
it's canceling it's it's telling this to
the server I don't want those resources
already already have them so reset reset
again and again so if you imagine with
your clients already having those
resources in cash instead of making your
application faster you'll put you'll
start pushing a lot of resources and
your clients will go I don't want them I
don't want them in meanwhile you are not
sending the actual HTML page you're not
sending the important data to your
clients so instead of making you making
your page no time better you may be
hurting it in a way so you may think why
we are not sending the HTML page first
right here we can just send some bits of
the HTML page and then pushed or those
resources because we know it'll be
useful but if you do that it's actually
warned against in this back there saying
this basically you shouldn't respond you
shouldn't respond first and then push
push promises because in this case you
may run into some kind of race condition
and that's the kind of case you run into
right it's again the client asks for
this let's give him what he wants
headers in data for that particular
index dot HTML page then the browser is
actually parsing HTML okay discovering I
need to ask for this j/s I need to ask
for that CSS
and in that case if you're pushing
promises after the fact then at the same
time the client may ask I want this
what's going on here what should we do
right it's kind of some kind of rice
condition it's not really effective it's
it's warned against in this back in the
spec so really what should we do then
because server-side application we know
about the structure we know about the
number of size of the resources but the
client at the same time only the
browser's know better about the URI
sticks what what what it needs to render
the page efficiently it knows what it's
gotten it knows what it's got into its
cache etc or us maybe we know better
right obviously there's another new
feature in HB to this time also optional
and this time it's all about the
possibility for the client to
communicate those needs so instead of
sending just dumb requests the client
can tell okay for this image this image
depends on that other resource and I'm
putting a weight on it so a way for the
client to communicate some kind of tree
of dependencies to the server and so the
server can allocate like network
bandwidth or CPU let's say resources to
give those resources as soon as possible
to the client and as efficiently as
possible so actually using this the
experiments show that using this feature
properly both the client and the server
is a huge performance boost and that's
really one of the keys here so the
response here no as usual no silver
bullet you don't have a perfect response
for everything I guess or one of the
best advice I give you is to use the
your browser developer tools and all the
tools you can have and and try and try
your application in a real world
environment as much as you can because
for example with the recent developer
tools you can look up in the network tab
you can see the graph of resources being
downloaded you can see if it's HTTP to
or not and you can even say okay I'm I
want to simulate that connection over
a 3g because local or very good network
and 3g or even worse edge it's very
different and it makes a lot of
difference over hep-2 even more so what
argue if you want to test things out
just start with h b2 there are ways to
start the testing things with hep-2 or
the jvm support is coming and if you
want to choose properly and
implementation that can give you some
tips so if you want to really choose an
implementation those are the items you
should look for for example I want to I
want to container or a sort of
environment that or whatever web that
serves htp using HTTP to you want to
look what kind of i/o and programming
model is it using another cover
threading or even loop etc just to know
how it goes if the sort the TLS report
is decent enough and complete enough
because that's really important with HP
to you don't you don't just throw any
TLS support it's it's got really strict
requirements um you need to know does it
support server push and stream
prioritization just like we talked about
because the way it's supported is really
important what kind of primitives and
API is it providing to you because
obviously if it's only pushing
everything first then not flexible
enough right and also if it's reactive
streams friendly you may look into that
state that thing yeah you can see some
kind of mechanical theme pathy sympathy
between reactive streams and the flow
control feature of HTTP too so in a way
you could really control them the back
pressure from the client through the
server even over the network so really
interesting things to look into here I'm
all done we 15 minutes here in thank</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
