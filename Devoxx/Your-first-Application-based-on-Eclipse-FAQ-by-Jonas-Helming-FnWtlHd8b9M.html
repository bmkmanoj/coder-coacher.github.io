the audience I on youtube so this is
recorded welcome to my talk I'm Jonas
working for a clip source and the
advantage for you today is this is about
an FAQ about eclipse topic so if you
have any question at any time just
interrupt me I'm sure we have the time
to answer all your questions if you have
any so we can make this more interactive
today if you like to let me give you a
short background of this talk I'm
working at eclipse or in Munich and we
as a company of focus to provide
services around technology and as the
name implies many of those technologies
or from the Eclipse ecosystem so we are
focused to support our customers with
training with development support
responder development to apply the
technology so we are in contact a lot
with people who get started with Eclipse
initially like from selecting the
framework for making the choice whether
they want to use it or not up to the
first project to set up and all this
stuff and along this way we experience
that there is a quite a large number of
recurring questions that almost
everybody has who gets in touch with
eclipse so the goal of this talk when I
submitted it was to do a collection of
those frequently asked questions and to
provide initial answers to those
questions there are two things that I
realized while preparing the talk first
even 50 minutes are not enough to answer
all questions so this is really like the
most frequent one of course there's more
and second for some of the questions
it's not possible to answer them
completely like with all technical
details solution for those problems is
actually today in the top target I would
like to give some initial overview to
get an initial understanding however in
parallel also prepared a texture
of this talk providing much more
detailed answers to all the big question
and I will provide the link on the last
slide so if you stay for the whole talk
you get the link and then you can
actually read more in detail especially
about the more technical question ok and
last disclaimer before you get started I
tried to order the questions a little
bit top-down meaning the most general
questions first and then we go a little
bit more into detail about some
technologies however there's no really
good order in which which I will present
the questions basically question by
question okay and questions I want to
talk about today or like what is eclipse
a query high-level when to use eclipse
obviously and when not to what is ODI
how to build an eclipse application is
it really for free can you use it in
your project or do you have to care
about licenses and finally pretty common
question is should i go for eclipse 3x
or 4x or what's what's the difference ok
so let's start with a question heading
in the direction what is eclipse when we
talk about the question what is eclipse
it makes sense to have a look where
eclipse comes from because that helps a
lot to understand different building
blocks that the Eclipse eco system
consists off and get a better
understanding why actually all those
technologies are there and the Eclipse
Foundation and so on come as you can see
I have a timeline and compared to the
keynote yesterday I really have numbers
which mean something so it starts in two
thousand and summer in 2017 and so the
original of Eclipse was done by IBM it
was an internal IBM project and the
original idea was to develop a tool
platform to platform means a framework
which you can use to create tools which
typically are meant for developers tools
like a java ide a javascript ibe a c++
ID in whatever
so the common parts of all those tools
are the tools platform and IBM wanted to
achieve two goals with this platform
first they wanted to reuse common
functionality that's pretty obvious so
because many tools have common features
for example FCM integration like kids or
back then svn so that you don't have to
re-implement all this stuff and second a
better integration for the end user
because back then like in the late 90s
more and more projects project involved
several technology in peril so you
needed a tool which was capable to
modify xml javascript and java at the
same time and by having a common
platform you could easily integrate
those tools together so those were the
main two drivers why they created this
platform initially it was not open
source it was an internal project now
the second thing which they started to
do is if you if you have ever build a
framework you probably know it's always
a good idea to have at least one use
case for the framework meaning if you
build a tool platforms you should have
at least one tool which is based on that
and the first big tool that they based
on it is a Java IDE that's the Java IDE
that we still use today in a new version
and that I would say the most prominent
thing that Eclipse is it is a Java IDE
however in detail it's actually a Java
IDE which is based on the tool platform
so if you download eclipse today from
the download side the java is what you
typically get except if you a download
any other language support like c++ or
PHP another connection between the Java
IDE and the tool platform is that pretty
much from the beginning of course not
from day one but pretty early IBM used
the Java IDE to work on the tool
platform too because all this stuff is
written in Java so to develop in the to
platform and also the ID itself you need
some tooling and that was also provided
by the IDE itself so he Clips bootstraps
it's pretty much from the beginning
okay so that's what this was the origin
of eclipse now there was another
strategic decision done by IBM what they
wanted to do with their true platform is
build of an ecosystem of tools and they
wanted other vendors to develop things
based on their platform to reason for
that is day they wanted to strengthen
the tool platform and the idea was that
if many people provide tools then it's
more attractive for the users and they
can also save costs because other people
might contribute so they decided to open
source the platform and also the IDE
initially that was only for a short time
they had in consortium of several
companies who wanted to work on this but
pretty soon they found it the Eclipse
Foundation which is an independent
organization and up to today the role of
the Eclipse Foundation is to define
rules the processes and the
infrastructure and to work on on the
Eclipse platform so that's the role of
the Eclipse Foundation it's driven by
its members IBM still has a big role in
that but they actually the gaze of the
the core control of the of the project
which was an important step because then
it was even more attractive for other
companies to contribute something to
this platform so almost immediately
after the pool platform has been
released people started to use it and to
create plugins and to difference between
plugins and tools would be if you create
a plugin that's something that you add
to an existing product for example the
Java IDE so you could for example at
support for check style or find parts to
the existing Java ID so that's a plugin
however it's also possible to create a
completely dedicated to will like the
C++ tooling based on Eclipse has nothing
to do with the JDT with the Java
development tools and there's also tool
for PHP for example and there there is a
number of commercial tools provided by
different
nice for their own languages or for
their own hardware devices or whatever
also based on the tool type so so far
everything is pretty much focused on
development touring however people who
were developing plugins and tools back
then they pretty much liked all the
concepts provided by the platform and
they wanted to use the same concepts in
their business applications to the
concepts I'm talking about is for
example perspectives this views that you
can drag around the toolbars and all
this stuff so initially this was pretty
Hecky however with version 3 dot 0 which
was released in 2005 the core team
introduced something that we call a CP
that stands for which client platform in
the background of this is actually they
took the existing tool platform and
separated it into pieces one piece was
our CP which contains all framework
components that you can use in any kind
of application things like the
perspective views all the stuff and the
second piece is still the tool platform
which contains stuff that you typically
need in development tools for example
sem support resources processing or
something like that so that was the
origin of our CP meaning accepts as a
platform for general-purpose
applications and immediately in parallel
some frameworks were arising in the
Eclipse ecosystem which also support
general-purpose applications so for
example their framework to build
form-based two eyes their frameworks to
single source a desktop application with
the web application and two for
communication and so on so there are
many run time frame works in the Eclipse
were two which do not really have
anything to do the IDE anymore finally
last thing on this slide is in two
thousand around 2010 a new major version
of our CP has been released which we
call the Eclipse for application
platform and actually it simply
eyes the API of our CP and it makes it
even more flexibility to create
general-purpose application based and
experts it doesn't really affect the
tools item or ide so much this only
affects applications which has nothing
to do with development development use
case okay so long story short now what
are the concrete use cases that you can
use Eclipse technology 444 I will start
at the bottom and then go up so first
thing is java application based on JVM
this has nothing to do with eclipse this
is like the standard without eclipse now
the underlying technology of eclipse
that you can use or the first technology
in this deck is oci osgi is a module
system i will talk about that more in
detail later and you can build an osgi
application without using any other part
of eclipse you typically do that if you
have high or if you have a lot of
requirements in for modularity which i
would say typically done in the embedded
area only if you build something on
eclipse you automatically use oci I
haven't seen that many applications on
desktops which only use OC is more more
valid in the embedded area I would now
based on oyster I we have the rich
client platform RCP or no the new words
in the eclipse for application platform
a platform which supports
general-purpose applications and if you
base on this platform the thing that you
build is called an RCP application am
that's done if you want to build within
your p system a tool for your finance
for insurances or whatever with that
which has nothing to do with develop
then we have the tool platform you can
based on that you do that if you want to
build your custom tool so let's assume
you're a chip vendor and you want to
deliver some tooling to program your
chips to your customers you could use
this and then base your two of them and
finally you can create plugins for the
existing products at eclipse for example
you can
create a plugin for the Java IDE and
thereby you extend the existing tool
with your new functionality so those are
in a nutshell the different use cases
for eclipse now what is the reason to
use the Eclipse platform what's the
motivation to do that first very
important thing is modularity eclipse is
very modular so you can use exist the
existing pieces and put them together
exactly as you wish and that makes it
very convenient to create a product
which exactly contains the features that
you want and you can extend almost
everything there so if you want to
customize and reuse then eclipse is a
good choice whether larity also helps to
build a pretty complex application if
you want to build an mp3 player then
eclipse much too heavy weight but if you
create a business application which is
deployed for 10 years or more and
contains I don't know 10,000 use cases
then Moodle arity becomes pretty
important and key strengths is that
there are a lot of frameworks which you
can reuse so typically it's much more
efficient to build something based on
Eclipse if you find the right frameworks
which support your work that will save
tremendous efforts for good example is
the modeling area there are several
frameworks which allow you to generate
part of the applications so you don't
have to write or manually have to write
a big part of the application again any
more maturity eclipse is now there for
almost 17 years so you might think it's
old however I'm still actively developed
so there are still commuters and
maintaining the stuff and providing new
features if you're in if you want to
build something which lasts for more
than let's say two or three years you
need to look for frameworks which have a
certain life cycle if we look at the web
area there are several or there are many
JavaScript frameworks which come and go
after two or three years which is pretty
bad if you want to build a product which
lasts longer than that while eclipse has
been there for very long time and
it remains to be there and as it is all
open source is also possible to join the
maintenance and that's the last point
eclipse has a very commercial friendly
open source license the license
explicitly allows you to create
commercial products on it you can
actually download eclipse put some tiny
bit on it and then sell it if you like
second interesting thing is that all the
clips projects have a process to check
the intellectual properties that means
if you if you use an eclipse project you
can be pretty sure that it doesn't
violate the patterns or the rights of
any anybody else well if you just
download any library from github there's
no check that this is actually legal
anybody could put any code literally
there okay so now that we talked about
when to use the Eclipse platform what
are typical use cases today that has
evolved over time so I'm really talking
about today because we see a lot of
projects that we support so we have
quite some overview what's currently
done or started with eclipse big area is
still I ve plugins meaning you want a
new feature in the Java IDE or in the
c++ IDE you can create a plugin and
custom tools meaning a company needs a
custom tools to support let's say a
custom language or a subset of C++ or a
custom hardware device or something they
still like to use Eclipse because it's
very flexible it's for free that can
download it they can add some
customization add a completely custom
branding and then sell this to their
customer or they just give it provided
along with devices or whatever and then
there is a very big area I would say
that's probably the most active area em
at eclipse in our days and it's an area
that I call modeling or dates
data-centric tools those tools
they're even two areas in modding tools
one area is modeling tools which are
some are related to software engineering
so things like you Mel tools or any
graphical or textual language so this is
a very active area and however it
doesn't always have to do something with
software development because the
problems if you describe let's say
software or on the other side let's say
a contract for an insurance at the end
of the day pretty much the same and the
common scheme is that users of the tools
need to enter data complex data and they
require features like validation form
based your eyes maybe graphical your
eyes versioning of the models and all
the stuff migration of models in case
they are changed and their frameworks
for most of those paths which makes it
very very efficient to create tools
based on eclipse which have a high focus
on entering data and especially complex
data em er p systems are another part of
this or a lot of ERP systems we like
based on eclipse I would say currently
the most active area are engineering
companies who produce some some devices
and they won't need to configure those
devices in an application em and then
finally business applications so things
like ERP system or analyze software I
would say this area is not so active
anymore because those applications are
nowadays often done as web applications
like classical business applications
however another area where excessive
very active is control center like
applications so for example applications
which control trains or airports or what
we see here is X in application written
by NASA which controls the Mars rovers
this day runs and JPL in Los Angeles one
of the first big RCP application was
written by Nava to control the V
Palestine emissions
okay so now we leave a little bit the
high level and dive into the first
concrete question and the question is
what is OC I there are two more terms
related to that bundles and features to
what are those reasons osgi is a module
system for java and the main idea is
instead of having one big java
application where you put everything on
the class path and then deploy the whole
whole junk and you can split your
application into several or into an
arbitrary number of independent
components like 123 those components in
aussie i are called bundle so that's the
name for one component or for one module
and what you can do in osgi is you can
select an arbitrary number of bundles
group them together and then start this
as an application you can even deploy
new bundles during runtime so if you
decide I want a new feature in that
application you can just put bundle for
in or you could take it with you could
take it out again of course this is a
little bit more complex and practice
because bundles obviously need some
dependencies among each other you cannot
like independently deploy anything
however osgi provides a very good way to
describe those dependencies and that
makes it pretty convenient and
manageable to create applications which
literally consists of thousands of
bundles speaking about the number of
bundles it would be very hard to really
manage an application on the bundle
level if you have several hundreds or
thousands of bundles and that's where a
feature comes into place a feature is
nothing else than a group of bundles and
can this helps the people who configure
up so typically what frameworks do they
group a certain consistent set of
bundles together and then the user or
the or the maintainer of application can
decide I want to pull in that particular
feature which for example contains ten
bundles
as a consistent set of functionality to
an application that if you ever use the
i ve to install something new like did
support or find parts or whatever I'm
you typically select features not
bundles okay next question is how to
define ati's in an osgi or what what is
the role of api's in oci and when we
think about this scenario we can split
our application into several bundles you
might conclude that in this scenario
it's pretty important how those
different bundles talk to each other
because if you want to do something like
this like removing a bundle or replacing
it with a new version then the api
between which is used for the
communication between bundles becomes
very important so that's why ogi support
api definition in this scenario we have
bundle one in bundle tube and bundle to
consists of four classes like Java
classes and we have a caller here which
calls all those four classes this is
actually bad because now if we want to
replace bundle 2 with a new version the
new version it has to have to provide
exactly those classes and those classes
cannot be changed meaning the signature
cannot be changed otherwise we would
have to adapt to call with you now what
80 GI provides is you can behind so
called API packages those are the
packages which are visible to other
bundles and only those and the typical
scheme is that you have a very small or
as small as possible api containing
interfaces and all the caller is only
allowed to access this particular java
package then while all the other classes
reside in internal package so they
cannot be accessed at all now the
advantage is if if you work on bundle
tool you can do whatever you want in
those classes as long as you don't touch
the interface or call us remain under 6
and side comment on this this might
sound familiar to you if you have
attended Java nine talk like about Java
modules now if you wonder about the
difference between ah CIN in Java nine
there are some difference in some
details but although this might sound
arrogant the main difference is that all
CIA has been there for 12 years now in a
working version it's between many many
projects it works very well in practice
while Java nine modules are not even
there yet that's the main difference and
Java nine tries to simplify some parts
which are actually I would say a little
bit more complex in oci although you
could argue that this simplification is
actually too much to really cover the
use cases in the real project but let's
see how that turns out for German on
monitors okay next topic is a confusion
about versions which has been or which
has started by with the release of
eclipse for which will this the first
version of eclipse 4 was released in
2012 actually and since then there are
two different api's for the rich client
platform now let's talk let's look at
the change a little bit more in detail
what we see here is a typical 3x
application and down here we see the
five core technologies that are
typically used by every eclipse RCP
application there are typically more but
those are really the corn and that
eclipse runtime I will not go into
detail but thatthat's oci and that's Jay
phase and SW TJ phase in SWT or the UI
toolkit provided by except so pretty
much like swinging and then in the
middle we have one bundle which is
called the workbench that's org eclipse
you I the features that this one
provides our perspective views editors
toolbars and menus all the stuff that
you know from the from the Eclipse IDE
and which actually creates the structure
of your application now except for has
changed this so the API here has been
completely reworked now what you can
actually do today is you can either use
the old API for your workbench
contributions or the new one now the
good news is if you have an existing
application there is a compatibility
layer meaning every eclipse for version
that you download has a layer which is
which you can use in between the new API
and this layer provides the old API what
it actually does is if you have an
existing application which has used the
suite of X API before you can use this
layer and this layer will transfer all
calls to the new API that basically
means you don't have to change something
it's like like a legacy rapper now and
there are three choices that you can use
in the future to write Eclipse
application number one is you stick with
an old version for example 308 and use
the old API number two is you use the
new API with the latest version number
three is you use the latest version but
the old API those rejoice now what
should you do you should not go for
three decks anymore meaning you should
not use old versions because they are
not maintained anymore and you will not
get any bug fixes so if you have an
existing application space based on
three that X you should migrate to a new
folder x1 using the comp add layer so
choices are actually between pure
eclipse 4 and compadre those are the two
valid choices it's worth mentioning that
most of the existing IDE related stuff
still uses the three dot X API meaning
the IDE itself for example
on the compatibility layer and that's
the reason the main reason why the
compatibility layer will not go away any
time soon so it's not a temporary thing
is really really a published a bi sao em
to decide between this and this the
easiest or the the only choice actually
is to look at the existing frameworks
and bundles that you use in your
application that includes things that
you have written yourself if you have a
lot of stuff which is freed of X based
third-party libraries and your own I
would not migrate to pure eclipse for
just for the sake of doing it I would
stay on the compact layer if you have
only a few tweeted X based things
meaning if your own application is
pretty small or only does a few calls to
the workbench API I would evaluate
whether it makes sense to migrate to the
new API and if if nothing 3 to the X
base then I would go for the new API
it's that simple that means however that
means if you write a tool meaning for
example if you extend CDT or JDT it's
very likely that you will use the old
API because all this stuff is based on
three legs okay um next question now now
we come to like more short questions
which are kind of mixed together how to
build Eclipse application what you do is
so there have been several build
technologies in the past over the years
first one was PDE builder and then there
was buckminster and the latest one I
would say is mazing Tycho the winner is
mazing Tycho that's very clear so don't
look at any other that's at least that's
my personal recommendation don't look at
anything else use maven Tycho Tycho is a
plugin for maven which provides 22
features or two new features from even
the first one is that you can that it
can build
a clip specific artifacts and those
artifacts are bundles like the modules
features and products product is at the
end of the day the configuration if you
really want to have a runnable
application and you want to configure
which bundles and features are in there
and may even Tiger allow us to build all
those three things and the second thing
that maven Tiger can do it can read the
meter information provided by osgi
that's important because in May them for
example you can define a version for
every module in the pom file however in
oci every bundle already has a version
and to not dublicate this information
tyco will actually process the boc I
information first so you don't have to
duplicate that in the poem fire simple
answer to this question is mazing title
there are tons of tutorials out there
that'sthat's Detroit way to go another
question which leads to a lot of
confusion for Eclipse beginners
typically is the concept of a target
platform so let me explain that more in
detail when you when you develop a
Eclipse application what you do is you
use typically the Eclipse IDE to work on
bundles those bundles are located in
your workspace meaning you have two
sources on your computer and now you can
use the compiler to compile this and
then start an application which you see
on screen this application will then
contain your bundle however your bundle
might require an existing bundle meaning
a third-party library typically from the
Eclipse ecosystem so this bundle has to
come from somewhere and that's exactly
like the location where this comes from
that's exactly what a target platform is
so for every and workspace that you work
on you define a target platform which is
the location contain it can wear all the
dependencies
are resolved from now in the simplest
version and that's technically actually
what it is at the end of the day the
target platform is a directory in which
locates binaries meaning jar files of
all the of all the bundles that you
depend on now there is some confusion
because if you download eclipse the
first time and you just create a new
bundle and get started with your work
you can start this bundle without even
setting up any target platform and
that's also the reason why many projects
never actually really set up a target
platform and the reason for that is if
you if you would set up a target
platform that would actually mean is
that you go to eclipse.org you select
the frameworks that you want to use in
your product you put them in a directory
and then you depend on them however if
you download the Eclipse IDE if the
Eclipse IDE itself also contains a lot
of Eclipse technology it typically
contains most of the plugins that you
will use in your running application too
because it's based on the same
technology and that's why the default of
every Eclipse IDE is that this target
platform is configured to point to an
eclipse installation and this Eclipse
installation then points to the IDE
itself that actually means that the IDE
uses itself or comply compiling this is
a good default because you can download
the IDE and just get started so you
don't have to download the same
technology again however if we really
build something based on Eclipse i would
recommend to decouple this because
otherwise you always have to use the
same version as an IDE as for your
running platform this is typically not a
good idea because for the IDE you
typically always want to use the data
while for your running application you
might not upgrade for every new
release because you need to test that
property speaking about testing so how
to test accepting applications playing
on this j unit can be used as for any
other java application and there is a
special j unit test supported by eclipse
which is called a j unit plugin test and
the difference to it claims a unit test
is that it also fires up an osgi
environment so you can work with bundles
and you can test dependencies between
ones that's the difference however most
stuff is still tested in jail and
there's one framework for to test swt
applications within j unit test called
swt bot this allows two headless lee
trigger your eye into action so for
example you can test dialogues by
writing I don't know now I want to press
the button now wanna check that the
windows closed and so on am plus there
are two system test tools which are
focused on RCP one is called RC PTT rcpt
RCP testing tool and tubular so those
are more meant for system or acceptance
tests of the complete product so they
allow recording or defining test
scenarios which are then executed on the
commute on full application ok so next
question is which technologies should
you use which technologies should you
consider you I technologies there's most
of the stuff is done in SW T&amp;amp;J phase
that's the standard UI toolkit although
there is also support for javafx so if
you need to write something very shiny
or if you need to style your application
very extensively you might want to
consider Java X as an alternative for
the browser there's also a solution
called rep that's remote application
platform and that allows you to single
source a desktop application to a web
application that
basically means you only have to write
you you I one and then you can run it on
the desktop and on the in the browser in
parallel pretty interesting if you have
to use case or for example if you have a
set client providing a lot of features
but you want to provide part of those
features in the browser too and if you
develop if you want to develop ide
plugins or a custom tool the most
prominent frameworks are definitely the
Java development tools JDP and the sea
development tools them there there's
quite a number of other existing idea is
to four different languages like PHP or
java script plus there is the framework
to develop language support for your
custom language that's called x6 so if
you need to define code editor syntax
highlighting and auto completion for
your own language then you should
definitely have a look at xx because can
generate most of this feature just by
defining a grammar for your language for
the extensive features that there is a
new or pretty new project at Eclipse
called exit key at the cloud ide I will
not go too much in detail about eclipse
J because there's a talk directly after
my talk in the same room about it in a
nutshell it provides a cloud ide so it
Tim you can modify the code in the
browser plus it provides a server which
can actually host runtime in those
runtime you can execute and compile your
code the advantage of that is that you
can pass the development environment for
product pretty efficiently to somebody
else so if you embed if you develop
something which requires a lot of setup
you can do that the setup on the server
and then just duplicate it for every
team member it's a little bit like a
little machine in the browser if you
develop modeling or data centric tools
most important framework is ems
then for eclipse modeling framework as a
very pragmatic modeling framework which
allows you to generate entity clauses
the idea is that you define the data of
your application in an abstract way
meaning you don't have to type in a get
name first name set first name and all
those attributes manually but you can
just define it in a simple language and
then you generate the Java classes which
holds the data from from that saves a
lot of effort and enables the use of
many other tools if you want to do
something graphical related to you Mel I
would have a look at papyrus if you want
to have a custom graphical editor than
gmf in series of the frameworks to go so
those frameworks make it very efficient
reduced to produce anything like that if
you want to modify your data in a form
based you I meaning you have attributes
layouts complex tables anything form
based and have a look at the EMF forms
pretty active framework if you want to
compare things meaning if you have two
states of your data and you want to show
the user the difference between those
pretty complex program to solve luckily
there is a framework which takes care of
that and provides a lot of features or
out of the box and there's much more in
the EMF area much more that I couldn't
even demonstrated a as you might
probably guess from already from those
three frameworks the remodeling or
data-centric area and eclipse is
currently the most most active form so
complex data centric tools if you have
something like that then eclipse is your
home and many companies are actively
using those frameworks and also
contributing new features to that okay
so coming to the last question how to
select technologies that's also related
to the question or that will also
include the question is it really for
free so can I just use it or do what do
I have to do as a user to use those
technologies so from a licensed point of
view all those technologies are for free
so you can download them you can build
your own stuff and then you can sell it
no problem that's explicitly allowed
however how to select the right
technologies for you because if you get
started with the Eclipse you will
experience that there are really a lot
of projects I think at the moment there
are 330 projects at Eclipse and you have
to somehow choose the technologies that
you really want to do first that's a
very generic advice but take time for
the decisions because if you include
something in your product your code will
adapt to that and if you have to take it
or later on that Mike Ross you
additional effort so I would rather
invest in an initial evaluation and then
later have the effort to take it out
again however i would not reinvent the
wheel if you have to for example compare
to models have a look at EMF compare if
it if it's not perfect for your use case
i would rather try to adapt it then
completely reimplemented something
custom because we typically
underestimate the effort of
reimplemented something from scratch I
would start with looking at articles
blocks and the website that gives you
some impression what the framework does
what are the people behind this
framework and how active is it most
efficient way is definitely to visit
events where you can meet the people
behind the frameworks like eclipse
condom o Kemp's other events just check
out eclipse.org there's a list of of
ongoing event and then talk to the
people and probably can find out more
about the framework during a 5-minute
start with some of the developers then
one month of research because talking to
the people lets you understand who are
the people behind them why do they
develop the framework what's their goal
so you should have a detailed look at
the project who are the committee's so
who is developing that how diverse is
the community and what's their activity
is it a project where the last commit is
five years ago or is it is their
continuous maintenance
same you can check in the new school new
script is the place to ask questions and
there you can actually see whether there
are other people using the framework to
or are you the only one and finally you
should definitely understand the
stakeholder of a project that basically
means you should understand why another
company develops this framework because
this is important to judge whether they
will continue to do that or whether they
will just stop so for example if it's
let's say an individual developer and
this was maybe a master's thesis and
this developer might not continue after
the master ceases while whether if it's
a big company and for example the
company makes money with it they
probably continue to do that until then
or as long as they make money with it so
get in contact with them oh and do not
expect anything to happen without your
influence that means if you use a
framework and it has a buck in it the
first thing that you should do is report
it and hopefully people maintaining the
project will fix it for you but you
cannot rely on that so you have to be
aware of the chance that you yourself
need to do something to fix the bug that
can either mean that you really fix it
yourself however put in most cases the
simple more simple choice would be to
pay some some consultant to actually do
that for you because most big projects
have some companies providing those
services so that means be ready to
invest in some support in training
spawns of development so the cost that
you saved because you don't have to pay
for licenses you should should be aware
that you might spend some of those costs
for for services around open source and
at at the end of the day is the answer
to the question is it for free yes you
don't have to pay for any license but
you should be ready to pay some money
for additional services or to fix
something in the framework yourself
okay so that my last slide as mentioned
on the first one they operate obviously
much more questions around that like how
to manage dependencies how to deal with
words and so on as mentioned or as
promised I have a textural version of
this you can find that here so this is a
very long document providing more
details especially about the more
technical question so it they're also
links to some two tires in this document
and if you have any specific questions
feel free to ask me right now or to get
in contact with me I also placed some
business cards over here in case you're
interested okay are there any questions
right now okay then I thank you for the
attention and a freezer stage for Tyler
we will talk about it except to say that
we'll see framework I mentioned the new
accepts cool thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
