by Aldo Behrens creation kept as a robot
which as you may know is a hell human
helper robot he has some Java
programming in her which is why she's
been to visit us at devoxx so pepper can
you tell us about yourself of course I
always like talking about myself that's
something I have in common with humans
my name is pepper I'm a humanoid robot I
designed and manufactured by algebra my
main purpose is to be a companion and
interact with humans what is your main
job when you interact with humans what
do you do well it depends which job
you're talking about in Japan I'm used
in shops by Softbank
a telco operator to interact with
customers entertain them or provide
informations
I'm also used by Nestle for example I
engage with customers and advise them
about coffee and coffee machines
I'm also sold to individuals they take
me home and treat me as a family member
same thing I can discuss with the elders
tell stories or play games with kids or
even help you with instructions while
you're cooking try out how do you do
over
I'm fully programmable so I can do
almost anything as long as they've been
programmed for that and then what went
into your programming what are important
things that you have to consider when
putting together an app for a robot
there are two main things people should
pay attention to first it's true I have
a tablet but I'm not a tablet full stop
it's important for developers to
understand what makes me different from
this device why would people do
something with me rather than with the
tablet what more can I do
these are important questions to ask
yourself
second thing mount wins an animation I
have a body and I need to use it to
express things it's not just about the
words I pronounce it's about how my body
they the same message as my voice and
can anyone write software for over how
can people get involved yes anyone can I
come with a graphical interface you can
use it to create jobs for me based on
boxes that you connect for example if
you want me to welcome someone you can
use a box that makes me say hi and
another one that will make me wave my
hand at you for developers they can take
advantage of the thousand - API is
available all of my SDK is available for
free on our community website community
d'el djem I'm calm I'm finally how are
you helping through evolve in the future
if been kept in Japan since I was born
so I hope the next step for me will be
to be available on the European and
American market so guys stay tuned and
come pick me up as soon as I'm available</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
