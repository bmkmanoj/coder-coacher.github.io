a swing from a commuter I work at
pivotal and I'm also an organization
organizer of the mix it conference which
take place in France in neon in appeal
and today we are going to talk about why
Spring left cotton and how you can build
spring application using this language
currents most popular way to build web
application is using spring but--one and
and java and today we are going to see
how far we can go
using spring boot 2 which has been
released quite recently and uncut in
last year I announced the curtain
officials report in spring 5 and we get
a lot of a lot of good feedbacks a lot
of people interested and we have
continued since to work on that reports
to polish it and I'm going to present it
to you today what we are going to see
today is based on a real project which
is sprinkle in deep dive you can see the
source code on github it's it's a blog
posts built with spring wood - and
cotton so feel free to have a look to
the to the source code if you want to to
get a deeper understanding on what
occurs you will see that there is
various branches step 1 step 2 step 3
step 4 and you can see the value step of
the migration from spring boot and Java
to to spring boot to encoding so for the
first step we are going to switch from
Java to clean without using any spring
cuddliness report specifically but just
just changing the language in the second
step we are going to migrate from spring
boot one to spring good - which is based
on swing from Mach 5 which you bought
native liquor clean then we are going to
switch from spring MVC
to spring waveflex so that's perfectly
fine to use spring MVC for your project
if you don't need a non-blocking
reactive runtime but we will see that
spring web reacts open new capabilities
and we are going to explore that and at
the end we are going to switch from the
regular annotation based programming
model that you are likely to already
know to the new functional API Anza
Kathleen DSL so step one from Java to
Kathleen the easiest way to start a new
spring boot project with whisker tree
needs to go to start the spring dot IO
you can see that there is a special URL
that will automatically select cutting
language by default or you can select it
in in the combo box in this slide ads at
the left you have at yeah at the left
you have the cut line code and at the
right you have the Java code you can see
that cutting code is much shorter so
that's not much about writing code
because you all have IDs that allowed to
write code quite fast with automatically
automatic generation of Gator setters
but when the time comes to read this
code and to debug it I think the signal
and noise ratio of the gotten code is
much better so in this code link code
you can see that we are using data
classes so the data keyword means that
you automatically generate two string
equals ash code you can see short
notation to declare at the same time the
constructor and the property's Miller to
what you have in scalar value mean
that's immutable so usually cut in favor
and immutable based usage much more and
Angela
so values for immutable and val is for
me table you still use the same
annotation so in that case that's spring
data MongoDB annotations
you can provide some default values for
you
optional parameter so usually I put this
kind of parameter at the end that means
that you can create an article without
specifying the dates and it will
automatically set the date to know if
you don't specify it that avoid too
overloaded version of the constructor
and so much much shorter code easier to
to maintain so that just for fun but you
can use emoji new test names and
globally you can use real sentences that
provide a more meaningful test name that
is a usually camelcase notation so when
you use backticks
I usually use that for my test not that
much for my prediction code but for
tests I think that's quite quite useful
that's regular spring MVC controller
written in Java so nothing surprising it
is annotated with Atlas controller it
will usually be used with to produce
reason for example XML you can see that
we are using implicit auto wired as of
spring Kanak 54.3 if you have a single
constructor it will be parameters of
this constructor will be automatically
over yet so that's like if the
constructor was annotated with auto
layout so user repository is injected
and I get my pinning post mapping etc
aliases to request mapping annotation
and they specify the HTTP method so here
is a cut in version so you can see that
it's it shorter we use the same
constructor based property declaration
by default the property are public so
here we use private because we don't
want to expose directly the user
repository
you can see that God lien provide a
short notation for one-liner functions
that's leverage type inference so in
fact this code is a statically typed as
this record this is not like dynamic
languages fine one as return type but it
will be it will automatically take the
return type of a repo that fine one and
that will be inferred by the compiler
you can if you want if you prefer
specific specifies a return type
explicitly that's possible but it's it's
up to you and usually in my code that I
wrote to repeat an information that the
compiler can automatically infer that
said it could be useful to see the
return type for debugging purpose of
code review so in ID you have a sitting
that is not enabled by default but you
can show a function property on local
value read on type means that way
IntelliJ IDEA will automatically show
you Cynthia type a little bit like you
have a parameter names type int in in ID
so feel free to enable that I enable
that in all my projects because that's
allowed to to clearly view what are what
are the return types when we started to
build spring project with curtains there
was some glitches one of the glitch was
that could clean by default in encoding
by default classes are final so we had
to use open keywords to make them open
and open classes and methods are usually
needed for add configuration classes for
example or transaction emphasis because
spring with usually extended at runtime
and if the class is final that that
don't work so we discussed with the
cut-in team and we ended up they ended
up to provide a cut in spring plugin
which will automatically open every
spring annotated classes so
as with this plug-in enabled enable at
maven or greater level as soon as you
have a configuration our control at
controller at async related classes or
method will be automatically open and
that'll you to don't care about that and
just use the default behavior and avoid
to have this more verbose cut in version
so with something important that this
plug-in is automatically configure
configured when you generate you project
and start the spring that IO so you
don't have Ritu to care about that it
isn't automatically provided now boot to
so spring boot to has been released a
few days ago after a long
milah stone and release candidates phase
so it's quite polished and kudos to the
spring boot team which has done a huge
work to provide values features like
integrating all the new web flags
infrastructure providing content reports
and I use other things noticed that
there has been a lot of work or so and
start the spring data aside for cutting
support to provide for example Jackson
Kirkland module automatically so every
kind of things that make your cutting
experience smooth from the start and
yeah that was a long journey but
currently we have with boot spring boot
- we have official gotten reports and to
end in values part of the Spring
Framework of the spring projects so when
I say that spring of Kirkland and Office
report it's that means that there is cut
in support deep into spring from work
5.0 that has been released a few months
ago but also in other
projectors a spring portfolio like
reactor core 3.1 spring data Kay and
spring boot to that oh and support is
coming in other parts of the spring
portfolio curtains report is provided
out-of-the-box that means we don't
provide some kind of spring - got Linda
jar
module captain bytecode is directly
provided into Spring Framework spring
data and spring boots just when you are
using Java projects are just not used
but as soon as you use go clean as they
are used and that's a very thin layer of
functionality on top of the Java ones
because one of the curtains key point is
that it's it has a very good job until
operability so good in api is basically
java 1 plus values gatlin extensions and
other things there is an official
documentation so reference and API
documentation in both framework in
spring but-- so feel free to ever looks
this is quite quite detailed and you it
would provide you every kind of
information you need so we spring
but--one when you want to run an
application with cotton you had to use
this kind of syntax so application
semicolon semicolon class that Java is
to be able to get the Java class from
the cotton one so that was not super
dramatic so in spring boot - we provide
a real application top level function
that are you to specify directly the
application to to run so the class
should be for vacation I need to fix
that slide and it also provide use it is
a possibility to decay additional beans
like in Java here we also take advantage
of the type II friends and the real
application provides your sauce a
possibility to to customize the
generated application with this kind of
syntax another feature that we provide
is to leverage refight type parameters
so in in Java there is a the type of
ratio issue that make the generic types
lost at at runtime and sometimes for
example when we want
get lists with rest on plate it's it's
forced to use not so nice in tax to be
able to specify that that's a list of
article so you have to use this quite
quickly new parameterize types reference
with the generic types and with wizkid
Lynn we are able to provide the same
kind of functionality but with a very
nice recent tax and that's done by
providing an extensions that means that
with cutting extensions we can add cut
clean specific functions number
functions to existing type so in this
example we provide an exchange extension
to rest operations which is interface
behind rest on plate and we provide
basically analyst to provide the beta
syntax and Kathleen provide extensions
for the wall Java JDK so on string on
various various classes so that's a very
useful mechanism that we provide to
enrich current spring API with
scheduling specific features another
very useful feature is of cutting is new
safety
so in Java nothing isn't thought at type
system so new safety is a kind of
dynamic aspect of Java since we don't
specify it in our API there is no check
at compile time but there is no point of
exception at runtime when we forget to
do some tests and we can use optional
but optional is not usable everywhere I
mainly use able for written values it
does performance impact if you use for
the internal implementation of your
classes it's not a good fit with
parameters so optional is is not an
Universal answer and so in Kirkland
there is various type of developers some
some developers are really a very
functional and prefer to use
optional light type but the majority of
developers in Kirkland are using
the fact that new safety is explicit in
Kathleen so by default the type is not
readable and you have to add a question
mark at the end to specify that new
label and that provides full check at
compile time no no pointer exception and
functional constructs are provided a new
label values that's a law to use new
liberal values to two significant that
when you could provide the value or not
so it's it's not a bad thing in Kirkland
to use new label values it could be used
as a clever way to two significant that
something will or not return a value
that spring from our can spring boot and
spring data in Java and so when you use
a Java API with Kotlin basically
Kathleen has no information about the
types the new safety of the Java API and
he could interpret Java types as as
platform types so the nobility is
unknown that with this exclamation mark
and yeah and basically with that you can
still have nine point two exceptions so
when you are using your libraries and
you are using libraries in various parts
of your code so what we have done we
have worked with JetBrains quite a lot
to provide new safety annotation so we
have annotated the wall spring for mark
and spring that a code base
to provide new safety annotation of all
our IP is by default we set the default
to none new at package level and we
specify new label written values or
parameters with add new label
annotations and with this dash x GS f u5
equal strict compiler flag which is
enabled by default on status ping the
Deo Kathleen will automatically leverage
this information to infernal ability of
course in area of spring API that means
that when you are using our rest
operation methods
Kathleen know for sure if something
could
Oh nuts and concretely that means that
where you are using spring AOP I always
cut in with this track you have no risk
anymore to have new motor exception
because that will be catch before with
the compiler if you don't do the related
check it will be in red and you will
have to to write some code to to deal
with that so that's I think that's
that's one of the major feature spring
boot does not spring boot too does not
use that for its own API but I think it
will be the case into that one we still
have to work on that but for the wall
spring framework and spring data they
are notated and they provide you a nurse
safe API we are so leveraged continue
label information to determine request
program and auto why are required
attributes so that's an attribute that
you have to set in Java explicitly to
make a request program of chanel for
example and with spring boot two and
spring for mod 5 we will automatically
leverage the nurse if T's need ability
of a parameter to know if the required
parameter of the annotation should be
set to four so true so if in this bath
annotated request program its new label
that means that required is
automatically set to false and it's also
usable for injection so when you have
full nan new label food that means that
have been of type who need to be
presence in your application context and
if bin is new label it's optional that
means that if the bin of the bar is not
present in the application context
new will be injected and there will be
no error hasta at startup
so that's leveraging the Kirkland type
system to provide automatically
information to to to spring existing
notions some words about testing so you
can totally use the unit for for testing
you
got in God and there is various cutting
testing libraries but I usually prefer
to use the unit 5 which is reported by
Springwood to not enabled by default so
take care about excluding spring unit 4
and importing Genie Drive you will have
more information in the reference
documentation but what is interesting
with unit 5 is that it supports a
non-static before all after all that's
same that before class after class from
unit 4 and unit for on this reports
static method for that and that's not a
very good fit with got clean because God
clean don't have directly static methods
report to have companion object which is
kind of the same thing but the syntax is
more verbose and that's not super
dramatic so by using unit 5 and enabling
the bear class lifecycle lateral to
instantiate a class just one time and
then run multiple tests then you can use
a non-static before all and after all
annotated method and that's a pretty
good fit with Wisco clean that's a
similar feature that destiny has for for
four years so yeah feel free to use to
use that and to configure as a per class
lifecycle which you need five encoding
also an interesting feature of JUnit 5
is that it's report constructor base
injection and that's a good fit because
with Kirkland since kirtland deal with
no safety natively when you are when you
have separate installation of your class
and initialization of your properties
basically you have to use new label
variables or late in its latent
variables in your tests and your in your
classes and that's not super dramatic if
you are directly using constructor based
annotation injection and I usually
advise to use Cocteau base injection you
can directly use immutable values and
that's that's perfect so you can use
constructor base injection which unit
five so feel free to use it that's a
good fit with wiskirchen now we are
going to talk about Webb flux so spring
for Mach five introduced a new web stack
which is playing web flat which is non
working and based on reactive streams in
addition to spring MVC which is blocking
and based on servlet so blocking is not
a bad thing
spring MVC is still supported not
deprecated at all and still usable for a
lot of use cases but when you need to go
the extra mile in terms of scalability
in terms of streaming when you request a
lot of remote services with latency
that's something that scaled better
because you don't have when request
again one thread and so you are able to
to deal more efficiently with streaming
use cases and scale better when you have
a lot of concurrent requests so you have
basically two parallel stacks the
servlet one which is based on the add
controller programming model based on
servlet containers like Tomcat and GT
and you have the new reactive stack
spring well flux which allowed to use
neuron times like Nietzsche another and
auto without using any separate API
which is based which it still reuse a
ton for a programming model but also
provide a functional endpoint poly model
that we are going to see at the end and
provide a reactive client so web
flagship all values non-working ap is
the ones provided with Java like
compatible future alpha publisher Eric
Java reactor and you can use any library
that supports rocky streams like
occurring and others
internally we are using reactive streams
and reactor but you can really use one
that you want in this example I'm going
to use a rector for father for the
pupils so reactor provide to two main
array of types mono which is a rectified
for zero to one elements that's the kind
of relief from Iraqi future
and that's what is a bit like computable
feature and flux is for reactive
collection and streams that's similar to
flowable or observable for every java
and both based on reactive streams and
provider a wide range of operators that
allow you to to transform the data so
using spring reflex with annotation is
quite similar to in terms of annotation
and poly model to spring MVC you still
use atlas controller at get mapping but
you see that types used our non-working
types so compatible future mono Flags
observable flowable etc and so that's
interesting to notice that that's usable
only if you CPI that you are using uses
non-breaking types that means that you
are likely to use bring that K R active
support for MongoDB Redis Cassandra
HBase you can also use the reactive
client web client which provide the Flex
and mono you can use any kind of library
that written non-breaking types if you
are using booking types that will work
but with bad care ability so that's not
something we advise to to do notice that
if the programming model is similar the
implementation will be quite different
because reactive api's means using
functional programming so instead of
writing imperative code with different
lines that you do use usually you will
write functional codes like that by
chaining all the other steps so that's
quite different implementation so even
if the annotation look like the same the
implementation will be quite quite
different
we provide cut extensions for rect or
for example it's allow us to add too
many methods to every kind of objects
notice that extensions need to be
imported that's a little bit like static
imports so it's not something that come
magically into your code you have to
they have to be present in the class
pass and then you have to import
explicitly
static imports to to use them usually it
does a pretty good job to to provide you
some install them easily notice also
that for example the last example with
we have an extensions with which is
called reactor mathematic extensions and
since flux is some type that we can't
extend in Java we have to provide matte
flags that have a vegetable and the nice
thing with curtain extension is that we
can directly add another edge operator
to to the Flex type and it will be
unavailable and flux of numbers so you
can also restrict extensions to make
them usable only on the specific dynamic
types and now we are going to secretly
in DSL and functionary PI so this is web
flex functional API with cut in DSL so
web flex provide in addition to the
annotation based programming model we
provide a functional API that is similar
to what you have in other technology and
other frameworks
so that's lambda based programming model
which allow you to to write your routes
not without annotation at request
mapping annotation I usually but using a
kind of DSL
so that's available in Java but that's
quite verbose but with Scotland that
provide us a way to to write a nice
syntax like that so you can see that I
specifies the media type text HTML then
with the nest operator I provide nested
routes so / will render index so you can
see that it supports template rendering
that's not only about Jesus and XML
support etc but that also about the
patron during which support also
server-sent events and regular JSON and
XML so that's just another way to write
your code in this example I have mixed
that's a very simple example where I
have me
in the same place roots and the unless
implementation that in real life and
concrete project you wish you will
usually separate both roots and others
so in this example which is integrated
in spring boots application you see that
I'm using the rooted ASL to declare
values endpoints for a reason for
notification with server-sent events and
with exam with HTML and we use method
references to just point to the on layer
that will be called ok so the nice thing
with this syntax is that I think it's
quite readable and it gives you the
power to choose a greater granularity of
your roots with with annotations you
have all your roots spread into all you
controller classes so it's not always
easy to have a global view of that and
that's where spring boot actuators help
here you can decide to put all your
roots in the single monolithic rotor or
you can also provide many Reuters
provided in Raja you you you choose how
you group your human you mappings on the
unrest side you see that you will inject
services or repository and then on the
other adjusts functions okay that take
several requests as input and return
mono of several response so a kind of
future of promise of several response we
provide an API to make it easy to render
specific templates render design call
server sent events and you will use
repositories and services that you are
injected into your nose and that's
regular regular components so what are
remaining pinpoints we would like to fix
I think we have a currently a really
good level of caffeine support so there
is no big blockers
we have been polished that for years now
we had a lot of feedbacks and I really
think that's usable in production for
your project whispering good - but there
are a few pain points and the first one
is immutable configuration properties
with spring boot - that oh you have to
use late in it valve to use
configuration properties because
configuration properties does not
support classes with immutable values
for now that could be the case maybe for
spring boot to that one we are going to
work on that but currently it is not
reported so you will have to use this
late in it validation to make it
possible for spring boot - instance yet
for properties and then in a second time
to populate the properties but that will
be much cleaner to have immutable values
because usually your properties won't
change at runtime and also to support
data classes with the short notation so
we are going to work on that for the
next version I think with the lady need
Varrick it's it's quite quite usable and
we have big project using that and
that's perfectly fine so that's just
something to have - - - no more annoying
issue is web test client so web client
is a new rekt chief API that we provide
in spring for Mach 5 and it's usable in
that's basically replacement for
restaurant plates with a few end API and
that's usable even in you spring MVC
project so when you do spring boot -
please please you do what you want but I
advise you to use web client and not
restaurant late it's much more powerful
and usable in other cases but the
testing reaction which provides some
kind of mock MVC functionalities which
is web test clients is sometimes a new
new table with Kathleen due to a type
inference issue so you have the
reference of the curtain issue
curtain team is aware of that and they
may fix
that in curtain 1.3 with a flag but it
should be fixed in wonderfully with a
flag and 1.4 without a flag so yeah
fingers crossed to to make that fixed
for now just use web Italians in Killeen
or if you are blocked use web desk
Alliant in Reggio test in Java for that
but in my project I prefer to use web
client in encouraging another
interesting point is guru teens so I
consider coroutines
as an additional way to provide to
expose non-blocking features from war
flags so we can see as an additional
additional support there is a project
community project done by Konrad
Kavinsky which has a very good job so
that's not supported natively by spring
for now but there is a very good quality
project which we bought it so coroutine
recognized by threads they allowed non
blocking imperative code there are less
powerful than regular pile in terms of
decree shows trimming or burritos but
they provided a nice syntax especially
for a single value single asynchronous
values so this if you want to use that
with spring boot to use the spring
Catlin coroutine project be aware that
coroutine a still experimental
and we are currently working on that and
experimenting about about that
concretely in terms of interoperability
when you have a single and synchronous
value which is mono compatibility or
suffering when you are using co-routines
you will call a responsible function
that will return tea or new level of tea
so you see that for single values that
allowed to remove the wrapper and writes
code that like if it was imperative code
so that could be seen as an advantage
for for simplest case for a synchronous
collection mono have listed something
translate to suspend able function that
return a list of something
for streaming you have to provide a
special type so here there is no magic
instead of freaks of T you will use
receive channel of T and for a scene
completion you will just return use a
suspender belt function that returns
nothing so there is a step 3 - KU
routine branch in my spring cooking
dip-dye life project that show an
example of the project whisker routines
so you will see that the code is quite
close of the spring MVC version and not
of the spring my first reaction because
that basically allow you to write to use
to leverage the non-breaking runtime but
with more imperative style syntax so
that works quite well for I think rules
values when you are doing a lot of
streaming and thing like that I think
it's the advantage is less clear but
yeah that's wrong that's something was
to to to to try butis functional bean
DSL so spring from our 5 introduced
function urban definition it's a very
efficient way to declare your bins with
no reflection necessary proxies it's
using lambdas instead of annotations and
it's both decorative and programmatic so
functional bin definition with the cut
India series like that so in spring from
Alpha we have to DSS we try to not
provide too much DSL we have the Rooter
one that we have seen before and here is
the bins one and it told you to declare
bins with this kind of syntax which is
cut in code so that's a kind of
trade-off between Jerry config and XML
or Yamaha team thing like that
you can provides any kind of customized
condition because that's code so you can
use something that we provide by default
for example we provide an avi remote air
/
but you can use every kind of Cousteau
conditions to register your bins and
yeah that's that's pretty interesting
you can also use both DSL together so
bin spruce root or DSL feet were
together so in that in that one I'm
using the bins DSL and inside the bins
the SA I'm using the Rooter DSL to
declare various routes so you can see
that's another way to to build your
application context and yeah that's
something that could be that could be
interesting
currently it's possible to use it into
spring boots but that's not there is no
first-class report so you have to plug
it manually you can go to this issue
that will explain you the detail but
maybe later we will work on some more
proper integration to allow you to
declare you or your bins with this kind
of GSL you see that in Kirkland DSS are
more dramatic than annotations so we try
to provide to expose our programming
model we've gotten DSL to to provide
more flexibility more power and the last
part of my presentation is about
multi-platform support so Colinas
first-class Trivium shabbat and that's
what we have talked about today we
provide first class for first class
support for code of forked lean on we'd
also provide first class support as a
non spiked by Google a few months ago
but we have also Curtin provide support
for JavaScript so you can write
front-end project in Kirkland that
sounds transpired to the west crypt and
there is a circuit in AD which also to
allow to use code clean without any
VM with the LLVM tution
but just be aware something that's not
you will not write the same projects and
compare it to JVM JavaScript or native
you will use the same language but the
libraries that you are using as a super
difference so it's not about writing
something once and run it everywhere
it's using the same language but taking
accounts that the ecosystem is different
so for example in cognitive
you will use you will not use Jackson
to cellulous reason you would use native
seed library that has binding to
Kirkland ad that's that's difference
compared to other technology so you can
use cutting for front end today with
cutting GES this was the this is your
original your JavaScript code from a
deep life project it's a lot who to show
notification when the when there is a
new blog post period so this is the
JavaScript version this is a cotton
version so the opposite is is the same
but the nice point is that you you have
also gotten features of type safety note
safety I need 10 kilobytes with dead
code animation tool that's the code that
is quite similar to death grip for
example but if you want to write all
your project with a single language that
could be interesting but for the long
term I really believe in a web based on
this report
so web assembly is a is a technology
that allowed to run sandbox native
platform for the web without any plug-in
involved that's pushed by the w3c you
can see this very good introduction to
web based on V by link lat from Mozilla
if you don't know the technology and so
cut cleans report webassembly
it's it's experimental vehicle in native
because LLVM tution can generate web
assembly code and that could be a better
computation target than JavaScript
because that's a proper bytecode its bit
for performance for low memory usage the
risk currently some showstopper at least
for a will real production grades usage
so dome API and garbage collector are
not available yet but are coming but for
for the long term that could be a nice a
nice platform and cut in native front an
ecosystem could could arise so that's
something to to to have a look for the
for the future notice I think one of the
key strengths of Kathleen is that it
allowed to share code between platform
so you have multiple from data types and
sorry section that
becoming and maybe we will support that
in spring that's not not yet available
so I don't know that the idea is to be
able to write some part of your code
that is multi-platform so the same for
JavaScript DVM and native and you will
provide some implementation that's our
platform specific so basically the idea
is to provide 80% of shared code and you
will only provide the implementation
that are platform-specific so that's the
initial support is provided with code in
1.2 I think it will take some time to
mature the libraries and thing like that
but that's that's an interesting point
too to follow that's that's all for
today you can never look to the slide on
speaker deck you can follow me and s
dollars for fresh spring and continues I
have built this last year various
applications based on spring and
Kathleen so feel free to have a look to
the mix it conference website which is a
real non demo project based on the stuff
that I have showed today spring curtain
full stack which is a project with
cutting use for both front end and back
end spring cutting dip dye which is
project behind this presentation and
spring cotton functional which is a pure
spring for Mach five functional epi
beans and water without directly usable
in standard mode without spring wood
thanks for your attention and if you
have some question we can discuss after
after the talk Thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
