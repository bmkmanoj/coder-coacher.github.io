and thanks for joining after three days
a lot of information I am sure that you
guys already over fruit that like so
when I saw the video then I actually
reduce my session because after three
days nobody will have ever typed wrong
for a long station so we are going to
talk about engineering management today
and just before start little bit of my
background I'm sorry Ian I'm managing
enjoy came for paper as a senior
engineering manager and I have over 16
years of experience in the industry and
I was managing teams in Bangladesh
chennai singapore and now in the USA
have over eight years of experience in
management so that's why I want to
discuss about this so engineering
management how I see enjoying management
I see this is a combination of managing
people managing technology and managing
conflict and this is all three are very
meaty subject and i will not do justice
if i try to cover all of them today so
i'm just going to focus on managing
people as much as possible today so why
I'm choose this one why I'm thinking
about engine management in as a topic to
discuss because because of the industry
growth we see that a lot of in companies
are expanding as well as the lot of
start of us coming in so when there is a
new companies coming in as well as the
company is expanding you need new team
and you need managers to manage those
team and because of that this role a
number of roles is coming in market more
and the importance also becoming more
significant and career pot care but is
not really may be true for Bay Area but
other regions like epic region and other
regions after some time engineers wants
to go to management they see that this
that is their next step in career so
like those markets are not ready for
engineers for 20 years 25 years ago
of experience so they look for a
management role and organizational
structure organization structure also
changing a lot nowadays most of the
organizational matrix organization and
they also have now most of the reins of
practice as well methodology and there
are smaller teams there so need more
frontline managers so there is a need
for engineering management so to manage
a team you need a team first and you
need to build a team so you need to hire
people I see hiring is a project so you
have to decide that how many engineers
are what are the roles you want to have
what level of Engineers you want to hire
and do you want only engineers do you
need anyone else of the team any other
roles and even in engineers what type of
scenario do you want gineer engineers
senior engineers how many of them you
want if you know all of these then again
you will start your hiring project and
also that what is the ultimate goal of
your team what the team going to deliver
if you know that it will be easier for
you to hire accordingly there are
changes happen because you may build a
team for one goal but in the long run it
changes to defender and but it still you
need to have people based on what you
have in current information and once you
have this information you can and also
you want to know that what is the
timeline for you then you can start this
hiring project and to start hiring you
need adding pipeline how 12 you hire
people you can use your personal network
if you have personal network and if you
can hire through this this is the best
solution like family friends alumni
ex-colleagues because you know all of
them and you know that how they are
going to fit in your team so it's really
easy but it's not all of the case that
you can use these resources you can use
communities meetups conferences like
this type of conference for interaction
and UCP how people are participating
there then you can have use those
information as for your hiring and
you can use recruiters recruiters I
understand that there are two types of
recruiters right we always work internal
recruiters and external recruiters and
internally tudors is like whatever you
have in your organization you have to
use that and for external because there
is a catch that you have to find out the
best one who can do the research for you
who can find out the person for you and
at the same time that we could need to
consider both party not only your
consideration also the engineers
consideration so that it can satisfy
both sides nowadays I'm not sure how
many people see job advertisement other
10 websites and like hi kaam or indeed
or LinkedIn but not in the newspaper and
other maybe some of the roles may be
applicable but not in a of atmosphere
now people use that so now you know that
what is your requirement what type of
team you're building what the resource
you're going to hurt people then you're
thinking about hiring senior engineers
and for that what are the resources are
going to use so you can lose references
definitely if it really works it good
with senior engineers community linkedin
and sometimes executive recruiters if
you can use exclusively through this
because they're going to use they can I
do research for you and you can use the
those research information and for the
interview panel senior manager engineers
definitely managers and outside
therefore this is really important to
involve stakeholders for senior
engineers because in matrix organization
they have to work with multiple teams
they have to work with different teams
and connect with different teams to
discuss priority dependencies all this
so and as well as they have to interact
with business teams so if you don't
involve stakeholders you may not choose
the right person so I'll go quickly on
the mid level engineers are engineers
because this is a common panel we always
use like opens
tribution job sites and as well as
senior engineers managers will be in the
hiding pal you can include do near
engineers there they're going to be
interesting because of how they be able
junior in units in the team environment
you want to see that one hiring junior
engineers are really interesting because
you don't have much background
information about them you may have if
you want to have our stages recent
college graduates you only have the
academic background nothing else so how
you want to choose them you can use
university events hackathon programming
contests I'd like topcoder and other
things you want to see the best on their
technical skills if they are good and
the technical skills you can guide them
on their leadership skills and the team
dynamics how they're going to perform on
teams so I got on programming contest is
a really really good option for them and
same interview panel we can use that one
so now you know that you won't have all
the soldiers in in the heightened but
whom you want to have you want her I was
the engineer we're going to have android
engineers which level of Engineers you
want they also just so good but what you
need you have to choose and based on
that you have to assemble your team and
to assemble your team you also need to
think about your team structure what I
mean by team structure that what the
team will do is going to be a
deliberating you want a team only focus
on similar like any other teams works in
agile environment that whatever I sent
to them they will deliver that one or
you want the functional teams you can
build a team only for the you guys you
can be team only four key ways there is
nothing right or wrong on that it
depends upon the need and depends upon
the organization structure I also worked
in environment where we had hybrid teams
you functional team as well as delivery
teams so you know you're hiring plan you
you have the hiring path plan you have
they interview panel you are hiring
depending on you need
now if you need a heavy teams definitely
you organize you need to support that
one so from that point of view you have
everything to build the team but is
still inject nourishment becoming
difficult day by day why it is because
increasing increasing cultural and
discuss diversity in the team
involvement in engineering decisions and
I'll go briefly with this why increasing
culture and discuss diversity in the
team is really making it difficult and
at the same time is in actually bringing
power this you have to understand the
diversity in the team you have to
acknowledge that and feel that diversity
is a power is not only in the theory you
have to really believe on that and you
have to foster a culture in the team so
that everybody believed in that and use
that power so nowadays a lot of people
move there here and there and different
organization and different countries so
they add this cultural values if you
understand that if you try to believe in
that then you can use that power and
based on that if you really build an
environment where they can open up that
will get the then you can get best out
of them if you don't have an environment
where engineer cannot open up you will
not able to make a team that can perform
and you only get a mediocre product so
involvement in engineering decision this
is an interesting area a lot of people
want to disc have defined opinion that
whether engineering managers need to
code or not whether I would say there is
personal trials that whether you want to
call or not whether you want to involve
in this food review but doesn't matter
that whether you are cook whether you
code or not you have to be involved in
your technical solutions discussion you
have to understand what your team is
delivering what type of dependency you
would team is going to face from
technical point of view and also the
limitations your team is involving
actually bringing in what the solution
they are
so providing it may bring some
limitations and if you don't understand
that those things you will not able to
guide the team support the team and
removes the blocker for the team when
you work with other teams when there is
a questionable dependency what is it
there is the question of a delivery so
you have to involve in technical
discussions we have to know what is
going on the ground so now because of
the different technologies is become
very hard because you may be worked as a
worker engineer and become a manager now
your team is delivering a mobile app so
it may be hard for to understand that
what is going on in your team what is
going on in in your team's technical
discussion discussions and why they are
taking this type of decision because
it's different signals and doesn't
matter which level you are working maybe
using a manager or director of VP you
have to be involved in this type of
discussions and metrics organization is
has his own complexity right and like if
you think about that when we have to
deliver something we have may have a
deliver dependence with the service team
you may have a dependence with the legal
team and globalization team so II unless
you make your decision privatization
align with their preservation and work
with them you'll not able to deliver
it's not only that your piece can go
along you have to have convince other
timmmmm teams and other other
stakeholders to deliver your product so
now the question about the motivate the
team to delivery right so if you don't
understand individuals in your team will
not able to deliver you have to interact
with you in engineer so you have to
understand individually if you know your
team what is individually they need and
that will make the whole teams made and
then you can deliver and motivate the
team so the here is a one thing I want
to highlight that like setting clear
goals is not only the delivery go
because that may come from the product
manager that may come from the PMO that
okay what is the delivery for next
screen or the sprint after what you have
to do you have your company gold company
vision and your team is working here as
a junior so you have to connect the dots
that okay this is my company vision and
this is the strategy my company doing
and next quarter we are planning to
deliver this one or following code we
are going to pendant deliver this one
hao MA our work is actually impacting
that how our work is helping on the KPI
if you can connect this dot team will be
motivated they will see that ok their
work is actually making an impact now on
the evaluation is always about evolution
we are including the teams is not only
evaluation you have to reward the team
and this is a common picture we always
saw in facebook in other areas right and
the reason I use this one because we
always think about a measurable criteria
to evaluate Kim's team members it's good
if you have a measurable metrics if you
have something you want to tangible in
measure but sometimes it's very hard for
the senior engineers or senior level
roles to measure more with data so you
have to understand how we are going to
measure for your team on that at the
same time I want to give one example
that I think we all work in ideal
environment but there in practically
there are some of the companies you have
to assign new team member for its
specific job maybe usne a team member to
support light live issues for next two
quarters an end of these two quarters
you are avoiding that team member with
other team members who are actually
working on delivery so even though
whatever task you assigned to him he
delivered right what is what about the
task assigned to him he did it with
hundred percent devotion and quality and
everything is there but when you are
going to evaluate with other team
members if you use the same scale you
are not doing justice is this person
so you have to be very careful when you
say that okay I need a common ground
before you set a common ground for
everybody have to set a common
assignment for them also so and it also
makes more complex when you go for inter
team calibration that's also really
interesting because you have to wait for
that like how you want to portray your
messages on during the calibration how
you want to put his performance during
the calibration so when you do the
evaluation there will be some low
performers and this is common doesn't
matter how you team how efficient your
team is how good your team is there will
be some of the performers and this is a
common interview question for
engineering managers how we deal with
low performers I said like honestly we
should should see the root cause of
performance we have to see that train
the performance is he performing lower
for last two sprints three spins or two
months three months or he has been
performing low for a long period is
there any technology essentially making
him perform low that you have to see if
you know the root cause then you will
able to solve his problem and then you
may able to motivate him to perform
better and there is a one interesting
thing I want to share sometimes we see a
low performer but maybe that is not the
problem because the whole team
environment may be the problem the team
is performing in environment where you
are practicing some bad behavior you are
practicing that people will not open up
but this person has a good intention and
he is delivering right and he is speak
up he's trying to deliver the right
thing but because of the team
environment he couldn't do it because
and he's a star is getting demotivated
and his performing No so if you try to
fix that person you are actually doing
causing more problems you are
discouraging a good behavior you are
encouraging a bed giver in the team team
environment
so unless you know the root cause if you
know the root cause you can fix the team
environment problem but other people
also can open up and perform better and
this person also feel motivated that
okay what I try to do I can do it now so
it's really really important to
understand what is going on before you
try to fix anyclip anything on the
performance and the high performers is
the last one in the things and high
performers we always think that I mean
this is really interesting because they
already know how to motivate themselves
they already know how to tell in tensile
they know how to remove their blockers
they're very good at it that's why they
are high performers but how are you
going to motivate them and how can I
challenge them so it is really important
to understand them as a person you have
to interact with them more time and you
have to spend more time with them to
understand of what really motivates them
how you can get us those type of
technology for them or how you can
gather those type of projects from them
if you have those information then you
can actually help him to grow more and
challenge him more there is one
interesting area is that maybe that
person has interested in different team
or maybe he wants to go for a different
career path you should encourage him in
a short term you are losing one person
okay you are encouraging him to go for
another role when going keep encouraging
him to go for another team so in short
term visibility you are losing that
person but if you think about that in a
long term you have to advantage one is
you are building a trust in your team
your billing that a trust among the team
members that my manager suppose our KD
our goal my managers suppose what we
want to do in our career and our people
at the same time you also making a
friend that's a additional benefit so
that the other than that this trust is
going
to help you in long run to help more
people in your team because your team
member going to refer other people there
k you should work with this person so we
talked about hiring plan we talked about
briefly about how to build the team
motivate the team and how we're going to
evaluate the team so that's all for
today from me and if you have any
question ok
ok this is outside for example it from
our different cultures you will see that
there is a cultural teaching I have to
repeat the question sorry if you ask the
question that how engineers open up our
im mean by open up so in cultural point
of view that there is a teaching from
the school and that you don't speak up
even if you see something that goes
wrong and that actually bill become
building in there in turn life so when
they see that there is something going
wrong because of their culture kidding
they don't speak up now if you start
making an environment that okay fine he
may speak slow he may not have the
communication skills but ok we'll is a
family the king team then we can wait
for him to share what is this Scott's
slowly you will get input from that
person that confidence you have to build
on these guys who are not easily open up
on their thoughts those guys who are not
really vocal that okay something goes
wrong okay you when you are talking
about your technology or architect
observer their technology said okay this
is this don't go for it right
there is not like all of you will have
that type of person in the team so that
I also person that those see something
goes wrong but they will not say
anything but they have may have a better
solution for that so if you can have an
environment where everybody and there's
one thing like when he opens up or
anybody else open up if you have any
feedback you can do it in person rather
than just use this in the inner forearm
so that it he'll not able to open up in
the next time so encourage him to speak
up it has any other question
one two three okay thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
