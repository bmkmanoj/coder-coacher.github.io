where the j hipster guys Deepu and GBM
so what's coming up next with a hipster
meeting us
I let begin because biggest thing
today's react support so we have been
working on adding react to a gesture
because we already support angular 1 and
angular 2
so rillette has been a big ask and we
have been working relentlessly to add
that today we have something which is
like a working alpha kind of thing so we
do have a beat just did a small talk
introducing that to people and we are
having another talk later and reducing
it a bit further so we are we are hoping
to release the beta or something by
today and probably have no like a fully
supported react support in like another
1 or 2 months hopefully but you know how
Oasis goes but but we hope that it
happens soon yeah we continue to evolve
the framework with no spring boot to
onto the 5 so as we leave in five yeah
it's been five new support so we we also
have a lot of with a normal work to do
so react comes on top of this so it's a
bit odd to have a
the exact schedule but they are fully in
the phones yeah so we are also adding
couch based support like there's a PR
waiting to be moist yes so it's like
yeah we are adding too many options
recently so we even decided to stop on
adding features yes because we are
riding like too many features yes so
interesting thing is that today we have
so many people coming and bringing new
features that while we cannot just keep
up with everything so well the first
solution was to pose a little bit also
new features but we also have a new
blueprint but also deep ways do is doing
yeah so we are also trying to make
gesture more extensible because
currently one of the asked that we
constantly hear is that people are
people really like to use data to
generate what they like but they also
want to have more customizable feature
because though gesture provides lot of
options which you can choose from
sometimes they want bit more than that
they want to customize the template so
currently with it which is not possible
so we are working on a blueprint support
where you can run J hipster and specify
a blueprint to use so that j-3 uses
those templates instead of the ones from
jail so you can easily override you know
bits and pieces here and there like how
you like so it makes it more extensible
so we're also working on that hopefully
we'll have something out for that soon
as well how do you prioritize what
you're going to work on next which a
hipster the different of what we like to
do but basically you know it's only a
community project so it depends on what
people won't do or we need to do on the
bugs that people either so sometimes a
few times because I need it for my work
sometimes a few days because that's
something I like to do and rucksacks
finally the same for you
same from same for me as well and and
sometimes you also prioritize what the
community wants say for example react
the community has been asking like for
react because when we started was like a
angular community we didn't have any no
react you know fans or like react people
there but nowadays we see that a lot of
people like want to try react as well so
it's been like so it's like okay it's
time to add that as well yeah when we
don't rugby was a chin no just us when
the chin it's like a democracy in which
you move like 20 people when we don't
all agree we do a poll with
multiple on Twitter and we have a look
at what people won't and we try to do
what you won't because since we don't
have a company or something behind zip
store it's it's purely community driven
so so and and co thankfully we have the
freedom to do what we like so that's
always your project works we basically
go where people want to go it's we don't
push them to go somewhere where we bill
them for support or something
building new features for themselves
it's also why people curve and light
products thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
