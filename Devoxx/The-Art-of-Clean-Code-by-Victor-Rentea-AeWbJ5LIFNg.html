something first this is the the biggest
room I ever was I want good so it sounds
like good I really wanted to do that to
be in the whole equally bigger than our
opera back home good so the art of cling
coat really excited to be here with you
to talk to you about my favorite topic
Who am I first of all I'm the polenta a
consultant technically one of the debug
effects for the largest one of the
largest client of IBM Romania but
there's not me actually I'm a clinical
divan jurist and I talked about clean
coding clean architectures and all these
conferences that I keep talking about
that because this is what I love to do
with my free time however my passion is
basically to train and teach and coach
others I already have some experience
with it so that's why I'm here with you
today from this passion I talk about I
teach Spring Java Enterprise being
called architectures even if faculty I
teach design patterns coding dojos
performance in many more ok enough about
me what will we talk today about first
of all why am I here what is this
clinical stuff and why do we need it
there in the names or better yet the
power invested tips then about the
single responsibility principle a
principle which many might say that it's
the most important principle of
programming then about the Autopia we've
been learning about then about about
incompetence then some how to handle
this lightsaber that we were given by
Java 8 right how do we arrive drink or
regenerate if we had enough time to
cover like link oh there's one thing
well so the inventor of C++ right you
can already see the things
responsibility principle in their main
code we'd like well written pros like a
book you can see that the author of
green code really put
as for interacting expressive nice
elegant coat beautiful god-king code is
where each method you read turns out to
be pretty much what you'd expect it in
the context of you have founded a multi
flower comes and says that anyone can
write code with a computer can
understand light mode ax bakes
but few conceal programmers are able to
write code that the human can understand
and that's what we here today to talk
about how to communicate instead of
clothing okay this pretty this is pretty
interesting the code it reads needs to
turn out to be pretty much what you've
already expected in the context you
found it before we can move on do you
know the International lead of measuring
for code quality yes that's it I want
the I wouldn't say it out loud but is
the number of times the developers
scream and the curse when they review
the code right and this is actually the
the essence of the principle of least
astonishment you don't want the clothes
to shock you at each step you want your
code to work with you to be familiar to
be easy to read understand why do we
need think it but easy you all know
probably this the true cost of software
realizing it's maintained is not in
initial development eight percent go
that why why so much because we get
slower slower time passes by a task that
you do now in five minutes you're doing
one month in one hour in two years in my
even become impossible so we just slowly
store because the code quality degrades
you may not be concerned of this
financial consideration but the fact
that you turn out to read code ten times
more when you get to write code it
should tell you something you should do
your very best to write good code even
if that means it writing becomes quite
hard so a rule that you can an idea that
you can follow in this spirit is that
whenever you take code of get to write
some changes to fix on something don't
limit yourself to that fixing that thing
also do some random acts of kindness
some a little improvement to the code
from extract method some extract
variables and renaming to help you to
make it to keep the code allowed
otherwise your
to work in a place like this dominated
by fear you will come to work your sit
on the chair and suddenly you'll feel
satisfied by changing the code right you
don't want to go to come to work to such
a place right actually it is said that
the day in which you stop refactoring it
is a day that your application has
become a legacy and you all want work in
legacy code onto your right so avoid
that the point is if you continue to
postpone a certain refactoring once
twice in the end it will become harder
and harder to do that refactoring and
you will end up not doing it so don't be
afraid to refactor always when it has
the idea go ahead the fact that
otherwise you will have a legacy code
right soon now a lot of us of developers
are me also are fascinated by this power
that we have at work we literally can
invent things can put them in code give
them names and make them alive very few
professions are able to run the thing
that they create a right to give life in
a sense so this is a huge responsibility
because we have to invent new things we
have to select names for these things
and as you all know with great power
comes great responsibility right so you
have to be good at picking up good names
for the things which we create talking
about writing prose here of course the
function should not sound like that
right what does the production function
do but it's a create persist what does
it do you should have obviously some
verbs in them right now with boolean
things use the very name of that thing
which is a spite boolean should scream
it so that it's a boolean there you
can't possibly answer with 17 with such
a question like these are predicates
these are names that screen to you that
this is true or false now for class
names it's pretty straightforward they
are nouns of course the other thing that
we work with but when you select names
for your classes try to avoid adding
these useless plastic cells or suffixes
like this tell me what is the difference
just by looking at the class name what's
the difference between ordered info and
order let me let me take my shot or the
info healthy I'll slide the it class
it can have feel so this is right -
refusing your power which is just like
not willing to take up the
responsibility and putting the good name
this is one guys with said on Twitter
that his search for a glass name for
four hours four hours for a classmate
addressing tomorrow you should put your
data task search for a classroom for
four hours but the point is that by the
end of those four hours that this
developer clarifies his entire domain by
looking the conditions the possible
meanings the related concept of that
thing that sieves searched for so take
the time to find good names for the
classes it's create in the same spirit
if you encounter a thing named I
customer service tell me what is this it
if an interfacer and it there is also a
class named customer service which
implements this quite quite obvious the
same applies for this naming convention
this is just stupid
actually it's just stupid and I will
tell you delete your interfaces fully
remove them with three exceptions in
case you really will send your
interfaces to your remote clients for
remote locations or if you are using
religious stategy pattern and you are
selecting the implementation to use
dynamically based on some data or in
case you are doing dependency inversion
like I've discussed in the morning in
the in the clean architecture talk cool
now tell me honestly how do you
understand the function you see a
function you want to use it how do you
do what do you do you probably would
read the comment that sits there right
and then probably you will start hunting
for the other places in which that
function is being called in you will
invoke in a similar way the same
function right there also Spartans of
you will probably open up the
implementation or the function and they
will start reading so the reverse
engineer the function is this tremendous
effort and you shouldn't need to do that
each time the name of the function
should tell you all that is about it
it's in tension that's why whenever the
things you found a better name go ahead
and refactoring but at times there is
this thought that occurs to you oh my
god is impossible I couldn't have found
a better name that was done by the
elders who wrote the application 15
years ago right this is complete
nonsense you
should find better names as you learn
the applications or go ahead and rename
it rename it on the spot the ideas will
help you a lot it gives us stuff with a
different idea and it really fails this
renaming it's usually it goes okay the
only places where it might fail if you
have reflection going on in your
application or if you have some it's
somewhere that reference that some class
names but you will find out which
classes are more fragile and you will
take care next time if even hasn't named
it named comprehension recycling it
something like ah look what I found
let me rephrase the code not afford for
the following developer to be easier to
understand I talking about the
continuous renaming process as you learn
the application because there are no
perfect name you know this code I repeat
myself I mean from the morning but there
are only two things have been
programming cache invalidation and
naming things and I'm putting about
finding good names here the whole team
will be grateful yourself will be
grateful in three months
tell me one thing honestly how many of
you have cursed the code some code and
then found out that they were the author
of that code right you redundancy oh my
god it was me why why does this happen
probably you didn't review your code
back then enough but more importantly
you forget the design decisions you
forget the code that you write we can
you already don't remember all the
decisions or did not micro design that
you put in place so yourself will be
grateful for them I'm talking about the
continuously naming it continuous
refining of the name just like a
distillery for example now the names of
course should be pronounced about how
could you argue with someone about this
function it's it's a complete nonsense
so use words but I'm talking about
avoiding abbreviations not inventing new
abbreviations every five minutes of
course all the smart and writes value
added tax in your code right Val of
course it's a well-known distance term
that you should embrace in news in our
code but I'm talking about not inventing
new abbreviations each time because they
have to be learned names should be
consistent if we go to database with
find special yet I don't I don't mind
the only thing that I mind is that
always to use the same verb when fetched
answers and the database enforce
conventions and help your developers of
fallodon why because the code will look
familiar to you even if it's not you who
wrote it
all developers should follow the same
naming conventions now
when selecting a name don't don't refer
to a customer with wire and client in
different places because the reader will
get confused or why the heck what's the
difference why is it by rat and customer
here there is no reason the author was
just being overly creative he should
have he should have written poetry
instead that code in the code you want
to be exact precise concise don't leave
room don't leave any ambiguity then on
this gap right on the one side is the
business with money
on the other side it's us with the pipe
and we need to exchange four bytes with
their money so the first thing we need
to build is a bridge between us so learn
their domain always and have also them
to understand the limitations of our
world that you cannot possibly have to
submit buttons on the same page for
perfect explain them these things make
them understand so both of you should
learn something from the other one on
other words words now with treasure is
pretty straightforward it's all about
the single responsibility principle a
function should do one thing it should
do it well and it should do it only says
uncle bow for the purpose of translation
be small how small should the function
be tell me five why's that what the
Bible says five lines files lines of
code oh my god oh my god a first time
that I've read that I was like what the
heck
how come five why is it impossible why
so small but it can't possibly do many
things in five lines of code right if
you do it right yet you're done you have
try-catch and you have two more lines
what would you do in those two lines you
will you will call the functions of
course you will invoke other functions
so the thing is if I raise the - you
can't possibly write much of a logic
much of many
so you have a better chance of having a
good of finding a good name for that
needs to the functions interesting
enough either this file is just
empirical right in our applications we
are we often have this boilerplate code
going on Get Set Get Set Get Set that
make sense to have five lines of code or
method with such code the eristic that I
use personally is that is a function it
takes me more than three seconds to
understand I break it up just if it's
too much logic in it if it's a form with
complicated things I break it up in
smaller methods so the idea is that the
function should never exceed even so one
screen and I don't mean you should
rotate a monitor at one screen means I
don't know 25 times if it's boilerplate
stupid code cool now this is don't
you'll end up with such a function like
I did years ago deliberately prohibiting
myself of any kind of refactoring and
then I affirm now at the end of the day
for me it was very easy to work with
this function because I just wrote it I
knew only to save it when it was perfect
I mean it is super familiar I orient it
very well in it by just following the
indentations and the fourth is that I
knew where there however for the rest of
the team this is like complete while the
rest
this is like like an completely unknown
landscape but honestly what would you do
is I would give you two first to
implement a change request in such
function first of all you are working
with me in the teams are probably will
start reading from the beginning to make
sure don't do anything stupid and you
will read read read read read in a third
point the phone rings it's the matter
okay the cat is sick oh my god
then you keep reading the beginning and
there come to the lunch break what do
you do go for the lunch of course not
the pyramid of needs we have to feed
first rock then you come back from the
lunch you don't recall exactly what will
their way to keep reading reading and as
I'm going to say Arica I found out here
I need to do something else
I think additional what do you do now
what you puta you put a leaf yes you put
a leaf and you add the parameter there
above right yes
effect it's like working in on the
street with a dirty little used tissue
in the hand and you find a trash bin
that overflows what do you do we do that
with a tissue but you just added one
more responsibility to the same function
what you watch you should have done is
to break it up into smaller solutions
little ones extract them all end up with
25 functions like I did and then be
terrified why was I terrified when I
ended up with with 25 functions please
don't any performance because smaller
methods were proven to work faster
because of because they get hot faster
and get compiled creative code faster so
now the performance is not the problem
with performance there is just one now
that we perform at least one single rule
to follow
measures longest like pepperdine sir
actually the major stimulation is the
root of all evil to clutter your code
upfront just because you think you might
have a performance problem don't don't
do that measure the problem and then
clutter your call with optimizations by
always looking at begin in milliseconds
that you achieved using Bible by braking
by making your code ugly so no it wasn't
performance that scare me but is the fit
was the fact that instead of having one
single familiar function I now had 25
functions to remember come on I had 25
functions to remember I was doubling
with 25 new functions well by the end of
the day I don't even recall the names of
those 25 functions for me the open it
was very hard to work with so many names
but for only 4 for the entire team
things were a lot clearer because the
function the names that has put to those
new functions were looking like this let
me read one for you
remove all past canceled orders of
concern with all due respects if you
can't understand what this function does
I don't want to work with you so you
have to be brain dead simple
the readers understand because you might
be debugging this function Friday
evening at 12 o'clock at night so be
kind to your readers like leave behind
you wrong names that tell what the
function is doing since we're talking
about single responsibility principle
let's look at this example this is a
function that receives two boolean's
right like before how many things do you
think this function can do but maximum
but this for right mm I'll fastest so
break it up break it up and in many
melamine methods and then combine the
invocations to these methods to achieve
what you want now
this particular kind of function mean
not only laziness or fear but mean also
rush and more importantly this function
tells us two things first of all the
team is terrified by refactoring this
function is scared to touch this
function and also this function was
recently changed a boolean parameter was
added it means that the function is ugly
I mean scare the developers and changes
it is the perfect candidate to start
refactoring with because it's the
maximum gain can bring these changes and
it annoys people so refactor this one in
the same spirit if you ever make accept
customer to be null you will also do a
null check write your test if customer
different in now then you continue and
again we are doing two things for formal
and what for not moon so I'll tell you
don't accept mutable parameters oh my
god what am i telling you I'm telling
you then the question is when when and
where we fight with anybody data okay
this brings us to the moon Wars let's
suppose you can build a fortress inside
your code it can put some kind of code
inside the fortress and the rest of the
coding they'd have to be outside inside
the fortress I will personally want to
have my drawing services and the
essential business logic of my
application in a safe green peaceful Zen
place I want to have my logic there and
read it and and and let all the corrupt
they
that surrounds me outside the walls for
leave all the data out then at the entry
point enter in your photos we do it with
a bodyguard a strong body part which
does defensive programming total it
takes every kind of vivid it wants to
enter the photos if you do that you can
gain a sense of confidence of trust you
no longer have to check any kind of data
for invalid data for negative age for
empty name so dude is a dmg point in
your system and then trust the data you
have inside however at some point you
might end up with a mole inside your
photos and this mode might actually have
a business meaning like for example the
fact that the customer doesn't have a
gold card it might be business wise
reasonable right if it makes sense in a
business mindset then you could wrap a
optional and I keep saying that optional
is the best the best
I'm the use feature of the raid so wrap
it in an optional and work with the
optional don't pass the new around but
if the new left will represent a fatal
condition don't be afraid of throwing an
exception and the slow on the spot with
no fuss and this brings us to exceptions
you know that there was a war between
random and inject exception the war is
over we'll all go over because you don't
want to do this right and this
particular example will help me will
schedule 15 minutes of personal
discussion with you I mean if you do
that ever
you know swallow exceptions it's
absolutely horrible
so another not to be forced to do this
always prefer to throw and handle
runtime exceptions because we don't see
those Randall exceptions now just my
preference is now I always have a global
exception handlers at the at any thread
entry point in my system because not
only HTTP threads play in your
application but there are also either no
file Polar's timers GMS messages coming
to your application make sure that any
where a thread enter the application is
half destroy catch and place to load it
nice in the in the log then if you have
to have nice message translated in the
in the in the in the language of the
user put some code inside your exception
and then translate it outside using some
messages or table now if you do that and
there is one more thing here
avoid kitchen avoid writing catch in
your business logic code how can you do
that actually the most the vast majority
of area of the exception that appear are
fatal conditions there are only a few
exceptions that you can retry for
example HTTP connection timeout or
something like that you could imagine a
written ISM for the rest of the cases
exceptions are usually fatal condition
so don't be afraid to throw them here
and leave them propagate down to the
exception handler at the end so in in
short don't do in your code don't don't
use catch so minimize as much as
possible there are quite a bunch of
principles and guidelines to follow
quite a few and it's pretty practically
impossible to write this kind of
function without continuous refactor
it's impossible to write these functions
from scratch absolutely impossible the
only way to do it is by continuously
refactoring the code once you have it
working so you are not done when the
console first starts working and I look
at my colleagues my junior colleagues
what they do if they always get up and
run take a break after they finished
some use case then the next project
probably that guy won't be in my team
but if I see him every once in a while
maybe reflecting a bit and thinking on
better ways to expressing the design
that she just did then I love them I
like him the point here is that the best
moments to refactor the code that you've
just written it is after you see it
working it is very many should clean up
your code it is this is this way how you
can grow your design one smart eye says
that the time that you see your code
first start working it is the moment in
which you start investing in your career
and you start building your own design
skills because we all screw the design
up the first time we do it let's let's
let's admit some of us have remorses
have this bad feeling about what they
just did
but if you feel this this remorse don't
just get up and run stay for five more
minutes and refactor the code just roll
in in your head there are all the micro
decisions all the D remorses all the
traders which it just did it's the best
time to refactor not the model not after
lunch break Venice but who now cut
example finally how can you simplify
this bit of code this huge skills first
of all you see if the reader get past
the if he automatically gets tired
because she has to remember that an else
will follow then he enters another if
with another else then a fourth will try
catch then you know and when it when he
reaches finally the actual business
logic is like this I mean what the heck
he has to remember so much it turns out
actually that the number of consecutive
tabs indentation that you have in a
function is a good measure of the
complexity of the function you can
evaluate the extent we can recycle it
them like this litany animation it can
refactor this by reordering this test so
first check the parameter is facing
Israel abruptly exit the map on the
early return refactor and if you live in
is always well then continue on now you
can see the number of consecutive stops
is just one right and it's actually good
measure I told you and I actually had a
client that had a maven plug-in setup
that in case it detected any three
consecutive tabs it will fail the built
I mean wow well because little made all
the the nastiest function we ever saw
were deeply nested if you see a function
is just just like a poppy rose that you
down down down during indentation we can
easily probably cut it into multiple
pieces without fast so that may be many
complications but this is super deeply
nested is it's a mess now that the most
simple refactor we can ever imagine now
let's talk about the most on tricky
IntelliJ actually offers it out of the
box for you but let me let me dissect it
a bit now you have to respect for a
method that has one thousand nine we did
you how many of you have ever seen a
method of 1,000 lines yeah I love you
guys what do you do we have 1000 line to
recite well quick hint a class should
never exceed 300 lines what do you do if
I have a function a function what 1,000
eyes they tell you about this function
when you get hired they tell you you
will work in this function at the hiring
interview so you have this humongous
function what do you do you promote it
as a class this is called the extract
method object inspector and I quickly
quickly want to show you what it means
when it has a huge function with lot of
local variables and deep nesting if you
don't extract this block as a method you
will need to pass this brought a lot of
parameters and at some point it may even
be impossible in this weed patch two
local variables from the outer scope so
in that case you could do you could
create a new class that will have all
the local variables will become filled
in the other place the parameters you
take via the constructor and then the
rest of the logic you put in an execute
for example matter given from that point
on you can extract any block from the
original code in different methods
because the the formerly local variables
are now filled in the instance and it'll
they are readily accessible you can
change to totleigh field and you don't
need to pass seven arguments to that
function so it's acting method becomes
possible however i want you to realize
something in the left side i'm just
invoking the function in the right side
i'm instances in the class I'm using it
and then I'm throwing it away right for
that purpose the right-hand class is
stateful it has field which store
intermediary computations of the current
processing it is a stateful class and
stateful is bad
it is hard refactored hard to understand
hard to work with so my point is that if
you're right if you design some new
functionality from scratch don't aim for
such a design this is a tool you should
use only when you're affected monstrous
legacy code right and the use of this
pattern in Greenfield should be an
exception well documented and well
debated okay that being said let's talk
about object or the LP utopia how many
of you now see alright good now
oops I just wrote it so it was lovely
just a collection of data nothing more
okay that's one particularly lovely
example of a stroke in Java it is
immutable
ah cool it can never change that's why
it's easy to work with
it will remain valid please it's safe to
put increases receiving sets and maps
whatever it's lovely
the other example you anticipated
probably I would feel with getters and
setters and I get I'll repeat myself in
the morning this is nothing exhalation
this is nothing to do with LP it's
actually an anti-pattern you do more
than just setting the field in the
setter so this is nothing different than
having public fields take down that
funnel I'm joking but the idea is it's
nothing different actually now what
these are all be in one slide you will
allow me the elegance but the all these
basically explore periods in that data
exposing instead of expanding your own
internal data exposed methods for your
user do start engine this way in the
next version you can have three states
for your engine for example and when you
really have to tell something to users
expose found in a program make sure it
is you expose it in the most app way as
possible so don't tell just ring in
liters
neither percentage fuelers tell some
estimated remaining kilometers if you go
this way in the next version of your car
you can implement it as a hybrid car
right
just how many cables can I go on with my
battery so it's an API which will remain
more
I question Pat ability here it will
remain more stable so OB it's all about
hiding the implementation details from
the code that uses your API well but
that work we don't do our be doing
despite the interview right we don't do
our P and there's a reason for that
because in our enterprise applications
at least in my world we write procedural
code why because most you enter both
applications just translate existing
procedures in the real world and
implement them in software and I found
it quite straightforward to implement
procedures using procedural code so we
are just we are just writing tons lots
and not just figures within our
enterprise applications well and then
our question is how do you organize it
how do we keep it simple simplicity is
the most important principle for any any
large enterprise application it's simple
how to organize this huge amount of
procedure to do that we will distribute
this huge procedural code into many
classes but these classes are nothing
more than but containers of logic they
are just like namespaces basically it
have services in the order service is
not an object is not a structure just a
way of organizing become the huge amount
of procedural code so just as me tips
that you are not doing a LP you are not
you are not doing structures also there
is another form of class which is
basically a container of logic then
after all
did they really asked us for nothing
those stupid questions that the
interview when when in your career you
will you ever care of of not breaking
your client the code that uses a certain
class I usually have this as a question
but now let me tell you why will you
wake up at night terrified
now shivering what why when will that
happen when you create some when you
dare to create some mini libraries and
mini framers a mini reusable code that
you dare to publish on your corporate
Nexus like my court - Commons - why
one point zero and the one point zero is
not the problem that wakes me up in the
night because other applications will
rely on my 1.0 version and the next day
obviously I understand a bug in my code
and I would want to fix my library and I
will go begging the clients of my jobs
to migrate to one point one but if the
migration is more than just changing the
version number in the poem XML then they
will just not do it for me
in my bag will go to production so when
you're right whenever you write the mini
reusable code mini library always think
of how hard it will be for your clients
to migrate to the next version and then
it is the place to employ IOT to make
sure your API stays stable there is when
you have to employ all those or biscuity
to have who's now about formatting and
comments do you see this farming glasses
in this bit of code this is a code right
let's go
do you see the sunglasses let me take
you a broader overview do you see the
sunglasses
let me help you well it's but you know
you know it's not magic at work it's all
about teamwork you are not me oh you
shouldn't call yourself improve how dqr
how obfuscated code you can possibly
write you are working in teams
despite the subtlety of who that only
gives us homework if our individual
works so your assistant is the faculty
you come to work then suddenly there is
someone standing next to you now and
he's alive he moves if you touch him oh
my god I have a colleague what's that a
colleague it's a human being I have to
interact with him how look at this this
is a major major problem for any
graduate to work in teams to support and
to tolerate what is human presence and
why are you getting the whole earth
shift because it's all about caring for
the other team member
otherwise they will hunt you down so
don't call this is our message never
co-op to skate don't you see you know
what what did you do today
I caught it I already see you with the
Enigma machine encrypting a message you
know don't do that right communicating
code tells your thoughts express your
intention respectively but the code you
wrote in ten minutes will be what the
code you wrote Internet will be read for
almost two hours by someone and you
don't want to know the thoughts in that
person's mind about you so be nice to
your reader be nice to the one who will
maintain your code alright literature
right nice phrases explain what you want
to do and never ever obfuscate again I
repeat myself if you have energy in one
day invested into optimizing it is
simplifying into making a mini framework
for distance so test is the most
challenging activity you can ever do an
America professional how experienced you
want so invest all your energy into good
test there is another thing that I
always say there is no reason for pride
in any software can besides having fast
super high coverage significant
non-overlapping clean dry tests there is
no other reason to brag about the
software now if you join the army they
will tell you that look this is your
crash nickel for now this is your wife
your mother your this weather I can move
in right I'll tell you the same about
your IDE it is the bitter foster you
must dream about you must know it by
heart
learners belt circles the contest
refactoring contests in which you put
the mouse here in your ear say start who
finishes first games the beer no so
learn those circles make sure you are as
fast as hell when using those circuits
because when you will have to do a major
restructuring you need to move lightning
fast
configure reasonable static import
reasonable default complex make sure you
have a short short short tiny feedback
loop like Venkat setting the time you
have into building a fast feedback look
into having the instantaneous deploy
instant then
supermini testers are now just some
suggestions the line the lab should
never go over 120 140 because otherwise
we will force the reader with his mouse
to click on the dance crawl into drag
the scroll bar you don't want to do that
to your reader so never force a reader
to scroll horizontally for metal in
earnest I already discussed with you the
point is to be easy to understand never
more than one screen but for the length
of the class I already told you
somewhere about 200 300 lines more these
are just suggestions what I use pub for
2 characters whether your Egyptian style
or not whether you use spaces how you
put the bracket I don't care
all that matters is that the whole thing
follows the rule that were established
by the team so play with them making the
code as similar as as idiomatic as
possible with their clothes in my
favorite slide talents are failures
comments are a written expression of
your incompetence this a good one is
really good one why some of us have
remorses when they finish writing some
code and what did they do they drop a
comment there and hoping the next one we
understand and run away this is not
because they know we screwed up what I
tell you is don't do that take a walk
use the bucket of work of clean cold
water next euro in next to your desk you
should let me clarify a bit the mind
come back and refactor improve the
expressiveness of the code why am I so
it gives comments because statistically
somewhere about fifteen twenty five
twenty percent of the good developers
always remember to update the Java dot
when they change the implementation of
something so inevitably the comments
will turn will end up lying to you Ryan
to you in the face telling you a story
ten years ago or five years ago that
even wise even intelligent eclipses
display the comments in a washed away
color not to disturb your eyes not to
none because everybody knows that the
oils too
is the live running code all that is a
part of that it's it man says it will
not be specification observer that it
all falls out of think the only thing
that matters is the live code what I do
what I what I ask of you is to improve
the expressiveness what effect is that I
mean really valid interest the one word
in the array it's my god least one and
the best thing is X of zero this is the
ultimate stuff I mean it's of real
really equals four really these are
magic numbers that you need to explain
the riddles of course then introduce new
useless variables new explanatory
variables to name some fun bit of
computation for example is like equals
cell of status equals light you see this
is variable you would laugh at me but
this will exist for two lines we will be
tended to in line it to destroy it but
no leave it like that because it turns
something it fails that this means that
the cell is flagged and this also please
well when you have this if and then you
start a boolean expression hit enter you
continue or also end and enter and and a
lot those right and you need to click on
the bracket to see where it ends it is
absolutely adorable so what I do about
this I extract all the brackets as a
temporary variable let's say I put them
names and I then compose them in one
single line to an incensed respect your
predicate respectable on tests it really
does that complicated that they deserve
more than one creepy line introduce new
variables to store the intermediary test
now what I did next is I even created a
method but who to host you you told you
may laugh at me again but I created a
method that does just get this bit or
one line for 25 structures I created a
method name is flat this is so frequent
to you that it has a name this is called
encapsulate conditionals when it will
take a bullying condition
put it in a method and give it a name I
get this matter just to be more
expressive what I mean and even now I
even switch to object oriented stuff so
now if I say that this is a bit of
school from - eh but you won't be shot
free I mean is game where the cell is
like I know you can write this in one
line with Java 8 but hold on
this along with splitting your methods
into multiple methods with long
expressive names is the way you want to
leave out behind you in a life
documented to tell the very code
explained in your intention cool
now example of bad comments with this
one it is my favorite now beside the
fact that the author probably needed a
professional professional counselling
from someone in this psychology because
this guy expressed his negative feelings
in the code you should never do that it
conveys your negative emotions to your
reader never read how many of you have
seen cursing and bad words in code in
the production ball don't don't avoid
that because it will make you read a
selection so besides that what scares me
most is that the fact that this might be
a forgotten to do so as a minimum make
sure you put to do and everyone to
continue something this is it is matrix
this is the victory of machine against
human this is sonar teaching you how to
program make sure you tune those don't
follow rules like they make them work
with you not against you this is a clear
sign of a to long the class of courses
should be broken up commander dart code
is not there for you to read it is not
there for you to uncomment it from duck
deleted it is probably problem with that
the gate is still there ok mum vocal if
you really have to put a commented on
the same line not a function not only
class no on that line to be in front of
the eyes of the reader and then if you
really have a lot of energy don't
describe to me what the abstract factory
design pattern is in the Java doc or
but are you are picky I know I did
yesterday evening but don't explain it
to me in two paragraphs perspective
right so don't be overly effusive
energetic test again now there are also
examples good common see when you just
can't say that you want to use jigsaw
algorithms for navigating for traversing
an oriented graph stuff that is too
complicated to put it to express it in
code there are occasions but then only
put the URL of the thing that you wanted
the bit to follow it may be a bug work
around it might be some classic
algorithm put the URL cannot now it
really has to pass travel as an argument
to a strange API explain what that seven
means like may you can put some Java doc
there in case you are in for what kind
of developer profile will maintain your
code you can leave behind this kind of I
don't put simple days format or as a
field in a class disk understands to do
that followed by the name sometimes will
meditate preparing for the debugger I
mean delivery be public Java doc if you
really have to write it write your own
library make sure I mean you need to
write more Javadoc just to keep the
decline code the client developers out
of implementation won't explain them as
nice as possible well yeah I mean to
avoid them to go into your
implementation
biggest okay now lightsaber will lower
lambda right because they are cool I
mean they literally caused a dramatic
increase in the popularity of Java after
they were introduced the thing about
Java is that is the code cleaner than
Java 7 that was my concern it can be
more expressive but if you ability can
even become very very very cryptic and I
said several talks about this problem
this topic and there are what are the
best practices for writing clean code in
Java all nowadays because time is
running out just an examples here yes
you see here this 4 dots has line not in
stock is a method in the same class that
hosts some bit of actually predicate in
the in essence but this predicate is
specific to the use case implemented in
that class so it's no use of the braces
and I put it as a private method in the
cell
plus then you can see here our deadline
is not you stop this is an incomplete
pretty a negatory conditional
application which actually created the
boolean function in this very entity
then it can even work with predicate as
long as variables that creepy but you
can even do more can have found
higher-order functions that return you
parameterized predicate this is creepy
it's supposed to be creepy if a
predicate takes some parameters for
example believe in two days before
Sunday then this predicate cannot be
writing the entity on anywhere else you
have to have some factoring methods for
the predicate it's pretty creepy
I know so the point is you will work
with predicate and respect your
predicate work nicely with them
generates of course is a new language
it's a new paradigm shift loss little
advantage actually it's switching slowly
towards the declarative way of
programming essential learning not only
a new language but a new paradigm you
need to know it all because simple
against it simple is not necessarily
what you are familiar with so we have to
learn it first and then it may prove to
you to be more simple but after you've
learned that don't use lambdas able than
the day before a adopted progress may be
either in C maybe nine months in order
for all the team to be sure that they
understand what you're doing that then
don't ever do Aero bracket in a way
because that's an anonymous function you
agree when you do that you are about to
write an anonymous function and it's
precisely my problem
it's a nonnamous doesn't have a name and
I will love names I love to be told what
the function does so don't do that
instead write a method in the same class
and reference it from this using four
dots in the name of the method don't do
that much as possible use the map
function and the flat map function of
the optional
learn about monads what you were told
then finish about predicate a work with
an eye like I showed you in the slide
before and in the end find the simplest
form ask for review from the other
essential peer review is essential in
the best form of peer review no I
thought this talk this discussion over
another peer review is equal to peer
criticism to peer arguing to peer
blaming don't it's better yet to have
their programming to proactively better
ways together and not have someone
criticizing your code like so prefer to
the program it is possible okay as the
key points study factor equals start
legacy and when you stop in fact if you
put in the kennel and drink to that
then names it's all about refining and
continuously searching for better names
in your code function should be small
with long names and expressive names
classes are of three kinds struct which
are the best immutable objects which
hide their data and their things inside
a logic containers if you're a feature
called lots of procedural code for
formatting comments are failures
admitted and prefer always to refactor
to refine your names to express it in
code with lambda if you're learning a
new language a new paradigm make sure
someone per programs with you daily
profits good deal work this is a key
point now how to apply this in mind or
logistical I continue I contend to say
that over and over practice practice
over and over do cutters do dozers do go
to code repeat days grow your skills is
hard it takes months maybe years of
practice but in the end you'll love it
okay books books this is the Bible no
developer can ever write any line of
code until sis has finished at least
half of this book at injera
read book written I mean that was it
thank you all for your attention
a little of the infinity
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
