give one of the first talks of the
conference day today my name is Bentley
I want to talk a bit about open source
vertov's business rules and case
management first question of the day for
me always interesting who is already who
already knows BPMN as a standard which
is twice the most of you which is
amazing
great always interesting for me to get
an idea so Who am I I'm Ben Luca I'm one
of the two founders of communi I'm
basically doing workflow all my life I
started with jbpm two and three like
twelve years ago and I have a background
in the Java Enterprise stuff so I wrote
an EJB book quite a while ago and I
wrote that lovely real life beep MN book
as well we have a couple of copies at
the booth so if you if you want to crap
on if you're interested you can get one
at our booth and communal we are an
open-source ppm and also we're making a
BPM platform we're based in Berlin we
have a subsidiary in in San Francisco
we're currently approximately 40 people
and what which is always interesting as
a source company we are not venture
capital based so we are basically
growing substained
which is I think a big difference in how
the company behaves so um that might be
might be interesting for a couple of you
so if you have any question about that
let me know or talk to me later I'm here
till tomorrow
around lunchtime maybe yeah what come on
maybe PMS I will show you later on in
the demo so first question was what is a
business process the lot of you raise
the hand who is already knowing BPMN so
just a quick overview of what we have
here so this is a typical example of a
process right the vacation request so
you want to go on a vacation that kicks
off maybe a bit payment process with a
start event so that kicks off the
process instance we're talking about
instances then that moves on there are a
couple of task types for example a user
tasks so somebody maybe your boss should
approve that vacation and then you write
data to the process instance we call
that process variables and based on that
variables we can decide here with a so
called this gateway X or gateway either
we go that path or the other path and
then we have for example a service task
which directly automatically sends an
rejection email for example or just some
other stuff and then we end up in an end
event and the process instances ended
right so that's a B payment process I
will show you that later on in demo with
a more complex example I'm in the
background that's always an XML and we
have an engine which can basically
interpret that XML and run process
instances through that okay so that's a
very brief introduction into a business
process I shouldn't get nervous I she
makes photos of me this is actually what
we see in real life so this is not a
real life example there vacation
requests even if that's the example you
always see this is more in real life
example that's a credit card issuing
process from a German banking company so
basically and what you can see here is
the so called pool at the very top is
basically used so the customer maybe
wants a credit card and then you enter
some form in the back for example and
you want to want to get your credit card
you make the application and then this
ripple through a couple of systems until
you end up in a process which is really
automated on in this case commoner beep
M on the process engine on the workflow
engine and then you see there's quite a
huge process automated there which does
a lot of automated steps like for
checking validation entering that into a
couple of systems but also like what we
call human task management so a couple
of things are really delegated to a user
like a four eyes principle or doing some
additional checks and then in the end
it's handed over to basically to
producing on the credit card and then
this is shipped to you by our mail
basically and then which is basically
makes a good process it starts at the
customer and it ends at the customer and
so this is a bit more realistic view on
that we have a lot of these core
processes automated on the
technology and using BPMN so from
different industries so this is banking
we have a lot of customers in insurance
space so if you want to want to have an
insurance application or you want to
have claim handling that's a typical
example or in the telecommunication
industry if you want to have a new
mobile phone or a SIM card sending over
or a new flat line or whatever you want
to have these kind of things and so on
and so on so there are a lot of examples
for these kind of co-op processes and
for most companies out there that's
actually really important to get that
right because it's about what we call
scaling the company so if you automate
processes you're able to grow really
large because most of you can see that
most of the process is basically
completely automated okay so if you do
that you can handle much more customers
with the same company than if you do a
lot of manual work and at least in the
banking industry I know that there's a
lot of manual work still done so that's
important to keep track and being able
to scale your company a good example is
Solano Solano is a reference customer as
well so you do you know Solano for most
of you okay which is interesting because
for for IT guys it's not very ask your
wife or your girlfriend she might know
it's about clothing and shoes and
they're expanding all over the world so
it's worldwide you can can order stuff
at Solano and every order process you
kick off as soon as you place the order
that's handled by a kimono BPM process
instance and that for them it's
important because they are growing very
fast they're changing adjusting the
processes very fast as well they have to
adjust that to the growing company so
and then it's important to have this
this picture of how the process looks
like in order to be able to see where
you want to change something where that
influences a process how to improve that
in order to handle the growth so that's
one of the examples why that definitely
makes sense to to have these business
processes and if you look at the current
customers or current companies out there
not yet customers so how do they
implement processes what you see how
they
lot is like they're coding it in various
forms you code your own process engine
like a state machine or are you coding
like your order table where you have
like or the state attribute which is an
integer which which basically decodes in
web state the current order is or a lot
of these things and the problem is or
you have called the whole stuff into
java code or whatever it is and the
problem is you don't see that process
and you're normally not able to change
it because if you want to change it you
have to understand how it works today
and that's pretty hard to do in in
current code so that slows you down and
that normally is a is a big problem and
if you remember we're currently in 2015
so coding processes hard-coded or doing
your own process engine doesn't make any
sense from my perspective the problem is
it that yeah you're missing transparency
right so you're looking at at one part
of your system or even if you're doing
very modern stuff like with Microsoft's
we have a interesting discussion
currently going on does BPM bpmn play a
role in the micro service world and i
think it pretty much does because if you
if you look in init like small micro
services and they're doing stuff here
and there and the overall process is
nowhere shown or nowhere visualized you
you're just missing transparency so
that's what it's all about
I'm getting to the demo in a minute
don't just making the introduction wrong
so if you look at the transparency part
it might be in the development so that's
something we tackle very much actually
how do we handle requirements management
how do we handle the giving the BPM and
process model from a business analyst to
the development then on a like a
definition level how to see how that
operates do we have bottlenecks too it
behaves like I think it should do we
meet the SLA which is defined for the
process and these kind of things and a
lot of instance related transparency is
that that's like you're at the customer
calling the company where is my
application what is the current state
and depending on the answer you know
how good they are at I'm basically a ppm
okay if you look at the whole ppm topic
they're currently three at least from my
point of view there are three really
relevant standard you should have a look
at so the first is bpmn so I think like
70 percent raise the hand you already
know be payment which is pretty good
that's for workflows I have an example
in a minute
you see that's already a pretty amateur
standard we have a second standard which
is called case management model
indentation CMM and anybody knows that
actually which are two three four five
people I think not that much it's pretty
new as well I show you an example later
the ideas with BPMN you always have a
very strict ordering of activities or
activity a then B and if you have want
to have more flexibility where the human
in front of the computer can decide what
he want to do then CMM and might be
interesting for you
it's from the OMG as well and we have
dmn which is very new actually brand new
so that's decision modeling notation is
about business rules I'll show you that
in a minute as well
and what it's in common for all of them
is that you not only model it
graphically
so the BPMN model I showed you in the
background always have the XML file
format so you can save it as an XML file
you that standardized so you can even
use different tools and you can execute
that on an engine so the standard
defines how to execute that on an on an
engine so even if you're not using
carmona BPM if you find reasons for that
you still can use BPM and CMM and EMM
makes a lot of sense actually ok so I
try to be always quick with the demo
actually so and what I want to do today
as a demo is basically making an
insurance application so that's normally
what all people here can can at least
know from from home so let's say you
want to want to change the car insurance
I want to have a new conscience and I
want to have let's say I want to have a
Poor's
9:11 that's okay and I want to have that
I'm male so that's the end user
perspective this is basically a
hard-coded HTML page there's nothing
special about coming on there but what
happens when I when I click on apply
it's basically it calls the rest service
in the background and that kicks off
process instance in our tooling so in
the combination I come back to a couple
of architectural things later on so what
I can see here for example cockpit is
our application for the operator so we
can see what's going on in our engine
here so for example I have that
insurance application I can have a look
at the process definition so I see all
instances which are currently running in
my case I only have the one I just
kicked off and this is currently in the
decide about application user task why
is it there you see the model now I
kicked out the process instance and this
is something which is called the
business rule task it bpmn the business
rule tasks can be connected directly to
DMM so there's a rule table a decision
table in the background I'll show you
that in a minute
which basically thumb is responsible to
you to get a risk evaluation so in my
case the port seems to be a medium risk
that's why I actually choose it if I
choose a flux long it would be green for
me so I choose the pores and that means
I just go that way what you can do here
that's a lot what I said earlier about
transparency I can look in the process
instance in the single instance I can
see the data attached to it so I have
some insurance application which is here
serialized it's adjacent for example I
have my wrists which are just found by
the MDM an and a couple of other things
I could even like modify the stuff like
moving the token and these kind of
things don't want to do that at the
moment but there are a lot of things
possible here and I want to switch
actually hats now so
let's assume for a minute we are now the
basically the clerk who works on the
applications so I can switch
applications for for now I'm in the
so-called task list so that's the end
user interface we have so you can see
for example all tasks so these are a
couple of filters I could configure them
I haven't done that much for this demo
so I have again this user task we
visualize the BPMN again so we can see
where he is in the overall process and
we have a form for him in order to do
that task what you can see here all the
applications we have our HTML 5
angularjs so and the rest using our own
rest interface in the background and you
can embed HTML forms here so there are
easy ways to automatically generate
forms if you want to do a rapid
prototyping or you can embed HTML forms
using javascript and these kind of
things and for example I claim that
tasks that I want to do it and I see
again the stuff I see the risk which was
found and now I can basically decide if
I want to accept or reject them actually
who knows me is I'm quite a quite a
EcoLog trigger guy so I don't want to
have that port anyway so I reject that
for the moment I complete it and so my
task is done and if I go back sorry in
cockpit and I refresh here what it tells
me is that the process instance has
ended already and so I can switch to the
history view and I see exactly the path
which was taken for that process
instance you also see the timestamps and
these kind of things so in the
background such an engine always Rhines
writes history data like ordered locks
and these kind of things so I see again
a lot of transparency I have within here
yeah so far so good
maybe if I'm already here and we're
talking about transparency what's
interesting as well maybe having a look
at a couple of
reporting features for example that's
actually a a plug-in I built so it's not
not part of the out-of-the-box cockpit
but you can easily plug in your own
plugins and this for example show a
couple of KPIs I modeled in the process
so the message here is that because we
write all the audit data it's very easy
to access them and to use them in order
to for example show a couple of
different things - like business user or
decision-makers and to support that
decision how to maybe improve the
process we out-of-the-box ship for
example a so-called heat map so you can
directly compute us a bit slow at the
moment actually so you can directly show
how the most majority of the processes
which pass they take so I see most of
them are currently directly
issued which is maybe a good thing for
the for the insurance company okay so
there are a lot of things you can see in
here if we move to the dmn part so
taking that decision what you can
already see first thing is we're
currently implementing dmn you saw it on
the slides a pretty new standard and
we're currently implementing that so
what you can see here if you should be
big enough maybe yeah it's an alpha 2 so
I'm currently showing you the alpha
version of the upcoming 7 for release
which will be released in end of
November so end of this month then we
will have the immense support within the
engine but it can already see it in the
preview so for example I can see in
cockpit not only process instances but
also the process that the decision
definitions for example so I see my risk
assessment decision table and this is
actually what dmn defines the most
interesting thing for the moment for
execution our decision tables and the
decision table as we are basically very
easy you have a couple of input
data fields so these are the light green
columns and you have output so for
example I say if I'm and then you have
expression language what you can see
here so for example I have a relate in
this case to process variables because I
called that from a process instance so I
can directly reference and process
variables like the application and if
you remember that let's quickly recap
that so if I go to the variables where
is the application there it is so there
you have for example and they click and
and this has some age so I can directly
access that and say okay if he's younger
than 21 he's a beginner and he always
gets a risk these kind of things so
that's basically what the MN can do I
show you a couple of more things in a
minute and what you can also see is that
we write a history for the decisions as
well
so we see all the decisions takes and in
in in the past and we see the input data
and we see the output data so what was
basically the risk we're currently
working on that we are improving the
yeah basically the display option so
you're currently playing around with
showing all the stuff on the table
directly so you don't have that ugly
table and below so it should be should
be nicer actually in the 7 for release
but we're currently working on that okay
so far that was a very very quick
overview so the other interesting
question is what do I have to do in
order to get that running what I showed
you so the first thing is that we always
what we call a developer friendly engine
so we always embed in the Java space so
for for me what I have here and actually
you can find the example I showed you on
github so you can play around it with
with it yourself just make sure you use
a alpha 2 otherwise dmn will not work
and this is a normal Java project it's a
maven project they're embedded the and
bpmn files
that the insurance application we saw
earlier we have an eclipse plugin that's
what you can see here so it can model or
or edit everything directly in Eclipse
if you're not really happy with the
usability and eclipse which at least we
are not we're offering a second
alternative we developed that over the
last one and a half years and it's
pretty cool by now and we released that
in November as well which is a
browser-based modeler first of it it's a
browser-based modeler so you can
directly check that out if you want to
so go to demo became an IO
and then it can directly model
browser-based thing is because I got
asked earlier today we don't send any
data to us so if your model there it
will be completely in the browser right
so we don't send it to us we would be
interested in your models but we don't
do it it's everything browser-based and
this is from the usability much nicer
actually than the Eclipse plugin and we
offer the so called common log which is
a standalone version of that where you
can see that it can edit all the
properties you need and these kind of
things so they're basically both options
you can use either the Eclipse plug-in
or um the so-called commander modeler in
order to model em BPMN for DM n we're
providing only that commander modeler so
only the web-based modeling part we
don't have an eclipse plug-in and we
don't plan to build one for DM n so if
you have the DM and XML within here you
just open it up in the kimono model and
and you're happy or ready to go to model
this stuff in here we can maybe show you
that example here so same thing there's
in your elbow you can try it out and
then you can for example whatever add
rules or add columns and these kind of
things where I'm planning to improve the
usability of that thing in December so
after the release we are we will improve
the modeler and currently we are pretty
busy to get the release done so that's
something we will we will improve in
December
that's about the dmn part the modeling
part in the tooling part yeah I think
maybe we do with that audience it's
easier to do the questions at the end so
that was a quick demo maybe we have a
couple of more code later on let's see
so that was the p-payment file that
might not be so hard to get so I started
the application I did the dmn track I
with a result I went into the manual
decision and then I reported in my case
reported the rejection that might be
interesting to have a quick look at so
if you for example where is it there if
you go to that service task what you can
see is I attached a Java class so in my
case I just do a logging so I don't do
much actually and with this entry
direction that might be a bit trickier
because I send an email and what I do I
attach Java classes and if you look at
the Java classes they are actually
pretty straightforward so what you can
do in the easiest case is to use the
Java delegate interface from us in that
case and then if the process instance
moved through that it calls the execute
method and then you could even use CDI
or spring in order to give it a name and
then it can refer to that with a bean
name if you prefer that and there are a
couple of options in there but you can
see that it's pretty pretty
straightforward a - to attach code and
for example for the decision here accept
acceptance or approval I just used an
expression on the outgoing path in order
to decide if I go that path or not
that's jewel to have a unified
expression language so Java again and
that's actually the same what we use in
dmn so if you look at dmn in all the
places like in the expressions here or
there
you could use jewel as well so you can
even call like spring beans or CDI beans
there and we're currently I'm building
in what
defined in dmn as well which is called
feel which is quite a cool thing it's
friendly enough expression language what
they mean is business friendly enough so
should be readable by business users so
there it could do something like if the
sum is between ten and one thousand and
one thousand is not included or
something like that so that would be a
feel expression so that will be possible
to use within dmn and the process
instances okay so if you're interested
in more technical details the bestest to
get over to our booth to ask us
questions to check out the stuff
yourself at github and these kind of
things so that was the BPMN part i
showed you the deep dmn part as well so
that's pretty interesting as well let me
add one more thing about daemon so what
I learned about dmn actually I looked
into a lot of dmn over the year and what
I learned from there is that there's a
lot of a lot of methodology actually
going on around rules for quite a time
so if you look at something which is
called the decision model that one which
is quite an interesting book to have a
look at what they described that
consulting company in the US and they're
doing a lot of rules assignment there
and they're modeling a lot of decisions
in terms of decision tables and that was
somehow surprising to me so I'm so far
all the problems we saw there we could
really translate very easily into the
decision table so no need for trees or
no need for a rule language for most of
the problems and tables and that's a
great thing about it they're always
readable by business users they are
always understandable very easy so I'm
really looking forward to making more
experience with that so if you're if you
are having a dmn problem I'm happy to
discuss that maybe later on because
we're currently searching for for for
more pilot products we
have like five to ten customers
currently already doing something with
that but I would like to have more
actually to get more experiences and
then if you look at the DMM table so you
can even do a lot of more stuff which I
don't have the time to show but just to
make one example so you cannot only say
there will be one row firing which would
be unique but you can also say there
might be multiple rows for firing use
the first one or you can define a
priority you can say don't care which
fires you can use the collect which is
interesting I did that for the risks so
there's maybe not only one risk with
second where is it here so there might
be multiple wastes right if I'm 20 and I
want to go for Porsche I have to risk
and these kind of things so and this is
why I have to see and everything I'll
show you there is defined in the
standard so it's not a common dimension
we are building the engine so you can
execute it on the camera BPM part but we
are not it's not not like a proprietary
come or nothing okay if you want to use
the dmn stuff if you want to want to
start playing around with it which I
only can motivate to do the easiest
thing to do in the first place and
called a decision starter here is to use
it in a stateless manner so for example
you can have something like a yeah
basically we call to the dmn engine the
decision engine which is a quite easy
thing so there's nothing in the
background we don't need a database we
don't need nothing so I'm just build it
and then for example you can parse the
dmn part so that the xml and you get a
decision definition and then you can
directly use that in order to make a
decision and you just pass in data like
variables which is what you can see here
which is a very easy map like string
object map you pass in the data and you
get a result and this for example
contains the risk so if I'm 25 I have my
BMW let's check what we should get so if
I have my 25
EMW should be young at fast and high
value wait vehicle so I have two wrists
actually so let's check that so we
should have two wrists let's do that
don't want to save that I guess okay so
that works actually so if I change that
to like what else two and a half like I
want to have a smaller BMW I'm sorry I'm
German so I have to use German cars so I
have I think I get an arrow no because I
only have one risk just quickly check
that yeah so they don't have a second
risk so I just have one um thing is it's
very easy actually very straightforward
to use that that's the message here and
you don't have to use that in the
infrastructure there is the possibility
to use dmn within the what we call the
BPM platform so then you have the whole
communal at forum you have a database
because that means we conversion the
decision definitions so you saw that in
cockpit like there we have versions of
that so if you change it you will keep
track of the versions and you will
always know which decision you made
which with which which version and then
you have all the history of the
decisions you made so that's basically
the decision you have to make if you
want to use it with all the history and
the capabilities or not right so but you
can use it in a very very small
environment already okay so that's
basically about dmn if you ask me I
think the MN will have quite a quite a
bright future
I maybe motivate that in a minute in
more depth if you look at rules what we
definitely do not recommend this all and
model them in the BPMN processes so we
see actually a lot of that out there so
the people now have beep Amanda
they have it graphically they think okay
there that's nice because the business
can read it so I model that in bpmn and
then you get these kind of process
models so for example if you have to
make the decisions what to cook in order
to depending on the guests you have it
will already get quite complex and thing
is if you if you if you do that with dmn
it gets much much more easy and normally
the process model gets much much more
easy as well and much more stable so
things separate the two concerns that
makes Miriam very much sense if you're
interested in all the details we have a
tutorial already online you can check
that out yeah don't don't mix that up if
you look at that the the it's very
different frequency of changes what you
do with the processes so if you look at
the processes out there in the companies
they really rarely change so the overall
process is normally very stable because
it's a lot of effort to change you have
changed management in your company you
have effort for development going on so
processes are not changed that often
even if you have the capability with the
BPM and to make it easier they are not
changed at all the same goes actually
for the rule structure the rule
structure like the columns you have the
expressions you have to define in order
to make it work they don't change that
off and so that normally involves
development so what we currently
envision there and you can see that on
the modeler you can always hide the
technical details so the gray stuff is
basically the definition so that's done
by development but what we already
achieved in a couple of projects is that
the actual rules so the the rows in the
table are really edited or or at least
approved by the business so that's
actually what it can achieve here and
what is really possible to do we had a
couple of projects already who do that
for example if you take the other way
around if you want to get rid of your
insurance
they normally have kind of a limit like
four days after the real date you had to
cancel that they allow it still because
they are user friendly and in times they
really have a high load on their on
their clerks they extend that period
like to ten days or 14 days okay so um
that's very easy to change in these kind
of tables yeah so the most interesting
question nowadays is but roots engines
are new right so there are a lot of rule
engines out there there's tools as an
open source rule engine and why don't
you use that or why did you write your
own rule solution or your own engine and
we did okay that so that's completely
written from scratch we we made a like a
questionnaire earlier this year how
happy are you with your current business
rule solution and that was really
interesting to get all the answers we
had around 45 answers so with a lot of
detailed information in there but the
most interesting thing was like all
basically all of them like 63% are
really unhappy with the current
situation and the solution they had were
ranging from business rule engine an
existing one over hard-coded business
rules on non routes at all basically and
if you looked at the figures of the
people using a business rule engine the
number of unhappy users were even higher
so and from my perspective that I mean I
was JBoss contractor a couple of years
ago so I gave a lot of Deborah's BJP Pam
and Drew's trainings and I think the
problem is that the rule engines so not
only truths a lot of them are basically
based on theories like Rita algorithm
what Prolog does and a lot of these
things which is quite complex and they
try to solve a problem where they said I
have a whole huge bunch of facts of
objects and I want to match a huge
amount of rules for that very
efficiently so there you need a lot of
theoretical
stuff and that makes it complex that
makes very complex rule engines and what
we see out there are very easy rules
like a couple of lines and I hand in one
application I want to get a result I
just want to have the business IT
alignment the transparency stuff I want
to read it from a business perspective
and therefore the current solutions are
not really suitable and that's actually
why we decided to write it from scratch
and currently the dmn standard is out
for a couple of month and we are only
member we are contributing to the
standard so we basically based it on the
MN and then it can really do complex
stuff which is quite interesting so
that's an example I see out there quite
often it's like skill-based routing you
want to want to route the task to the
right people and the right people is not
that easy to make the decision because
that involves like we have that that
from a basically from a real-life
example so we had that for example a
couple of exceptional cases like very
important customers big partners they
have special agents which work on them
then you need normally to decide the
required roles that's more or less a
hard decision most of the time so these
roles are allowed to do that or not then
you have to check all employees which
are which fit to that roles and are
currently available they are not on
vacation or on leave or whatever and
then it gets weaker the next decision is
very weak because you want to score the
best of them so now you have a pool of
possible options and now you want to
score which one really should do it and
there we did like a scoring model on dmn
which basically incorporates a lot of
the inputs like is it in the same region
so they normally want to want to handle
that regional so if your and Antwerp
normally the Antwerp office should
handle it
but if that's really packed maybe
Brussels could do that as well
like the yeah the experience of the
employee and that and so on so on okay
experience of the employee was
interesting because they didn't have
that information they didn't have the
information what is the experience of
the employee but they
in the host and COBOL Joey nice and they
have thing of approval Authority they
have this guy is he is allowed to
approve like up to 1000 years or up to
5,000 yours because this is a hard limit
day they headed there and they
translated that by a small table into
experience okay and these kind of things
so it can make a lot of these decision
decisions really fitting together pretty
nicely and yeah we currently built or in
this case we build a bpmn project in
order to what I call a decision flow in
order to make that in a in a role
something interesting as well thing is
again I want to extract the whole flow
from my from my BPMN which is really
doing all the Overlord process model
that's important thing that okay one
last remark you you recognize I call it
decision engine we call it a session
management we don't call it rule engine
and that's actually the new term so we
don't talk about routes anymore business
who is more they really complex stuff
from the path if you and if you search
for rules that's actually a funny thing
to do is should do that you find a lot
of bad things like the red sign here the
or pay attention and they don't do that
and their rules so rules are and you
find some the Panda as well which is
quite puzzles why the Panda is there but
rules are a bad thing if you have rules
that's a bad thing to do it you have to
follow rules but decisions are a great
thing right you have a choice you can do
the right choice and these kind of
things so and that's why we nowadays
focus on the decision management like
because the decision is what you want to
do you need rules in order to do the
decision but the decision is the thing
we want to do and that's a positive
thing you have other okay great
so we already tackled MB payment we
checked out DM n so far the last thing
is about cm MN which I haven't shown yet
so what we experienced in a lot of
projects out
is as soon as the people are starting to
use be payment or in order to make these
nice little processes and they automate
it at this point they normally
understand who if I do that I have to
follow that process model I really have
to do that I cannot work around that so
if I have like a couple of user tasks in
a row I have to have them in a row and
then we often have discussions like okay
if I have to do that decisions I have to
do a lot of things like these are really
good paid guys okay they have to have
possibilities - for example to get some
additional documents to ask their team
leads so if you're not looking at car
insurance but if you're looking at life
insurance or health insurance it's a
much more complicated thing to do and
this is hard actually to put in to be
payment we did that in the past so what
you can do in BPMN is for example you
have so-called event sub processes maybe
that's not common to everybody's with
the dotted line here then you have a
so-called message start event and which
is it started again so it's non
interrupting that means when I'm in the
decide about application task I can send
in a message to additionally with a
parallel flow basically start their task
so that means when I'm here it can start
these guys independently additionally
that gives some flexibility right
because I haven't modeled it in the in
the in the flow and then you can this
these things are normally you can
imagine that by showing by basically
looking into the user interface where
you see for example my application from
earlier I might see what's currently
running but I have the possibility to
start additional activities and for this
certain application so I have the
overview and I as a human can decide
when I looking at it what I should do
additionally but thing as this gets
pretty unhandy and BPMN if you have lots
of possibilities like you don't only
three of them but you have like 100 of
them and this might even be only
possible with some circumstances like
for health insurance a lot of things are
only possible if you already have some
injuries if your smoker or certain age
or whatever so there are a lot of
conditions when these things are
possible or not and this is where we're
basically the boundary of possibilities
for BPMN is so this is where cm MN jumps
in and that was basically the idea from
the MT so when I in the BPMN process so
come on Abbi family can use a call
activity there and then refer to a CMM
and case CM MN this is how cm MN looks
like you recognized a lot of the
activities from BPMN basically so the
overall thing is a so-called we make
that faster a case so within the case
you have a so called stage so these
stages basically yeah like like a scope
where you currently in then you have a
couple of tasks this is what you
recognize from BPM and like a human task
it's not called user task but it's
basically the same or a process task
which basically refers to a BPMN process
again so that's the easy part and then
you have milestones my stones are easy
to understand as well so you can reach a
milestone at a certain point in your
case that's easy and then you have a
couple of things which are more more
hard to understand so first thing is you
have these so-called sentries they are
pretty interesting a sentry is basically
kind of a guard for an element here so
in a sentry you can configure a
condition again for for communal that
means draw a unified expression language
for example and within that sentry you
can configure the condition in that case
if the process variable the case
variable were approved for example was
written to true or false okay so we can
relate to
within the case and then you have these
so called it's so called on part but
these connections here which says and I
can only reach that milestone
if this stage was ended okay so this is
not like a sequence flow and bpmn it's
not like an order it's just based on the
the conditions I have here so as soon as
this is ended and the proofed is true I
reach the milestone approved but I made
it more complex here in order to explain
the idea but only if some conditions are
true which mean I don't need to approve
that decision it might be that depending
on the BIA whatever may be the car or
maybe the pricing or whatever let's say
every every like claim handling every
claim above 2000 euros needs an
additional approval then I can add that
to the conditions here and then I will
not reach the milestone but I will reach
that user task and that gets activated
at that moment so it's a lot about these
conditions again you might already guess
that in the background these centuries
might be expression language might be
dmn again so you can put everything
together there and then there are
additional markers like the place symbol
or these hash the place symbol basically
means that you can configure if this
task is directly started so it's
directly put on your task list or if
it's not started and you have to have to
make that manually and the hash tag
basically means I can do that multiple
times so it's a repeating thing so in
this case the approval here could decide
that the application decision should be
re-evaluated and that's expressed by
that one so what you can already see is
that it's much harder to understand how
the case works from what you see in the
model but the other side of the other
side of the coin is that you have a lot
of flexibility to do that in here okay
so that adds another two to the top
there
so what we basically envision on the on
the platform on the kimono BPM platform
is that we have all of the three
standards implemented there so you can
use whatever you need for your job so we
have the BPMN part pretty mature what I
said earlier we have CMM N which is a
pretty early stage and we have dmn which
will be implemented in seven four
release which will be very very
interesting I think so that's what you
get on the kimono BPM platform and what
you can what you already saw we are
building tooling for all of that so you
will have the to chain on the modeling
part on the operating part you will have
like what I said earlier the very easy
engines everywhere so you can really do
a lot of things in there
I have architecture slide so I want to
want to get to that actually before time
is up
yeah so that's actually from the
homepage so that's basically what's
driving us so I'm I'm yeah basically
going over conferences for the last like
five years a lot actually talking about
workflow and what I always experiences
if you tell the people how we're doing
BPM it's like BPM I use that once that
was pain and it's not like that anymore
so it's really easy to use it's it's
even fun for Java developer so that's
actually what we're trying to achieve
with all of that so yeah whatever I
showed you all the components that we
already tackled so we have the engine
it's basically based on a relational
database we have the task list cockpit
we have an admin interface not that
interesting we have the modeling part so
we basically tackled all of that one
thing I want to want to show you at the
end as if you look at it from an
architecture point of view so what I
showed you so far is you could use the
engine as a simple jar so that's
basically what I did here right so I
just have a maven dependency I have the
jar so I can directly start it you could
do the same thing with spring so you can
start up the end in the process engine
the case engine the decision engine with
spring so
can embed that within your own
deployment you can use spring boot if
you like so that doesn't matter actually
you can use drop without or whatever so
it can start that up embed it into your
own thing what we also have is the
integration in the application container
and like JBoss in my case i have wild
fly here so i have running wild fly
where we already start the engine as
service of the container so when you
start the container it started that in
white fly it's a module orange avos it's
the module in Tomcats is a bootstrap
listener which start up the whole stuff
in websphere or GlassFish or WebLogic
it's an RAR file resource adapter which
is started up during starting time of
the container and then you can deploy
simple war or you files just normal
deployments that's actually what I did
here right with my insurance
applications so that builds a normal war
file and there I just add the BPM n DM n
and MC m MN files and then they get
picked up automatically they we scan the
class path and are deployed to the
central engine which already runs in the
application server and that means you
even can do things like having multiple
war files and within the war files
having different B payment models or DM
n models but you still could reference
like in a call activity like a sub
process which is maybe a reusable one
like output management or these kind of
things or decision you want to reuse
over different processes and the they
can be related can be part of a
different war file so you can really
separate stuff there that makes it very
easy to use actually so that's the
environment we normally recommend to do
I'm you if you want you can still use it
with remote file so you can just put it
there use the REST API sand that's it ok
so I already showed you that it's very
easy to start that by by API
that the process application I just
showed you that's not that interesting
so the thing is if you want to get going
go to come on at a torque that's
actually where the open-source project
is living on my browser don't want to so
if you don't to come under a torque you
find the download if you want to get
started I think the easiest thing is get
a distribution so you get the container
already with the engine
so either Tomcat or white fly is a good
choice nowadays that's what we can do
then go to the documentation so it's
Doc's comunidad maybe go to latest
because we revamped all the stuff so
it's much nicer here and then for
example you can have a lot of the
reference guides and these kind of
things here we have a get started guide
there so it's easy to get up to speed
there which is maybe not that easy to
find go to Network comunidad or they've
find a lot of material around for
example yeah like webinars white papers
I mean German version sorry and that
might be interesting for the beginning
like a complete free online training so
if you're interested in that just
register in the network and then you're
ready to go we're doing a lot of live
meetings so they are not only in Germany
for especially for Belgium or France
would be interesting to find hosts so if
you're thinking hey that's great we want
to host some such a community event let
me know yeah and if you want to have an
enterprise edition we have an Enterprise
Edition obviously go to commando.com
there if even find the advantages of the
Enterprise Edition so you get the SLA
base support and a bug-fix backporting
and all these kind of things trainings
consulting that's basically what we are
doing and if you if you like get a
poster we have a couple of not much
actually left at the booth otherwise
give us your email we can send you over
some copy either hardcopy via snail mail
or in the PDF version so we have a post
over the whole example we have our book
there so if you want to get a freak
Pete just drop our booth we have a we
have a pile of books not that much
actually but a couple of them are left
and yeah thing is that's for me always
important it's really cool thing right
it's not like a black box became sweet
it's not a hard thing to do it's really
it's fun in some way to really to do it
so yeah just get going think that's it
so thank you guys for for listening
you maybe have time for no time left
okay if you have any questions I'm at
the booth</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
