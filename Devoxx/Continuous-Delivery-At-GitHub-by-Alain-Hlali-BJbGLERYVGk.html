so I know the chairs are very comfy so
if you fell asleep during the priest or
can you don't want to be here it's a
it's a new one this one is ever get up
it's about gigabits about how do we
continuously deliver I'd get up so I
treat change the title about Chad offs
shut up supper get up it's bc the same
talk I've couple disclaimer first I will
not be handing t-shirts away after the
talk I've been asked for a lot of
t-shirts sorry don't have them the other
thing i want to share is also everything
that starts with get is not geared up so
sometimes it's good to you know we might
people out get was actually started by
leaning toward ten years ago now and 11
years now actually and it's it's a core
component of our platform but we are
just one contributor out of many but one
of the biggest contributor obviously and
we created on top of that platform
called get up actually get up started
eight years ago it was really a way for
us to better collaborate better using of
kid because GUID was is great the best
was good management that you can find
today but it's not great to share ideas
and our wall the world concept of our
founder is really was really to find a
better way to exchange ideas together
and to not only send packages of code
across emails but to starting of storing
the idea storing their concepts during
the discussions about the code and and
keeping that you know fruit i'm so other
people are joining later the teams could
discover all that information and not
not having to get you know four words of
all the emails for the last years or so
with the project so that's when i get up
started basically um fast forward fast
forward to
a gear Ibiza is a very distributed on
company you see it's actually an old an
old map of the employees of get up we
have that real-time system where we can
see where everybody is on the planet we
are now 600 employees this was a couple
months ago and you can see that we are a
super distributed company and that's
always been the case I get up and there
is a good reason where I'm sharing that
with you because it's it's part of the
way we're working basically we want
everybody to be where it makes the most
sense for them to be where it's where
they are the most productive basically
so you can basically work wherever you
want we have people who don't have a
home they are going from one country to
another and they work that way we had
people who are living an RV and going
across the u.s. and they stopped some
places and they work from there but the
world that our world organization is
based on the fact that we don't care
what you are you can walk wherever you
want and we make sure that you don't
need to be next to the coffee machine to
be aware of what's going on in the
company right the chit chats next to the
in the mid pack or next to the water
cooler should not be required for you to
be aware of what's going on oh and it's
a very important part of our culture I
go in depth that so we have people over
the world and can see we've got people
in Hawaii we get people in Australia we
have people in Europe in Japan and these
people might very well be in the same
team so in a one-team you could you
could have someone in Hawaii someone in
Australia somewhere in Europe we have
team of five or six people and this
these people should be able to work
together and again regardless of where
they are and you can imagine that when
you have such distributed team it's
quite hard to have discussions it's
quite hard to to do a stand-up Mina
meeting it's even how to do a webex
right you can have a you can have a good
time frame for meeting on
that feeds people who are scattered all
over the world that way so we because of
that and it's just one we done out of
many but because of that we decided that
we need to have a very Breeden oriented
culture so everything is we're gonna get
up and we have a say that if something
is not written if something doesn't have
a link that you can share then it
doesn't exist right your conversation
that you are next to the water cooler
doesn't exist or the decision you made
in that meeting room doesn't exist if
you cannot share the link about
everything that was said during that
decision that discussion and what were
the reason why you took that decision
and the matter of fact if you using gear
up are people using Kira yeah oh okay if
you using get up you know that
everything you're doing basically has a
link an issue as a link a pull request
is a link a comment in an issue as a
link so you can set a link just that one
comment and everybody will be able to
receive a link and see exactly what you
are looking at when you send a link so
we took that concept very far and it's
very central to our fee but we have
other there are wherever there are tools
and techniques but our main goal behind
that is to be able to deliver and
deliver quickly wherever you are in
whenever it is so this is a graph of the
number of deployments we did in
prediction so on github com in a given
week so that was in May May twenty six
week was actually four day week because
there was a holy day on the Monday and
you see the number of deployments in
github com goes almost all the way up to
480 480 deployments in a given week on
gear up calm I hope you didn't see that
week a lot of you know error screen
angry unicorns that's what we have when
there is a problem sometimes that
happened but we basically managed to to
create something which allows us to
deliver whenever we want seamlessly
without anybody seeing anything any
change any done time and you whatever on
our web
there are good reasons for doing that
for us one of the main reason being you
know being I think we had number 56 in
the ranking of the most popular website
on the planet we have a we have about 40
million visitors per month so you can
imagine that we have couple servers in
our data center and what we what we
figure out is that there is no way for
us to be able to create a test
environment that will work for that
scale of traffic we're facing for
diversity of traffic we're facing and
with all the components we have to go
through for you know when whenever we're
serving one request so we our conclusion
was the only way to validate some some
code the only way to make sure that some
code is production really is to release
it into production and see how it works
so that's why we're deploying so often
you know we're not we don't have that
many features that we need to deploy 80
times a day but every time we're
developing something when we want to
validate that we push it to production
and we see how it works all right and
I'm going to show you today how we do
that while all the tools were using and
actually all the tools were using or
most likely most of them you could use
them as well I mean there is no this was
hard complexity over there it's just a
matter of organization it's just a
matter of thinking that you can do it
and then it's super easy and so some
people sometimes tells me yes but you
know I'm a bank I cannot do that on BS i
cannot do that we are the customer
called the JPL the Jet Propulsion lab
the guys who are doing the the enzymes
for for the NASA they want to do
continues delivery and they do
continuous delivery and so it's it's
really about thinking about the
trade-off because you're what people
always tell me like yeah if there is a
bug in prediction what happens but first
of all there's always bugging prediction
and how fast can you fix them so when
you have a bug in your jet that's going
into space what happened if you cannot
fix it what happened if you have one bug
and on the other end you can fix it in
couple seconds well maybe that's better
right because the jet goes back to
trajectory and that might be better so
maybe you guys more bugs in production
but you're fixing them faster so you
know think about that trade-off that
might be better and I think it's better
for a lot of companies so how do we do
that so what's our secret that won't be
a secret anymore because I'm going to
share everything obviously but there you
go so first of all and I'm going to go
in depth about visa these four different
points but the first thing is we needed
a common philosophy and I mean I urge
you to start thinking about you know
your team and are we you know in your
team are you all thinking the same way
about features but the way you develop
you might have a common workflow but
even in a given workflow there are some
room for people doing different things
so we have that common philosophy I'll
show you that to you right after a
second is communication so I showed you
that we are all over the planet and
being able to share information
regardless of where you are is super
important so that concept of a sequence
communication goes also beyond that and
and we go over that as well because
she's delivery of course uh we cannot do
that you cannot deploy that many times
today in production if we don't have a
solid continuous delivery platform and
that goes for something that's we call
chat ups so chat ups you will see it's
basically doing devops for a chat client
and it's fun but it's also super useful
and I'll show you why all right so first
of all come on philosophy so that's what
we call the Zen of get up it's a it's a
list of things that we try to keep in
mind when we developing feature and it's
very simple it's about like okay are we
going to develop for three weeks and
then start sharing this code with our
colleagues or do we rather break down
everything so we develop only for three
days and start
sharing after three days and but having
more like pull request open for instance
so it's a lot of thing that way where if
you're not doing or if you if you don't
go all in the same direction then it's
going you're going to have some clash in
the in the team at one point and it's
going to show in the code as well and
you can imagine that us being so
distributed you have many cultures many
ways of saying things are many
backgrounds we don't you know we didn't
go to the same cooks cooling systems so
there are a lot of differences between
people and how they approach things and
help the approach complexity for
instance so it was super important for
us to have that common view of things so
every developer I gear up we know that
it should not walk on you know by
himself on the corner for weeks and
weeks and weeks before sharing something
that's that doesn't work in our company
it needs to be up on it needs to be
short it needs to be concise we need to
be able to deliver it quickly so we can
I eat a right on that you know it's
there is no fee there's no such thing
about like a feature that we're going to
spend years and years working on and
deliver that and see that maybe doesn't
work or it's our users don't want that
that would be stupid so that's our then
get up and actually I told you earlier
that everything needs to have a link
that we can share so if you go into a
https api that getup that comes a shot
took at and you call that several times
you will have one of these sentence
showing on your screen and you can go
through that on your own so it's
actually the first sample of our API CPU
if you want to try out leveraging our
API so you can find out that stuff its
public so that's the first thing second
thing is that s equities communication
and it's obvious that at cecconi's
communication is very important for
distribute distribute team like ours
because there is no again time for a
webex there's no time for a physical
meeting it's not possible to have that
so that's the first reason why we
started that way but if we're talking to
your our founders they will tell you
that even when they were on the
four of them all in sick on Valley sorry
in the same office they were hardly ever
talking to each other and there's a good
reason for that they were saying that if
I'm talking to you while you're coding
I'm interrupting your flow you were def
thinking about something coding
something and I'm asking you a simple
question that it's going to take you
maybe 30 seconds to answer even shorter
maybe but you're going to lose a lot of
time and some some researcher depth
in-depth study about that and they find
out that it will take you about 15
minutes to go back to your regular
cutting flow when you being interrupted
15 minutes to get back to the speed of
code that you are out before you can
imagine that it's really it's really big
right the number of times you being
interrupting on a given day it accounts
to probably an hour at the end of the
day because think about it I mean when
you're calling something you hardly ever
are just 15 you're probably thinking
about several fights because you have
split your logic and your data and your
presentation in different files and you
have that model in line and as soon as
somebody's talking to you that mother
get flush I get flush like yeah like in
the toilets and you have to reboot that
stuff in your mind and we start you know
start back to very well so being able to
say okay instead of interrupting you
whenever I have a question well I'm
going to you know organize myself in a
way that I might be able to wait for
that answer at the end of the day you
know oh it can i can give you two hours
or three hours or maybe more to provide
me that answer and my colleague will
send me the answer when it's convenient
for them so when they down with
something like they've merged up or
requests for instance and they're ready
to you know that free time in their mind
they can start going back to slag going
back to the poor requires going back to
the issues to start answering my
questions and giving me feedback and
it's just as fine for me because I
probably I had some of the things to do
anyway and I can mucci task I can do
other things and it will the answer
would come either timely in a timely
manner that way
way but don't need that right away most
of the time so it's it's it's one of the
great benefit of that asynchronous
communication and that really works
whether you are distributed for the
world or that you are all in the same
room the other thing is a very often we
have meetings and I mean meetings is
like it's craziness we have so many
meetings I add some customer ones
looking at a developer schedule and he
calculated that the developer actually
is developing only sixty percent of this
day sixty percent you paid for a brine
code and you just writing code sixty
percent of your day it's not that you're
not doing any meaningful things for the
other forty percent but what if we could
give you back twenty percent of time of
coding would that be great maybe there
are some meetings where you drag the
developer for an hour and is really
useful in that meeting for ten minutes
and what about if we also could maybe
get that information in a different way
maybe you know have a system where
everything is open so everybody can grab
the information they need to create
their own report and that's what we're
doing basically I get up you know get up
it's funny because it's a it's a
developer to developer company for
developers so we are one of the few
company who really eats his own dog food
so it makes our life very different and
when we think about what we're doing
we're really thinking about how we can
improve our day to day life and it's
probably I hope it's probably impacting
your life as well as a developer so
being able to add more time developing
it's sometimes also like making sure
that your manager understand the way you
walk in and that it doesn't like set up
a meeting right in the middle of your
day or your afternoon or your morning
because if you have a meeting at ten
a.m. why are you going to start working
out at am probably not that big
refactoring stuff that's super useful
but that's going to be complex because
you know you just going to our like one
or two hours of work and it's going to
take you four or five hours to really
you know start that meaningfully so
you're just going to do some meaningless
things or like less important things
it's because it's different for you to
have two blocks of two hours of having
one block of four hours so educating the
manager sometimes about you know when to
schedule demeaning could save you also a
lot of times and that's that's the kind
of things we're trying to think about
being concerned about in order again to
make our life easier and being more
productive so that that all goes into
the umbrella the isochronous
communication that's super important and
then of course we use our tools so I as
I told you we are using our we are
eating our own dog food and for instance
we are never sending emails to each
other we are never sending emails to
each other we are just creating issues
when I want to talk to somebody I create
an issue in a repo and I got that
conversation starting for that and it's
it's I mean look think about it when you
put information in an email can you find
it back six months later right can you
look I mean you you know that it wasn't
an email you know it's somewhere you
cannot fight it and think about also all
right we discuss we discuss about that
wall new refactoring stuff we made
decision somebody was good enough to
technology send the notes to everybody
in the team and you have a new colleague
coming three weeks later what does he
know about that stuff how does he find
that information you want it's buried
it's lost you won't find any time
anymore so that's why we're using issues
we're just using issues you want to talk
to something about you know you won't
share an idea just create an issue and
it sends emails notification you can
reply for emails but it gets back into
an issue there are labels there are meta
data and it's searchable so you can you
can relate back to that and people who
are coming on in the cheer later people
who are we're on vacation they can catch
up they can discover the information so
it's super valuable um and then I don't
know if you've seen that who's been it's
been released a month ago you can now
organizer issuing Kanban boards and
walking projects so i don't know if
you've seen that it's super excited
about that stuff and comes it comes for
free and then we using pull request so
poor requests are so very interesting
things there are many many ways to use
pull request the wrong way I'm saying
the wrong way but I would say the not so
up to my way when I discuss with people
a lot of people I'm telling me that the
code you know they create their branch
the future branch they start coding on
that branch and at the end they open a
pull request to share with their teams
and say can I have come with you work
right but if the first comment of the
code review is like oh I would not have
used that stuff I would not have used
that framework I think you went in the
wrong direction well maybe we should
have talked about that before you know
because you've been walking on that
stuff you've met you made decisions and
if nobody agrees with your decision then
he might have lost couple you know days
of work and I'm going back on that it's
probably a bad idea and also what
happens if you're doing that that you
asking people basically to discover
everything you've done they have no idea
when they start to pull request when
they will start reading your code where
do you want to go you know what was your
you know your your logics what what what
was in your mind when you study that so
we're doing we're doing things are
pretty slightly different what we do
when we have a new new feature to
implement it as we open a new branch of
course a feature branch and we probably
going to create like a very small commit
somewhere or get things started so so so
you can just create the pull request and
then the developer start sharing why
it's going to do you know it's not about
what I've done is why am i opening these
pull requests what do we want to go what
am I thinking about in terms of impacts
are in terms of changes in the model in
terms of refactoring in terms of
whatever eyes
I'm going to share first with other
people were playing what I'm playing to
do and then my colleagues can start
jumping in the conversation and say yes
then don't forget to do that as well or
you know maybe you should not use that
stuff because we did something different
somewhere else you know you can imagine
whatever conversation we have so it's
happening these conversations are
happening before we start coding so then
you know when we start coding we know
that everybody agrees on the direction
we're going to and when the developer
when my colleagues are up to do a code
review they pretty much have an idea of
what they were they going to see you
know they're not surprised by anything
and they can send me back some good
information they and I'm maximizing that
time at the same time you know they know
exactly where to go where to look they
know what's important what's less
important they have you know they are
saving hours of code review paper week
just because they know already what we
are talking about and support problem
the other important part is to make sure
that you know asking code review on
forty thousand lines of code because
then you know your cookies are coming
and saying it was good go ahead and then
slowly useless I mean when you're doing
40 lines you have 40 comments let's
maybe too much but at least you have
meaningful feedback and I mean code
review is so important today I don't
know if you guys are using that but from
a quality point of view it's great
because you're going to be able to catch
some bugs that you might not see
otherwise and that your conscience
digression cannot see here and you make
sure so that the knowledge of the code
is distributed for the team because you
know sometimes you have you know these
guys charge of that part of the code and
they go in for vacations they're coming
back in two days there's a bug well
let's wait for him to come back because
by the time I'm read all that code it'll
be back anyway so let's let's you know
leave with that bug for now that's not a
great way of doing things and what if
what if he dies tomorrow right if you've
been doing car review consistently
doesn't matter if he dies
you know no matter you get the code you
know it you know the code base and so
it's a great teaching opportunity as
well what we're seeing that younger
people are learning by doing code
reviews to other people so it's not just
about the senior developer reviewing the
juniors code that's great they can they
can tell them things they can teach you
damn things but with the junior guy
reading the senior guys good did we
learn a lot of things that they've never
alone at school you know and they can
improve their own code by that so
everybody benefits from that so it's
really something that you you guys
should start doing more other and it
pays off right away there is no it's not
a waste of time I mean people some
people still believe that testing is a
waste of time I've met them I've met
some black very recently so some people
think that code review can be a waste of
time but honestly it pays off right away
all right so we're doing that a lot and
what we do also and that's uh that's
also something i encourage you on doing
is that we're sending back a lot of
feedback to the developer right the
great benefit of gate i think and it's
kind of a side effect but it's still a
great benefit is that it's easy to
create a lot of branches but it's also
easy to plug your conscience integration
tool to all these branches so whenever
juniper is creating a branch it creates
a pull request and that for request you
know triggers a notification to the
continued integration platform whenever
somebody's pushing some code and the
continued integration platform can send
back feedback to the developer right you
probably all do that already but most
people just get back one piece of
information like it's green oh it's red
and you've you know you've configured
Jenkins with like 45 different plugins
to get a love-filled of information back
and just have one green or red and
that's it so when it's red you know
what's red you know tamiha boy I need to
go in Jenkins look for it look for my
bill scroll down oh that's the stuff i
don't care
that stuff you know and I've just wasted
like five minutes to look for my my
error that I don't really care probably
ever so that's a huge waste of time
again and remember it's about getting
some time back to create some new
features so what you can do is use the
API is that we offer and you can send
back some intermediate status so you
know the linker is green the
computations green the unit test is red
you know it's not just about something
is red it's this stuff is right and is
that stuff important or not well you can
decide that so you can say okay these
studies for instance the the get up one
is required so you cannot merge it that
stuff is not green none of the stuff is
not that required it means good to have
nice to have but if it's red you can see
merge all right sure your decisions
developer and you guys can do that today
it means available it's very easy to do
it's just some HTTP API and you can you
can really improve your war your word CI
system because the CI system is really
about getting feedback to the developer
so why is developing or she's developing
she can get more information make better
decisions and go faster as well so go
ahead and do that and what we've done
also is we modify our Jenkins so it's
called genki it's actually open source
so you can you can download that so we
have direct link between our pull
request and our build status so
basically when I'm when I'm clicking on
the details here for instance for that
bill I'll go there and from there I can
click on the progress bar and go back to
my full request for instance so I never
have to do free clicks or even two
clicks I'm always one click away from my
information and I'm saving a lot of time
that way the other stuff we're doing is
that we are using our deployment status
as well so that's another API that you
can use because probably when you're
developing today you have some
environments that you can target before
going to the live production environment
you might have a test on
or a cue environment whatever other
environments you can think of and it's
quite convenient to be able to know that
that somebody deployed that feature to
some environment like I need I'm a
tester I need to test something I can go
and get up I can see all the prayer
requests being worked worked out and I
know that I want to test that one it's
important that feature really explaining
that I'm going to that feature i'm
scrolling down the story of that pull
request and I'm see I'm seeing hole I
can click on View deployment it means
that i will go to some environment
somewhere where this code is running at
the moment and i can see for myself how
it's running and i did not have to talk
to the developer to get that information
I haven't been interrupting anyone to
know that I can test that stuff it's
here it's still active because it could
be a could be a virtual environment that
I that's been spin off automatically or
it could have been erased by some other
deployment later I know all this
information and can see it for myself
super in Portland super valuable and
when you're looking at the history of a
pull request you can understand how many
times has been deployed which
environments we've been through I mean
you can really assess the release cycle
that we went through two to two other
feature running you can use that it's
again an HTTP API that we that we offer
all right so super valuable um let me
skip that one I'll go back on that later
other things again about reporting
without reporting that again that's that
you know do you lack do you enjoy doing
some reporting I guess not nobody like
that but you still need to do that you
still need to get you know information
back to product manager product owners
on while we've been working on this week
what are we delivered so that's kind of
dashboard where everything shows
automatically I don't know if you know
that but when you start up request you
can say it fixes and the issue number so
if your if your user stories comes as
issues you can reference the issues you
are fixing in a pull request and as soon
as you
requests you click the issues the
matching issues are closed so if you
walk in that way your product owner just
create issues and they know exactly when
you've been working on these issues
because there is a cross-reference
automatically generated and they will
know exactly when ever you have closed
all merge visible request again the best
reporting the one you don't you know
doing basically it's the most accurate
one and and it's very transparent there
is no more like yeah I think we are not
far back you know we are almost finished
developing that feature like let's say
we are eighty-five percent no I mean
you've done it or you've not done it and
that's very simple alright so that's all
the tools we using but then oh yeah
let's recap let's grab so what we doing
we're creating a future branch we are
adding very few commit and we are
putting the pull request right away and
then discussion happens come in happens
more discussion more commits review is
happening as well in the pro request and
then we ship the code alright we still
our on our field branch master is over
there that's big big fat line of their
headmaster and this is a feature branch
and so we shoot that code so you can
shoot that code to again a QA platform a
test platform whatever but as I told you
before we happen to that to
prediction and in order to do that in a
reliable way because you know doing 80
times a day that thing there could be
room for you know fat finger or like
some problem or you know thousands of
servers are involved in these
deployments there are multiple tiers
multiple databases which people you know
reuter proxies whatnot and we actually
manage all this layer support lee i mean
a proxy at get up is some code created
by get up because there is no get proxy
on the on the market or get ruler or so
it doesn't exist except together so we
have to end all these different tiers
that you're going for whenever you're
hitting a
the commit you know the coming button or
whatever so we created you but to help
us doing that so you body is doing a lot
of things for us it's a it's our where
there was actually an article on wire
labaad you but once you know I'd love to
have an article on on y al about me but
this is a robot and got that he's been
called the you know the hardest worker
of get up it does everything for us so
it does our deployments and i'll show
you how it works but it does so some
more fun things like you can can get us
some some maps on google maps can get
some images as well so you just see seen
slack we use slack but you can use
something else zubar is an open source
project it's just a nut GS runtime and
yes adapters for a lot of different chat
environment so if you use if chat or you
know other other stuff i don't think of
right now you can use it as well very
easy and you can create your own plugins
so we've created a lot of plugins sort
of tasks that you what can do we told
him a lot of things some are very
serious some are less serious so we can
have like the the food truck around the
the office we just ask you about and you
know the truck me come and give you that
information you can get you some
animated gifs so it makes things a lot
fun you can like our our our sales
people whenever they want to have some
information says force they don't go in
cessful to go to you got and they say
okay dot sfg see me and they say you
know whatever customer they want to look
information for and you bought go
successful and give that information
like you know they what our thinking now
i get up is that any time I have to do
something anytime I have a script to do
or system to interact with what most
likely the best way to do that is to go
for a you bot script that way I don't
need to log in to any system I'm just in
my slack environment and just work for
me right I don't need to know where it
is and the side effect of that is that
all that work I'm doing you know talking
to you but I'm doing that in front
of my colleagues because we are in slack
rooms and if i'm looking at a customer
and somebody else is also interested by
this customer then we can you know they
can say oh yeah I know what you're
looking at that because you know I that
discussion with that customer some of
the day likewise and I'll show you that
later or our you know sprung for
instance or our graphing systems they
are all accessible who you got in slack
so when I'm troubleshooting something
I'm looking at you know the response
time of the on page for instance
everybody knows that I'm looking at that
and people can jump in the conversation
and and tell me things that I'm not
aware of and they would not be able to
tell me that if I was looking at that on
my laptop you know being in Paris for
instance when my colleague is in San
Francisco and he knows about that and I
would maybe not at the idea to put him
over in the conversation but it just
seized what I'm doing so we can start
that conversation that way so another
great thing with you what is it kind of
listen to what happens so we can
configure you but to watch the activity
on some we pose for a given stock room
so each team as a slack room and each
team as is list of repo and you but will
tell me whatever is happening in the
report that I'm interested in in my team
slack room so whenever somebody is
opening an issue or commenting or
whatever well I know what's going on so
I don't need to know watch some
notification anywhere I mean slack and I
know what's going on over there and
likewise if in slot with referencing an
issue and we have a discussion in slack
about an issue well there will be a
comment by you but in the issue saying a
this is a link to that conversation that
happen in slack so I don't I don't need
to like copy and paste discussions to
send them back to to the issue to keep
the track of that it's is the cross
referencing is happening naturally so
I'm just using whatever tool I have to
you know to have that discussion if my
colleague is there is available to chat
we can shut up with that right away or
otherwise i would go to my
you and you put maybe longer of tax of
questions or thoughts or whatever else
but it's up to me to decide what do I
want to use because I'm not losing
anything I'm not afraid of losing
anything by using one of the two tools
so it's pretty it's pretty and then
comes the times where i wanted to point
my code so the developer wants to deploy
some code somewhere can just go to slack
and again it could be something else
like I'm not trying to sell these like
here and you just ask you but where can
I deploy so wzid is where can I deploy
and whenever there is a dot it means
it's a you but comment you could you
could also use a longer form will be you
but where can I deploy but we made it
shorter obviously and you will release
all the environments we have and and
this this particular command comes it's
open source as well so you can you can
use that command to list all your
environments and give some some couple
properties to define you know where they
are what kind of environment they are
and everything so all up to there its
standard anybody can can use that this
is no program and so the dropper we then
decide to use one of these environments
so for instance my colleague em do
decide to deploy the branch mobile on
the score now in the sky experiment from
the get up people to the branch lab
which was one of our environments listed
before okay you just need to say that
and then you what is going to pick up
that code and deploy that on servers I
mean then we have some you know we have
some scrip we're using top hat so you
but is going to work with our propel
environment to trigger the deployment
because you what even is not doing much
it's more like a middleware France if we
can put it that way and so the
deployment is going to be trigger and
couple minutes later you was going to
come back and say hey this is a variable
now it's been deployed and it got some
message back from the deployment system
from puppet hear about the the location
where
deployment can be seen and that that
link over there the mobile the minus 9
minus experiment blah blah blah blah
that's why you would get on the pre
request as well you know remember that
beauty remember on that will show as
well in the pull request so the
developer just need to click on that and
that's it it's done so you see the great
thing about that is any developer can
arrive you know I'd get up and 10
minutes later they can start deploying
things they can mess up anything here
right it's hard to mess up that small
small workflow so we've been able that
way to deploy in the shower in our
branch lab system but then we again we
want to devote to the production
environment because that's where things
are really happening for us that's where
we test everything so that's where we
test everything but we've test
everything before you see we don't wait
for the personal environment to make the
basic test and so the production
environment is a little trickier right
you don't want two people to deploy some
test codes at the same time you want to
make sure that one person goes after the
other ones and you want to make couple
checks as well to just just to be sure
right so the first the first safety
measure we have that only one person at
a time can deploy in the production
environment so there is a queue so you
need to wait in the queue to be able to
deploy anything so the developer can ask
you but why is the stages of the queue
because if you have 25 person in the
queue you might you know you might
decide to go back coding and come back
later so here we see that we have couple
guys in the queue somebody is using is
using the environment already and
another one is in the queue so it's very
manageable so the the developer can say
ok q me to deploy qm TD and it will give
the reference of his branch so you but
can you know I remember that this guy
wants to deploy and come back to him
later so you see the time it was 343
it's a real surreal disappointment right
I'm not making up anything here so it
was free 43 in 350 for you but comes
back and say you up it's your turn now
to
to deploy things so you see it goes
pretty quickly right you don't want to
you don't want to have people hugging
the the production environment for hours
and hours again we have a lot of
requests per seconds so if something
goes wrong we can see it pretty quickly
we don't have to wait for users to come
they always come so that way that's why
our our turnaround is pretty pretty
short and on top of that and I'll show
you that later the developer needs to be
there physically in front of the screen
to monitor everything that's going on to
make sure that eastcote didn't break
anything so 21 minutes later the
developer can say okay I want to deploy
my code to this environment prod /
canary so it's a subset of our
production environment and then you but
makes couple checks so you bought checks
for instance that your branch is not
behind master because if you are being a
master you're going to remove some
features I will be unfortunate so there
are a couple of checks that way we will
check the status of the CI so remember
earlier there was some required studies
some you know some feedback from the
conscious integration while we're going
to double check that the developer has
the right and to deploy given the status
of the city's the CI one school but
that's all there in project to make sure
that we're not breaking anything so okay
you was going to do the job and get back
to the developer a little bit later so
it was surely less than a minute and to
give back a list of all the servers that
I've been impacted so you know the
grayed out production servers and that's
it again I can't break anything doing
searching you know it's very hard to
break that that workflow because it's so
simple anybody can do it so it's in the
production environment it's super easy
to to check then the developer most
likely nobody will see what happened
over there nobody will see if there is a
new feature on you baron or whatnot
nobody you will see that because we
you have some feature flags and we have
an application supports us as well you
can download it to manage our feature
flags so we can decide that this button
will show only for visa and these people
on this and this repo and only you know
during a couple days or whatever I mean
we can really decide from an external
tool how that feature is going to show
up so that way we can introduce a lot of
new things without anybody noticing and
then we can open the knob later and say
okay now everybody can see it or now
only this organization can see it it's
very easy to manage so we've deployed
unto our canary environment and now we
want to deploy to the production
environment so likewise the developer
see as the as the lock under on the
production environment so you can still
use it for doing other things and you
can decide to deploy to prod and again
same thing happens again we just need to
deploy branches that you know basically
if something was going wrong so if the
developer decided that the deployment
and canary was not good the curl was not
good where it needs to do is just deploy
master it depots my story is the world
back of the feature it just created and
that's it so either I'm deploying a
feature branch either I'm deploying
master and I always go back to a solid
state that way easy you can can't mess
it up so what we ask the developer role
is that it needs to monitor what's going
on so he has been about to deploy code
but in his to monitor what's going on
the production environment because he's
the most likely person to understand the
exception that are showing up all the
problems that can appear because he
knows what kind of Cody's been deploying
all right e so we give them some tools
and we actually give him all the tools
he needs two more everything so there is
no like one team as the monitoring one
team is coding it's like everybody's
monitoring and everybody has access to
all the monitoring tools because if you
don't know what code has been deploy how
effective can you be at monitoring or
diagnosing what's going on in the system
so we have that tool and we have the
another tool called haystack so
in a haystack obviously you're looking
for needles and every exception is
called a needle and what you see on the
timeline here is a picture of all the
engineers that have deployed something
so if you see in the timeline and this
is a response time of the of the
homepage of the pages and get up so if
you if you see a problem in between two
deployments while you know that the one
on the left is the person responsible
for that deployment and you can
obviously contact that person but you
see you see directly the pull request or
the compare page on the pull request of
that deployment so you can isolate
immediately the amount of code has been
deployed through you know during that
during that deployment and you don't
have to you know investigate all the
code base you have or like the 25
feature you released every month in
production you know that's only one
feature one set of code and it's very
fast to then read for that and find the
bug right you have just one pro requires
to examine not 25 of them so it's really
a lot faster to assess any problem and
it's a lot faster to diagnose the
problem so it faster to work back
eventually or to fix the problem all
right it's still going back to that not
that jet that goes in space if you can
fix the problem quickly then it's not
such a program anymore but if you cannot
fix it then it's good so we have that
and then what happens or so is you but
again is listening to our different
systems so we don't have somebody in
front of nagios for instance or some of
the system you might use to to watch the
art you body's doing that for us and
think about it whenever you have
something to diagnose in your production
environment you have an incident for
given up you always go through the same
indicators why are you checking you know
you're checking the response time
checking the cpu checking you know all
these systems are part of your
application what the studies there are
all these steps you going through almost
every time you have an incident well if
you're doing it all the times it means
you're wasting your time because you
could automate that
so whenever we have like for instance
beasts incident here this particular
like hey stock slow queries per minute
what you was going to report us inside
that there is a problem but you boys'll
is also going to create the issue for us
so we can track that you by screening
the issues putting the right levels
putting the right information over there
so the name of the incidents the
description of the incidents as it's
been recorded somewhere but also it's
going to grab the studies of all the
systems will usually looking at so
instead of going to system a and B and C
and D to get all the information while
you body is doing that put all that
information in an issue it's going to
look at some graphs as well again put
down the issue so whenever some
engineers need to diagnose the issue he
goes to the issue that program sorry
we're going to the issue and we have all
the usual suspects you know all the
things you always do when you're
diagnosing something it's here what you
might need to go further why the
solution might not be there but actually
but you actually have all the basics you
need to get started and then you need to
you know start doing your your foot
process and investigate that stuff but
the usual stuff and here you see it will
have been at three or four different
systems though I will need to go to to
get all that information everything is
right over there likewise I told you if
I need to look into my logs we are
sprung styes ingesting all our logs I'm
just going to slack and I get some
comments to query my my sprung clogs and
again I'm doing that in front of my
colleagues they can see what I'm doing
and they can jump in the conversation
and tell me hey I know what you're
looking at or that kind of program is
happening when you're doing this and
within that with seven times and we have
conversation about the problems or
junior people can just sit and enjoy
this like discussion and see how other
people are diagnosing be screening
programs and they can follow their fault
process and they can do that you know
you can come back go back in time so
people can look at incident up in like
two days ago and understand what was the
thought process of the people
and love for that likewise graphs
everything is available for that so
let's say everything went well we can
now merge with master it's only after we
are validated that something works in
production that we merging with masters
because master should always be the
branch that you can redeploy whenever
there is something wrong so master
should be only way they'd be code that
you can redeploy whenever something else
is going wrong so we mentioned master so
do / just click on the merge button and
it's as you see it says okay I confirm
that coding prediction that works and
then what happens that you bought detect
that the branch I was deploying
prediction is now merged so we can
release the lock we can give the log to
somebody else and the process is just
finishing the next one is the Q gets
gets to deploy then and the process is
over and that's just that super simple
do you have any questions yeah can you
speak loud yeah you get flow light we
use what we call get up flow we use get
up flow I mean get flow get fro is so
much more complicated you have
long-running branches you have to apply
a patch to different branches it's a
great opportunity to fight finger or
something so we we like to make things
easy as possible other questions
oh yeah sorry I can see ya do we have a
new world box yeah that happens that
happens and rod backing is just
deploying master again that's it I mean
we very often of the question about also
database schema and we created a
framework again open source called ghost
we using my sequel so we have a tool to
migrate schema without any interruption
and we leverage a lot to be agile team a
level so we can we can change the scheme
out there is no interruption that we
start with whatsoever it's pretty
efficient as well yeah so what well
whenever whenever there is a the
question is about what happened when you
have above a schema change and a feature
change so we doing things in two steps
so we will first do the schema migration
and make sure that the schema migration
is you know the code needed to access
the data it's a pretty straightforward
layer that we have so it's easy to
change that we found messing up anything
and then we can build features on top of
that so it's like there is a separate
pull request for that and it's quite
easy to do that it's just a matter of
breaking down the work in ways that
cannot cannot fail yeah
yeah so yeah two to make sure the branch
is on top of master are we using
rebasing or so they are there are
several ways so the developer can we
base itself is branch himself if he
wants but also you bought if there's no
much conflict you but can create a fake
like a like a virtual branch that is the
result of the rebase so you but can do
that for me I don't necessarily have to
do that when deploying you but can do
that to Mike Lee as well so but later on
when the developer wants to merge its
pull request it's up to the developer to
decide why why what a or she wants to do
we don't have we don't have a really
Janet get up about marriage or rebirth
we don't care these stories in the pull
request a story is not in in the gig log
so don't care with that if somebody is
raising his hand and I'm not seeing it
oh yeah okay because I got the light my
my face so I can see you have to scream
sorry can you speak a little louder
probably writing it
um stuff too so the questions are what
the amount of time we spend talking
about code rather than writing code and
to have that kind of social coding
that's why we call it social coding
activities it's hard to tell 30 to tell
but i will say that we spend probably at
least one or two hours talking
discussing about each other's code in a
given day yeah but I mean the benefits
you know it's better design better code
so let's box at the end of the day and
placed I'm refactoring things or so
there's there's a I mean really pays off
but yeah I will think one hour to two
hours a day now I can see oh yeah I can
see you so but I see us all ends oh good
question no because we don't we don't
want our salespeople to deploy code so
there is a there's two levels of of
security as there are two ways to
enforce security first of all you but as
different behaviors in different slack
rooms so there are some comments are now
available in certain slack rooms so if
you have access to that slack room you
will be able to to to trigger these
comments and then for the most sensitive
ones we have a second factor
authentication so we received a
notification on our phone to confirm
that we are the person who is typing
that comment on slack and we need to
acknowledge channel 4 and then the
command is getting trigger yeah we yeah
we secured a little bit we for that
leaving everything up to two slack for
our own security was not such a good
idea you have two minute left
yeah yes yes we do that we do whatever
something is going wrong we doing
postmodern or whenever a large project
is over we do post-mortems as well to to
learn from that yes definitely will you
allow them yeah
to master Adam into to product
production
well yeah I mean if if we have an
emergency like we see that something is
really wrong and we need to act quickly
on that then we know that we can
redeploy master but obviously sometimes
we have bugs that are still existing in
our cut base then it's just the same
cycle again we create a pull request
which in the code and we push that code
in prediction to fix the bug and what we
can do to avoid waiting in the queue
when send emergency that we can we can
leapfrog everybody and do an emergency
deployment so we we can just say okay
you know I'm the first you know whatever
is happening right now just get out of
my way and I need to push that code in
production right now so we fix about
yeah yeah because the feature might
still be useful so yeah
no no no it's a everything is in the
u.s. right now and it's can't give you
all the details but no not yet we're
doing step 2 to be to improve our
distribution over the world but right
now it's so fairly narrow geography I
mean several places but not not several
continents all right I think my time is
up I'll be on the roof we have a gear a
boof over there we have stickers and I
can get more questions thanks everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
