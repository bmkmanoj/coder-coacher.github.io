hi you're here to hear about home
automation practice I think so
that's Cal minute but first off Who am I
well I'm Dan most people know me here
one of those kinds of DevOps but here
I'm not here as a teacher of adaptive is
I'm here actually more so technologists
I decided my house has other dumb I saw
other people playing the cool stuff and
I thought I want a cool stuff too so
here's me as my role as a hacker
animaker
i've been hacking homes and things for
years so I spend money so you don't have
to it's really what it's all about this
isn't a serious talk at all I'm going to
get nervous out of watching this back on
YouTube really this is it this talk does
get ramen tea it gets rather frustrating
because it has been really frustrating
journey but really what I want to do is
give people a sense of what's possible
with the things that are out there on
the market so there's many things that
you can do there's loads of different
technologies out there and I had a few
people come up to me said what are you
doing why are you doing this what about
the security you could what should I buy
I want to cover the important topics
like security privacy protocols hubs so
many herbs than you have but we're not
going to talk about building your own
devices or hubs so if you're here hoping
to hear about rewiring your house or
planes with mains lectures at sea this
is not the talk for you I try not to die
rule number one do not be on fire I took
that very seriously this is a
conversation about really what's
available commercially what you can plug
in play with I really wanted my wife be
able to control my house as well as me
because I spend enough of my life fixing
people's laptops in my family and I
don't want to be fixing my house -
hopefully we'll end up with some use
cases that will give you a good idea
about the things that I've achieved how
I've done it and at least give you a
sense of what I did to do it and you can
do the same way and have all the things
fun but this this isn't going to be a
deep dive into code we do have a bit of
code but
not much enough to show you why you I
really wish I didn't have to go this
stuff if you do want to learn about open
HTTP and you want to as a talk go talk
to your home it was done by juice number
I've completely butchered didn't they my
apologize to this year in the room but
eager to talk dem ox last year and on
talking to my home go along to hear and
you can figure out all the different
tools and stuff that you use for that
but we're going to take a different path
this is a story of my journey and I do
apologize this is incoherent because it
will be incoherent and in fact I'm going
to skip slides because this is me I'm a
conversation with you as people who are
interested in the space rather than me
trying to produce something nice and
polished so I'm happy to share any
detail or give me questions afterwards
I'm going to be around so if any of this
ignites an idea in your mind or thoughts
as to hey what about this do come and
talk to me after so before the what
comes the wide well it should do so I
wanted to get peace of mind I wanted to
build a house that I could underfoot
damn it did I leave the oven on did I
lock the front door I also have to
answer the simple questions a little
down it did I leave the window open the
things when you're driving down the m6
on the holiday for two weeks and we like
damn it did I do F I also wanted it to
be more secure we're getting all this
data about my house I've ever heard been
in bed and you hear a creep downstairs
I now know if someone's out there's
probably care I also wanted to save
money I didn't quite work out how I
wanted I'll explain a bit more later but
ultimately really what I cared about was
being the developer that I am I want to
be lady I don't want to have to think
about a lot of the stuff that I do to
get me to where I want to be to do the
stuff I need to do so I started off with
the premise that my house isn't very
talkative so I need more data so I can
do stuff so how do I get data so if we
have a look at the range of different
things that we can do with home
automation it looks roughly like this I
mean this is
image ourselves Internet thank you into
it but if we start off to the top we can
see that we're covering things like
music garage doors blinds and curtains
Watson alarmed heating is that the CCTV
lighting and presence detection
entertainment and sprinklers electrical
outlets all these can be controlled by
buttons apps and voice but before we go
into each of these areas let's talk
about some platform commonalities holy
crap
well is protocols I thought this was a
solves problem apparently it's not we
can be split basically into two
different types of networks you'll end
up in your house you'll have Wi-Fi and
you'll have mesh mesh is built up of a
set of different networks depending on
which company depends on which one I
choose yeah so we have lightweight so it
runs on 433 megahertz we add a genie
like this so anytime you get pick up any
Benjie new testing much only energy like
this unfortunately it looked like it was
a great direction and then people came
up with z-wave holds dead weight like
everyone called the zero and z-wave plus
which is kind of compatible but not
really
z-wave runs at 900 megahertz because
it's double it must be per twice as good
right but smart things
Piper things like that will run on this
frequency smart things is from Philips
and we'll see a lot about that later
Big B is the main competitors their
drive and things run probably both at
the same time lots of devices when I'm
on both of those protocols especially
hubs but typically when you buy a sensor
it'll be one of these protocols my gut
has now been to go further said wave was
like beef because I've got in the herbs
that I can talk to just about anything
there is another one which is thread
which is 2.4 gigahertz and that's done
by Google Ness and that actually looks
like a really interesting protocol where
two different protocol there's Wi-Fi of
course Wi-Fi and you have a lots of
devices that actually just connect to
the network and you have hubs that talk
on the network through devices but you
also have hopes it just bridge into now
I don't think I figured out I have 15
wireless networks running in my house I
think I can't find them all
oh debugging wireless network just can
have and debugging Wi-Fi is hard enough
but Belkin Belkin sana harmony all these
will sit on your Wi-Fi network and you'd
have to worry about that too much
I kind of wish more did but it's really
energy inefficient and until we start
wiring our house with five volt
connections everywhere
and having those drop down by lights I
think that will be the price point of
which we can actually solve some of
these problems but we're not there yet
so we have this and thank you man Dulce
epitomizing my hel in in a nicer cutting
anyone who's not seen this this is how
standards create and how they
proliferate because we're going to do
everything in one else does and there's
one else does one more thing so if you
want to go back about start buying some
this stuff I strongly suggest you go and
have a look at this this breaks down the
key components and the benefits of each
of these protocols and gives a much
better articulation and I just have
about why you choose each so it's the
best one I found so far and it covers
their support more importantly it covers
the trade off and actually at the end of
it you'll probably end up with most of
them but least you'll have an
appreciation of why you're in the hell
you are so what's what have I done what
I've actually completed I have completed
some stuff kind of I've start off with a
sawn-off which is freaking addictive and
gets very expensive very quickly you buy
one little speaker you sit in the corner
you realize you can play absolutely that
you can play music from any of your
phones you know yeah and then you go oh
I needed another one you realize you've
got 22,000 and you could also use Amazon
echo it does play music rather badly and
Google home 2 speakers crap but you can
just plug them into any number of
Bluetooth speakers out there I just
chose saunas because frankly I was doing
this talk so I can right up against that
so yeah so my main issue is actually
these is if I'm talking to a like sir
which came out pretty much far down my
track is I either have to have Spotify
or I have to have Amazon's own music
service I don't I'm on Apple music and
I'm happy with Apple music this is my
but no I have to take you all over again
and what's worse Wi-Fi doesn't even have
the music I want you don't Apple how can
I use Apple tunes match and yeah dammit
so I've moved quickly on it's not myself
again depress and other things I'm going
to leave my house and it happened that I
was going to leave my house last night I
end up spending two and a half months in
America yeah yeah but what about my
house haven't I need my house to be
aware of what's going on and so Piper
was on my first purchase basically it's
an all-in-one box it has an inbuilt PIR
sensor so that's the thing here motion
sensor presence it's got a standard and
an infrared camera and it does motion
based with cloud recording it's got a
microphone and speaker in there because
really useful if you want to scare the
cat and a painfully loud alarm which can
make people accidentally it's great
security purposes and it's purpose-built
app this is unfortunately really
isolated but it does cover all of the
things I need I can look at my Piper and
see what's going on in my different
rooms from security perspective it's
really useful but unfortunately
isolating doesn't integrate well getting
events out of it and putting triggers
into it and we'll we'll talk about going
on harder and my routine later smart
thermostats fit into the heating area
and there's nest and energy need smart
radiator valves I've settled with hives
because I have a hot water tank and at
the time how was anyone that supported
hot water tanks now believes nest
supports open term I have no idea if my
water tank but open firm it doesn't have
it written on it and it's full of
lighting and I don't fancy ripping it
off find out but anyway I was pretty
dumb and it's rich it's basically just a
replacement for your old thermostat and
controller unit it still uses shed
joules but I want to do less scheduling
I want to be more articulate about my
interactions I want to say I want to
have three showers a day in the morning
and I want to be able to have two baths
at night
because that's how my house works he
just makes us in the hot water at those
times you just make sure I don't get in
the shower and halfway through I'm
frozen but we'll talk about how I
managed to achieve that or not later I
think is the most addictive my wife yes
but she loves all of our life and some
people in this room has seen what we've
done to our front room I've got ten
lights in my front room her kid you not
you end up it gets pretty crazy with
light strips and light bulbs and
sticking them everywhere it it's good
fun and actually it's a great talking
point in the kids that actually in love
with it but actually found it once we
were able to set scenes and able to
actually influence the color of our
lights and the dimming and have it
respond to the type of activity we're
doing as we started to compliment the
stuffs pretty damn well unfortunately is
frickin expensive and we wanted one act
that did everything for it so while
there are lots and lots of different
lighting systems we went for philips hue
it's expensive it's about 50 pounds of
color light and when you rack up that
I've got 25 lights in my five bedroom
house and 14 switches you start having
to look for bulk buys are options
because it gets very expensive very
quickly we wanted one app to do
everything that so that you could just
pick it up because the biggest problem
we had when we tried the lighting you
separate vendors I was having to go and
pick up three different apps in order to
figure out which one do I turn the light
on and you know what by then you just
turn the light switch okay the whole
idea was to make it easy and yeah
philips hue has really put a lot of
focus into their app the problem I have
is that while it uses as the like the
ZigBee and as you could be a home
automation and light link networks the
real challenge that I had was it doesn't
communicate when light switches are
pushed and we'll see why that's a
problem later so it's all Isis I see it
isolated on its own network and oh and
in case anyone the marketing doesn't
tell you that you can only have 24
lights in a network and we have 25 so
yeah we have to go round and turn one
off so we can turn around so I need to
get to hubs and I'm not yet figured out
how on earth I'm going to have two hubs
in my house and how they're going to
talk to each other and what happens to
it do I have two different apps now and
I have to remember which room I'm in
make this easy for me and I so I think
and I say I think that this has made my
house actually more energy-efficient
because it means that I've got my lights
being turned off more I can dim them and
actually they're led to the more
efficient but the way that hue lights
work they're plugged in to the light
socket and they're on all the time so
they're connected to the wireless
network all the time so I've got 25
devices always on so that's going to
take more electricity than the lights
being off but my my bill at the end of
the month is lower so either I've saved
a lot and but I don't I just don't know
unfortunately if you don't have a smart
meter in your home you pretty much can't
find out either
my brother has a smart meeting we tried
at his house and it's intelligent enough
to know which is the lights in the house
he's left on
so if yet if you can get a smart he need
to do but unfortunately no way to
actually buy a smart meter they just
have to come round and enable it at some
point senses sense is it great
especially when combined with lighting
okay so I picked a bunch of these and I
picked a bunch of these purely because
they did the four out of the six things
they do I need this do four I could have
picked a bunch of sensors I could have
built it myself but for about 40 pounds
you can pick one of these up and it
worked out that about for about 15
pounds and some blood sweat and tears I
could build one myself but I like my
blood sweat and tears to say my body so
I bought it instead so if you buy the
East you'll get presents which it really
is a calm in my mind cuz it doesn't
really tell you presents what I really
want I want a sensor that tells me when
someone's in the room but it doesn't
tell me when someone's in the room it
tells me have someone moved in the room
recently and that's not the same thing
it's definitely the same thing if you're
sat in the bath if you yeah you've never
lived until you've been woken up to am
gone down to the bathroom take it
especially as men standing up and
urinating and then the lights go out
it's not a pleasant place to be nor is
having gasps gasps no aah I can't see
yes fumbling around for toilet paper in
the dome
I learnt very quickly this just has to
work it has to be reliable and it has to
be fail-safe there to fail and work and
yeah unfortunately people get sending
the lights off so I went round put tape
on it to stop people turn the lights off
it meant they couldn't turn them on
either it's so and so press presents
will detect when you're there but you
have to keep moving
in order for it to work so that means
you need lots of sensors so don't put
one sensor in the bathroom luminance
tells you when it's light but
unfortunately there's quite a light on
it so when the lights off it's dark so
so my use case for luminance was at 5:00
p.m. when the sun's going down I
probably want the light on a bit when
another day I probably the lights on at
all so don't bother turn the lights on
if I wouldn't have needed to turn the
lights on to see I wanted to express
that I I don't I shouldn't care about
lighting I shouldn't need to think about
lighting I should be able to do the
thing I'm wanting to do and see and the
moment you don't start thinking about
light pink and you just do your thing
you're looking for rather than trying to
find the light switches it's dark that's
the moment you're doing it right problem
with luminance is that there's a lag in
the senses about 12 seconds when there
are batteries so rule number one wire
them all in with power hence going back
to it I wish houses had five volts I'd
beware but if you don't plug them in
about every 12 seconds it will tell you
the luminous thing is when you turn a
light on it gets brighter so think so I
don't need to be on any mind set this
off and we went through a phase of one
of my development cycles where you go
into a room and the lights will just go
up and hand
and it was really frustrating if you
were reading a book yes so be careful
calibrated oh and in bathrooms again
mist I figured out this late that mist
actually reduces the depth of words of
the field that can see which is really
annoying because when you're in the
shower there's a lot of mist and yes so
shower m and we usually ever shower in
the morning and we have baths at night
typically but we went on a fun run
recently and in the evening and he's
have a shower turns out a showering you
in the dark is a harder experience than
you think
yeah bugs boating life oh yes in fact
finally watch out for the wireless
networks so our downstairs bathroom is
as most behind the kitchen so between
directly between our bathroom and the
hub turns out there is this massive
Faraday cage called a fridge and freezer
and they were blocking one out of nine
so every time I went to the bathroom
it's absolutely fine but every so often
you have peeps yeah I get a text message
going can you turn the lights on but you
drink like an I'm done with simple and
and yeah so watch out how far you are
away from devices in Tibet again
you're going to be debugging wireless
networks so we'll go this later with one
of my use cases but I wanted to have a
nice living room I want to be able to
come in and be a bit martica to my
living room so with entertainment I
purchased Harmony remote so it's both
the hub which is this little black box
at the bottom that's a infrared blaster
it does both infrared and Bluetooth and
it can control things for you I also
picked up the remote because I very
quickly worked out that people just
reach to the remote and that does some
really bad things and good things which
we'll talk about later but giving them a
remote that does the thing that they
want to and just does it intuitively so
they can just push volume up or they can
push the off button that's really
important especially for people that
aren't members of your household II how
often you've been to a friend's house
and they've had to train you on how to
use the light switch yeah we can't do
that so there's a lot of stuff that we
take for granted
lots of behaviors that you
have to hook into and again I wasn't
going to play with mains electricity and
so I had to figure out how I do this on
top of it so us and my music in this
case is the surround sound system and
I've got an Apple TV that I use for
playing ethics I've got an Xbox which I
played two games and got skies which
just because I use it Formula One and
the news when I feel like being
depressed let's go out less I thought
I'd need lots of these and actually a
boss I've got a lot of despair so if
anyone wants to play with them feel free
I let me know I can give them to you
because I've got no use of these at the
moment apart from in two cases I found
they useful for Christmas of three
lights and exterior lights because those
are not going to be hooked up into Hugh
they're going to be the things that are
plugged in the wall you turn off and on
at night and you probably want a lot of
time answer I think that works quite
well yeah that Christmas was only like
three months into this journey and so I
only figured out that was useful three
months in also anyone who's had their
internet go down at home or figured out
that you need to reboot a hub you can't
go to reboot itself because what you
tell it to go off there's no it's tell
to go on again so out-of-band her brief
starts become a big thing and so my
energy knee plugs
basically just restarting out you never
live until you've had to reboot your
house but I'm keeping calm because I'm
not done yet I have more things to go I
have a garage it's full of stuff that I
don't look at and should probably get
rid of but I do have a garage and there
are definitely interesting options but
this fell into the mechanical brackets
I'm going to have to get a door the new
this can go wrong pretty majorly and if
anyone heard of the case where the guys
blew up on Twitter saying my energy as I
may I kind of forget the company's name
but my guru store doesn't word your apps
 so in so the app owner locked him
out of his garage yeah that can happen
it got resulted in like a couple of days
but yeah be careful about being mean on
Twitter to the people but basically run
your house they can do bad stuff and but
yes I I don't go into my garudasana
I've not tried doing this and also if it
breaks down I can't get to my stuff and
actually failing safe I need to get to
my stuff
the other thing I'm not done is blinds
and curtains because there are many
interesting options this is possibly the
cheapest Wi-Fi automated blanket but not
the best and you can get something more
like this if I want but yeah you can go
I mean feel free to lift this image put
into Google Images and you'll see the
price and it's I Wharton the expensive
so I'm not doing that yet
door locks is actually probably the next
thing I'm going to do but fortune I've
got an old wooden front door it's not
got Yale lock it's not got a night latch
which another one shown actually and I'm
not got a five-point either which is the
PBC doors with like most of the secure
ones that I found out they're the ones
because this is the if in your house to
get into I wanted to make sure it's
accredited and so the Yale key free
connected smart lock does everything
that I want it to well kind of but you
just need a compatible door so if you
have a five-point lock oh if we already
had one I'd had the snap and also I'd
have had discipline top right which is a
smart doorbell I want to help to see
when someone knocks on my door but it
turns out if you've got a doorbell
people push the doorbell before knocking
on the door and so people end up hey if
you actually tried knocking the door
some one thing just knock on the door
it's okay I mean I'm like I don't want
to be meetings announcing the daughter
delivery people but what we can do is
tell them here's the pincode you can put
it in the porch and I want it to be
because it doesn't do quite what I want
so I want two doors I want to be able to
lock the internal door and open it based
on why I open the front door so if I
open the front door because their
delivery keep the inner door locks so
they've got this protected secure area
that I can let them into and they can
leave something expensive and I don't
have to worry about that being open all
day as someone who gives it a go will
just be able to open it up and take what
they see but if I'm late friend in I've
given the pin number I do want to enter
the house and sometimes I want to be
able to open the inner door selectively
so if I've had a tradesman come around
and they say hey I've dropped this stuff
but didn't you want me to pick some
stuff dammit I left it in the front room
I could then let them in do the sort of
stuff I want to do and it's not quite
there yet and so it's not what I want to
use yet so I'm going to hold off a loved
it there are some senses that we're not
using one senses is windows and that's
mainly because they're too expensive
it's about 25 pounder sensor and I have
a lot of windows you don't realize how
many things that can open on the outside
of your house until you actually look at
them but I would love to be able to know
now did I leave the small bedroom little
window open or something and that also
like to be notified has something gone
wrong
water damage as well it's so low risk I
would like to know if I what a leaking
loft I would like to know if the pipes
are frozen and cracked but the amount of
effort I'd have to go to to figure that
out is quite high and frankly the
weather round in England is just too
normal though that's not really a
vigorous I did have a picture of what
goes wrong with a robotic lower which
ISM there's a guy on the internet and
ran over his dog and gave me good
haircuts and yeah I thought about not
sure but if you're going to see this
rope they're not clever it's like would
you let your three-year-old mow your
lawn no there they have the intelligence
of three-year-old at the moment so I
also I don't have a mansion so I don't
big garden so I don't need to worry
about this which takes me four minutes
so and if you do perhaps you probably
want a gardener anyway and let them
figure out I was spring plus look I just
have enough grass so some music use
cases the things I've done
so the entertainment one was the way I
started and with all you escapes you
start with one segment so I want to be
able to say to my system somehow the
intended to thing I want to do I don't
even turn the TV on and turn next box
and change this off I want to say I want
to continue watching Doctor Who it
should know where I was up to and play
the next episode in fact if you look at
Netflix so now players they kinda do
that already but you still have to get
to the point of iPlayer being on in the
first all the components kinda are there
but not just so I want to define the
target States and I want to adapt based
on the current conditions so if I was on
the Xbox you're going to need to change
the sauce if I was if we're going to be
putting Radio 2 on I'm going to turn TV
off so depending on what state there the
room is and at the time I need to change
an update Vicky's issue I found with
this is remote controls because people
having remote controls can change the TV
itself and the system's not aware of it
I talked about rebooting your house and
it's actually a big pain because you
need to make sure that the sensors come
on after the lighting system and
anything that can change state because
the senses change the state to something
new and if they think they've turned the
TV on everything's out of life and every
time you try to send TV on it sends it
off and that's frustrating it's really
frustrating when someone who's sat there
trying to use it doesn't know what's
gone wrong and so on tech support again
so if I want to rate it I want to do
things like during the evening I want
more lights than I do during the day
unless I'm watching a movie in which
case dim the lights I want to avoid
reflections from the ceilings unless I'm
watching the news in which I said I
really care because I care more about
the message they're giving me sometimes
actually I might want to be reading and
so turn some stuff off if the TV is Lisa
SH input changing I want to be able to
figure out what has to happen sounds
sometimes need to be surrounds sometimes
volume needs to be changed because
actually the input level that you get
from an Xbox is different to that some
sky and pretty much every show on
Netflix is a different volume level okay
and so I want to be able to do stuff
about content so plug it over to Alexa
and you need to be specific and it
intuitive and reactive ideally I want to
do no text-based stuff so the technology
is really important the things that I've
said before we have saunas and that's
dealing with our sound it plug that into
a lexer and there's a relaxer scale
which lets you control a third of what
it does but at least it knows what
you're trying to do so you can say so I
plugged it in with you know me and you
know me is
like if this then that so it's a text
it's not as a visual programming system
that allows you to say if this happens
in this case
turn turn the Xbox on I want to play on
the Xbox or you put in the permutations
the command you want to say to it it
will then know that the TV needs to be
on turn it in to the correct state it
will then know to wait in this harmony
that knows to wait 20 seconds to the TV
to turn itself on and then it will go
off and change the channel to the Xbox
and then the exports will turn on
because the powers gone down the h mayer
cable this took me about a weekend to
figure out how to turn the damn thing on
it then took me another two weekends to
figure out what else how to change the
state between them but with a
combination of harmony you know me and
Alexa and Sun us it was able to do all
of it and I did have to do no
programming it was all done through the
apps sounded quite easy but it was
definitely a debugging Lupus let me
change this extra thing I can't convert
to Alexa properly I can't say show me
the next Doctor Who at episode what I
can say is turn the iPlayer on and it'll
go off and do that it's almost
impossible for it to figure out what the
length is showing me the next Doctor Who
episode because what I really want is
for it to figure out where that would be
so if I'm wanting to watch the next
Doctor Who episode if I'm all up to date
I wanted to figure out when the next
Doctor Who episode is and go and record
it for me I wanted the technology to get
out of the way and stop asking me to
figure out what I need to do just do it
for me what I really wanted a personal
assistant and it's not there yet but
it's not very far off so if all the
media he could companies if they can get
them to learn one thing is to get your
act together media licensing is a
hellhole I have to have Netflix sky and
a ton of other different things in order
to be able to watch the set of things I
want to see it's really hard for me
selves to get hold of media be a music
or video or TV or movies because it's
split across all these different
better rights management a licensing it
really need you to break these barriers
down so I can get the content I'm
looking for it's being delivered in a
better medium now it's not just being
grip fed to me on a daily basis or
weekly basis but I could pay 2,000
pounds a month so all the possible media
providers out there and still have a
really poor experience and that's not
great but if you weren't doing my people
pirates it's because of this mess but
we're lighting I wanted to be reactive I
just wanted to forget about it as I said
before lighting isn't the thing you
should think about it should be just
there so it should be automatic
I should just happen you should adapt to
conditions time of the day times a year
whether if it's overcast movies a few
middle of summer and we still need the
lights on at 5:00 p.m. because you've
got a blackout that's Marsten or not it
doesn't always need to be on sometimes
it can be dim it just needs to balance
it to have an acceptable light in the
room sometimes you want to change the
color temperature so towards the evening
you probably want to make it a warmer
light so that you get rid of the blue
spectrum that's been shown at least in
some studies to affect sleep cycles but
the problem is rule 0 don't wake the
wife I don't want to get up in the
middle of the night and all the lights
come on that's bad or worse don't weigh
the baby
that's bad if you're super you want to
make sure that the lights come on and
this is 2 o'clock in the morning they
come on quite dimly in fact maybe the
you want a night light around the
children's areas you don't want to do
dark though so you can't see what you're
going for defeats the object failure in
the system shouldn't be critically
impactful it should be able to just work
still I should be able to eat for a
light switch and turn it on one things I
like about the philips system is that
the worst thing is you turn it off and
you turn it on it comes back on bright
wait the wife and then deal with the
consequences using the bathroom while
sleepy is tough enough but using well by
us blind is just asking for trouble and
maybe you have to make sure that people
community or house can just follow those
things and just make it work what we've
ended up doing is getting 3d printed
covers for our light switches so you can
still get to the light behind it but all
of our this
switches and remotes on top of it I mean
it's a fun funky project but it's not
really ready for most people to deal
with our main places that we use it in
bathrooms hallways and anywhere we
really just walk the front the kitchen
is really useful to the senses are
everywhere and we need them everywhere
most of the rooms have got at least one
sensor some have got three or four
because with a 120 degree view you need
to pick up blind spots but then you have
to be careful that across the hallway I
can end up tricking the bathroom if we
leave our doors open from my bed and I
don't want to be turning my roll over in
my sleep and have left the door open
Internet you have to be aware of the
field of vision that's there there is a
lots of things to help you when you're
debugging and we'll actually get to some
curtains and and but once you've set it
all up you can see when they're
triggering you can see a live log of
what's going on in your house and that
could be quite useful in determining
what's triggering where and most of them
have flashing lights that will tell you
what they've seen and where they've seen
it so I'll flash to tell you you're not
moving anymore they'll actually tell you
I've seen you on my periphery they'll
flash to a different color to tell you
I've seen you and I've sent a signal
that there's motion time is already
useful but the problem I've had with the
philips system is that my timers around
my senses and that's on smart things so
smart thing says hey something moves
tells the lights turn on problem it
someone the the light may have gone off
as well push the button to turn the
light on or they want to tell it like go
on but because of the security which
we'll cover in a bit I can't get that
message from the philips hue system into
the smart thing so i can't cancel the
timer they're not aware of each other
and that's really frustrating and I've
actually got to the point now when
thinking of building a actual cloud
application for my entire damn house and
I shouldn't really be there it's
annoying it's really shouldn't because
no one's going to do this well maybe me
so
smartthings looks a bit like this and so
in order to do the timings I had to go
off and create an app I wanted to pick a
bunch of sensors and say when this thing
happens if the light level so this level
then if it's too dark
then turn the lights on and I want to be
able to specify this abstractly and
follow different developer principles so
the first thing we ask is muggin I can't
show you most of this unfortunate an
on-screen because wonderfully and all my
device IDs will be seen and I'm not
going to put them out on the Internet
I'm really sorry there are some things
we just can't do I'm not willing to do
but what I will do is do a demo for you
and show you how the app is built so
here we see does this look hey I was
expecting it to work NCA hey so when you
login I have a list of my locations all
the other stuff will give you a bunch of
ID's you can come and I'll show you one
here if you wants it but if I go into
the applications you can see what's
actually in my house I've installed a
bunch of off-the-shelf applications like
hello home it's got these are routines
so I can say good morning I'd never do
any more but you have a good morning
routine and what that does is set a
bunch of thing so it might turn the
lighting off across your house or good
night might shut everything down house I
think means that all my senses around my
security there is a house it shouldn't
go so I've got something my office
should be locked and so the motion set
so in my office should never be
triggered when I've got a house sitter
in and yeah but things that do stuff
there just push a button and it'll go
off and figure out what needs to do but
this is my one and so we can see we've
got a ton of senses on the right there
feeding back a bunch of information so
Lux is your light level and I've got a
ton of light sensors okay so I use a lot
be named uniquely and it gets a real
bore naming all your devices uniquely I
know some people who just give them
names like Bob Kate Franks
but I find that really hard so I end up
with really verbose names for mine so
I'm pretty sure you can guess where
those senses are but yeah I can't
actually get into that but what we'll do
is I'll show you what that app it's cuz
it's this one the one I wrote I hate
this this is the worst idea in the world
because it gives me no development cycle
I am used to writing REST API is I'm
used to doing bits of development
I like committing my code into github I
like being able to have some CI tool
check that done the right thing I don't
get to do that here in fact it's ah
magic it's wonderful groovy magic and I
don't really know what I'm not I don't
know what I've not done and you have to
figure stuff out but you're gonna Rev if
you follow my path you're going to end
up in this pretty quickly so to run
through quickly you have a definition
itself which is self-explanatory the
preference pages so if I open up this
simulator and set the location it will
eventually give me a preference pane
this is just defining what's in the
preference panes if you've ever built an
Android or iOS app this is relatively
straightforward to you I haven't so this
is all new and it should be
self-explanatory as to what these do but
you want to basically put your inputs
into groups we have multiple sections
and I wanted to actually build
preferences panes that were generic I
wanted to say hey here's a bunch of
sensors here's the type of room it is so
it's a bathroom over the hallway and
here are the lights so you want to
affect it it's really hard to do because
it's in Destin and because it runs on
micro-services and there's no state
handled so I can't write a curried
lambda I have to end up with something
along the lines of here where I'm
subscribing tons of different senses in
the different pit so this is the each of
the pages so room a would be room T in
room D if a happens to be my dancers
batter
so where's installed this gets triggered
and initializes which means that I'm
going to now subscribe to the events
that happen on all of these centers and
it's a set of sensors because we have
multiple is set to true so manage the
lights in the downstairs bathroom
based on these sensors and I can just
tick which one's the real interesting
stuff happens inside of motion detected
which is actually motion detected ABCD
because I can't do Co Inc so I have to
do horrible stuff like that but it runs
this and it gives me the room which is
room a and the event happened so I want
to know have someone moves or not moves
cuz I want to do two different things if
the one moves then I want to figure out
is it too dark and is it too dark is if
I've been given a sensor and I've been
giving a limbless threshold because
different rooms have different
thresholds so depending on where you put
the sensor there's and how much light
its use in the room so you end up with a
ton of calibration fun but assuming
you've got that we can figure out is it
too dark so if it is too dark they'll
turn the lights on
okay and it should turn it on and beyond
I set the threshold for 20 minutes so if
no events fire to say you've stopped
moving because of probably okay did some
stuff then it will be then it'll go off
after 20 minutes but if you become
inactive so if it's not too dark and
you've moved then it won't do anything
once that's off but if you stop moving
don't turn the lights off when you see
someone stop moving that's really
important instead set it to a more
reasonable time out in this case two
minutes what I want to be able to do
inside of this motion detected famous a
unless someone has pushed a button so
someone comes the room and turn the
light on ignore me completely they've
said they want the light on so leave it
on for an hour and so because they said
they want it on time not figure out how
to do that yet and then all these
locking all the locking I'll show you
the locking base it's quite interesting
because I think you get a stream of data
I know people in my house right now
be spinning off the screen that des
logged it it there's no breakpoints
there's no way to see what's going on
and how so you just have this ton of
logging data that you just comment out
most of the time it's frustrating yeah
that's all I can say about but that's
because this was in case the internet
didn't work and I couldn't show you that
so yeah you get logging like this I've
had to take a screenshot because the
fortunately they get all the device IDs
and the device IDs you can pack my house
so please don't do that
so I blurred them out please don't do
anything back to my house we can see
this affecting what this is doing is
just getting a hit on the downstairs
bathroom light a we're seeing that a
command a past of motion that was it
going inactive where we actually read
look at this before I put it out but oh
yeah you end up with silly things like
the downstairs bathroom no longer exists
no no no it does it's now a minute Jeff
I know it really does you have some
really good it's really good therapy you
find yourself talking self a lot and it
becomes with the abstract so if anyone
decides to hack into my Alexa I'm pretty
sure they could section II and the
Mental Health Act because there's some
really weird conversations you end up
having yourself friends together so
challenges the senses suck they really
do they don't really do what I want what
they do is they gather the information
that they can find they don't answer the
question I really have and that makes
building stuff really hard especially
with wireless networks they're just
unreliable and it's all UDP stuff
so your sensor just goes hey I tell you
and then ok let's also check that you've
got that if you didn't get that well
yeah my and I can be really really
painful the development cycle is just
hideous and yeah we need switches I have
more switches in my house now than I had
before that was the opposite of what I
was hoping for and yeah again
stay away the hell away from mains don't
die so going away what can we do when we
leave our house well I did ten weeks in
America the house that had come some
time
and I'm a traveler and my house is empty
but I like my things so how do I make
sure I have things when I come back so I
want to know things like have the house
is a bit
have they been where they shouldn't it's
a gardener bin because we paid them to
it's my house on fire
that'd be really nice you know we
decided not to go with a certain extra
fire alarm because the only one on the
market at the time had an open hack
where someone had turned it on and off
fifty thousand times a second and caused
a fire the irony of your fire alarm
actually sitting size of your house is
not lost on the fire crew that were
laughing in them the has my carbon
stolen so I have a little fob in my car
you take it and I know has there been an
intrusion but I don't really care most
but I don't care most of this about most
of my stuff but my tech is hidden away
so I because I've done away I'd
collected all the important pieces
technology and hid them and it covered
that and put stuff in front to cupboard
had that been opened because then I know
someone's taking a lot of my money
Piper's how I got started
simple free standard lights just pull
lights put plug control put on timers
just made it look like us home the
motion sensors there's a proximity
sensor for my car so I could figure
still there lots of door sensors are
they open or closed if you leave the
door open sensors to open it resets
itself and so many close it now if
you've opened it so what you end up
looking for a state change rather than
what would say is outer band plug
controls in case smart things break down
it does it's rare
if the insect goes down I am screwed but
I had to make it easy to power cycle we
had a power cut while I was in America
and I had to talk my mother-in-law how
to reboot my house it was a trial for
both of us being out of the house is
okay but being out of timezone is really
painful I found that really hard and
people change their travel plans and so
we had the houses to setting off alarms
and then I had to get up in the mines
and no shows is up because it is a paint
alarm I had to make my house much
smarter to deal with humans being just
humans and unpredictable humans messy
stuff and that's really hard they don't
do it intentionally but bloody humans I
mean if you hide so we hit the remote so
people texting I think went on to the
downside of the TV and started changing
things and I'm plugging for you
something like how do I turn it I don't
know I don't know what you've done just
undo it put it back and it should just
work and so I ended up using the camera
from my Piper to see my TV so I could
try and reprogram my TV from America
that was not a morning I want to go
through again he efficiency this is
where it gets really ramped leakers I
have really simple requirements is that
I I know I really like eating on too
much because it's dumb we have to set it
23000 during the day and it's on all day
and the fat times available and it only
has one point in the room but you can
take total so it gets less not a lot and
the time is to set it and we have two
requirements I don't want to be cold and
I don't want to be poor it's not that
hard but they're also mutually exclusive
because I can leave my heating on all
the time but then I'll be poor I can
turn it off all the time but then I
because each house is very different and
has lots of different rooms and each
room is occupied at different times
presence is predictable mostly so I know
when I'm going to be in my office I know
I'm not using my office at 6 o'clock in
the morning exception to the Telegraph
to usually by an event so I know in the
run-up to DevOps I'm probably going to
be working late so it's actually rather
predictable about how it works and
rather be cold for 30 minutes so I'd
rather be cold for 30 minutes than say
500-pounder year so I can figure out
some metrics what I've ended up doing is
using a thought surface that and I know
I've gone wrong because I have a machine
learning algorithm for my heating if
they're pulling all the data about where
I am my house and then they should be
all natural no one else is going to do
well actually people in this room will
probably do that but most
the people out there that bought a hive
are nests aren't going to do these
things and we need so many more data
points that need to talk to each other
but it's almost there it's tantalizingly
close that I can leave my office cold
during the night because it doesn't need
to be why am i eating my bedroom during
the day I just want it warm by the time
I go to bed
that's all and actually I like my
bedroom cool and I like the rest of my
house
otherwise I'm too hot my wife would
disagree but then we can just have wars
over what suddenly but the biggest issue
I have is that with Alexa my heating
system is called receiver which is
apparently hard-coded into the system I
have to say Alexa set the receiver to 20
degrees and no one's going to do that in
my house other than the person who knows
I and now actually have some instruction
cards about how to talk to my house
there's something's gone wrong I don't I
fear about the path I've taken because
this feels like I shouldn't be asking
people to talk to my house in an
intuitive way so we need to get it a
much smarter first but so fast when
you're 20 percent is why i roughly
worked out i've i've saved
oh yeah let's just I don't know that
there's receiver I can't be named
receiver I would just like to call you
heating have something just pizza so
where am I going next
well actually I want to have the kitchen
warm in the morning I want to heat hot
water on demand based on how much is
left in the tank most hot water tanks
only have one sensor on them but you can
stick multiple in and so I can work out
how much of a tank I've got left I can
also work out which showers been in use
I can also work out when a shower is
likely to be taken and all of this means
I can do on-demand heating ahead of time
without having to use a combi boiler
unfortunately a combi boiler would cost
make significant lesson time and money
that they might anyway
my time is almost done so I'll fly
through these but the first thing I get
to ask is about security aren't you
worried that all your stuff is on the
Internet as you and know
doing a threat model so what are you
trying to guard against what do you care
about because there is a minor data out
there you are right and abuse of the
information someone could hack into my
camera start taking photos they could
there's lots of cameras around my house
and there's lots of sensors you can know
when I'm not there I guarantee you there
isn't a single burger out there that
it's hacked into your wireless
networking who's trying to figure out
are you home or not they'll break the
window so that's what they're going to
do so the great case came from the
police of Westminster it said that
they've now seen people going round with
electric car fobs opening cars and
recording and replaying you can't record
and replay because it's JWT tokens so
actually there's a bunch of security
already built in but it took 8 years
from the first remote opened car to the
first remote open theft and so the
burglars still going to break into your
house and steal stuff and so actually I
care more about the data and so I'm
lucky look for things that have got big
security standards that protect data
don't just stick it just google around
and see how this as we sold your data
some companies have so just google and
find out what what they're selling some
people sell you search history
American companies are now enabled to do
that I don't worry about hacker so it
would have to be either broad spread
target spectrum attack on my house and I
just get swept up because I'm one of the
million people that were vulnerable but
all this stuff also updates so the risk
is actually relatively love or it's
going to be really targeted on me and
again they're going to smash my window
there are much easier ways to get what
they're looking for does it make us lazy
every good yes that I'd say that's a
good thing as this conversation with my
wife but then I say well when I'm doing
the laundry do I consider myself lazy
because I'm putting into a washing
machine rather than going outside and
scrubbing it by hand of course not
actually these things are there to help
make it get off and spend our time on
better things and so laziness is a way
of describing it but I think this is
absolutely a better way to do it as long
as you're focused on how does it
we need to get what I want done faster
and I can send that time another things
maintenance is a pain you will you're
building a smart home this is a better
home but it's like building software and
because everyone is developing their own
software it's like your house is in beta
constantly it really is a effort but
that this is the biggest thing anything
we need to overcome in terms of IOT and
the smart homes it's make it easier to
maintain and manage so the future
machine learning enough so intelligent
isn't we're putting a big lot of stock
in that across the rest of the tech
world and I think it will start helping
here too so food is one lighting I would
I would love for it is to all the food
based on seasonal meals and things that
I eat and do the shop I'd like to sit
down and do my shopping it knows why
most of the time I'm ordering similar to
surf its algorithmic how I'm going
through it why can't it just figure out
and buy that stuff for me I don't even
mind just scanning through it you're
going you know what I fancy some peanut
butter but everything else here just
make sure there's milk in the fridge I
like baking so you make sure I don't run
out mmm tasty pigs interoperability we
need to make the stuff talk we have to
get it inspected work together release
because it's so hard to get this stuff
plug together it is the thing that
you'll learn and learn hard and harshly
is that this stuff doesn't talk to each
other because of the security stuff so
it's good that it doesn't talk to each
other but that cripples you in so many
ways you have to expose the data be
careful how you do it's really hard to
get everything to play together to do
what you want and now I think I've got
five different abstraction layers in my
house in order just to get things to
hook together this one the user
experience is is the hardest thing for
me to deal with when it comes to
intuitiveness the apps from each vendor
or all isolated but they're usually
pretty and quite intuitive the stuff is
generic it's the lowest common
denominator and you end up with ugly
boxes and it's really hard to articulate
what you're doing you've the controls in
just armed nice and again
interoperability make it really hard to
have something that does multiple things
across multiple stuff which involves
events rather than just actions and
what's your reliance on it because I've
bought 150 devices nearly 200 and from
these I've paid to vendors fixed fees
I've never paid a service fee and yes
I'm reliant on Philips goodwill to keep
running their clouds they tend that
cloud off and then my house gets very
done very quickly so I don't pay service
fee survive and they could stop my they
can stop me getting into my garage as
they want to do if I did exactly that so
watch out about your lights externally
yeah can someone break your house I
don't mean sanding outside so you brick
through your window but you can
practically have the same effect if you
can't open your front door and with that
my rant is over thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
