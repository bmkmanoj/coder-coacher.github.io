Weaver from pivotal and we've just given
teachers that machine learning yeah
yes knows one it was fun actually I
enjoyed it and then people seem to I
mean playing playing our own trumpet
here but people wanted to appreciate it
yeah I think so yeah yeah and see one
thing that we do is we go over three
types of learning so we go over
supervised learning where you have the
correct answers and you have the data
and you're saying I'm going to give you
all of the answers can you work out
what's happening here unsupervised
learning where you go I just have some
data can you please find some patterns
and reinforcement learning where
actually could you explain reinforcement
learning reinforcement learning is where
you have an agent in some environment
and the agent has to learn something and
has to learn to achieve some goal and
then it's rewarded implement early or
maybe after it's achieved the goal with
with some type of reinforcement and so
that way it learns them to achieve that
goal over a number of iterations and so
unfortunately it's quite have time to
cover that and it's all the
reinforcement learning is the power
behind the computer program that can eat
the top alphago champion correct that's
one of the one of the things the forms
of machine line behind that other forms
it does use traditional supervised and
some unsupervised learning and so it
kind of uses those three things together
in a strategic way to to to beat the
player yes I'm not familiar with the
game of alphago but I believe it's much
more complicated than chess yes
so the it's just called go the alphago
is the name of the project go is a 19 by
19 grid I believe it was invented in
China and you put stones there's black
and white stones that you put on the
intersections of the grid
came by 19 as 361 so there's 361
different places that you can play
stones and just not almost infinite
number of combinations of board States
orders of magnitude above what there is
in chess much more compact I can safely
say that I've never tried to play that
game and so when we were looking at some
of the examples something that we looked
at quite a lot actually with neural
networks because they're so hot right
now
and we finally had the computational
power cedes and really cool things with
neural network gosh so we looked at
convolutional neural network and
handwriting prediction yeah for for the
general case of images where and
convolutional is you know it can be used
for other things but it really shines in
being able to recognize what's what are
in images what's going on in them as you
mentioned as we were preparing for the
talk as you kind of coached me why don't
you mention that it's it's the way that
animals recognize things by recognizing
features so that the convolutional and
pooling layers of that kind of take
features and recognize them much in the
same way that we as humans do look we we
hope one of their big comments is near
an hour especially in the architectures
of neural networks and looking at and so
it's always just a simple artificial
network you can have these recurrent
neural network and you have deep
learning where you have multiple hidden
layers and and they can interact in
different ways and a time series no
networks is we're always kind of
guessing at how the brain works throw is
guessing how those neurons interact yes
and I don't feel like I'm any closer and
more alone about machine learning to
knowing that but maybe any
neuroscientists watching can step in and
help us that's a good point that's a
good point yes
and for what what's your favorite thing
to demonstrate about machine learning oh
well you know the that latest science
always about the latest new toy right so
yeah the handwriting recognition thing
that was kind of fun where where you
could take the take the digits the
handwriting samples of digits and
actually create one right one dry it out
on this this application and then it it
shows you the different layers I'd Rafa
Klee you know what's happening inside of
the convolutional neural network and
then what classification that was given
at zero through nine it was kind of that
was kind of fun to demonstrate it is
matrix I think it's especially learning
about no now Eric see for the first time
you might think all handwriting
recognition is really boring especially
incredibly complicated so the
demonstrations really good way to show
how convolutional net works kind of
compress what they tell the pixels they
take in and take different parts of that
to work out how they all combine to make
the digit 8 yeah not sick right yeah or
badly within seven is seven not two or a
Warner and yeah that is really cool
actually this is really good music duet
program that you showed me in the break
yeah that was an AAA experiment related
to Google brain and a project magenta
where we took a MIDI keyboard it
happened to be al instrument was a very
versatile MIDI keyboard very expressive
one and and then played a short melody
kind of a an improvisation kind of thing
where play a little melody a few notes
and then the recurrent neural network
then predicts plays improvisers kind of
using recurrent neural network to
predict what the next notes the series
should be based upon the body of work
that it has been trained on I thought
that was really cool upon the journal
yeah the keyboard itself is really cool
it's not a keyboard in there
and there's one key in a row sense it's
like a multi-dimensional keyboard it is
it's kind of a cross between playing a
traditional keyboard and playing a
guitar that gives us laid out in eight
rows of 25 T's which cause you to slide
and think in terms of how you type they
would think yeah well welcome all people
have to check out the talk absolutely it
was a it was a really great the way that
I think it was a good interplay between
discussing the kind of the theory behind
machine learning and demonstrating code
and then also you diving into the
intuition of the maps I think it made a
very kind of complete picture of peeking
under the covers as far as learning
what's going on to where developers then
I believe got a great intuition about
what's going on underneath not that they
have to but when they're using machine
learning libraries it's not a mystery
anymore
so yeah I think that was a good benefit
to them if anybody has any further
questions they can feel free to reach
out to us on Twitter absolutely</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
