moment using javascript and java ee so
my leisure project i think you mean your
leisure project is actually two projects
Prometheus and i built called stuff
called x-ray it's like statistics
project for my block i think five years
ago and it runs with hazel cast java and
exposes the statistics using rest and so
first i would like to do is to prove to
implement some charts with javascript
and just using just using web standards
at the same time i created also a
javascript projects which exposes docker
some stay two steps with angular 1 it
was a very old one and i would also like
to rework that with or rebuild this with
web standards and the last one there's a
Prometheus it's like monitoring
dashboard very modern monitoring tool
which is using cloud environments and I
would like connectors with application
service which I partially already did so
there is a project called light fish
which captures a glassfish monitoring
data and stores in database and i would
like to expose it in Prometheus format
and not only this also business
monitoring from apps and and
implementing or monitoring for micro
services so this is actually and the
last one I will try to hack in flight
back to unique so today and the other
ones let's see how much how much leisure
will get science it's a lots of
statistics and data are you looking at
feedback and what are you trying to
learn from this um dia the main problem
always was in Java everyone was focused
on code coverage which is more or less
mini glass in distributed systems and
something like you know key health
monitoring or key performance indicators
is completely lacking and with Java is
very simple to expose your business
statistics like know how many i think is
registered to the conference how many
registrations fails or how many throat
attempts there were and you could expose
this by a simple format and make a nice
dashboard for the client to see what's
going on the app so
one is interested in amount of thread
sessions whatever but everyone is really
interested what's going on in the app
it's like a dashboard or a cockpit there
is not a good name for that and this is
what i will do and we needed in all of
my projects actually and we do it
afterwards so if the projects fail then
we implement this and yeah i will do it
start with that right now and you are
you're right we need some charts for the
client you know because no one is
interested in numbers or feet thanks
very much thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
