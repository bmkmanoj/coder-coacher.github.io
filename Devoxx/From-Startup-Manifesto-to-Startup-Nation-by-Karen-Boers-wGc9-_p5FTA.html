gentlemen but I'm searching hard and i'm
not sure if there's even one lady in the
room if there is one ah where they are
great two of us good start this is
typically one of the conferences where
you don't have a queue in the ladies
room which has its advantages but I
would like to see some more ladies in
the room by next year so please go out
and chase your friend female friends and
girlfriends and to start coding start
becoming a developer making their own
businesses because that's definitely one
thing that we need but that being said I
would like to know you know not taking
your sex into account who is in the room
more or less are all of you at this
point entrepreneurs developers looking
to start your own business developers
looking to join a start-up what's
basically your interest in being here
today that might help me too you give
all of the messages and all of the
things that I've learned as an
entrepreneur being active in the
technology industry that I might share
with you to make sure that it's a bit
more tailor-made so which one of you has
a business of your own at this point in
time I know that you don't like to speak
up the waving is fine yeah that's about
one-third that's not bad actually and
which one of you are currently you know
either as a freelancer doing developer
work or are inactive in a company but
considering to start your own business
anytime soon Oh another third
interesting so most of you will either
be active now building your own business
and doing probably not just coding but a
lot of sales and development in the
marketing sense and and go-to-market
strategy and all those things and that's
probably slightly away from your comfort
zone as it used to be when I started out
this particular venture which is called
started OBE I'll explain in a second why
I was invited to come here and talk
about startup nations which seems to be
a big concept but it's really not we'll
bring it right down to earth but being a
technology entrepreneur as you are or
will be very soon hopefully that's a
peculiar type of business that's a
scalable business that means that once
you start
right out and you go online you are
become active as a business you face
worldwide competition from day one and
that's very different from starting a
restaurant or a local shop which has its
challenges of its only not going to hear
me say that that's more easy definitely
not but it has a different type of
concept and different types of
challenges being a technology
entrepreneur you are going to face
competition but also opportunities
across the globe from day one and that's
interesting that sets the scene in a
totally different way from what we've
been used to as Belgian and European
entrepreneurs for decades and decades
and centuries and centuries it's a
challenge and it's Anna it's an
opportunity at the same time but it does
mean that it's going to be very hard for
you as an individual code or developer
entrepreneur of whichever kind to go and
conquer the world entirely by yourself
there are those individuals that are
capable of doing that but let's let's
face it most of us will need at least a
bit of help and mentoring and support
and people providing us with contacts
and opening doors for us and that's just
fine there is nothing wrong with asking
other people to help us out but finding
those people can be quite challenging in
this technology and start industry I
used to be a head of marketing of I
mines which is a Flemish software
institution are working with University
researchers to develop the solutions of
tomorrow software solutions of the next
generation let's call it that way and we
found that about 10 years ago that most
of those innovations after those big
research projects ended and they were
full of promise we had demos we have
proof of concept these solutions were
almost market ready and even so many of
them never made it to the market not
through our industry partners and not
through our researchers taking those
innovations to the market themselves and
that was a pity there were beautiful
things in there you know solutions that
enabled long term sick children to do
stay in contact with their classroom
environment catching up on all of the
things that in the class was learning
and not falling behind on their
learning curriculum but also staying in
touch with the social environment not
becoming socially isolated while they
were in their sick bed at home or are in
the hospital for example if those
innovations are developed and they are
not taken to the market then society
loses out to be frank you know and
that's a pity it's not just a pity for
the potential entrepreneur not making a
huge business out of that so back then
we're talking ten years ago there was
not that much around in Belgium or in
Europe for that matter to help that type
of innovators who we're doing
breakthrough stuff to bring those
innovations to market and luckily a lot
of things have changed in the last
decade there have been emerging a
magnitude of initiatives to help you to
take that type of innovation whether
it's a real technology breakthrough
kuiper kind of thing like developing a
new type of battery for example or
whether it's a business model
breakthrough or whether it's just you
know social entrepreneurship bringing
and bringing better life quality to
people and enabling them to do the
things they want to do and be passionate
about what they do that really doesn't
matter there's so much support out there
to help you to coach you to guide you to
introduce you to enable you to network
to address your potential customers and
your potential end-users and that's a
good thing but it's a challenge at the
same time once more because in the last
decade even in Belgian alone more than a
hundred of those initiatives have
emerged cool very cool but now it's
tough for you to find out if you're in
health pick which is the right training
and coaching a mentoring program for you
which would be the most suitable
investor for you if you're an attic
where did it where do you turn where do
you go if you have a media company if
you have a business and financial
solutions who do you turn to it's become
this thick wood of all sorts of people
that seem to be ready for you but you
it's very hard to identify that person
and that coach and that program and that
investor that's going to take your
business to the next level and you as an
entrepreneur in the scalable global
business you don't want to waste time
trying to find out networking for a year
and a half before you find the right
person that will help you along you need
it today yesterday preferably to be
able to scale your business because time
is of the essence in this business
because your competition is worldwide
you probably will not be the only one
with a genius idea in your mind other
people across the globe are developing
similar things if they're faster to the
market they're going to overthrow you
even if you were the first one and the
best one so that's the danger you need
that speed in Belgian alone over a
hundred initiatives are out there to
help you we created with a number of
technology entrepreneurs about three
years ago now a nonprofit organization
called starters OBE to bring them
together to unite them in a
one-stop-shop type of environment where
we hope we can deliver you know more
insights on who is doing what but even
after being active in this industry for
three years already even for me it's
hard if you come up to me and ask me
okay I'm I'm a financial services I'm
looking for an experienced business
coaches it's going to be hard for me to
deliver that answer that's how complex
the ecosystem is that's how fast it
changes but we're trying to bring it all
together and to provide those
value-adding matchmaking services to
allow you as an entrepreneur to focus on
your business to find the right people
to help you out and to scale as fast as
you can that's basically what we've been
doing at national level why at national
level because if you're going abroad and
you're talking to investors for example
in the US or in Israel or in Singapore
they don't care about Flanders versus
Brussels versus Wallonia they don't care
about Brussels vs Amsterdam they just
want to find the most talented
entrepreneur the best business and start
up the best market fit that's what they
care about you need critical mass you
need the sufficient number proficient
level of quality of professionally
professionalism to stand out in this
international environment and we face
the same problem at European level to be
honest you know back when we started out
with starters up the e where we were
kind of a pioneer of this open
innovation type of philosophy that
everybody talks about but in practice
turns out to be very hard to collaborate
with whoever is
there is something that sounds good but
is very hard in practice we were
pioneering three years ago at European
level the same type of collaboration is
opening up now incubators accelerators
investors coaches mentors it all over
Europe are trying to form associations
and collaborative platforms to support
you as an entrepreneur to become
successful it's moving in the right
direction we'll dive in more detail as
to what's available in Belgium just you
know as a reference point because I'm
aware that probably some of you are not
belgium-based at all but similar
initiatives are emerging though they
might not be united in a local network
yet but across Europe you see the same
things going on it's a very diverse
ecosystem of people out there to help
you you have on the upper right hand the
incubators in the accelerators as
basically coaching coaching programs and
environments or you can set up your
business and be close to the people that
might be able to support you and to help
you out into coach you on your way and
startup communities and event organizers
to make sure you have all these network
opportunities that will bring you closer
to your potential customers in the end
obviously you will need funding at some
point so there's the different type of
investors between ranging from banks but
also crowdfunding platforms business
angel networks and communities putting
somewhat smaller money on the table
ranging to the big VCS where I could
potentially could get up to 35 20 60
million dollars or euros at the point
you're ready for that all sorts of
government initiatives out there to help
you really much more than you might be
aware of you can get up to fifty percent
funding from your local expert agency in
most countries if you are actually
scouting a market abroad which is what
as a technology entrepreneur you will be
doing a lot of the time half of your
travel costs and your expenses could be
subsidized through your local government
if you apply for them so be aware of the
fact that that's out there many
entrepreneurs don't even know on the rim
they're just doing their business
burning money on on all sides and it's a
good thing being focused on your
business but if government is out there
with instruments to help you
make sure you claim the money right
there are lots of corporates ready to
support you either usually not with big
bucks but usually they do provide a lot
of either in business feedback if they
are aware of your business for example a
lot of corporations are now looking for
collaboration with startups who are in a
slightly similar industry to make sure
that they can learn from you they want
to learn from your inspirational example
they want to learn from your you know
awareness of what's going out in the
market what could be a potential threat
for them but on the other hand they're
also being more and more supportive in
connecting you to their network and a
customer network of a company of a
multi-billion company with with the
offices all over the globe that can be a
very valuable thing if they won't
introduce you to some of their biggest
customers you're going to come through
the big door you're going to come
through at CIO CTO CEO level which makes
a big difference in your negotiation
process and a big difference in the lead
time that you will need to secure such a
customer so lots and lots of people out
there how are trying to bring it all
together we've developed basically with
starters of e 2 main axes which is not
on the upper side being a one-stop shop
bringing all of that information
together and I know for some of you will
have been surfing to our website in its
crap i know i need a good developer by
the way it will help me out with that
but we're we're nonprofit ourselves
we've started out with zero money
ourselves we just put our money where
our mouth is we started doing things
even before we had money to do that and
to be honest for the first two years it
was just me and an intern you know
trying and trying and working hard and
doing consultancy on the one hand to pay
for the stuff that we just wanted to do
but nobody was paying for so we've been
pivoting and and in doing it the hard
way ourselves but now we finally have a
team of eight people in place that is
trying to scale this business at a
European level as well so marketplace on
the other hand actually bringing you in
contact through events through social
media through newsletters that become
more and more targeted if you are
telling us you're an early-stage
entrepreneurs still developing your
business will try to find out based on
you know the industry that you're in
which might be
interesting calls for startups
competitions programs or international
opportunities I could be relevant for
you and we'll bring them in your lap if
possible but we've also been building a
lot of expertise on what are startups
how r started developing over time not
our expertise is as a team which stars
OBE but with all of the experts that are
active in the programs and in the
institutions that were collaborating
with obviously so this is a pool of over
a hundred people that have a lot of
experience in coaching nurturing but
also building that type of businesses
experience in how to do due diligence
how to do negotiations for a potential
takeover how to do negotiations with
investors that type of thing and that is
all becoming accessible to you guys as
well if you're looking for something let
us know and we'll do our very best to
connect you to those people and to help
you along on your business and in doing
so and that's the topic of today
obviously we kind of by accident became
a community builder we became the voice
of the startup community in Belgium and
increasingly the voice of the startup
community in Europe they're actually now
euro commissioners like Commissioner are
a tinkerer who is responsible at
European level for the Digital Agenda so
you know how to drive digital innovation
forward and how European Commission
should support that that type of people
are actually looking our way now as a
representative of you guys on what
should they do to create this famous
digital single market and enable you if
you launch your business in Spain in
brought in Belgium in Norway whichever
suits you best to scale it across Europe
in a more easy way there has lots of
obstacles today if you want to do that
actually it's a lot easier to start a
business in the USA and to scale across
the USA then it's today to launch a
business in Europe and the scale across
Europe it's probably easier to launch a
business in Europe and scale to the USA
that then then to scale it across 28
European countries today and that's a
nuisance that's an obstacle we need to
take out of the way and that's something
European Commission is working very hard
on trying all sorts of things and
they're listening to your voice today to
understand what you need and how
it might set it up and what's the cool
thing about entrepreneurs is that they
don't come complain they don't come
whine about all the things that are not
good they tend to come up with solutions
you're entrepreneurs use the opportunity
you see solutions instead of problems
and that's very interesting about this
ecosystem that's why I love to be active
in the startup ecosystem we try to solve
and fix the problem rather than complain
about it so this one stop shop is there
make use of it if you can there is one
event a year where we bring the entire
ecosystem together which is coming up in
February indie egg in Brussels where we
have over a thousand people present
usually 80% out of the nurse twenty
percent know from the ecosystem so
mentors and experts and investors and
such so if you can and if you're the
building or considering building your
business make sure to be there so you
can come and meet all of them there's
similar events across Europe if you're
not from Belgium although you're very
happy to join us of course because there
will be an international crowd but we're
also trying to set up the other way
around and many different startup
communities across Europe are doing the
same today to build this kind of startup
nation brand each for their own country
at the time we're trying to interconnect
those national brands together to make
sure that we can create soft landing
opportunities which means we try to make
it easier for you to enter another
European market right now we're looking
export so we're trying to get the belt
don't most talented and the most ready
Belgian startups on stage in different
conferences and events and different
pitching environments across Europe but
also be armed we take Belgian startup
delegations this week to slush in
Helsinki which is a big tech conference
we've been to web summit in Dublin last
week we're taking them to nab show in
Las Vegas with which is a trade show for
media companies for example we've been
to gamescom in Cologne to take gaming
companies in a very specialized industry
environment to give them speaking
opportunities pitching opportunities
them opportunities and also investor
contacts at these big gatherings where
their potential customers and their
potential investors are so it's not just
about
giving them visibility it's mostly about
giving them business opportunities and
that's something that is right now
growing and scaling again across Europe
so make sure in whichever country you
are find out which are the platforms and
the networks that are enabling you to do
this because if we come to web summit
for example with the artists / with a
delegation of 10 to 15 Belgian startups
in our case it's much easier for us to
attract the attention of the big
investors you know if each and every one
of you has to reach out to those
investors that never heard of you before
it's going to be very hard to stand out
in the crowd and to grab their attention
if there's thousands of people fighting
over that same attention and it's big
it's going to be even harder once you
grab their attention to make sure that
after they've heard 120 pitches
throughout the day that you're the one
that they think about when they crawl
into bed at night at such a conference I
can tell you I'm being pitched to a lot
as well it's very hard to remember all
of that you know so fighting for
attention is tough and it's important at
the same time and grouping startups
together makes it more attractive more
interesting for an investor to say okay
I'm going to come over and meet your
delegation and within those 10 to 15
stars probably i'm going to be
interested in two or three and you know
for the rest i might provide some
feedback very hands-on very fast but
those two or three I want to meet again
after the conference and that's what we
want to secure and so similar
initiatives in portugal and spain in
norway in lithuania everywhere across
Europe there are people being active to
create those platforms those jumping
boards for you so make sure you find out
you reach out and you grab those go to
market opportunities if they're there
another thing going on across Europe
with all of those startup nation type of
initiatives is that they're started to
launch databases online databases of
startups which makes it easier for
potential customers to find you which
makes it easier for potential investors
to find you or at least to research you
a little bit and to benchmark your start
up against other similar business
across Europe so make sure that you are
there you know once you launch your
business you make sure that you can be
found not just through your own website
and channels but that you're in the most
important startup directories across the
world you need to be in angel list for
example if you're looking for funding
there's different TechCrunch is an
important one across the world wide
databases but most of your countries
will probably have something similar and
of course we're developing we're
maturing ourselves as started nation
initiatives and over time we hope to
secure that if you're as a Belgian
technology entrepreneur if you're in our
database that you are in all of the
important data bases across the world
because we hope to push that information
you know through 22 oath all sorts of
third-party networks but we're building
ourselves so make sure that you can be
found very very important step to tick
and I was telling you before we kind of
almost by accident became the voice of
the startup community but I don't want
to be the one being non techie I mean
I've studied German Germanic languages
of all things you know I don't know
anything about coding I wasn't gonna
step up when our national minister
frigid agenda Alexander the co he asked
me early this year say Karen would you
like to join my task force for the
Digital Agenda and voice the concerns of
the local technology entrepreneur
someone like why on earth are you asking
me I don't know that much about
technology I don't know that much about
startups either how am I to know what
could be the concerns of those
technology entrepreneurs but I wanted to
grab the opportunity at the same time
because it was the very first time in
Belgian at least that people were
actually actively asking for your
opinion and that's important because I
want to make one point clear startups
are not a minority group and we need to
make sure that they're not addressed as
a minority group you're an important
economic force you need to make sure
that you're considered an important
economic force you're going to be the
drivers of the knowledge economy of
tomorrow you're going to be the ones
democratizing our economy in a way we've
never seen before having business run
digitally and
online has enabled everyone and anyone
to either become an entrepreneur
themselves create a business created job
create economic activity for themselves
or to participate in a very democratic
way right now you can be a housewife and
at the same time have an extra earning
as an Airbnb in a provider of of
accommodation as an uber driver I don't
care which type whatever makes you
passionate you can combine different
professional activities you can combine
different economic activities based on
what you need at a certain point of time
what you want to do and that is going to
be the biggest democratization ever we
face the industry the Industrial
Revolution a couple of centuries ago
we're facing another type of revolution
right now and it's huge its massive and
you're going to be the enables or of
that type of economy so make sure you
are not put in a corner you're not a
minority group you're going to be the
most important leverage in the economy
of tomorrow and you needed a voice I
understood that but I didn't want to
speak for you without knowing what you
guys wanted and needed and again loving
about you guys that you are solution
driven rather than whiners I said okay
let's fine I'll do this I'll voice the
concerns no I won't voice the concerns
of the startups and the technology
entrepreneurs I want to voice the
solutions what should we improve if it's
not alright today the entrepreneurial
climate in Belgium in Europe what should
we do differently tomorrow and this is
what you guys came up with we
crowd-sourced for a couple of weeks
deadline with a bit tight sorry about
that will do it all over it again next
year I hope for a start-up manifesto 20
and there are already 12 start at
manifestos out there across Europe at
regional or national level many more
coming so make sure again to reach out
to the people in your local environment
that are developing this type of
document because it is important it has
an impact and these were the five topics
that came up first of all a start-up is
a peculiar sort of business you know it
asks for a lot of investment not just
cash investment if you're in hardware
and infrastructure there's a lot of
cash involved already in the early
stages if you're in software it could be
in the or or in software as a service
for example or if you're in a business
where you're actually leveraging other
type of digital marketplace for example
the investments are lower but still in
the early stages of such a business you
will not be earning money let's face it
and I want to be very clear about that
if you're going to launch digital
business and you're going to step up to
an investor say I need two million
because I want to provide for a wait for
myself for the next three years while
I'm building this thing you're going to
get a big no as an answer you know the
digital environment is great because
there are lots of opportunity but is
going to ask a lot of you as an
entrepreneur as well you're going to
have to invest at the very least your
own time but the fun stuff is that you
can do that if you're ready to invest
your time you can actually build this
business without having a million of
euros in your bank account up front but
it is a peculiar type of company and it
is very hard to hire staff in Europe
because it's very costly to hire staff a
very even more costly to fire stuff and
hard if you don't sometimes you can't
even get them out the door which is a
nuisance so there's lots of things that
are not exactly ideal for launching this
type of business in a European
environment and that's why you guys
propose to have this different type of
statute like you have student
entrepreneurship now in many in many
countries which allows you certain
exceptions and certain special rules you
know apart from the mainstream we would
propose a similar type of statute for a
startup company which allows for Tex
exemptions for example on the first
hirings or for prolonged periods for for
for paying that type of taxes and that's
actually one of the things that came
through first just a couple of weeks
after the start at manifesto was
launched which was handed over in a
presentation similar to this one to
Alexander the co and his entire task
force now with the press conference lots
of media there for weeks later he
announced that this startup ink type of
thing they call it differently but it
was included in his starter plan and it
did include for example a tech shelter
for angel investments which which is one
of the points you know below
those topics that we were asking for it
enables people to put up to a hundred
thousand euros into your business and
get text incentives for that because
there's a lot of money out there dear
gentlemen and dear lady there is a lot
of money in the bank accounts of the
people around you lots of people that
might believe in you that might want to
invest in you but you know being very
conservative and being very savings type
of people as Europeans there is a
threshold there this tax shelter is
actually lowering that threshold it's
making it financially more interesting
to put a hundred thousand euros into
your business and getting text
incentives out of that over having it in
their savings account at me r 2 0
interest so that allows you as an
entrepreneur because the fact that you
said this is what we need this would be
a potential solutions a couple of weeks
later it's there it was officially
granted by the government early July
there's still a couple of issues with
the waiter implementing it on the right
way tax shelter for angel investments is
there by from startups the second thing
that you guys called for a stop
pampering us we're out burners you know
we can take care of ourselves we know we
don't need all this nitty-gritty
mentoring type of thing in the end what
we need is customers you need to buy
from us you need to do stop doing big
tenders and granting lots of money to
the big corporations out there we have
better solutions we want to be heard we
want you to buy from us and that's
actually what some governments and some
companies have started doing since the
Android government started actively
buying from startups in last six months
they've launched a couple a couple of
problem topics here the city that we're
in today rather than saying we're gonna
launch a big tender with specifications
50 pages long with no entrepreneur wants
to read from to back with contracts
hanging over your head of 500 pages with
definitely know how to pronounce to read
or even can read because it's all lawyer
speak they're just posing problems out
there and they're asking for you guys to
come up with solutions smaller solutions
not five min
dollar solutions small things that you
as a business as a start-up can provide
to improve the city operations in the
city environment 21 startups have
started contracts with this entropy city
government since a number of big
corporations have launched by from
startups hackathons and type of events
to better understand what you guys are
providing and how they might become a
customer of yours so it helps to put
your voice out there people are
listening so make sure you cry out I
mean I know it's far from your comfort
zone but step up and cry out as as loud
as you can whenever you get the
opportunity I will be there we know
we're listening to them will be helping
you so make sure if you have you know
that type of proposals for us others you
don't educate and cultivate it's obvious
that we need to teach people about these
opportunities that we need we need to
teach more people to code on a
combination of three and four paying it
forward which means that you know
entrepreneurs that have had a good run
they're willing to give something back
they're willing to do mentorship they're
willing to do investments most of the
business angels out there are actually
you know successive succeeded
entrepreneurs that are putting some of
the money that they earn by selling
their businesses successfully back into
the community they're out there to help
you but not just with cash also with
their networks and with their expertise
which is cool but it also means that we
at the point in time that we're still
investing even we can do something you
know I can be out here and come and talk
to you I don't get money for this I'm in
oulu how I'm not losing business but at
least I'm not doing business at this
point in time to help my own business
forward but I'm very willing to do this
for you to share whatever I have learned
in the last three years about the
technology ecosystem with you to
hopefully help you along one small step
and I'm sure many of you are doing the
same and that's also part of paying it
forward and being most of you very
technical profiles and there being a big
lack of those across Europe there's many
programs out there that are helping both
youngsters and you know more mature
professionals to learn coding so if at
some point you say like hmm I want to do
this I'm gonna pay it forward I want to
contribute to society help other
entrepreneurs on their way
this is something that you could do
fairly easily maybe you can help you
know maybe you can join one of those
coding camps you have lo hago in Paris
and Brussels for example teaching people
in the nine weeks the timeframe to
actually build their own prototype which
is you know something that's become more
or less doable if it's a fairly simple
business maybe you can join one of those
in training programs for for kids and
for youngsters to learn in the basics of
coding that's going to make a huge
difference in their lives so make sure
you know entrepreneurs love to
contribute they love to create solutions
make sure if there's anything out there
and you want to share you know don't
don't hesitate do this you're going to
make a big difference in people's lives
if you do and most of all them that's
the hardest part for Belgians at least
it's be proud we need to we need to talk
about successes we need to talk about
the things that we're doing I mean
equally need to talk even if we're proud
about the failures we've created this
conference and we're now active in a
European project to try and get the
topic of failing and failing forward out
there we're being punished harshly if we
fail across Europe and it's stupid in
the u.s. if you step up to a big
investor and it's your first time
project your first startup ever they're
going to laugh you out the door and
we're going to tell you you go and do
this and play around a little bit and by
the time you reach your fifth startup
come back because you will have learned
you know other people will have paid you
to learn and you come back when you know
how it's done failure is being
considered over there as a learning
process it's part of a learning process
failing forward you don't tell a kid
when he falls off his bike for a 20th
time hmm maybe you're never gonna learn
you know maybe you should stay on the
ground I don't think a bike is something
for you have you ever met a kid that in
the end did not learn to ride a bike I
haven't you know some need more time and
others granted and we as entrepreneurs
some need more help and so many more
time than others and that's fine but in
the end they learn to ride the bike
right because we keep telling them maybe
you should consider this maybe should
try that we help them a bit we hold them
a bit and in the end they learn to ride
a bike and it's the same with failing
and with entrepreneurship you learn by
doing but they need to allow you to do
to practice to become a really good and
a really successful entrepreneur and we
need to allow people to do that we need
to be willing to keep putting money in
entrepreneurs that may have had a failed
project in the past and it's fine in our
failing forward conference which are
nearly cruz opened two years ago she
actually said if you've never failed you
probably never tried hard enough it was
kind of confronting I thought but it's
true in the end you know stretching
yourself taking risks putting yourself
out there that's what it's about and if
you if you do that properly chances are
that you're going to fail it's multi
more big time you're going to fail at
some point and that's just fine so let's
nurture each other talk about the
failures as well as the successes be
there for each other and you know cheer
each other on for the next project
that's fine in having your voice out
there many of the things we already
discussed so a lot of things have been
changing so you can actually change the
world bit by bit which is huge in itself
and dude just a couple of examples with
those tech shelter already being
mentioned the city of Antwerp starting
to buy from startups fidic twitch is the
federal agency in Belgium for ICT
actually you know being a broker in
between all of the local regional
national and european governments and
the ICT and technology industry they've
started a big project on open data and
on buying from startups from a
government perspective there to spending
you know one full-time equivalent which
is already a good investment on learning
to understand how to work with you guys
and who innovate the way that government
is operating at a local and at national
level there's European associations and
European initiative like ours that are
emerging and you know I mean I would
never have expected three years ago when
i started started obe i felt like we're
so much behind you know i was looking at
the Amsterdam in the Berlin and the
Paris ecosystems in London was going wow
they're so vibrant how are we ever gonna
catch up being this tiny nation with all
of these in infighting and internal
problems how will we ever catch up
people we did I mean we're not the
biggest start of city yet in Europe but
that's the pole problem of Belgium
we're not well actually we are one big
city we need to consider Belgium as one
big city we're close to the population
of New York ladies and gentlemen that's
how we need to behave and we need to
interconnect those startup cities or
startup hubs or startup regions however
you want to call them nearly cruz is not
that stupid you know she launched all of
this digital stuff at European level and
then she went back to the Netherlands
and the first thing that she did was
that she created the start of Delta it's
not just about Amsterdam anymore she
created the region which includes
amsterdam rotterdam and and woven three
of their biggest technology hubs and she
joined them into one project one brand
startup delta and then if you have a
marketing front like neely cruise that
helps a lot of course but now started
delta is amongst the 20 biggest startup
communities in the world amsterdam on
its own even would have made it that far
that's how it's done you need to open up
you need to partner you need to be able
to work together to create bigger
quality bigger platforms and make sure
that you stand out there and once you do
success follows believe me we've had a
couple of examples at the start of
Nations summit where we could each
startup nation across the world could
nominate one startup one startup could
go over there and pitch in a big
pitching competition and just one year
ago more or less today an anthro partner
actually won one of the major
competitions over there he got PR
attention across the globe because of
that you know being a startup nation you
can put your people out there you can
create those opportunities for them same
thing with these codes market a type of
of campaigns in one of our last go
global campaigns or early this year at
least at the next web in Amsterdam one
of the biggest web conferences in Europe
one of the Belgian starts one major
competition won an investment rise of a
hundred thousand euros you know what
they turn it down while the accepted
honor and the award they turned down to
100,000 euros because it came with
strings attached and they had you know
the lucky position of saying no no no
we've got a three million dollar or euro
type of investor standing
by and he doesn't want to share for a
hundred thousand euro a couple of our
shares with you so thanks but no thanks
we'll take the honour will take the
award but you can keep the money how
cool is that you know and that's what we
need to do we need to create a platform
for people like you so you can
concentrate on your business because the
right mentors and the right people are
out there and you know the stage is
yours it's going to be you standing up
here next time and believe me it's a bit
to know it's a bit uneasy especially the
stage is this big but you'll do fine
don't hesitate I didn't use to be on
stage like this either I still you know
sleep badly before I have to do this
type of thing and you will too for a
couple of years you get the hang of it
you can do this so make sure that you
practice whenever you can with your kids
with your wife with your girlfriend with
your friends make sure that you practice
in pitching being on stage being in
front of people telling your story and
being very passionate about it because
that's what we've got to make you
different you care about what you do you
wouldn't be here if you didn't know and
that passion is what's going to make the
difference but you need to do that be
aware of that and they'll be afraid of
that is fine you're going to survive
nobody was killed on stage yet or at
least not in this type in forum and so
don't worry and there's lots of you know
people standing by to capture your story
you won't always have to be on a stage
like this you can talk to journalists
you can talk to bloggers you can talk to
all sorts of people that will tell your
story for you and you will be in the in
the press and the attention visibility
worldwide that's fun it doesn't seem
like it could be maybe but it's fun it's
going to be okay so make sure you know
to write a journey to start out with
being inspired listening to other people
seeing how they're doing it reading a
lot about this type of thing you know
going to conferences to hear other
entrepreneurs share their experience and
and have they've done it what they've
learned from it what they've taken away
they start doing as sorry as soon as you
can for those now luckily a lot of you
are already in action so maybe you can
share after this session with the other
ones how you're doing and what you're
experiencing but for the ones that put
up there handsome this is something I
want to do but I'm not just there yet
don't wait too long I mean it's never
going to be the right point in time
never ever
you just need to go out there start
putting middle viable products out there
talking to your customers what you think
about it what did you do you think about
that is there anything we need to change
how would you would you like to buy this
yes or no how much would you pay for
that talk to your customers that's going
to be the toughest part listening to
their feedback understanding that it's
not criticism of you as a person it's
constructive feedback on your product
and your product will need development
but you need to start talking to your
customers as soon as possible even if
it's only a drawing on paper go out
there with your drawing and ask your
customers what they think because you're
going to build a way better product if
you've got that feedback early on and
that's what we're being taught wrongly
most schools you know we're being taught
to finish something and polish it to
make sure that it's fully fully ready
and perfect and all that you want before
we want to take it out there and that's
not what a technology entrepreneur
should do because you're going to do a
huge investment and you're going to be
too late if you wait for that perfect
product you need to get out there try it
out experiment talk to people and if you
want to benchmark what you're doing if
you've got this idea in your head we've
been working on the Belgium startup
ecosystem and the metrics that we have
about all of the incredible cool
companies out there with Omaha would
whose growth engineer at serious its
knowledge center that's used to be part
of a Gloria which is the technology
Federation in Belgium we have a database
of about 1,400 Belgian startups that we
mapped out and so we're trying to build
insights on that I what are we good at
as a region what are we less good at bad
at some things might need to be improved
but at least we can gather in size
metrics that you can benchmark against
we're now searching for databases from
different startup nation's first of all
across Europe to see if we can
interconnect them and to see if we can
learn about Europe as a region and you
know is London the biggest fintech hub
in in Europe yes or no I mean they're
claiming to be and they might be but we
don't know for sure and that's something
funny there's all this talk about
startups and all this talk and a lot of
energy going into the start of
ecosystems in the start of Nations but
there's actually not that much
that we know for sure there's even not
one single definition about what a
start-up is and some make a distinction
between a start-up and a scale-up growth
companies or called scallops in Europe
and then in the u.s. they don't they
just call them starts you know you can
be IBM and more or less be a start-up in
their in their eyes so we need to make
sure that we back this up with data and
with metrics to understand what we're
talking about and that's still going on
right now so you're still in a very
mature market I'm afraid as a start-up
that's fine because we ourselves are
also out there trying testing talking to
customers and trying to make it better
practice what you preach that's going to
be important next couple of decades for
sure so just speaking for Belgium for
those 1,400 startups that we mapped out
we're definitely you know Abby to the
country no big surprise there i think be
a belgium has history of being more be
to be oriented than B to C so that's
being confirmed by the numbers but
surprisingly if you look at industries
ad tick advertisements no branding type
of technology that came out on top we
didn't see that one coming manufacturing
was more what we expected we've we've
got a big history there but we know that
it's draining and it's whining so it's
probably not going to be around for that
much longer but technology in doing
end-to-end manufacturing and that type
of thing is still very hot him in
Belgium still very active health tech
was another one that could have been
expected him there's a good social
security good health system in Belgium
so it kind of makes sense that were
pretty active in all the technology that
surrounds the type of health environment
and health provision coming up is
FinTech everything having to do with
financial services kind of disrupting
the big banks which makes them very
anxious and very eager to be active and
to talk to you guys to understand what's
going on and how they might need to
reinvent themselves over time and one of
the emerging industries is actually HR
tech we're still being very conservative
about how we hire people how we find
people are we recruit people select
people that's something that's probably
going to be disrupted over the next
decade and
take that long so interesting to watch
you know over time we hope to see the
trends and evolutions in that are there
certain industries rising are there
certain industries fading away
interesting to look at if you look at
you know how big are they how old are
they how are they doing as to you know
business turnover that's Harper thing
many many many of them are still
considered startups which in the
definition of omagh at least a start up
this is a startup as long as it's not in
well there's a difference in in Belgium
at least between what we call an eyes BL
known otherwise well maybe I that's the
one so it's kind of a smaller the
company doesn't require a lot of
investment up front you putting money
safely a way to build your casa your
business so there's different for
Belgium there's there is a difference in
start-up and scale up in there once your
watch called an env numbers of notes cup
in in Flemish for example then you
automatically become a scalar because it
requires a lot of cash up front and that
kind of comes with the assumption that
you've got that cash to put it in that
type of thing which is not in your core
business creating revenue so that says
something about your business the number
of people in your staff to turn over
that type of metrics are taken into
account to distinguish but surprisingly
low is a Deadpool we know for a fact
that from looking at the projects around
us that near to ninety percent of the
projects that start out don't will make
it into a bigger company ninety percent
fail in whichever way you know or die
away so how come only eight percent are
actually businesses that are officially
taken out of business that are either
bankrupted or close the books and and go
away that shows that there is a big
problem in our legislative in a context
these businesses are not officially shut
down they just stop doing business more
or less but they're still officially
they're still around so how many of
those startups and that forty-nine
percent are actually living dead we
don't know we're looking now for metrics
to see if we can identify how many of
those 40
nine percent startups are actually not
that active or pretty much dead without
us knowing it for sure because they
might not want to close the business
because they would consider it as a
failure and I don't want to have the
failure on the resume because it costs
you a bit of money to close down your
company and they just don't want to
invest that type of money in closing the
company and therefore let it live on
forever that type of thing so we're
looking for metrics on on how to
distinguish between that interesting to
look at that type of metrics what I also
found interesting was the big boost in
the number of startups in 2010 and at
first I didn't understand but then
walmart it some more research and he
explained to me that that's about the
point in time when technology became a
commodity it became affordable and
accessible for a multitude of people you
can pretty much all of us at this point
in time can afford to buy a laptop go on
the internet learn to code and do
something create a business out of that
that was not the case before you need a
you know expensive servers that you
needed expensive technology you needed
investments are in the ten tens of
thousands of years to be able to start a
business that stopped in 2010 and that's
formed a huge boost in a number of
startups and another one is coming or
was coming a end of last year first
early this year because of the fact that
in many countries the funding schemes
opened up following the trend after a
couple of years of having more
businesses around the investors became
more interested in cash was coming on
the table so lots of opportunities there
it says is the right time to start this
type of venture just you know as a
reference 2014 we had a couple of
companies in bringing in the big bucks
in Belgium which was a good sign but if
you compare that to 2015 and the years
not over yet not just a number of
companies that acquire over a million
dollars is growing fast but they know
the amount that they're raising is also
being tripled quadrupled so that's a
good sign that were actually breathing
companies that can grow sufficiently and
that
can secure and convince big investors to
put big-time money on the table to
become global players hopefully at some
point if you want to low and for the
ones that are a bit aware of the type of
companies that we have round these are a
couple of examples of companies that
they require that were bought that so
that we're sold in the course of this
year that's another way of bringing in
cash starting over potentially with a
cash for a new venture so these
companies were acquired by other bigger
customers or companies rather and these
are a couple that are now in the 1
million euro club that they raised at
least 1 million and some of them many
more in just the last couple of months
let's say if you're looking at regional
spread for Belgium for example
interesting to see that our capital is
bringing in most of the startups
probably not surprisingly being the most
international environment obviously in
our tiny country but if you look at the
different provinces of smaller regions
within Belgium interesting to see that
antwerp where we are today is kind of
heading after our capital and even more
interesting especially for some of our
policy makers is that our wounds the
french-speaking provinces are doing
badly at this point in time and they're
investing heavily to solve that issue
but having that type of metrics gives
you a benchmark it gives you a more or
less objective idea of what's going on
and what might need to be improved or
might need to be done what could be an
interesting investment or an interesting
in industry to go into and watch which
might not regions startup cities across
Belgium but also interesting is where do
our companies from launching from
Belgium start their second and third
office still won 1 out of 3 and chooses
USA as the first foreign branch let's
say but apart from that people are still
very much focused on the surrounding
countries and not that hard to explain
with Europe still being very closed off
as a market is very hard still for a
Belgian company to enter
finish market or the Spanish market
something that we need to work on
because if we want to create unicorns
and the big companies which we don't
have at this point in Belgium to be
honest then we need to do something
about this we need to create a bigger
home market for them and we need to make
sure that it can get out of that tiny
circle of surrounding countries not
being as dependent on the USA to be able
to scale University spin-off some of you
might become coming from University
recently or in the more distant history
these are the universities that are
doing well in bringing those researchers
and those innovations to market at
present of probably most interesting for
them to compare amongst each other it's
kind of a competition and then I'll just
go a couple of fun metrics you know what
type of domain name are they taking it's
kind of interesting to us to see where
their ambition Eliza know if you launch
with the dolby e type of URL that mean
that says something about the type of
customers that you want to attract and
where your focus is which is not to be
saying that Adobe e domain is not okay
or the only you shouldn't launch your
business on the Belgian domain name
that's fine a good but it's interesting
to look at how many companies think
globally from day one and our aiming
globally from day one again on the legal
setup which says something about again a
ambition level and the type of business
that they want to run and then just to
give you a quick idea of just the belt
and market at all what is out there as
to support we're not going to describe
all of them in detail you can find out
more either through our website or ask
and we'll put you in touch everything
you want but just to have an idea
accelerator so these are just programs
in a limited number of weeks or months
helping you coaching you mentoring to
get your company either from idea to
start up or from start up to you know a
bit more mature maturity enabling you in
your go-to-market strategy and acquiring
new customers for you that many programs
are actually around in Belgium 10
million people have this many options to
choose from startup studios something
similar yeah all those programs out
there helping you to take the next step
in your business if you're focused on
Hardware you have lots of choices even
in Belgium tiny country if you want to
partner up with a big corporation loads
and loads of companies are stepping into
that scene or setting up coaching
programs go-to-market programs to help
you out to reach reach out to you and to
learn from you we'll also to open up
their network and their expertise if you
are a media lots lots of choice across
Europe as well buyer for that matter
media companies are really waking up to
see the dome and understanding that you
know disruption is coming from the
outside and that they're lagging behind
and they want to understand they want to
partner up with you to be able to
survive but also to help you to thrive
and to become bigger banks already
discussed and in Belgium alone and I
think actually Bell fuses the first the
fourth one moving a bit more
aggressively into the scene three major
bay banks are heavily investing I'm
talking millions into investment funds
into acceleration programs into
incubator buildings where they're
hosting startups like you so these you
know these big fish are actually really
really eager to work with you make use
of that if you're in food tech you know
certain niches are doing incredibly well
you know if you're in cleantech another
example certain niches are are becoming
that important because in case food tech
we're moving back to local production
we're kind of in the next industrial era
coming is it's going to be organized in
a totally totally different way with 3d
printing on the way for example so we're
just gonna bring in all of the the basic
goods and we're going to do the
manufacturing very small-scale locally
very tailor-made that's where we're
going so food tech is gonna be huge it's
going to be really really important a
couple of initiatives focusing just on
that if you just want a short-term hook
up with a number of people and do this
kind of sprints in 34 days with your
business doing kind of business
validation business testing do do a spin
development with a couple of other
people then a hackathon or startup
weekend could be an interesting format
for you
a massive amount of initiatives are
there that will help you to just do that
one one one off big jump forward and
test your case and talk to people
looking for money don't come and tell me
that there is no money out there when
there's a huge number of VC funds
smaller and bigger out there business
angels and business angel clubs out
there the problem is not that they're
not out there the problem is that you
might not know today how to reach them
you know who to reach out to how to
reach them to grab their attention and
to convince them because you know
investors I wouldn't know how to step up
to one and convince them either so
what's probably required is not the fact
that there is no money out there that
what's required is to that we who might
have those contacts help you to reach
them and help you prepare for such a
talk so it's up to us to be better at
what we do rather than you know the
money not being out there there there
don't worry crowdfunding in itself
especially you are in a b2c market
crowdfunding could be a very interesting
format for you to see its business
validation at the same time as its
acquiring funding there's many many
platforms launching right now angel
investments already discussed all sorts
of programs to help you internationalize
to jump on that international scene and
to make sure that you move forward and
that you have this global vision and you
acquire our customers not just in your
own startup nation but across the globe
and as to industry I think personally
fintech and insurance is the one that's
going to be disrupted if not tomorrow if
not yesterday then probably tomorrow
they have this big hit coming and they
don't see it coming right now so that's
be a big opportunity for the innovators
that are going to be in that scene but
there's also a revival of the hardware
industries so if you're in Hardware
there's a very interesting era coming up
HR tech already discussed and also don't
forget that you know there are lots of
opportunities in the sharing in the
peer-to-peer community and an economy
you're able to enable people to work
with each other create a direct
connection between customer and provider
then you're probably going to be in a
good spot for a couple of decades to
come as well
so actually there is no real reason why
not to take your idea your business your
venture out there and just you know
tryna and go and that's what I would
advise you to do take your idea start
talking start doing reach out to the
people that are out there that I
hopefully convinced you of the fact that
there is many many many people out there
that willing to help you capable of
helping you we're still struggling a bit
you know to get the right ones under
your nose but still they're there go out
and find them go pitch and you know do
your thing do what you're good at that
being said they'll be out the door if
you have very practical questions I
think we have 23 minutes left if you
have this burning question you can step
up right now otherwise er I'll see you
at coffee thank you very much for app</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
