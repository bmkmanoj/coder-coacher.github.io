thanks for coming to the early session
when I first created this talk or when
it was first asked me to speak about it
it was front-ends for back-end
developers but if you look at the
acronym for that that's actually a fee
bed so that doesn't sound like a very
good acronym right so I changed it to
fed bed which sounds a little better fee
bed you know has some weird connotations
but I apologize if my voice is a little
raspy are sweating a little they kept me
out late last night you know that guy
with the funny hair mark I think his
name is he didn't seem thirsty but he
just kept drinking and the other guy
he's tall and fun to talk to and it's
got this weird obsession with like
automating his home I'm similar in my
volkswagen problem damn alright so those
two guys if you see him today then and
you know complain to him my name is Matt
Rayville I'm a hick from the sticks I
grew up in the backwoods of Montana with
no electricity and no running water had
to walk two miles to the bus stop every
day and it was uphill both ways I have
an expensive obsession with Volkswagen
buses and ban again if you have a
similar problem I'd love to talk to you
I work for a company called octa and
this company is cool because they have a
pub in the company headquarters so this
is a picture I took when I was first out
of company headquarters in San Francisco
and and it's actually the office that I
use when I go out there you can
basically sit at the bar and work all
day which is fun we basically have a API
for doing authentication and
authorization we support protocols such
as a lot to open ID connect and sam'l
and I don't know if you saw yesterday
but spring security came out with a new
release 5.0 like milestone one and they
have octet as an example to authenticate
against so if you're looking for a
faster speed to market and you do want
to do authentication against the cloud
you can just use spring security so
you're not actually incorporating any
code from us into your application
you're just using our open standards and
makes it easy to get up and running with
an authentication
and authorization in your applications
so how many people in the room consider
themselves back-end developers
is there anyone that's done front-end
development you guys are just here to
test my knowledge it's great who's doing
anyone doing dotnet Python node.js
a couple people and then Java everyone's
hand goes up all right I like you people
who writes code for you eyes there's a
couple of you do you write it in HTML or
JavaScript just shout it out what are
you using for a framework time leaf and
bottom anyone else like nah we don't
want to talk about it we're using JSF so
who likes JavaScript ends up ok we got
like 5 so my goal by the end of it is
we're up to like seven or eight write
that like JavaScript so is anyone using
react we got one two three anyone using
angular we have a couple ember about bjs
so it's a zero and those last two so my
web development journey I actually
started developing web pages in 1993
that was before netscape 1.0 even
existed my dad talked me into and he was
like you know you can write this HTML
stuff it's pretty cool and so I did and
and I used the browser called Slipknot
and then the next year a browser came
out called Netscape and lo and behold
the image tag worked right and it was
like wow this was pretty cool I like you
know being able to see images and then
you know I continued on that and then I
ended up being a Java developer late 90s
the reason I became a Java developer was
I was HTML guy and I would encounter
bugs in the backend and I would talk to
the Java guys and say hey can you fix
this and they would be like yes but it
would take them three or four days and
I'd just be sitting there twiddling my
thumbs the whole time and so I figured
you know maybe I can dig in and figure
this out so sure enough I started
digging into the Java code and figuring
how to do it and I wasn't very good at
it I wrote a lot of really crappy code
but at the same time I ended up learning
a lot about Java and I you know dug in
and taught myself a lot and got some
certifications and stuff like that
and within a year I was like the lead
Java developer which just meant I wrote
the most crappy code right and I had the
most code in the codebase but it was a
fun experience 2001 I got into open
source I got into struts 2004 I wrote
the first book on spring 2004 to 2008 I
kind of got lost in spring land and
started doing a lot of back-end
development
I got somewhat famous for doing MVC
framework comparisons right of struts
and spring and tapestry and JSF I went
to work for LinkedIn in 2007 and then I
got back into front-end development in
2008 and 2009 and then 2010 I got into
Lake leadership at Time Warner Cable I
did some Java is overstock out in Salt
Lake City and then 2011 and 13 I got
into jQuery and then that turned into
angular and and then I've been doing
angular all the time since like 2015 for
the most part last year I started
working at storm path on there Java team
at the same time I was working at
Computer Associates on their angular
team so it's funny that I would do Java
in the morning when I do angular in the
afternoon and then 2017 my favorites now
are basically Java spring Boop angular
and typescript and that's you know what
I'm not skiing or driving Volkswagens so
I have a fair amount of experience with
front-end development and front-end
frameworks so it is modern front-end
development I want to hear from you what
do you guys think it is here in the
front row you got to go to speak up if
you're in the front room
but you you're here to learn about what
jQuery No
never done UI okay it's a JavaScript
view typescript is it CSS sass alright
it's still CSS that just compiles
differently right
so it's interesting because one of the
skills that people ask me you know what
are you known for I like to say that I
am really good at CSS because who's good
at CSS nobody I think it's very unique
you know to say you're good at CSS and
for the most part the reason I'm good at
CSS is just because I've done it for 20
years
right and I know that there's different
tweaks and different browsers and stuff
like that the CSS frameworks have gotten
better so it's you know it's easier now
than it was but it's still one of those
skills that really comes down to
experience for the most part so
front-end development has changed a lot
since 2005 remember the good old days
are like struts in spring MVC and then
we got this this awesome new framework
called JSF and and that was supposed to
be the savior for Java but what happened
around the same time you'll see there in
2004 flex 1.0 and spring 1 dot oh those
were very powerful at the time compared
to JSF they made it really nice for
developers to be able to to write code
and get it quickly to the screen and I
think if you talk to anyone that's done
flex development chances are they'll be
like that was a good experience I'm sad
it went away
JSF not so much but then the what
happened was the Java framework
explosion came along and so they used to
make fun of Java frameworks Java web
frameworks because we had so many and
then then the JavaScript web frameworks
came out and there was a new one every
day so now there's you know not a new
one every week but like two years ago
there was and so some leaders have
started to emerge and now we've got into
like progressive web apps right web apps
that are basically apps that you can
download on your phone
and it sticks in your browser and it's
almost just like you know regular native
app and we have web frameworks that
write native apps we have ionic and
native script and react native right so
it's really come a long way in the sense
that you can write HTML and the sense of
react native and it actually produces
components on the phone it doesn't
actually use any HTML doesn't use
PhoneGap or anything like that
so this can be overwhelming if you're
new to the space so if you are a
back-end developer and you're looking
again in the front-end development
you've heard of all these frameworks and
stuff you might want to read this
article because it's pretty funny it
talks about you just learn this and now
it's out of fashion you just learn this
an outside of fashion so you were new to
your current space though at one point
and the question is were you overwhelmed
then when you first started learning
Java for instance maybe but you're
probably very curious to write you were
you were new to it and you were into it
and you're willing to learn and rather
than being bitter about new frameworks
you were just excited to learn you know
what job offered so you know I think
front-end engineer and and you know how
that works now has become a whole new
meaning right front-end engineer is now
a thing and that's because we've added
all this complexity to the front-end but
it's because they've given us the power
and there's you know a lot more
capabilities in the browser than there
ever was so back when you first learn
Java and when you first got into
programming it was a great time in your
life so today what I'm trying to do is
teach you that it can be a great time in
your life as far as front-end
development is concerned too so when you
were first getting into programming
you're all happy about learning you know
something new every day
that same experience can come in
front-end development so learning is the
ultimate skill it's not knowing angular
it's not knowing react it's the ability
to learn that's really where you know
the power comes as a programmer the
willingness to learn and the willingness
to be curious so I hope you're all
curious let's do some learning
so we have a number of different
JavaScript versions es5 was basically
released in 1999 which was the same year
as web browser any guesses 99 spent
along ie6 and at the time it was awesome
right it was better than the previous
versions it has Ajax capabilities and
and it was just really great for a web
developer to work with and then ten
years later people are still using it
and it's like stop please stop
so es6 came along and that's also known
as echo script 2015 and that has classes
and modules so not just you know
functions like normal JavaScript but
more like classes like we have in Java
and then we have es7 which is
technically ECMO script 2016 it was
finalized in June of last year and it
has features like the exponential
operator and array includes so you can
do and includes on an array there's also
an e s7 feature called
a decorator it looks just like an
annotation in Java they've actually
taken that out so that's no longer part
of it but take script as that so if
you're doing angular development or
you're using typescript it actually has
that annotation that you can use so all
browsers have good support for es 5
browser support for es 6 is pending you
can see there that ie 11 doesn't have it
and it's not going to have it because
they've created a new browser now called
edge classes support is almost at 75%
and modules is at 5% so the browser's
still have a ways to go to catch up and
you know support all the features of es6
so what typescript looks like here's how
you can install it so you install
node.js and then you can all install NPM
install - gee typescript and that gives
you the ability to write a function like
this the only real difference between
regular JavaScript and this function is
there's a type so similar to how
in Java you would have a string space
you know variable name this has variable
name : string and then you can use this
TSC command to compile that and this is
all from the typescript documentation
there's also other things I mean
javascript has types right number string
and boolean and typescript adds
additional types like a tuple and an
enum and then any and a void so those
are all types that you can use it also
has static types and interfaces and
generics all those exist in typescript
so if you're a Java developer and you're
looking to get into front-end
development I would highly encourage you
to look at typescript just because it's
very familiar to you and it'll be easier
for you to adapt to than regular
JavaScript and the cool thing about the
typescript compiler is you can actually
run it on existing JavaScript code and
it'll tell you if like variables aren't
being used or if other things are wrong
you know with your code so it's more
about classes and functions for example
here's a bus class and you'll see it has
a constructor it's not like constructors
in Java where you have you know public
and then class name it's just called
constructor and then you'll see that
looks like an Elvis operator there where
it basically says that name parameter is
optional you don't have to pass it in
there and then there's getters and
setters for the name and how that works
is you do class name dot variable equals
and that will call the setter and then
the same thing with the the getter you
do class name dot whatever the variable
name is and that pulls the value so you
don't actually call getter set you just
you know use that syntax and it calls
those methods and then you can see at
the bottom we have some string
interpolation with the backticks and you
can see this buses name is and it reads
the local variable so typescript 2.3 I
know it's kind of hard to read there
brings type checking to JavaScript files
so you can see this is a visual of
decode and basically you type in a
comment at the top and then it detects a
whole bunch of JavaScript errors even
though we're not in a typescript file
we're in a JavaScript file you can
actually have it
it recognizes and you know parses your
code that way so before you can really
do anything with with JavaScript or your
writing code for the front-end you'll
basically need to install nodes so
you've probably heard a node you know
that a lot of people use it for back-end
development but it's really the power
behind front-end development now because
it allows us to run build tools it
allows us to install things and do a lot
of stuff that you normally do on the
back end so before you can write any
typescript or es6 and have a compile
down to es5 you need to use nodes so
basically you can install from node.js
org and then there's this nice tool
called nvm that allows you to switch
between node versions so you might need
that especially if you're doing back-end
development with node to switch between
like a 4x version and a 6x version just
makes it all really easy so the next
thing you'll get into after you've
installed node is a build tool it used
to be gulp
before that it was grunt and we had you
know some build tools were in the front
end space newschools kind of systems yes
a lot of people are using that as well
but the hip one is webpack that's what
everyone's kind of moved to in the last
year as far as pulling down web
dependencies like we do in java old
school with bower noodle schools npm and
now the real hip one is yarn so yarn is
yet another resource negotiator and it's
from Facebook and the reason they
created it was just because NPM
basically installs all these web
dependencies in your project and it
doesn't do any caching so if you have
multiple projects going there's no
sharing of resources between those
projects and so a yarn allows you to do
is actually caches like what you've
downloaded previously and it just
installs things much faster so yeoman is
another tool that people use often to
create projects it's basically the
scaffolding tool for modern web apps
helps you kick start new projects and
promotes a yarn workflow the yarn
workflow is basically having some tool
that creates projects like yeoman and
it's cool because the commands yo like
yield create me a project
and then the build tool which is like
grunt or gulp and then a package manager
like bow or MPN and you have easy
installation new JavaScript libraries
you have build and optimization of
JavaScript files with grunt or gulp or
even web pack and then you have testing
with karma and phantom our popular
choices phantom J's is a headless
browser and we've recently started
chrome came out with a headless version
last month and so people are using that
more than phantom J's now so browser
sink is another great tool I think I had
a video but it's not playing anymore
browser sync what it allows you to do is
basically have a number of different
browsers so yeah you can see the video
playing now the guy basically modifies
the code and it changes all the
different browsers and it even works if
you're doing something with iOS
simulator you see here this is actually
iOS simulator there and it'll reload
that browser as well so it's great if
you're testing or your app needs to work
in multiple browsers so this is what
gulp look like looks like it's like aunt
kind of where you have tasks you can set
up browser sync and then you can watch
files and when any files change your
reload browser sync so if you're
familiar with ant are you familiar with
tasks and Gradle gulp will make sense to
you web pack is a whole new ballgame
so web pack is a module binder bundler
for modern JavaScript applications when
web pack processes your application
recursively builds a dependency graph
that includes every module your
application needs and that package those
all those modules into smaller bundles
and there's often only one to be loaded
by the browser as you get bigger and
bigger applications it'll do code
splitting for you so you can have
multiple modules and handle that it's
incredibly configurable and to get
started you only need to understand four
concepts which is basically entry output
loaders and plugins so here's what a web
pack config looks like you can see that
is the entry and the output it tells it
where to go and then the modules for the
loaders
and it tells you basically for every JS
file load it with Babel and process it
that way and so if you're doing
typescript you would use a similar
loader for typescript that is an awesome
typescript plugin for instance that
processes all the TF files and turns
them into JavaScript files so a couple
features that are cool about web pack is
there's a web pack bundler analyzer and
web pack dashboard so I'll post these
slides after the presentation you can
actually click on these links the
bundler analyzer will tell you the size
of your bundles and how you can make
them smaller the dashboard will
basically in your browser show you the
airs so instead of looking in your
browser console you can look you know
right in your browser and see it so this
is a great recommendation that I have
for a practical introduction into web
pack this guy ivan aqua loop a senior
engineer at epa has basically been
working with web pack for a while and
he's written these three blog posts so
the first one he has out his building
front-end and adding compilation and
then he has a couple more coming out
this month so if you want to see the
latest and greatest information on that
he's a good resource but what I really
like is it's brought back compiling so
it's now actually on the projects that I
work on that have like angular and
typescript it's actually slower to build
the front-end than to build the backend
so you can you know sword fight with
your friends in the hallway or you know
go get a new cup of coffee so now to dig
into one of the things that people think
about when they actually do front-end
development is what framework should I
use so in my opinion my gut feel is that
the leading JavaScript frameworks are
angular react in view jeaious this is
based on traffic patterns that we've
seen both its storm path and octa and on
Scotch IO we get some information about
what they see and it's also based on
stats and this guy so Eric Elliot is a a
popular guy that talks about JavaScript
or a lot and he wrote an article earlier
this year that basically says here's the
top frameworks
that I recommend in JavaScript and
there's another another one I found on
hacker noon says the same thing
basically angular react view they also
have ember jets and meteor in there but
it's fun to talk about three or rather
than five so here's what Eric wrote you
know angular and react dominate nothing
else comes close reactors winning mind
share and customer satisfaction battles
and then down at the bottom there
frameworks to watch UJS I kind of get
help stars and a lot of downloads and a
lot of people are using it so there's
also jobs on indeed comm you can see
that angular and react are in the lead
Stack Overflow tags angular react again
github stars funny it's not angular but
views up there right so a lot of people
are starring it on github so with
angular it looks simple enough you're
just doing hello world you import
component use that component decorator
and then you have an export class that's
basically similar to doing public class
in Java and then you'll see at the
bottom there the tag right my - app and
so that basically refers to the selector
there and that's how you do hello world
with angular but that's not really how
you do it because you also have to have
an NG module which you see here it
declares that component it has a number
of imports that it can use and then it
bootstraps it and then you also end up
with another main TS file that kind of
makes everything work so you can't
actually do hello world with angular
anymore in one file you have several
files of course you can put all those
classes in the same file but there's no
like easy and concise way to do hello
world so you can get started with
angular very easily with angular CLI you
can see how to install NPM install - gee
and you know ng new to create a new app
and then CD into it and run ng serve so
here's what that looks like it basically
creates a
new project and then you can go into it
and run it so just to show you what that
looks like I actually recorded an
animated gif you'll notice that took a
minute and a half to run but I made it
work in 16 seconds so it's you know fun
to watch the gift so there's also
angular QuickStart which is from the
angular Docs and there's an angular seed
that you can use angular seed you
basically just clone the whole project
and then you CD into it and you start
developing with it there's another one
called angular seed advanced that has a
few more things in it it's got a ng rx
store for rxjs powered state management
inspired by redux it's got a
internationalization with ng translate
and it's got native script it's got
electron support so if you've ever used
slack or you used atom those are both
built on electron which basically means
that it's chrome bundled in an
application that you can install you
know on your desktop so I've written a
number of tutorials as part of my ng
demo project so that is a project on
github it has branches for integrating
angular material for integrating
bootstrap for and for integrating octa
to do authentication and then these
videos are videos that have done in the
past on angular the building one is a
webinar that I did in January on angular
and the testing one is the talk that I
did at Jay focus in February and here is
a tutorial that you can do on how to
develop against octaves API that bitly
link goes to that document in that ng
demo project that shows you how to
actually you know authenticate against
our API this YouTube video is great it's
part of the Open ID project and it's by
this guy that's just got like the
smoothest voice ever and it's only five
minutes long but if you have some time I
recommend watching it because it's kind
of like a
moment where you're like wow is just fun
to listen to that guy the other thing
that you can do once you've known
angular is you can write ionic
applications so Ryeon ik is a framework
built on PhoneGap or Cordova that allows
you to actually take your app that
you've written in HTML and JavaScript
and put it on the phone as well as talk
to all the API is that the phone has if
you want to talk to the camera or
anything like that so the cool thing is
is once you know angular you pretty much
know ionic there's not much more to
learn there if you're into angular and
you want to learn more I recommend
ng-book too I think it's great that it's
a comprehensive guide to developing with
angular 4 and it's named ng-book - but
it's worth your money and I'd recommend
it so the other popular one is react to
do hello world with react that looks a
lot different especially because you
basically have this reactive Dom in
render and you'll notice in that render
block
there's HTML so it's not returning
variables or anything like that it's
actually returning HTML and then that
document get element by ID binds it to
that root in the HTML tag there my
favorite react videos from eric vicente
it's an intro to react and basically in
an hour you can learn pretty much most
of the concepts that you need to be
productive with react he talked about
imperative code and how you can add an
element modify an element you know move
elements around remove elements and it's
very verbose and it's very difficult
right for you for instance this an
example of taking the badge from
Facebook and you add icons right you had
numbers on it because you have four or
five like notifications I didn't even
notice but apparently if you have more
than 99 notifications you get flames on
your notifications icon so that's the
has fire and the has badge and then
declarative code defines the UI you want
whereas imperative is more
are adding modifying elements so this
shows that same code is much easier when
you're using your act if count equals
zero then it just returns the div right
and it a basically just the HTML each
time so it's kind of like get in your
browser in the sense that if it returns
the second conditional and it's already
returned the first one all it's going to
do is add that span it's not going to
actually repopulate you know everything
from that div so it enables both
imperative and declarative and props
define what the component is and state
defines what the component is so if you
have a lot of state in your application
and things need to change a lot react is
highly recommended for that so there's a
create rat react app which is similar to
the angular CLI and it makes it super
easy to develop react applications you
can see you do npm install there and
then you create it and then you go into
it and so this is what that looks like
can take a couple minutes you'll notice
this took a minute and thirteen seconds
so let's see what that looks like
the biggest time consumer is installing
everything I did speed up the video you
can see that's what it looks like so the
cool thing about creating a new react
application window with that is it ships
with all their documentation so you can
see I check my project into github
my cool app and it has how to do
everything and it's readme so you don't
have to go even find another site or
anything you actually have all that
information in there whole world with
UJS can be done in very few lines of
code you can see we have our div ID app
up there and then we bind to it with
this e l and the hash app and then data
is where we put all our data so if you
have any things in there it could be
message it could be key it could be
value it will automatically be read up
in your HTML and you can bind to those
variables so I found this video which is
pretty good from coding explained and
but it doesn't have a github project to
go with it so you're just basically
watching the video and tried the code
along verses that react when I talked
about the guy actually shows you code
and then he has a github project where
you can go and might follow along and
copy and paste code so this one's good
though and explains a lot of what View
is it shows you at the top you can still
just import it with a script tag and
then how you write handlers is use v -
whatever so you can see on cool and
click it cause the clicked button and
then that goes into a function that you
can put whatever logic you want into it
so it comes with a CLI as well view CLI
you can do NPM install for that and then
you anit it and you give it a template
name and then a project name so it
basically prompts you for a number of
different things I know it's tough to
read but it says basically project name
is my cool app project description it
just has a default in there and then it
reads your author
information from your get info and then
it says do you want to install the view
router do you want to use es lint do you
want to pick an es lint preset you can
use standard you can use Airbnb and then
it basically creates your project from
that information what it does not do is
it does not run npm install so it's much
faster than the other ones just because
all it does is generate a few you know
lines of code and doesn't run the
install for you here's what that looks
like
viewing it web pack for instance Michael
app
so you can see this is the fastest one
it actually executes sin 17 seconds it
doesn't do that in p.m. install so it
doesn't take another minute so one of
the cool things that's emerged with
these frameworks is server side support
which means you can actually render it
on the server just like we've always
done with our MVC frameworks in Java
angular universally used to be the name
of angular support now it's merged in
angular 4 so it's no longer a separate
project if you want to see a cool react
app it's mobile Twitter comm they just
released this last month and it makes it
very easy to basically use your phone
and pull up you know this mobile app and
it sticks in your browser it's
progressive web app and it works really
nicely next j/s is the one that's
popular for view in java land you can
use spring boot if you want for react to
rendered on the server and basically
what it means when it renders it on the
server is it processes that initial HTML
spits it to the browser but it also
still has those scripts in there to do
all the JavaScript interaction after
it's been sent to the browser there's
also a spring boot angular render these
all use like the Nashorn engine from jv8
java 8 and in you know basically process
your javascript and then send it to the
client
so I think commit strip is a great
cartoon and they illustrate the problem
well and that the challenge is choosing
a framework you'll see here the
challenge when choosing a J's frameworks
is to jump onto the right train at the
right moment if you jump too soon
you don't know where you'll end up if
you wait too long you get left behind
how do you know which was the right
train you can see here that you know
some of them have left the station some
of them are canceled for instance
prototype angular 1 who knows
angular 2 may be late maybe not so it's
a tough thing to do but what I recommend
is basically learning one and
investigating a second one you know try
to learn one do it well but also don't
be afraid of
you know the alternative or the
competitor so cascading stylesheets this
is a something that people struggle with
a lot right how do i do CSS you can see
that the top one is a hash app that's
binding to an ID in HTML the second one
is a class dot blogpost so that's
binding to class equals in HTML the
third one is actually binding to the
first child in two different ways so we
have this greater than sign basically
it's saying any element P right below
that so it's not just the first one but
then you have pseudo selectors to go
into the actual first one and the last
one shows how you do sibling six syntax
so it's saying that you know I have an
image but at the same level of the image
I have a span so that allows you to just
you know modify that element but the
better thing is that syntactically
awesome style sheets they allow you to
do more programming in your CSS and to
have nested classes and it basically
produces you know what you actually want
to write and it's great so if you're
going to do CSS I recommend using sass
there's a number of CSS frameworks these
are the ones that I have a gut feel of
the most popular there's skeleton which
is dead simple haha right skeleton that
simple responsible play it doesn't even
have a logo there's pure CSS which is
from Yahoo and then there's bootstrap
and there's Foundation and bootstrap
basically is the most popular one and
what it really does is it makes your
buttons look good that's it's like real
claim to fame right you can you can
actually have a primary style and it
looks like a button that you should
click versus everything else might be a
little bit different and you're just
adding classes so it's very easy to
integrate it into most projects and
basically bootstrap for is the latest
version it's still an alpha has a great
grid system that you can use to layout
your components so on github
bootstrap is the most popular and then
foundation second pier and then skeleton
the other thing you're going to want to
do is a front-end developer is optimize
your code so the biggest way to do that
is reducing your HTTP request as well as
gzipping everything so browsers waive
accidents before even ie6 supported this
gzip concept which basically allows you
to compress all of your text based
assets whether it's HTML or CSS or
JavaScript it can compress them up to
70% before it sends it to the browser
the other thing is far futures expires
headers that's very important and then
code minification and even bigger is
optimizing your images has anyone done
front-end optimization on a project
how's it go yeah right so it's one of
those things that it does give you a lot
but it only gives you a lot on that
first render and now that we have single
page applications that's really your
only concern what I found is a lot of
clients that used to hire me to do
optimization hired me to do back-end
optimization right they're like hey this
web page takes a lot of render can you
look at our Java code and tell us what
we're doing wrong and what I found more
times than not was it was actually the
front-end that was the problem it was
gzipping it was expire setters they
weren't doing that and just by adding
those we were able to speed things up by
double so HTTP 2 is the other way of
seeing things up it's binary instead of
textual fully multiplexed so it
basically keeps the connection open and
sends information on that same
connection does parallel requests uses
header compression to reduce overhead
and allow servers to push their
responses so if you're using je hipster
so you can see here that we detect if
it's undertow and then undertow has an
option of setting it to HTTP 2 you see
the protocol in the chrome developer
tools says h2 you can also do HTTP to
push server push what this allows you to
do is push assets to the browser and
then this second printwriter where it
sends HTML it won't actually make the
request for that image because it's
already been pushed by the browser I
think this is a great diagram of HTTP
and how it works I'll just go through
quickly if you want to look after at the
slide it helps but it really explains
that you know HTTP 2 is a lot faster for
Chrome developer tools you're going to
want to use Chrome if you're a front-end
developer it's pretty much the best
browser even though hogs memory
I recommend following these two guys
Lamar and Adi osmani
they're basically the experts in the the
chrome developer toolkit and in how to
use modern dev tools this is actually a
course here modern dev tools calm you
can sign up for it I think it's like $60
US dollars and and it basically will
level you up on how to do you know
development with chrome progressive web
apps are also very popular you need
three things to do a progressive web app
secure origin so HTTPS load while
offline that's service workers and then
a web app manifest that tells how to
install an application and unfortunately
it all works great in Firefox and Chrome
not in Safari so because service workers
aren't supporting Safari kind of takes a
lot of the fun away because it doesn't
work on iPhone right you can install
Chrome on iPhone but not many people do
so if you're developing web apps should
you do responsive
or mobile first web design who thinks
responsive who thinks mobile first we
have a couple of you okay so most people
do responsive and responsibly means that
you're developing on your 30-inch
monitor and then you shrink it down and
make it look good on a phone but the
problem with doing that versus mobile
first mobile first is you divide and you
make your browser like look like a phone
and then you make it look good on the
big monitor as well that's better to do
mobile first because what allows you to
do is oftentimes you'll remove a lot of
features right because you just want to
show it works on the phone and then when
you make it bigger you add features in
so I think it's great to develop mobile
first especially when working with
product people because you can say those
that's too many features it doesn't
really look at it on a small screen and
so mobile first is basically just
testing with mobile before you actually
test with your desktop and your big
monitor so we failed on mobile for the
most part as web developers recent
report from double-click said that a 3G
connection most people should have the
webpage render in three minutes
but 53% of sites are abandoned if a
mobile site takes more than three
seconds or not yes and the same report
said that the average mobile site loads
in 19 seconds so most people are
abandoning you know mobile sites because
they take too long to load and the
reason we failed on mobile is because
these guys these laptops they're filthy
liars right they don't tell what most
people's experience is like they don't
tell what a 200-dollar Android device
actually renders your site in so $200.00
Android devices ground truth if you're
developing for you know the masses in
the world especially people in India and
Africa you should have a 200 all and
horas the device and you should use it
and test your applications with it so
mobile hates you and the ways to fight
back are implement the purple
pattern get that endured device use
Chrome inspect and inspect tracing to
actually see how long things are taking
to load lighthouse is a chrome plugin
that will tell you if you're developing
a progressive web app correctly and then
you can use tools in chrome to do
Network and CPU throttling as well
the purple pattern is push render pre
cache and lazy load so you push the
critical resources you render the
initial route you pre cached the
remaining routes and you lazy load
everything else so I published the blog
post this week on the octave developer
blog that talks about how to develop a
progressive web app with angular if
you're interested learning more about
that please visit we also have security
in the Olaf top 10 sequel injection is a
big part of you know the first one but
it's also cry site scripting is another
form of injection basically if you have
people that put data into your
application and you're rendering that
for instance if it's HTML based you want
to escape and sanitize everything don't
allow script tags in there you can
pretty much read the rest of them but
the cool thing is a Ross hasn't updated
it in like four years
and this is a release candidate so they
plan to release the final top ten in
July or August of this year but this is
the current recommendation the other way
that you can get started with a lot of
you know this front-end stuff is with J
hipster it's a yeoman generator and it
has a spring boot back-end and angular
front-end and it generates the project
for you
it also has support for micro services
and I wrote a book about it this is a
free book so you can download that from
info Q it's written an asciidoctor
and I wrote a basically a project that
you can use to start your own book so
many books are great if you want to
write one for info Q I'd be happy to
help you do that the cool thing is you
don't have to get into the topic too
much right because it's supposed to be a
mini book it's not supposed to be a
full-fledged book so hopefully you've
learned a bit about es6
in typescript and note in nvm and
angular react and view CSS and SAS and
front-end performance optimization the
biggest thing that I'd recommend is just
try front-end development and be curious
UI development is awesome because you
can see the results immediately it's a
great thing to teach kids so if you can
you know teach kids and don't forget to
test focus on quality use karma and
protractor use Travis and Jenkins and
that's still going to be a big part of
how you do front-end applications unit
tests are very simple to write you have
describe and it is basically the core
backbone of using Jasmin to test your
JavaScript code and then you can see
here again pretty easy stuff
there's also Jess which is a new
framework so instead of Jasmin and
protractor jess is a runner so things
are very fast it also is used a lot in
react applications so don't be afraid to
try new things learn JavaScript try one
of the frameworks form your own opinions
and be curious check out the developer
blog on octa i've got a lot of good
tutorials coming up soon about how to do
spring cloud micro services and build
ionic apps duje hipster microservices
and the summer there'll be some other
good posts on there so any questions
yeah
my own piano grunts this is all great
first time and then something updated
converging somewhere in ology because
maybe any consistent where it sort of
just worked it out and what they witness
but it just sort of gave me a loaded
question like no do you want put an
extra bit of wire in that proved that
something so maven has support for
ranges right you can say hey I want you
know 3.0 but if there's a 3.0 one go
ahead and give me that or 3.0 to go
ahead and give me that no one uses that
right because they know that it might
break between 3.0 and 3.0 one and
package.json for the JavaScript
ecosystem is the same way but a lot of
these projects when they generate
themselves they basically say they have
like this carrot right or this Tildy the
carrot says you can upgrade to the next
minor version right and the Tilda's like
the next you know incremental version or
whatever take those out make sure in
hard code whatever you have in package
JSON as the specific version so you know
that it gives you that version every
time it doesn't automatically upgrade
because people aren't that good at
semantic versioning they don't think
they broke anything but they did so
that's my recommendation there anyone
else well thanks for coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
