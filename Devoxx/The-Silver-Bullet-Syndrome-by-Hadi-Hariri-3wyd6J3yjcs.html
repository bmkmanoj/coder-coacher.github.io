to see the silver bullets in dome wrong
room this is the syndrome so there
wasn't some thing that I had invented
right had a nice lunch I was gonna ask
that but then I thought we're a dead
walk so that's kind of a silly question
so yeah your disclaimer of upfront who's
here to learn okay wrong room I'm
serious you're not going to learn
anything here this is more of my
frustration again so this is this is a
talk about not much so if you want to
learn something there's like six other
parallel tracks don't say I didn't warn
you
now with this let's get on presentations
101 I've been giving presentations for
quite some time and as you give
presentations you start to pick up a
bunch of tips and tricks and better ways
to do things and normally you need to
try and give talks that are informative
so that you know you've given your
valuable time to someone too well
they've given their valuable time to you
to come and listen to you so you want to
make sure that they get the best out of
that one hour or 45 minutes they give
you to be thought-provoking
that's one of the key things in giving
presentations you know it's about
thinking about what someone has just
said not necessarily agreeing but
thinking entertaining because people get
bored inspirational again it's good to
inspire people to do great things and
you shouldn't have any foul language so
given that I'm gonna basically this talk
is the complete anti-pattern of
everything there is in presentations 101
okay so I will try my best to not align
it with any of those requirements I also
usually don't talk a little bit about
myself but this time I will to put you
into context that was me Microsoft
thought I was 2 years old more or less
accurate I was born in Iran
what at some point my mother said we're
moving to Spain and I got into computers
and became grumpy and that's that's
basically the life my life now I've got
three kids and they look at me and I say
why don't you learn to program and they
say to grow up and be like you I'm like
good point
Touche background to this talk because
everything should have a background
everything should be a Y friend of mine
Greg young he puts on a conference in
Vilnius and he said to me why don't you
come and give a talk there I said this
is brilliant and it's actually a very
good I belong I'm we're at a conference
I won't comment but he said come and
talk to her and I said listen any of
illness it's good it's about to right
before it was going to enter the euro so
you know before the price is jacked up
and everyone lost their lives and he
said but there's always a bot right
there's always a but and I said yes what
Greg and he said he says you have to
talk give a talk on wucf now how many of
you know Microsoft right this is a
technology from Microsoft and he said
you you have to come and give a talk
about WCF and that's kind of like you
know getting that wedding invitation
that you've so been eager to make sure
you're on the list opening it up and
getting this instead of the actual
address and you kind of question now
like me WCF why I mean how is that
related I've made some mistakes in my
life one of them was to write a book and
I wrote a book on wucf and if that
wasn't enough bad enough I wrote it in
Spanish Spain is very good at reading
books they just don't know that you can
purchase them so it's a you already
don't make much money out of books and I
live in Spain and yes so anyway so now
if you google WCF hadi my book shows up
and I'm trying to file a request with
Google to get my name removed uh because
you know some things you do want people
to forget so going back to WCF and I've
been doing software development for many
many years and and before there was WCF
there was a thing called Korba right
how many of you remember korba CORBA was
a fantastic technology and then I - I
grew up in this thing called del Phi del
five people around here yeah still rocks
David I still stare saying it rocks as
well and del if I had this other thing
called Midas which was great which was
kind of like a distributed way to make
applications and when it first came out
it was like $5,000 to buy license but it
really simplified everything so we
deployed it once bought a license two
weeks later Borland announced that they
were making it free and I had a hell of
a hard time getting my money back from
Borland Spain but nonetheless I used to
use Midas if you want in the Delphi cam
Microsoft also contributed very
significantly to this with decom because
they said take comm and make it even
worse by distributing it and made us all
suffer and then one great day came that
one great unification and they said to
us they said you have this programming
model and you have this service model
and you have this channels and it was
like unifying everything that you had
ever seen in the past
com so everything you could think of it
was brilliant it really was it was like
a unified model for all your
communication needs it compiled it
complied with the four pillars of sowa
now just mine a little note these four
pillars of solar were written by dawn
box who at the time also worked for
Microsoft so it would be the same
company behind WCF so it would be a kind
of awkward if it didn't comply with the
four pillars but of course it didn't
comply with Thomas Earl's eleven pillars
of solar nonetheless they promised us
that this was the Silver Bullet that
everything we had challenges with in the
past was over and they used to go around
saying well they me we used to go around
saying this is as easy as ABC because it
was like three things it had address it
had binding it had contract so address
was who you want to talk to a binding
was how you wanted to talk to them and
contract was what you were going to
basically say really simple like really
easy as ABC and the great thing about
this is that you would configure it at
runtime right and configuration back
then in the old days it was done with
XML and of course it had its own kind of
configuration manual and patterns and
structures here's a snapshot of it it
didn't fit on one slide so there's a
desert third slide as well just to give
you a little bit of perspective and they
said to us if you build it with WC it
will run now the tiny little if you
manage to configure it of course if you
manage to do that it was all great and
every what every Microsoft evangelist or
book author used to say this but things
started to fail and they said to us well
your issue is WCF right WCF is a primer
is a problem that's the issue and the
promises weren't delivered and you're
kind of like but I just rewrote this you
came in and you sold me this and you
said this was my salvation but no it
just didn't work and then someone had
the bright idea of saying every class
should be a service and you kind of like
right so the silver bullet was not
delivered and the rest is history and
you will know all about that right yes
now I have good news for you Java
campers that if you if one thing that
ever held you back from adopting
Microsoft technology or WCF was because
it was an open-source you'll be glad to
know that WCF is now open source so you
can go right ahead and adopt it and it
wouldn't be fair for me to stand up here
and just criticize Microsoft because you
guys have it to write java has it too
you know like I have a problem now I
have a problem Factory with Java and
I was at devoxx France and we were at
the speaker dinner and we were walking
around with we dead organized this
amazing trip on the boat going down the
river and going and seeing the Eiffel
tire and Eiffel Tower at night and I was
up there with my friend and we were
taking some pictures and Antonio
conclave is some guy stands next to me
is like you look like such tourists well
in French accent and I'm like well we
are I mean technically we are tourists
and and then he says I'm like there has
nothing that has never been anything in
the history of mankind so ugly and
completely pointless as the Eiffel Tower
and I said that is not true there is
Java two E's well right and Java two ee
brought us a lot of things it brought us
fizzbuzz Enterprise Edition which is
fantastic you go there look at it it's
awesome and then spring came along and
said let's build a better Enterprise and
spring into introduced abstract
singleton proxy Factory beam which is an
actual class from string and the help
says convenient proxy factory being
superclass for proxy Factory beans that
create only Singleton's I did not make
that up
no seriously that is from the help file
it makes you wonder that's why people
you guys have a bad reputation of you
like like factories for everything but
there is hope there is hope or not all
is lost something is about to save us
and you all know what I'm talking about
right it's microservices now if you're
not familiar with micro services it's a
lot of little things that are
interconnected to eat with each other
and kind of each of them have this
little functionality and they're set out
to kind of make things work for you in a
nice way it's kind of like doing a lot
of little solos right except that you
don't you don't know about it in their
right mind would today say I'm doing so
because you wouldn't be able to sell it
but if you say micro services you can
difference is that you kind of like fail
small fail often and fail a lot
or or to put another way you move from a
single ball of Marcus tracing a lot of
 but there's tools to help you
orchestrate that and my friend Simon
that's here speaking as well he said you
know I keep saying this if people can't
build monoliths properly micro-services
won't help now this is good though
because it's got its positive site
because it's got us thinking and it's
taken us into having conversations like
how many lines is a micro-service right
how many not even classes now we're just
talking about lines now the good thing
for us is that tools can help tools can
help and in fact I have been prototyping
a tube for IntelliJ which is extracting
micro services for you so you can
basically select some code and then just
extract the micro-service we're always
there looking out for you right and of
course some people heard about micro
services and you know when micro
services already come mainstream when
you go to micro services organ it
redirects to IBM I also heard that
recently IBM purchased the Weather
Channel and it's like did they get the
whole clown thing a silver bullet right
but it is the Silver Bullet micro
services now is the silver bullet and
we'll see in six years of course but
it'll be great and of course this isn't
only with services and orchestration and
distributed applications we've got this
with everything we've got with this with
data persistence right in the early days
we all wrote our own dowels data
abstract layer who's here written their
own dowel excellent and we used to call
it kind of like repositories and then
someone said ORM czar much much better
and we kind of know I know but no or
arms really really are better so what
did we do we wrote our own ORM
and we called them mayan hibernate and
our your high-end hibernate and msn
hibernate or AAA also known as entity
framework and we said no actually you
know this isn't good we shouldn't be
rewriting and reinventing the wheels
maybe we should you use and hibernate
and then what we did did we do well we
create
abstractions on top of an hibernate and
hibernate and we made this like typical
repository panel and then we found that
well now we're losing all of the
features of the ORM mapper and we're not
really doing much but hey if we ever
have to switch ORM s well we can how
many of you switch our RMS frequently
yeah exactly but as as there was a there
was some consultants somewhere that said
ORM is a bad right they are all Warren's
are bad and they said you should
separate your rights from your reeds now
in the old days this is if you googled
this it would say did you mean cars of
course we're talking about CQRS right
who does see QRS here and of course if
you do see QRS which is command query
responsibility segregation you have to
do event sourcing even though you don't
but you do because it sounds much better
so event sourcing is even even even a
good thing and then we realized that of
course this wasn't the dowel it wasn't
the ORM it wasn't the reeds right it was
none of that the problem was the actual
storage it was what we were using to
store the data because sequel had become
kind of like antiquated it was no longer
the in thing to use and came about no
sequel which nobody knows what it means
except it doesn't mean no sequel or not
sequel or not only sequel and they said
this is how you store things you know
Cassandra couch database Hadoop or
whether you'd want to store things and
we basically went to the Silver Bullet
again writes you know now the the sequel
model has gone out the window and now
everyone has to do document databases
and of course we're kind of finding out
that this isn't the case either then
someone said no it's the platform that
sucks right and not only the platform
sucks but your community sucks too right
i back then was in the in the.net
community and there was a bunch of
people saying that you know dotnet sucks
and what you need to do is no js' how
many of you have heard that ok you might
have heard this version of it JVM sucks
how many of you you know you should do
no js' why
because awesome right why because
awesomesauce
okay of course too bad for the note
people note sucks now everyone's got to
do go and we get articles that say gold
is going to go is going to rival the
enterprise and the Java developers and
you know go is the thing to do you look
back eight months and you get note is
going to rival Java developers and note
is the thing to do and if you look back
two years you'll get some other
technology now normally when people
start to promote these things they
usually do it in the form of not you
know I've just moved trying this new
thing out it's awesome let me share it
with you know they normally do a big
blog post I'm leavin Java or I'm leaving
dotnet and it's a whole bunch of words
but certain keywords come out right
because too much ceremony scale
enterprise you don't help each other and
you're awful mean people and then we get
a coverage in in the media such as you
know I've moved to no js' and our
productivity is increased tenfold by
some tech lead somewhere or we now ship
micro services using docker aligning our
technology stack with our business needs
all this is made possible with go you
hear this every day right right yes I'm
some CTO somewhere and of course you
know I remember back in the old days um
when when I was talking about Ruby and
rails and they're like Ruby and rails
it's awesome what is it
Twitter uses it was Twitter right so
it's this thing that when you're eating
a pizza you say I'm eating a pizza and
then everyone knows you're eating a
pizza okay
and look what it is now I'm still trying
to make profit out of the pizza so you
know but of course when when ruby was
abandoned that Twitter no-one said Oh
Rails has been abandoned from Twitter No
well now they're using Scala and you
kind of wonder like you know was it
actually the platform or was it our code
you know actually it wasn't even our
code because the code technically
changed oh was it us hey we don't know
but nonetheless they promised us that
Silver Bullet but there's more there's
more now we realize that there's other
issues and the problem is the actual
paradigm so how many of you have read
this book right now back in the old days
and the old days I'm talking about eight
months ago when you when you used to you
know there was a there was a block I
clearly remember this post it was by a
coding horror Jeff Atwood and he brought
this blog post about how he's not read
this book and there was like six
thousand seven hundred and eighty
comments of life how can you possibly
call yourself a software engineer by not
having read this book every software
developer needs to read this book right
nowadays you say I've read this book and
they look at you like you're some
grandmother or grandfather there's like
really you're still doing
object-oriented programming it's all
about functional now right nowadays it's
about functional programming and in fact
I heard this on Twitter a few months ago
which someone said from the JavaScript
community functional programming is a
radical new paradigm
that was only invented 40 60 50 60 years
ago but right now if you have been doing
functional programming you know that
there's only one way to do functional
programming and that is Haskell now you
see if you were to ask this in a in a
dotnet crowd they will child f-sharp
right you know why by the way do you
know how an application is written in F
sharp because they bloody tell you it's
Haskell of course if you're not doing
Haskell what you can do freaking out on
the JVM you're not doing functional
programming fortunately for us we don't
have to learn Haskell because the future
is bright and it's in the form of
JavaScript and do you question yourself
is JavaScript a functional language if
it is a language then yes technically it
is somewhat functional yeah they didn't
like this when I did this at a
JavaScript conference someone said the
speaker is taking a crap on the
JavaScript community I said no that's
technically not true I'm taking a crap
on every community but good news is I've
been part of every community as well so
I have the right I have the privilege to
do that it's like I can I can come on
stage and make a Jonah joke about
Iranians why because I'm Iranian I could
also make it about Spain because I'm
Spanish two things awesome
anyway JavaScript love it or hate it it
is productive right it is actually a
very productive language and I'm saying
this with the strategies
we have note now if you're not familiar
with what note is imagine the mess that
we made on the client-side we can now do
that on the server side now a few years
ago what happened is that note kind of
split a few years ago sorry under a year
ago note split and there was this
article on wired you can see it is back
from when is it 12th of the 3rd which if
that's us date or not yes it's us date
no it's not 12th of the 3rd you know
future of Public coding tool in doubt
after it splits into two into two
immediately afterwards someone tweeted
if you're stuck on legacy technology
like nodejs and you're kind of like but
literally that only happened two weeks
ago and this was that they were using
some library was using the fork
fortunately a new foundation was born
and it was kind of they made up why it
didn't even bother changing the the
image right they thought what if works
as a fork but if you look at it the
other way works as it as a merge so yeah
great and everyone was like cool awesome
fork node fork is back back together
fantastic and then Microsoft goes and
says Microsoft plans to fork and extend
nodejs I like really didn't you just
read the news in the past two weeks but
anyway Microsoft for you now the great
part about node is not as no is of
course it's not so much the JavaScript
but it's the ecosystem so if you go to
MPN it's NPM is a website where you can
download packages and it says NPM is the
package manager for node if you wait
awhile
it says NPM is the package manager for
Bower and if you're wondering what Bower
is Bauer is a package manager I honestly
I don't know if I'm joking or serious at
some point
and you know there is 22 million
downloads 158,000 packages back when I
took this screenshot and they've got
very good discoverable names testacular
moron joyous happy joyous things
Dodgers whatever Dodgers I'm not making
that up in fact another friend of mine
had had a game which was like a drinking
game for web developers think of a noun
Google now know chairs if a library with
that name exists drink and you will get
drunk I guarantee I guarantee you but
now no jaysis NPM has given us a
marvelous amount of packages that people
write you don't even care what the code
looks like or whether it's got Security
vault vulnerabilities just go ahead and
use it it's all awesome awesome source
and it also gives us excellent
frameworks right how many of you used
angular by jeaious angularjs right it's
awesome right and I want to place
emphasis on the by and the Google which
basically means that since it's by
Google this kind of like guaranteed
upgrades how many of you have converted
to 2.0 right now I saw this I used
angularjs it was one of the mistakes I
made in my life that I openly admit
worst part is I can I kind of
recommended it for others as well so
anything I recommend ignore but I I said
you know enough with this I'm not using
angularjs I'm jumping on the Rianne
react bandwagon okay I am going with
react jeaious react jeaious is great
it's a it's a it's an alternative to
angularjs it's componentized it's it's
right it's by Facebook how many of you
use react yes right it's really really
cool if you go to the website in fact
this is one version of the website
there's another version that has a
compatibility certificate that basically
says to you that you know if you use
this it will certify compatibility and
this of course is because of when
angularjs 2.0 was announced and it
wasn't compatible the whole react.js
community was like you see I told you
you should have been using react.js
because that magically does offer you
compatibility into the future and if you
don't know reactor yes you should learn
it because reacts native allows you to
now do native mobile development and
they say that it's a game-changer
someone said so therefore it is a
game-changer react comes with a way to
organize your application so how many of
you are familiar with MVC right model
view controller and react try to
simplify that and what you have is this
thing called a flux architecture which
is basically you have a web api and then
you have web api you tools then you have
these things called action creators that
go on to dispatchers that then have
callbacks that then go to the store that
then gets to change events store queries
sends them to react views and the user
interaction comes in and you kind of
look at this in you like where did we go
wrong really where did we go wrong of
course some people have experienced this
they've realized that it's not the best
way to do things so they've come up with
another framework which you might have
heard of which is not flux but called
reflux unfortunately this is the only
diagram I found about it
so apparently though it is better so so
let's see if our react genius is that
Silver Bullet
now the good thing about angularjs and
react.js is that these are basically
your framework says there's that there's
kind of like you know a whole discussion
going on and where do I quote draw the
line between the framework and a library
is it when a library calls me or I call
a framework or framework calls my mother
I don't know but you know if you follow
that like path then it's all okay if you
don't like react yes if you don't like
angularjs just wait a few days and I'm
sure someone in the JavaScript community
will come up with a new framework
because it's just a matter of days
frameworks appear now in there and this
continuous frameworks has given birth to
it's a morphism how many of you have
heard of that so it's a morphism is
basically to summarize the we started
out doing client-server applications you
know what so web
applications and we said that the
server-side rendering isn't smooth and
someone said I know let's do this on the
client-side and we said okay that's
great but client-side rendering is hard
because we got to deal with JavaScript
and all of these things and someone said
let's create a framework which is
fantastic now we've got angularjs and
blah blah blah we can't do all of these
and then someone else said I lost my SEO
and we're like I know let's create
another framework and that other
framework is a isomorphic framework
which basically allows you to render the
same thing on the client and on the
server which is fantastic so again if
you don't like that there's also vapor
Jas and you just include that it's an
empty script people have actually forked
that thinking it's a framework but there
is hope there is hope the typescript
language recently visited Google and
they had a great chat and we all know
the result of that angularjs now uses
angularjs to now use this subtype script
so there is some typing in JavaScript if
you don't like JavaScript there is a
movement which says we deserve a better
language than JavaScript there's
actually a lot you should like you know
maybe look beyond your current browser
window but there's 527 signatures so you
can go and sign that and get rid of
javascript personally I want JavaScript
to die into the VM and just become a VM
you never have to deal with it again
now getting back to react and talking
about by naming we are I liked you just
earlier because already there's been
advances in our industry and we are
beyond functional programming we are now
reactive right and and you know and
don't call it functional reactive
programming some people will say yes
some people say no if you if you don't
care you like those kind of arguments
and you're tired of arguing about
whether JavaScript needs a semicolon go
ahead and then to that one but we are
doing functional reactive programming
and what do we do as developers as a
community when some new technology comes
out the first thing we do is we create a
manifesto for it so there is a reactive
manifesto which says that our our
applications need to be scalable
resilient responsive and be elastic so
whatever it's
great so this is fantastic because now
it allow allows me to say something like
this I am developing a functionally
reactive restful micro service and I'm
writing it in Rx CoffeeScript building
it with grants and shipping it in docker
fantastic and that actually makes sense
and we can do that today why are you
here you can be doing this because
containers are a thing now docker right
how many use docker right that docker is
the thing and and my conclusion to this
is it because the only way that we can
guarantee that working software works is
to ship our own machine right yeah
deploying apps are hard let's just ship
it Silver Bullet because building
software is hard and in fact it is hard
if we look at back at the history of how
we build software you how many of you
use make write make was around for many
many years and then there was aunt and
aunt like kind of brought the XML then
came out maven and brought its own
diagram kind of like the WCF one and
then someone said Ruby and someone else
said ooh expressive and then they said
the s l's and well everything went loose
from there and we got rake for Ruby and
a JVM kind of got Gradle and dotnet got
Passaic which is PowerShell PowerShell
rake cake
which is C sharp rake fake which is
actually very good is f sharp rake or
make and guess what JavaScript got yes
Jake
there is a framework or there is a built
tool called Jake but JavaScript didn't
have enough invented grunt and grunt was
really really ugly someone said it's
really ugly so let's go and invent gulp
and now to build you have to pull in
half of the internet so now javascript
has basically the same feature this
maven has right I'm gonna start a new
project let me go out for lunch
so if building hardware is if building
software is hard building scalable
software is also harder and we have
scale also known as Silicon Valley
syndrome yes no js' because scale but
fortunately we have awesome cloud
providers that you know give us all that
scalability that we need because you
need scale right it doesn't matter
whether you're doing an application for
a for a tiny little shop of three people
note you need scale one day that
business will grow what it's run by a
guy that's seventy years old and he
doesn't he's not has no kids no but one
day it will scale imagine if tomorrow
someone comes and buys it you need scale
and they sell us this scale right they
sell us the scale everything we do
nowadays it has to scale and guess who's
going to provide us that scale well
there you go
and new doors have opened for us because
we didn't have enough with what we had
now we've got the Internet of Things now
this is a Raspberry Pi connected to my
toilet
and I took a picture of this is
raspberry pie one raspberry pi 2 has
some advances over this I took a picture
of this I tweeted it and I said now I
can actually not turn around to pull the
flush and my Twitter is there someone
responded and said how do you make sure
the cable doesn't get wet and not with
ip6 every grain of sand in the world can
have an IP address which means that we
can take internet of things to limits
that we never imagined right anything
can become part of the system and again
if Internet of Things isn't your thing
DevOps might be because you can empathy
is you can tool it higher on it and
certify on it
okay so DevOps for the win and finally
of course I wasn't going to end this
without having a beautiful mention about
methodology right we have all been there
where we have blamed everything that we
have done on our methodology and we have
come to the conclusion that waterful
sucks right it does suck
unfortunately scrum is now the new
waterfall scrum sucks I I think last
time I checked a few hours ago lean
doesn't suck as much but maybe in a few
weeks it will so just sit back and enjoy
but if you think about it we are
actually geniuses we really are I mean
we're having awesome fun it's great and
not only that as a side-effect we have
created a self-sustaining industry
that's it if you look at the IT
lifecycle and a new technology comes out
we recommend it we sell it say this is
great of course we're there to provide
training for it and certification that
you can get in two days and become a
master then we implement it our
customers put it in production something
goes wrong they call us and guess what
we have under our belt a new technology
right and it just goes over and over
again now this would be quite
hypocritical of me to stand up here and
say that you know we've all got skin in
this game because we tool it for you
right and on top of that now we offer it
with subscriptions if you look at a
technology lifecycle nowadays it's it's
so fast-paced that you create a new
framework at about two weeks later they
create a new conference around that
framework and then you just go to ten
and this width I'm going to stop now and
shut up right and have a moment of
silence and think about everything and
then ice you'll ask me what is your
point there is no point there is
absolutely no point and I gave you that
disclaimer when you came into this talk
I've just been trying to talk slower and
slower because I've got 23 minutes left
I have absolutely no point what I do
have one single point which is there is
no silver bullet now how many of you
came in here thinking that there is okay
so at least one person has learned
something thank you makes me feel good
about myself so
now but the question is like if there is
no silver bullet then why are we
constantly jumping on to new
technologies why right so to answer that
question you got to ask yourself like
why are we developing software okay so
let me ask you why are you developing
software you like it what else it's fun
what else pays the bills
it's challenging right solves problems
awesome it helps people right yes how
many of you got into software to get
rich may I ask if it's not intruding are
you doing by any chance sa P or
SharePoint because that's about the only
way you're gonna get rich unless you've
invented something like snapchat most of
us got into this business for two
reasons mainly one was to love I
personally love to automate things I
really love to automate things and to
help people because it's nice to like
solve things for people it that was kind
of like a longer term it kind of started
to grow on me of course now we're
automating actually those people were
helping out of a job but that's a
completely different discussion so but
none of us really got into software as
software itself we didn't get into this
because we said we are going to spend
the rest of our lives updating our
system for the fact that we're updating
our system right we didn't get into this
to say you know what I want to do oh
there's a new version of my dependency
out let me upgrade to that why because I
got nothing better to do right but
there's a very very very high technology
churn and it's like every day something
new is coming out and you can't always
be on the latest and greatest it's kind
of like those people that say well I'm
not buying a laptop because I'm waiting
for the next model to come out right you
can't you have to at some point buy
hardware
does it just you know eventually you can
pay a thousand euros today and buy some
hardware you're not gonna wait two days
because it's gonna become cheaper right
hardware by and large becomes cheaper
unless its MacBook then it has less
ports and becomes more expensive but
everything gets cheaper but it doesn't
stop you from buying but you say no but
we are actually innovating we're finding
new ways to improve right and I say that
is great innovation and improvements are
good and I'm serious about this and I'm
so serious that I have actually made
this in red in bold and use Comic Sans
right so if there's one slide you
remember from this talk it's this one
improvement is good but when we're
improving you got to ask yourself what
exactly is it that we're improving right
what is it that we are improving when we
doing that improvement what business
value does it add and when I mean
business value is not behavior driven
development
okay in fact takeaway business what
value does it add what real value
because we're not in this for the bit
and for the money either and then that
goes to like well why are we making
these technology choices when we're
adopting adopting new technology how
we're doing it
do we reuse reasoning like well Walmart
which actually did has moved to no js'
therefore we need to move to no js' okay
or influenced by thought leaders or the
industry speakers like myself oh this is
awesome
you gotta move yes let's move to that
why well it's great Walmart moved
Facebook is using this Google is using
that right but do we have the same needs
as Walmart or Google or Netflix do the
same conditions apply for us now one
thing is we would love for the same
conditions to apply to us and we kind of
hide that yeah yeah yeah we can scale we
might skill me I'm on to scale but it
does it apply see one thing that we
often forget is context and context is a
really
really important word because what
technology might apply to some company
in some specific context might not apply
to us in a specific context right as
awesome as that technology might seem
and a technology choice has to be
applied within a certain context it's
kind of like best practices they need
context and I'll quote my the the fellow
speaker Ted knew that said you know
breathing is a good best practice but
would you do it underwater
with no equipment in the context of just
with your mouth nothing else
not really so again how do we make these
technology choices do we take things
into account like the stability of the
technology and I found this coming from
different ecosystems and communities
like dotnet Java JavaScript I can tell
you JavaScript and in fact Charles
Nasser was saying yesterday in that
session that you know they're less
conservative in the java community yeah
there's more conservatism we like
evaluate things a little bit more
javascript is like oh I did a framework
here zero point zero zero zero is 7.21
pre-alpha I've put it on NPM thousand
Forks everyone's shipping it to
production do we take into account that
stability is it proven technology I mean
right now we have all of these amazing
things talking about you know coming up
with micro services and orchestrations
and darker and all of these how proven
are these technologies are we playing
part of that guinea pig process and
what's the learning curve of these
technologies what is the market share
right and when we break this down and we
evaluate the costs do we actually say
well you know what I could rewrite this
new system and it would cost me this
much to do this module that much to test
that much to that and the total comes to
this much and yet if I extend it well it
might not be that exciting and it might
not be using the latest and greatest but
it might do its job and it might cost me
less do we do that analysis of costs do
we actually then validate our invest
and we say oh yes with the nodejs
conversion we actually saved three hours
a day in software development because
there's loads of thousands of packages
and that saved us a lot of time yes but
those packages get outdated people stop
using them they stop maintaining them
you get version conflicts but these
arguments have been used myself included
right I'm standing up here criticizing
myself as much as myself because when
things go bad
we're not the big corporations that can
just burn the money and what's more
important even if we do have a lot of
money doesn't impact our pay how many of
you get a pay cut because you chose the
wrong technology and it's not your own
business oh you chose angularjs yes yes
well it's not working out okay well well
you're not gonna get paid this month why
well because we're going to rewrite it
yeah okay well I don't have stake in the
game yeah but but think about it a
little bit you know if I were paying the
bills would I do this and that's why
there's this thing of this financial
impedance mismatch that I say right the
developers often ask we don't have that
direct link to the revenue and that's
why I think that it's important that all
of us at some stage in our life have our
own business and see how by making the
right and wrong choices it does impact
our paycheck and take that into account
because if it doesn't bring value then
why do it and then the question is are
we confusing our desire to learn with
business value right are we chasing the
new shiny because we want to learn and
we don't want to pay the bills for
learning well I can and I'm guilty of
this I want to make a little side
project what should I use I'll use a
vertex why is it the most appropriate no
but it would be cool because I'll learn
it as well is it the one that's gonna
bring me a better return on investment
for that job I'm not saying that what
you learn is not valuable but we've got
to evaluate those costs as well
or are we CV driven design right
do we do things to kind of like boost
our CV or is it based on social pressure
you know I see this all the time oh
they're still using Delphi Wow is that
thing still alive oh yes and in fact you
know when a big pool shrinks the little
fish become really big if you get a lot
of money as a COBOL developer nowadays
and in fact the Rosetta comment post it
on a Delphi blog and they've written
parts of it using Delphi well and it
went all that way there's the thing that
came out some time ago which is Jason X
and X is an IBM standard format to
represent JSON as XML and you kind of
look at that and you say there must have
been drunk right because there is really
no reason why anybody would want to do
that maybe there is maybe it was cheaper
to make this adapter than to rewrite
something and we laugh at it and it's
funny but maybe there is actually a
reason behind this but you say well no
we need to attract talent if we don't
use awesome technologies and you see
this every day right every single day
come and work with us we use blah blah
blah blah blah blah blah blah blah and
blah point 1.6 and then what do you get
you get CVS off I know angularjs well
Durandal that's no longer valid that's
irelia react jQuery JavaScript Java
closure c-sharp VB sequel server MongoDB
this is how we get our CVS which in fact
we don't even need to make Seabees
people some people say oh just point
them to get hub well I don't do open
source and you call yourself a developer
and that's partially our own fault
because this is what we're promoting
with our job at this is what we're
looking for instead of looking for CVS
to say oh you know what I have a brain I
understand the principles of software
engineering and here's my experience
this is the value that I provided these
are the jobs I did this is what I
provide
to the business and I can go into detail
of those projects but no what do we look
for we look for do you know c-sharp you
know what it's not that hard to learn
c-sharp
I did it it's not that hard you more
want to focus on someone that neat learn
knows how to communicate with people
that knows how to reason that knows
software engineering but it's a vicious
circle we promote it and then we say
well if we don't do this kind of
development we're not gonna attract
talent let me ask you do you actually
want to be valued by the old technology
stack I know Greg well he's cool because
he knows event sourcing and Barry over
there know Mary's cool as well she knows
event sourcing but Barry no he only
knows a CouchDB how that's that's really
not what I would want to be evaluated on
because you know what technologies do
come and go and we present it for the
past 20 25 years so you know it is
actually our job it's our job we need to
be on the cutting edge I'm not saying we
shouldn't be learning we actually in
fact need to learn we need to evaluate
every technology that comes we need to
know what's going on around us because
at times there are things that are
better there are things that actually
might solve problems but question when
you adopt these things don't do hype
driven development which unfortunately
is very common Oh everyone's using X I
got to use X are you adopting based on
technology radars do your own technology
radar think for yourself you know things
come and go
don't take too seriously all of these
thought leaders people also make
mistakes and don't do a dot adoption
based on assumed correlation well
Netflix adopted because Netflix openly
talks about this that's why I put it
here Netflix adopted microservices
Netflix is successful we
microservices Netflix might not have the
same needs as you you're not streaming
live video showing catalogues movies etc
and making people binge watch and lose
their life but hey I love Netflix it's
just come to Spain very happy
so yeah I'm actually waiting for this to
finish and go finish watching up the
orange is the new black so my main point
with this is we need to learn we really
do we need to evaluate technologies all
of that but what we need to do is focus
on the right things and when we make
these decisions we need to really take
away all of our you know selfish aspects
and it's okay to be selfish but it
doesn't necessarily mean that we have to
put a project or other things at risk
just because we want to learn but
honestly value things and say when
should we adopt why should we adopt it
and what business value does that
actually bring me apart from my own
personal satisfaction and now with that
having said all that
please go learn and apply everything you
learn in this conference thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
