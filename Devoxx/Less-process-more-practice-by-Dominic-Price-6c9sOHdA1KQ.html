make sure thank you for joining me the
next 50 minutes you will not have 50
minutes of me talking I have more than
50 minutes worth of stories but I'm not
going to bore you with them I'm going to
get you to do some work as we go through
this as well so if you want to just sit
there and relax you've probably come to
the wrong session I'm going to make me
think and do stuff which can be annoying
but you might enjoy it give it a try you
might throw what I want to talk to you
about today is nothing to do with
technology which might be a bit strange
for a conference called deadlocks but
I'm a firm believer in that a full-width
at all this stood a fool so instead of
talking about doing falls technology
what I'm going to talk to you about is
how you can make Falls and amendments to
the incredibly smart people and a little
bit of background about me I've spent
the last four years working with the
last year in Sydney
I joined Atlassian when we're about 400
people to locations of a 35,000
customers the world was incredibly
simple everything just worked and were
nimble because we were small it's just a
really easy and fun place to work
and my boss the VP of engineering at the
time stuck me down and said DOM and
never will never ever want to get on
stage and be famous - saying how big we
are I never want to stand on stage and
say we're 15,000 people are 20,000
people because that's not a measure that
I'm proud of I want us to be a relevant
place to work an awesome place to work
fund the nimble and agile and a place
where people aspire to be like where
where there's a culture that you want to
mimic and copy so can you go and do you
thing and work without and what I
discovered whatever the whole our
research was do with some good practices
out there there's some good techniques
but there was nothing that we could sort
of grab and it was going to help us
scale we wanted to grow and stay awesome
we want to get big and so we decided to
invent our own way of doing it and
that's one of the story I'm going to
share with you today
Atlassian today for those that don't
know is a 2,000 person organization
85,000 customers
we're in 8 locations around the world
and our growth has continued
consistently over those four years and
continues into the future so we're
continually evolving
work and that scaling is some of world
wanna talk through today the very first
thing I'm going to make you do is make
you very uncomfortable I'm going to make
you speak to the person next to you it's
not like a therapy session if there's no
one next to you just have to kind of
edge along till you find someone for
other people over they're going to have
the most fun you've got to move like
three whole seats and I'm assuming
you're all here because you're already
highly intelligent people that tend to
come to conferences on a Friday when
they could be in the Slug and Lettuce
having a beer tends to be those that
have a desire to grow and develop and
learn something new the thing is I've
one of the things I've realized in my
career is I learn nothing from myself
that doesn't stop me occasionally
believing my own but it's not
healthy so I want to start this session
with youth finding somewhere in the room
preferably the one next to you and just
take 40 seconds 20 for the first person
20 for you and just share what's the
hardest challenge for you in being a
leader and I'm making the assumption
there that ever in this room is leading
something whether they're leading people
directly or a team or a project or a
product you are leading something so
fine for the room 40 seconds what's the
hardest thing about being a leader go
okay let's call that time you always
know when you've got a good developer
community when the majority of people go
to their phones or laptops for the
answers it's like Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire and I've found a friend I'm
sure the answers online somewhere let me
just let me just google it and who wants
to share anyone shout out put your hand
up and I will point you and you get to
shout very loudly come on sharing is
going yes sir
getting people to do what you want them
to do and we try telling them that never
works by the way we'll cover that lady
I've told you a million times that I'm
telling you for the million from one
winery yeah okay anyone else yes sir
communicate with each other yeah like
two different teams god forbid like when
you get like the marketing people the
legal people it always amuses me that
even when you're in the same
organization you have the ability to
compete with your peers then didn't you
ever compete with your competitors
outside I often say like if a competitor
could have like a CCTV camera in your
office they just relax but like you're
so screwed internally I don't need to
beat you like you're beating yourself
this is fine anywhere else yes sir
honestly I'm speaking their mind yeah
one of the things that we'll cover in
this is the idea of respectful dissent
I actually there talk a few weeks ago at
Australia's largest bank and I was
talking about respectful dissent in the
boss lives in the front row knees
petrified is like no no that that's not
going to work n I don't know respectful
dissent is good do you hear from your
people what they do and don't like it
and that enables you to be a better
leader there's some hands up on the back
anyone yes sir
our remote and distributed team jet will
cover that so that is one of the reasons
we actually built what I'm going to
share with you today is we are spread
geographically culturally and across
time zones and that psychological and
physical distance does make a difference
I'm all for remote and distributed teams
I think it's a great idea but you have
to know how to manage in that
environment and anyone who's not a white
male so da yes there we are
I'm scouring the room I was going to
find you somewhere yes yes getting the
business on board
yes yes oh so I'm guessing from that
you're in a kind of a technology-related
team that is running in an agile fashion
as part of the business that is not
running it in agile fashion so you get
that friction of different ways of
working
anyone else experience that everyday
yeah okay you're in the right room good
so um the reason I want to talk about
this today is is ours actually other
talk few years ago with Gary Hamel he's
a lecturer at the London School of
Economics best-selling author who talks
a lot about what slows things down oh by
the way all this information is publicly
available to you don't be scared to take
any pictures and I'm at Don price on
Twitter if you want to contact me or
tweet any of this go through your life
none of this is a secret the bureaucracy
is the Kryptonite bureaucracy is this
thing that kind of it's this baggage
that we hold it's the fact that we don't
feel comfortable to speak up the fact
that people won't do what we've asked
them to do and the fact we've got people
working in different ways it's just
adding friction to the way we work
without adding any value some friction
is really valuable I like putting
designers product managers and engineers
at a whiteboard with pens and watching
them ferociously argue because that's a
really healthy level of friction that's
the one bringing their best self
bringing their views to the table and
having a rich conversation way too often
that gets put down now this guy Neil
Armstrong a wonderful chap for those
that don't know him and this guy Steve
Jobs who's way more sort of known in the
tech space so the reason I've got these
two people on screen is for some reason
in society and as a community we have
this habit of celebrating the individual
yeah we talked about landing on the moon
we talked about Neil Armstrong but Neil
Armstrong didn't land on the moon NASA
did and when we talk about great tech a
lot of people talk about Steve Jobs
instead of talking about Apple but when
you think about some of the achievements
that Apple have actually accomplished
they were achieved by a team there's a
team of people there that enabled that
and have a bit of a problem with this
because when we celebrate the individual
we end up putting that individual on a
pedestal
and by doing that we're actually
downplaying all the effort involved like
for you with your technology that
technology doesn't exist without their
business the people that speak up if
they don't speak up the business doesn't
exist anymore
and so we need to understand how we
celebrate teams I actually looked at a
recent incident young survey that said
that 90% of organizations are solving
problems so complex they have to have
teams solve them the reason they want
teams is they want that cognitive
diversity diversity of mindset and skill
set and experience cognitive diversity
in my world is way more valuable than
any other form of diversity well
actually we've got a panel discussion
later on this afternoon on diverse team
for me the mental diversity so running
myself with people that think
differently to me is the most powerful
form of diversity now let me talk about
some of the challenges I've had as a
leader which is why I'm actually talk
about this topic today I am going to
guess that at least three of these will
resonate with you so the first one is
scaling as I mentioned before I joined
Atlassian when it's 400 people and we're
now 2,000 were 30 something thousand
customers now rates 5,000 and we're a
few products and now in many my boss cut
me down in my first week and said dumb
to keep your job you need to grow by 40%
year on you just to keep your job if you
want to excel at your job you need to
grow by more than 40% now it is being a
bit of an idiot right I didn't actually
have to grow by 40% but he was sitting
in expectation with me that the world
around me was changing if I think about
the environment - you're probably in the
technology refresh cycle is moving at a
pace it's never moved that before your
customers have more information than
they've ever had in their entire lives
in fact in some industries the customers
have more information than you do I was
talking to a gal you the week who runs
restaurants if it back in the day people
used to walk past a restaurant that's to
the ambience divide the music the
candles that smell the food that see the
patrons that walk in sit down and spend
$100 hundred and fifty dollars he said
now people walk past the restaurant they
smell the ambience survive and they get
the phone out and they start googling on
the owner what this restaurants like
they stop trusting their instinctive
this looks like a really nice place to
eat and they will
search the internet for that find a
negative review and they'll go next door
and then they'll go next door
customers have more information they've
ever had before they've also got
ethically low switching costs in most
industries certainly we're with the
atlantean product suite we've built
those in a way at a low price point
board that means there's a lot of our
competitors are at a similarly low price
point so if you don't like the service
we provide turn it off
and you go somewhere else in a lot of
industries people think they have
customer loyalty when actually all they
have is customer apathy customers can't
be asked moving but eventually they will
right they will find a better product or
service and move on and once you've lost
them it's a lot more expensive to get
them back you've then got this idea of
customers those because with competitors
those wonderful people that is the ones
you know about you can go and analyze
and then there's the ones you don't know
about that are secretly sort of hiding
away somewhere in a garage in a room and
their desire is to beat you and knock
you off your perch they're a lot harder
to tackle well I think about those I
think about relevance I think about
companies like borders all his book
stores in the US for anyone that doesn't
know is like rated is the best book
store in the world they nailed the whole
premise of book stores you went in you
looked at books you bought a book you
maybe had a coffee and then you left and
they absolutely optimized that world is
awesome until the Kindle and iPad came
along and then they were highly
irrelevant
they've optimized the world for a
customer that no longer existed and then
the last one is people in the war for
talent
yo scaling is really important because I
want to hire the smartest people
everywhere but so there's everyone else
no I don't see any company here
advertising will hire the B or C players
that no one else will hire will hire the
average mediocre people so in this war
for talent here in the room is time call
however lost has got lots of time on our
hands is sourcing
time is an interesting once a time in my
world is something they get discussed
and debated Locke was actually
irrelevant the thing that we're really
meaning to talk about that we're not
honest about is prioritization so when I
say it's one I haven't got the time what
I really mean is you're not my priority
right now but I don't have that honest
conversation I use buzzwords like
time-poor and hope that they will either
go away or just you know come back
another time
but they come back another time and I'm
still time for
when really what I said I just said was
I'm not going to do the thing you want
me to do
it's a favor or whatever else because
you're not my priority these three
things are more important than you or
more importantly the thing you're asking
me to do we tend not to have those
conversations as a leader I'm expected
to be a multiplier and I'm sure anyone
who's gone from being an individual
contributor to being a people manager or
leader has felt this pain at some point
when there's not enough hours in the day
because you're trying to do your work
and a little bit of everyone else's work
and it's really hard what you have to do
is become a multiplier you have to be
able to invest the eight hours you have
a day to impact many more people in
yourselves and the last one this is
particularly something I've found with a
lot of our development community in it
last year and around the world and also
without designers this idea of
perfection I've got to get it finished
before I ship it it's a killer to our
productivity it's a killer to our mojo
and our teamwork one of the things we've
moved to at last year now is the
progress is a shitload more important
than perfection and people go yeah now I
get that I'm just got to get that pixel
right I'm going to get now that progress
is more important than perfection
momentum is more important than nailing
that end goal because you'll actually
get there quicker by measuring progress
then you will by being a perfectionist
the reason this is more important to me
right now is the technology refresh
cycle we're going to is bringing things
along like artificial intelligence
machine learning automation robotics
there's been a huge change in the work
force in the nature of work in the last
few years I think the change we're about
to go through the one that we're going
to experience is generation is a
shitload more scary than the one that
previous generations have gone through
it's scary because of the impact is
going to have with others in society
scary because of the impact on roles and
jobs and scarier because of the pace of
change and the nature of that change
when I think about AI we did a recent
survey 80% of people we surveyed said
they were petrified worried that a I
would increase unemployment if you look
at other research in the last hundred
and forty-four years congratulations to
all of you in the room you've enabled
more jobs to be created
then we're absolutely taken away so
technology is a net addition to the
economy into the workforce the problem
is and this is something that we all
need to be aware of is that it causes a
mass displacement of roles so if you go
back 30 40 years agriculture is a huge
employer and now software's a huge
employer now that's cool for all of us
in the room because it means we get good
jobs we get some conferences like this
the problem is is that the entire system
the community we're part of the
education system and the learning system
is not geared up to understand this
change we need to understand how this
changes our caring so good news at nine
percent of companies need teams teams
are awesome we're all awesome the
world's changing we're all smart the
problem is we're a little bit screwed
because when we interview people 78% of
people said they didn't trust their
teammates and I've got a bit of a
problem with this because I don't I
don't really care which religion you
sign up for we've all been on this this
is for a while let's just agree it's a
good while and by this stage we should
have kind of got these things nailed
these are things that is humans we
should be good at because they're kind
of uniquely human skills and yet for
some reason we've unlearn these skills
and we're trying to compete with the
machines and the robots which are better
at being machines and robots so the two
things that people cited has been
reasons they don't trust teammates
communication which we had in here and
accountability I think sir to your first
point right I've asked you all right
believe you're doing something and it
looks like you're not doing it I'm
trying to hold you to account it's a
painful part of working in a team when
these things really start to hurt you is
when you get that sensation of going
it's going to be easier so just do it
myself except then you can't be a
multiplier you can't actually have the
impact you want so I decided to do a
tiny bit of research and when I say tiny
el-amin back of a napkin type research
and I came to the conclusion that the we
have to find blame right so it's very
important we find someone to blame and
I'm blaming the Industrial Revolution so
the Industrial Revolution left us with
this legacy the Industrial Revolution
was a time where the workforce was white
male the workforce was illiterate and
the workforce to use their hands and
they didn't need to use their head
in fact you definitely didn't want them
to think you just wanted the workforce
to do and so a system was created the
manager was invented the manager who
pushes bits of paper and tasks around it
make sure everyone does the things they
need to do the manager that has maybe
has a carrot but definitely has a stick
and the managers role is to sharpen that
stick and beat you down until you do all
the tasks you're supposed to do in that
world your your team your business your
organization your leadership style was
efficient it was all about being
efficient how can I standardize the way
we work how can I eliminate variability
how can I get the most number of outputs
possible today and how can I get one
more output tomorrow because that's
demonstrated improvement how can I
centralize all decision-making because I
don't trust any of these people I've
employed who are illiterate I don't
trust them so how do I bring all
decisions to me how do I keep my job
secure by building a large monolithic
team that is highly dependent on me the
leader how do i build a hierarchy
because power is this thing that wields
control power is the currency in that
organization so those who feel the need
to be honest in the room put your hand
up if any of those things match to any
of your leadership style two teams that
you're in or things that you work with
where you feel that you may have
accidentally optimized for efficiency
know got some honest people there it
cool now that's not on that's not a
natural that's a normal thing to do the
advantage with efficiency is you can see
it it's kind of scientific and it's
great instant gratification if I if I'm
running a factory and I get one more
output today than I got yesterday I see
that today in our world in a world where
curiosity creativity invention
innovation is key where you want to be
effective that's a lot harder to measure
because you're trying to measure impact
in that world what you're trying to say
is I wanted to like my customers and
have them use my products and be an
advocate for me that's a lag indicator
but occurs after the event and it feels
a bit soft so the scientific part of our
brain goes now let's not measure that
let's measure the fact did we ship on
Friday yes we
yay what do we ship it doesn't matter we
shipped on Friday so let's have a beer
or a pale ale or a craft beer or
whatever it is you choose to drink and
celebrate the fact that we shipped but
that's an output shipping is an output
there's no quality there's no measurable
impact in that you want to measure the
outcome so without things we've been
dragging them over to the effectiveness
if people don't like the word effective
if the other word I use is relevance so
if you look at the fortune 500 in the
year 2000 50 percent of the
organization's half the organizations
that were on the fortune 500 in the year
2000 are no longer there they were very
successful very profitable large
organizations they are no longer there
they were efficient that optimised it
become very insular and all they cared
about was their business and not the job
to be done or the impact they were
trying to have and they are no longer in
the 14 500 so we're drugging our things
bit by bit over to be more effective in
a more effective organization your
communication doesn't go up to the chain
of command to go across to go down it
just goes across for anyone who's ever
doing like it's Friday so I'm sure some
of you have to do some form of status
reporting right I was talking some
project manager vehicle I guess I did my
status report we get aggregated into the
group aggregated as a program which goes
up to our boss and our boss's boss upper
management in the leader it then goes
across and it goes down the problem of
each person polishes that information
I'm not going to call it data because
it's not anymore
it's they polish it because they want to
present a certain view by the time it
gets the person that needs it it's about
two weeks old and it bears no
resemblance to the actual truth and it's
one is then going to try and make a
decision off that information and when
you think about it you'd never accept
that in any other form of life but in
businesses these politics these
efficient ways of working if wanting to
look good actually get in the way in our
world
what we're trying to do is give outings
the freedom to create their own rhythm
in cadence they know their environment
better than me that this is not a
top-down approach it's a bottoms-up
approach
and the way we do this is by empowering
and giving our teams autonomy to work
the way they want to work to get the
things done that they need to get done
so all really easy dead-simple job done
absolute pain in the ass so we tried it
and it was really part of my French
really hard because it was just
too soft and fluffy it also lacked
self-awareness so what we did was we
created all these funky nice ways of
working and we package them up and I
went around the atlantean organization I
went to the first team and I'm like
here's some brilliant ways of working
they're like ah thanks we're awesome we
don't need it the team over there that
we've been working with so I went
to them and they're like ah no we've
been together for years we've been
working together like 10 years now we're
like we're really tight so don't talk to
us totally the team and by about the
hundreds team I realized that I was
flogging a dead horse what was lacking
was self-awareness the understanding of
what is the impact of me not working in
an effective manner so one of the things
we went out and built was this awareness
the tools alone weren't the answer now
for a technology company this is quite a
kind of like drop moment your
Atlassian's been on on this on the earth
like 15 years and we've just been going
products and tools and agile products
and tools and I don't know where like
we've kind of had this realization that
tools alone aren't the answer like if
you just got really good tools but bad
people and bad practices the things
you're delivering aren't going to be
great so how do we get this mix right at
having smart people like you of having
the right tools that you select and
downloaded and use every day and
configure but also the right practices
and if we don't evolve those practices
we're not going to get the value we need
so to create some self-awareness I look
to the whole of this historical
Atlassian projects I look to the good
ones the ones where we have Atlassian
t-shirts printed and with a parties and
blogs and stories the lhari I remember
shipping gear is six and that pile and
bowling we all got drunk I took those
and I looked for what elements did they
have that I believe made them successful
and then I went into the atlantean
closet for all the skeletons the
projects that don't get spoken about the
ones where and you have them in your
organization as well when you say the
project name people get like cold sweats
and start retreating I went and looked
at all those projects as well
because I wanted to know what attributes
they were missing that made them a
failure made them not success and we
landed on these eight attributes now if
I worked at Stanford or Harvard or
somewhere fancy I'd go and do a mass
amount of research and prove this what I
genuinely couldn't be asked and so what
I did was I bribed the team
I found the bitbucket thing and I said I
will buy you coffee I'll buy everyone in
the team a coughing if you give me one
hour to try this thing because I think
it might work and if it doesn't you had
a free coffee and if it does maybe
one day I'll be in dev rocks in London
on the stage telling people about it and
so we run the session and it worked but
the team would enjoyed it and the team
Lee said I'm actually team leader on a
couple of other teams when we were on
those we were not on those when else
heard about it within two weeks I've run
over 30 sessions we never mandated we
never rolled out there's not a program
name there's nothing that makes this a
thing other than team saying we're
curious about how we can work better and
we're willing to invest one hour what
happened after that was the fear of
missing out kicked in so I'd like to get
calls from all over the world from San
Francisco and Austin and Poland and
Amsterdam saying we've been hearing
about this team thing that you've been
doing why aren't we getting it it's not
fair everyone wants it and then mark
thinking hey Charlie but everyone got
involved I've now had the luxury and
unfortunate of running over six hundred
sessions with teams across Atlassian and
over 150 sessions with Marcion customers
with people outside the atlantean world
at first we thought every team with the
project team project product whatever
you want to call it these teams have a
start middle and an end the end is often
the shipping of a product a feature a
service sometimes those teams stay
together other times those teams to
disband one of the commonalities with a
project team it is cross-functional it's
not necessarily the people that you
report to or report to you it's often
many people from different functions
contributing and that's where it gets
really murky because they have different
bosses and often has different goals and
they will be dragged in different
directions the project has its own goals
and you get that friction and it's not
always a positive friction so we thought
that was the only team and then I tried
running them with a few teams and it
didn't work so we landed on two more
team types team
Jonah's leadership teams leadership
teams are things that are selling vision
direction they are inspiring the people
around them
ideally they are coaching and mentoring
the reason we landed on the delusive
team with what we found was a lot of our
leaders and I'm sure some of you will
will maybe admit to this a lot of our
leaders we're getting dragged down into
the projects that they were supposed to
be leaving so is anyone familiar with
the phrase Pidgeon boss okay good I'll
tell you about Pidgeon bosses because we
found quite a few of them in Atlassian
the pigeon boss is the boss that wants
to be a leader and gets really busy
doing stuff and then suddenly one day
panics they don't know everything about
the project that you're working on so
they fly in they everywhere and
then fly straight out and all they do is
completely distract you from the thing
you are doing by asking stupid questions
that are irrelevant to you so it's not
like sparring where someone says ah see
you've made that screen adjacent I see
you've made that screen blue and yet you
know we're talked about there I think
you know color palettes more greener
it's not that they come in they go why
is it blue and then they walk out and
you're like what why is it blue should
it be blue and all you're left with is
curiosity as a very bad form right it's
just uncertainty so what we did without
leaders would say actually we need to
redefine your role as a leader your role
as a leader is to inspire and coach your
mentor to set that vision in direction
you need to be thinking over a longer
term time horizon because if you're not
setting that 12 18 months
Northstar and vision and roadmap we're
never going to know whether we're making
progress because we don't even know
where we're supposed to be going so what
we found was our project teams are
getting very insular and very short time
frame because they didn't have the
vision and then they were shipping
something going you like that we were
going now it was too late we weren't
experimenting we just didn't know where
we were going so we've set the tone with
our leaders that they have to lead what
we then found was a lot of people and
I'm sure you may all feel this you're
actually a member of more than one team
so a lot of our leaders were enjoying
this because they're like ah now I'm in
this leadership team meeting
forum or committee or whatever I need to
think and act like a leader but also as
a leader they were on project teams and
so this actually helped them with that
context switching to say what is your
role in this group with this team the
last one with London was service team
originally I actually thought this was
going to be restricted to customer
support teams an IP help desk what we
found that last year
partially butas technology change
partially I moved to the cloud and moved
to kind of a platform and product type
architecture mindset is there a lot more
service themes in my business today than
there were eighteen months two years ago
so there's things subtly different to
project teams they don't have a ship
gate and they don't have full control
over their backlog they provide a
service either internally or externally
and they are relying on people raising
tickets or raising something in some
form that forms acute and their role is
to clear that key interestingly that's
not their only role and what we found
with a lot of services is they thought
their only role was to clear the queue
those service teams look and feel the
smell a lot like firefighters they see a
fire they fly in they put the fire out
there get the high-five the bottle of
wine the thank you and then they wait to
the next fire and they fly and they put
that fire out they're actually dragging
your business down every single day
they're dragging your team's down your
productivity in your performance because
you are never improving you're only ever
managing the status quo so what we said
to our service teams was how do you
understand firefighting you will have to
do some of it with fire proofing which
is how do we detect and prevent things
from going wrong in the future how do we
understand the themes of some of the
services were providing and provide self
service to our customers so that not
everything comes to us so we've had a
lot of fun with these we launched the
three health monitors to accompany them
we actually launched 26 plays internally
in atlast Ian the plays imagine the
health monitor is an exercise that your
fitness instructor puts you through push
through a whole lot of drills and then
what we have to create was yeah when you
do a health once you feel a bit so they
crap at the end of it feel like we've
just realized we're not great and that
can be a little bit
chatting so what we did was we started
to document plays and the plays of the
exercises our teams do to get better at
the areas where they're struggling
we've been running with this about a
year and a half 32 years in Atlassian
across the globe 300 plus teams going
really well and I've sat down with Mike
and Scott our co-founders in the middle
of last year and we decided that given
that our mission is to unleash the
potential in all teams
it was absolutely stupid of us to keep
this to ourselves and so we packaged it
up and we've launched it to the URL you
see there for those with amazing
eyesight Atlassian comm slash team
playbook in October last year we
launched the team playbook for the
entire public to use this is completely
- like Gnostic you do not have to be in
Atlassian customer you do not have to
spend a single cent it is all completely
free of charge on there you will see the
three health monitors with full
descriptions of how they work what a
healthy team looks like and how that
actually should be used for every single
area on the health monitor so if we take
a shared understanding we just go by
we'll take a shared understanding on the
presidency health monitor what you will
see for every problem or challenge area
there are plays that accompany that so
if your team is struggling with shared
understanding you could do an elevator
pitch you could do a project poster you
could do an experience canvass for any
of you who have practiced agile design
thinking lean any of those kind of
disciplines none of this is rocket
science it will look very familiar to
all we've done is take those disciplines
some of which I feel are a little bit
utopian and we've turned them into
practices this is how we actually use
them and actually do them on a daily
weekly monthly basis what we found by
doing this is that we had a sensation
that our teams were starting to smell
and look a lot like factories we were
starting to be quite processed as we
scale through like what's the what's the
policy for this and what's the process
for that how do we know that that
happened we were just going back through
old ideas again and again the phrase
that's not the way it's done here
started to come out which is a great
sign of status quo kicking in
you hire new people and all you would do
is indoctrinate them into your bad
habits and ways of working so you'd go
to you go to market you'd hire a really
smart courageous inspirational person
that arrives day one at their desk with
inspirational ideas you like like your
idea it's not the way it works here so
if you just comply with the really bad
ways we've learned of working that'll be
wonderful we're going to take all you
value and leave it in your last company
and and the fear culture the hierarchy
is building a vehicle to whereby people
start going work
I just don't know upset my boss or I
don't want to dissent or don't want to
do the wrong thing and so we start to
become really really conservative and
when you think about the technology
refresh cycle and you think about the
changes that your customers expect and
you think about how your competitors are
trying to take on you and your teams and
your products that's not going to work
you have to be generating new ideas you
have to be seeking feedback you can't
have command and control you have to
accept as a leader that it's highly
likely that people are ranging around
being below and to the side and above
but everyone around you is likely way
more intelligent than you are one of the
amazing things about the playbook is is
absolutely nothing to do with me I was
working with the team that originally
came up with the idea but the three
health monitors has been documented by
other people and the 26 plays have all
been created and documented by our teams
I haven't got a thought leader somewhere
in a corner you know chilling through
research and creating utopian theory
this is all actually being used day to
day by our teams and gets evolved every
single day as their patterns change and
the world around them changes what that
means is we've now become a lot more
ideas driven a lot more experimental
there's a lot more sharing is a lot more
positives dissent positive dissent
sounds different than just dissent just
dissent normally someone's got their
arms folded and they're just having a
tantrum often a little bit of victim
mentality positive dissent is I'm not
convinced that's the best way to do this
have you thought about X or Y positive
dissent comes with an idea non positive
sense just grumpy right and I'm going to
every now and then in this world we also
test assumptions we use data and in our
world we are not data
driven we are data informed so yes we
use data and we are massive fans of data
and how that can inform you but data
should be used in combination with your
three brains a lot of people forget
they've got three brains and think
they've only got one which is this one
which is the logic part of the brain and
they forget about the heart which is a
very important part of your brain and
they forget about that gut interesting
that intuition we say to all of our
teams around the world when you're
making decisions use the data
don't let the data make the decisions
for you otherwise I might have a fight
there's no need for you if the data
makes all the decisions I want you to
use your accumulative experience your
wisdom your knowledge all the things
you've acquired over your life your work
and your social life to make an informed
decision that doesn't mean it's going to
be right we experiment so much that we
average about a 50 percent failure rate
and that's cool because there are lots
of really small experiments they're not
better company type experiments when you
go into this world what you realize is
is that over time the product
development processes started to look
like a process like a linear process and
it's not the reality of what you're
doing day-in day-out is not a linear
process where you ship and forget if it
is you're doing it wrong you're not
getting the value from it what we say in
our world and I'm just because we all
this it is a circular experience the
quicker I can ship something in
demonstrate progress the quicker I get
feedback the more feedback I get the
more I evolve and iterate the more I
evolve and iterate the better that
product becomes the quicker I ship the
more feedback I get and we go on the
loop again and again and again it's
important we know where we are in the
loop but it's actually more important to
know that it is a looping it's a
continual feedback loop so some actions
for you you're not just come here to
listen to me tell stories the first
action is the playbook is something that
we published not for ourselves we use it
internally in fact that URL the team
playbook URL we have now actually
retired our internal version and the
teams that Atlassian use the same
version that's open to the public
because of that one of the things that
we've recently added on there are a
whole lot of 10
plates and examples of how these have
been used what you'll see in the
examples is actual real data because we
couldn't be bothered synthesizing the
information in there so we've shared
real examples of how things at Atlassian
useless for this to work in your
environment as a few things you need to
do
the first one is embrace the fact that
being effective is more important than
being just efficient and the second one
which is that damn sight harder is
unlearning you have to unlearn some of
the things that work for you last year
or the year before that will not work
for you this year or next year you have
to unlearn those patterns and be willing
to try new ones in doing that you
actually the leader need to embrace
failure I cannot tell you how many
leaders I talk to who talk about failure
and then when I say them can you give me
an example of any so I haven't I'm too
smart to fail but people around me often
fail and that's not embracing failure
that's ridiculing failure and that's
that's kind of not cool right so you
need to be able to unlearn to do this
what I would recommend is take actually
going into the playbook and having a
play with it it is the word plays in
there on purpose it is not a very
serious document the way we've written
the plays are actually like recipe cards
step one do this step two do that step
three do this it's almost idiot proof I
say almost because I don't want to
offend anyone that reads it and thinks
it's really hard not the heart but just
follow the steps have a look at it try
it in my experience in doing this
externally the best place to start
tends to be the health monitors what I
found is high performing or highly
intelligent teams often lack empathy and
self-awareness they are so focused on
high performance they're not aware of
the gaps that they have that could make
them better so using the health monitor
is a great exercise just to raise the
voices it's a great leveler everyone in
the room is an equal there is no
hierarchy there is no right or wrong
answer
when we do the health monsters now it's
probably the lowest technology exercise
we're doing it lasting and we do with
our thumbs you put your hand behind your
back you read the area and then you vote
three two one thumb up some sideways or
thumb down it's a great way of giving
the introverts or the quieter people to
give their opinion and then they share
their views what we find in there is
that often there's air this is celebrity
there's a loud person in the room we
wants to dominate the conversation they
are the one that thinks they're always
right the challenge for them is if
that's you and that resonates with you
the challenge there is just to actually
shut up and listen it's one of the
hardest things to do as an extroverted
leader is just to listen to the people
in your team's because you will get way
more information by listening to them by
hearing than you will from hearing your
own voice the next thing is to
understand your environment so we've
used this with distributed teams one of
the things we've done with distributed
teams is again listen to the people that
are ready on the end of the phone or the
videoconference first one of the
mistakes we made when we first rolled
this out is our teams that were actually
working across borders would run it
separately and although we're dealing
with putting brick walls between them
and their team mates in reality there
were one team what particular team
that's for the chat that asked about
distributed teams what we did with the
team recently is we run a health monitor
as the team formed and they used that as
a discussion point to agree what was
their rhythm and cadence that would work
for them so they could still be
effective one of the examples was most
of the team in Sydney come in late on a
Monday and today a bit later on a Friday
because they're working with a team from
the US and there are that works and this
time frame works and some was in
Amsterdam
it wasn't me going in saying here's how
you do this they had an open discussion
around how do we collaborate let's agree
that at the end of the day before you
leave you drop a note in the chat room
with a link to the page that is the
latest status of all the actions okay
agreed what that has meant is they can
work around the clock and they're not
pausing they're not slowing down - they
haven't got information because other
people are in bed there's also a great
way of actually explaining that every
single one of those team members had a
valuable
commitment a valuable contribution to
the team a lot of the time the remote
person feels arm's length and is very
easy to forget we then use regular
health monitor to actually bring them
into conversation it's the same for
diversity and inclusion it's the same
for making sure that everyone has a
voice black white male female in the
office remote whatever the demographic
the whole idea this is it's a team
exercise that brings everything together
and listening is more valuable than
talking what we've also find is
workplace has to be congruent with your
practices in your people for example I
had a CEO from one of the big banks in
Australia came into our office his quote
was I've purchased every single effing
piece of effing collaboration effing
software and none of them work they're
all crap so I shouldn't run our office I
saw some people sparring we do some
stuff on a white board II sort of
workshop he's like yeah II took some
notes and I said do you mind me asking
what what you've written down to them I
think I need more white boards I said
you your bank makes billions a year I'm
sure you've had white boards before so
the next day our to his office and
literally everyone is in these old
school great cubicles you know it's
about six foot high just sat there and
everyone looks petrified of doing
anything other than working in fact the
image I got it looked like a it
organized the workplace like an Excel
spreadsheet every cubicle was a cell
every person who'd given been given a
formula as long as you got your formula
done didn't matter when you got done you
still have to wait till 6:30 because you
didn't go home til the boss went home
and literally they all look like
flamingos there at their head down doing
this their bum in the air and they just
had their fingers crossed hoping that it
wouldn't hurt but there was no
collaboration there there was no
engagement or vibe there's no creativity
or curiosity there was compliance and
adherence they were running an Excel
spreadsheet so the workplace your
environment is very important to how you
get teams to collaborate and share and
discuss and work together one of the
important things for me and this is a
trend I think we'll see more over the
next five or ten years
is actually sort of mental wellness
well-being mindfulness so as artificial
intelligence and automation takes away
the mundane tasks if you think you do 40
hours of work a week I wish I did but
imagine we all did 40 hours of work
imagine 10 of those are doing mundane
tasks right now I use those 10 hours to
recharge my brain the problem is when
automation or a robot takes those 10
hours of work will my employer pay me
for those 10 hours and let me do some
things or will my employer give me 10
hours more
gnarlie hard complex problems to solve
I'm guessing the latter in which case
how does my brain has with my
psychological safety respond to that are
we as humans equipped to do 40 hours of
highly complex work a week or actually
are we only mature enough and evolved
enough to the 30 hours complex work and
10 hours of mundane tasks and then the
last one is to understand the levers as
I mention before we're going through
epic change you're our playbook is
evolving because the world around is
evolving we're continually adding new
plays when retiring plays that don't
work for us anymore we are likely to add
a new health monitor in the next
probably six weeks which is for rapid
response teams again that wasn't
something we plan to do but we looked
around we saw incidents things been
formed response learning implementing
that learning incident response so we
are now building into the response team
health monitors to share with our teams
internally and then externally into what
are the best ways of working as an
incident response team Millennials are
making more of the workplace now than
they've ever made before
and recent status or is that in the next
few months it's not already there we'll
make fist expect the workforce the
challenge of that is that baby boomers
the aging workforce that we all assume
is going to retire can't retire because
the financial services industry
completely screwed up their retirement
fund and none of them have any money so
we've got this aging workforce that kind
of either doesn't want to retire it's
certainly living longer because
healthcare has got better and they can't
afford to retire so what's going to
happen with the aging workforce
how's the aging workforce going to
combine and spar and collaborate and
work seamlessly and effectively with the
Millennials
the Millennials who by the way are
petrified because stats say they're
going to have 17 jobs in their career
half of which haven't been even invented
yet God knows how they're going to have
the skills for them if they finish
university already and theory they've
got all the skills they need but it's
not true and there's half the jobs that
even exist yet so we're going to go
through rapid change to workforce the
nature of work the addition of robotics
and artificial intelligence we we have a
decision to make
I believe we've got way more information
right now on how the world is changing
around us than any generation before us
the challenge we have is do we think
we're a passenger or a driver previous
generations have felt like a passenger
they've let things happen and then had a
good old British complain and whinge
about it afterwards but it's all alright
I believe that we should be drivers we
are the ones certainly if you're working
in the software industry there are the
pointy end of a lot of these changes so
we have to accept that we are a
conscious driver in how this works
we have to accept that diversity and
inclusion is important to us the
cognitive diversity is important to us
the aspiring collaborating that the
theory that great minds don't think
alike is important to us and finding
ways of making our teams more effective
because the more effective they are the
more effective we are the more effective
our organization is and the more
relevant we are and the more likely we
are to be around in a few years and not
statistic about remember that company
that used to do X to do this we need to
understand those levers and
fundamentally change our belief system
that creativity is more valuable than
consistency and creativity and how you
work the practices you apply and how you
get the most out of yourself and your
Tings is critical this chat is no longer
with us but he's come out with some
classic phrases in his time mainly
around culture eating strategy for
breakfast but this is the one that
resonates for me when I think about this
topic there's a lot of people out there
trying to predict the future I don't
know if they have crystal balls or not
put on them if I have instead of
predicting the future it let's just
build it like we're all in this room
because we have the ability to do that
in the roles that we're in we have a
chance to make a
high impact on the world that we live in
and the people that we love and care for
live in so let's take elements of that
future and create it but do it
consciously and go and create some
awesome teams to deliver high-impact in
whatever field you're working in thank
you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
