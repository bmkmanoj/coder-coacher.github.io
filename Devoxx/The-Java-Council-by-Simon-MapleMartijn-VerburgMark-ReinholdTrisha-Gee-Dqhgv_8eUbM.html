who we are and I love all things alright
so apparently who we are is hi everyone
I'm Martin Vivek you might know me as
the diabolical developer I turn up here
every year and iced out lies and truths
and some some proofs Simon here runs the
virtual jug who here is a member of the
virtual jug yeah okay for those who
aren't the virtual jug is a virtual Java
user group and they have talks and
sessions probably about once a month or
so featuring speakers from around the
world like Venkat very popular man i
butchered warburton trisha other other
people like that most of you know Tricia
who is now back online thinking
Microsoft a trisha is now the developer
advocate at JetBrains doing interesting
talks around Java 8 9 and how to use
IntelliJ efficiently formerly at Mongo
but will forgive it for that my four
degrees yeah sure all right so a little
bit about how we started then years and
years and years ago wow 15 years the
java posse started episode 1 they did
well over 500 next the virtual jug form
we're actually formed for a totally
different reason I never envisaged being
here with a with a Jedi robe on but
after that when the java posse split
there was obviously a lot of counseling
people needed to go through then the
java council said well hey java party
was awesome we can't we can't deal with
them being lost so we actually started
the Java Council and here we are today
Stefan where Stefan thank you very much
their farm for giving us a slot so yeah
that's the Java Council that's a little
bit about us beer everyone got there
everyone got their awesome so I think
thank you
to our sponsors for the beer we have jet
range virtual jug zero turn around and
Jake l'artiste you do go by their boots
and buy everything they have if you need
another beer will be bringing two small
beard grew as well who are you let's
work out where people are from first
he's from North America Tokyo 23 wow
really okay belgium hey quite reasonable
Europe Wow UK are they still gonna stay
in the European Union yeah who knows who
knows well I just wanted to get more
specific Africa no one oh boo South
America Oh a few cool australia
australia sam Newman no not here
anywhere else somewhere really cold or
from another planet one person excellent
uh let's hear a little bit more about
you who's using who's using Java who's
not using Java spot the microsoft guy
you're in the wrong place who's using
Java nine trailblazers quite a few cool
help yourself to another beer java right
nice good adoption java 7 retweets move
to wait now now who's gonna be
embarrassed java 60 died already java
514 wow seriously you three four five
java 1.3 anyone let's get for java 1.4
one person at the back 32 people there
31.3 sorry 1.2 1.1 where's mr. Gosling
yeah okay so we're going to start with a
with an ignite talk everyone's been
talking about how great the last 20
years of Java has been well I'm here to
tell you that it's not been there great
we've had some fun with Java in the past
20 years much like any other language
who has survived this long over time
some of the earlier decisions that were
made have come back to shoot us
literally in the foot if not in some
cases in the hid so here is Duke with a
very safe starter pistol please don't
try this at home don't show this to your
kids your slides do auto forward do
they're not yes yes right so first of
all Java like any good programming
language should be able to rely on its
numeracy as you can see here big dismal
has a classic example of how it can add
to simple numbers correctly of course
using the string constructor works
because that's obvious you can rely on
date and time in Java as well here you
have a quite clear sensible some text to
create a year month day of course I
decide index month differently java also
decides that date start from 1900s why i
lost in the mists of time boxing and
unboxing who here likes using boxing and
unboxing as you can see here with
collections it is always consistent
always reliable which gives you the same
answer sad times more about unboxing
clearly when you have two numbers you
want to check that they're equal that
sometimes was true sometimes if you use
a divils number it's false and of course
when you go back to a number it's true
and at this point I start thinking why
am I even using this language it can add
up numbers correctly can t forget date
and time right it's got no idea what a
quality even means I think I might just
go to JavaScript because that's the same
language
of course we have some reserved words
which are entirely sensible and Java fun
trick to have with your juniors is to
make sure you put the backslash you
inside your variable names to freak them
out always good fun this one really gets
my goat and every year every year I
propose the world's smallest JIP to
rename null pointer to a
nullreferenceexception and year after
year Joe Darcy tells me no good
developers avoid nulls so you know
naturally you'd assume that the Java
collections library help support this
correctly no is this going to improve a
9 I don't know probably not of course
you need to be able to clear what your
return type is in Java and you can
return all the sensible things like a
primitive and object a collection or if
you're really keen you can return a
multi-dimensional array which makes
absolutely no sense whatsoever it's not
quite as bad as JavaScript though where
you just get not a number as a result or
Ruby where you get minus one I don't
know if it's Charlie nothing here
terrible yeah so we thought we were done
with boxing but boxing still continues
to make great consistent Simpson Java
you of course want to check with a you
know our is true or not and or sudden
you get a numeric value why who knows
but we're going to have mark Reinhold on
later and he's going to explain why
array is naturally our first class
citizen in any good language as they are
in Java you can of course sort an array
until the compiler tells you to piss off
groovy lets you do this thank goodness
switch statements also make sense in
Java somewhere someone missed a trick
and the Java language specification here
and I had seen one of our customers
users in their actual source code what
what it actually was ever going to do I
have no idea
but it is legal code so this point we
have to ask the like java language
designers what on earth were you smoking
when you were designing this language
what is going on luckily with Java nine
onwards they're bringing modularity so
we can get rid of some of the crazier
libraries going forwards I don't know
what we're going to do about the core
language in the vm though I guess we'll
just have to let John Rosen co get on
with it getting back to numbers Java is
very good at multiplying numbers and
giving you the correct answer try this
on a calculator on your phone you'll see
that Java is correct and your phone is
not this that type of thing is
especially good in financial trading
systems a quality again we'll go back to
a quality in Java things are always true
in Java whether you're less then a value
with your equal to a value maybe even
sometimes if you're greater than a value
who knows it's always true and of course
Java has logging who here has written
their own logging framework because you
have to because it's so so bad when you
see things like finer finer finest
finally finest it really does make you
wonder what the heck is going on
terrible so in conclusion although Java
has had a rich history of trying to make
us more productive there are still lots
and lots and lots of bug beers in the
language I haven't even touched on
generics but we're going to reify those
in Java 13 so we're going to be okay
quick thank you to all the people that I
contacted it in the past three or four
weeks and blatantly stole their fungal
blog posts and Java puzzlers so on and
so forth and that is twenty years of
java wet very nice
okay so next let's invite mark rhinoland
hope you can bishops
president
is gonna come to have
so much
wouldn't do it
hello I have a feeling I'm going to
regret this obvi this is the last time
you're gonna be on the Java counseling
you know I may be looking for new jobs
stay on the other side as well so it
doesn't look like we have been flanking
the poor guy yeah yeah put on fear isn't
it so but your role at Oracle uh yeah i
work at oracle I work on Java I more or
less the same job i had a son before the
acquisition but with much better funding
so how I was like how has life changed
from son torical there's much better
funding there there there is funding uh
well you know oracle and sun very
different companies very different
different cultures you know some of the
Sun culture has slowly infected parts of
the Oracle culture as happens in any
kind of acquisition in some ways yeah I
know Oracle has a certain reputation but
as a business I have to say it's run
much better than son okay it's very true
which is why oracle is still around and
well son is not I mean there were things
I loved about some there were things
were frustrating about some there are
things that are frustrating about oracle
but you know that's true in any large
organization whether it's for profit or
not yeah it is fair to say that we've
certainly noticed that the amount of
resource being poured into Java is huge
compared to the Sundays it's oh yeah in
the early days son bortolotti but any
over the years at Wendell and special at
the end it was it was sad you had he had
notepad or them to work with on an old
windows desktop and that was it well
something like that so how did you
actually get into job in first place
what was it that made you decide that
Java was going to be the thing you're
going to work on for your basically most
of your career well I was never so silly
to think that okay I'm choosing this now
and I'm going to do this for the rest of
my career right it's it's worked out
that way which which is kind of nice so
I'm actually a refugee from academia
well at this point maybe I'm maybe
refugees there is that is the draw is
the wrong word but now I did the
academic be PhD thing it
I was doing language research and I had
this postdoc position that that you know
that was it was good for a couple of
years and then wasn't kind of wasn't
working out I saw Java from the outside
when it was you know you know 0.9 alpha
one or something that they shipped and
only ran on solaris sparc so i found a
solaris sparc machine being played with
a little bit so oh well yeah that's sort
of cute whatever I actually I had a
connection with james gosling oddly
enough how many people have ever used
Gosling Emacs just James closing at the
bat yeah no he's not actually here um
yeah so got gost got James he went one
of them at the many hacks he did when he
was arrested as it I might get an MIT
CMU sorry is he wrote isn't he decided
right his on Emacs wasone cause we're do
this because yeah whatever and it had a
certain mount of popularity when I was
an undergrad i ported i ported that it
was originally written for for for
solaris and other and other UNIX is i
ported it and is going to sound really
antique i ported it to vax VMS nice and
so you know we're back back in the day
james and i shared many emails over what
was then called the ARPANET for you
young kids you know 3 300 baud in each
direction if you're lucky whatever about
the porting stuff and yeah it was a long
a long long time ago but anyway so I was
getting you know I kind of knew James
was aware and you okay he was involved
in this I knew it he'd worked on news at
Sun which was a really attractive
company to go work for at the time but
anyway well what question was I guess
how did I get involved in Java right
right so I had this I this post postdoc
position wasn't really working out and
then I developed a very very quickly
developed personal reasons to be out in
California this position was in New
Jersey because the woman who's now been
my wife for all those years moved out
there before I did and we just
anyway so so so so so I quit the postdoc
thing in New Jersey got it got on a
plane it was boom time this was may of
nineteen ninety-six in Silicon Valley
was this huge boom you think two
thousand was of Memphis with this this
was a bigger boom I I knew a few people
because I had done a couple of summer
internships I it wasn't like I was not
highly networked I made a few inquiries
and within a week I had a dozen
interviews including an interview at
Oracle I talked about the big a bit hey
you talked about the bigger baby sorry
I'm sorry I just have to finish this
story because you asked the question
yeah and it's funny I you know I
remember going to this interview at
Oracle walking into the towers and yeah
they would they wanted people to know
people with language expertise to work
on ooh plc cool it's still a
revenue-generating product oh yeah
little did I know you know whatever 18
years later writes up whined it wind up
working there but yeah that that's how I
got in a job it looked like a cool thing
to work on James was there you know when
I did all these new I wound up doing
probably 15 20 interviews I always had
in mind well yeah if some hires me that
would be like the thing to do because
I'm just you know I I'm all I have
always been deeply interested in
designing languages and platforms and to
me that's only really interesting if you
have a user community using it being an
academic just as designing a language
writing some papers about it is boring
the opportunity to work on something
like this that's so broadly used it has
a great community behind it is
exceedingly rare and I count myself
itself lucky to have it very cool
awesome so quit your post Docs people is
basically there the advice they're so
big boom let's talk about jigsaw
non-meat sequitur so jigsaw been in the
pipeline for a while you're on a train
derailed back on the truck do you really
do you real slow down no no just stopped
for one stop for a while nothing is what
would you do in hindsight what would you
do differently what would have been what
would have whatever got it into into
java right or seven
doesn't machine x do-do-do-do um well
the funding is it as simple as just
morph well you also something i know
jigsaw has been on the table for a long
time oh and now i know what is that the
American on the table or the British on
the take my brain hurts jigsaw has been
ins has existed for a long time I
started working on in 2008 something to
remember when youth when you wonder why
does this taking so damn long are those
guys just incompetent or what something
to remember is jigsaw survived the
acquisition it survived the death of Sun
and it survived the acquisition by
Oracle both of which were fairly chaotic
events extremely extremely painful
things to go through there there were
times during that period where jigsaw
had effect effectively been cancelled
but we managed to bring it back to life
another thing to remember is when we
started the project we had a completely
different set of requirements well not
completely but a very different set of
requirements what went one of sons sort
of death row acts was to try to get into
the smartphone business and a you know
it was it was a requirement to have
something like a module system that
could and you have download stuff over
the air and update things dynamically
and it's very different from from what
the kind of problem we're trying to
solve today we're we're we're we're not
we're not doing that we're not trying to
create an app store for Java a good idea
why that was a very important luckily
you know so the requirements have
changed you know the stock ticker symbol
has changed you know there were a lot
there were lots of politics for a few
years that we had to go through and so
that's that is part of why it's taking a
long time another part why it's taken a
long time is that well it's just a hard
problem in its software and it's
creative work and it's especially when
you're dealing with you know a mountain
of technical debt trying to find a
design for
basically a new foundation you know
where we're coming in with a forklift or
we lift lifting up the house and pouring
a new foundation and lowering it down to
make the whole thing better and also do
in a way that will fit in with the
existing tools in the ecosystem it's
it's tough and it's it's taken us time
one of the one of the key things about
about jigsaw that distinguishes it from
other model systems is you can migrate
to it gradually you don't have to do if
you have an existing system you don't
have to convert everything to models at
once you don't have to wait for all your
third party library to providers to
convert to modules you know including
that one jar file that you've been using
that hasn't changed for 10 years and the
maintainer zar gone you can you can
migrate a pset of time kind of like with
generics woody and I noticed some people
don't like the erasure approach to
generics but one of its big advantages
is we could use generics in the platform
you could use generics in some of your
code or all of your code or none of your
code you didn't have to wait for
libraries upgrade to generics you could
still use generics with them its
migration compatibility feature coming
up with up with that was you know it
took a while because there but it's just
a it's a new way of thinking about how a
model system should work so those who
are interested by the way java 9 the
latest bills with jigsaw do actually
already work with maven Gradle aunt and
I believe even a preview build of
NetBeans and IntelliJ so you don't you
start trying it out today you can you
can try a jig started a jdk nine
java.net / jigsaw really really do try
it today because it's quite a
fundamental change so you want to
prepare for it as early as possible and
even even if you don't try the jigsaw
early access the JDK 9 early access
builds which are somewhat more stable
actually they're pretty stable they
contain a lot of the preparatory work
for jigsaw so things like that like our
TV are going away the structure of the
JRE changing those have actually all
been injured in jdk 94 for almost a year
now and we you know we've broken some
stuff and we knew that
happen but most of the tools and things
that were broken have have fixed
themselves by now well sorry no their
maintainer is a fix things so apart from
jigsaw what about Java keeps you up at
night what makes you get up in the
morning go we still need to fix this
well take will take the yahoo toolbar is
granted it was a given no comment he
yeah it would take more than a beer oh
and no microfiber yeah what what about
Java keeps me up at night I don't know
that there really is no serialization or
finalization that you just wish oh sure
I mean serialization the the gift that
keeps on giving it it made another big
donation just the last eight days it's
not security guru be here yeah CBS s 10
in in commons really who here still uses
Apache Commons a lot of a lot of a lot
of things do we've been we've we've been
doing this case study trying to modular
eyes to dupe the commons all all over
the place in the face well yep its basic
everything it's is there um what video I
mean serialization yes if I if I could
go back in time I can remove what remove
one thing i'd be really tempted to
remove all the the date and calendar
crusty stuff which at the time i tried
to keep out but I was far too junior to
accomplish that back then there's one
thing I could remove it would be
serialization serialization in the in
the way that it was done in Java
originally is just plain wrong it is too
dangerous it's too hard to get right
there's a couple of people in the corner
you've been bitten really badly by that
one your toes the deprecated later it's
just wrong so one final question yes no
answer is there anything on the market
that
right now any other languages JVM or
other that will stop java from going
another 20 years no cool do you have it
thanks very much for thank you Mark okay
who's head of just a minute all the
people from the UK no longer going to be
an EU as of next week yeah we're gonna
bring a new game yeah I'm gonna bring in
your game to the Europe called just a
minute I'm going to choose Richard up
instead Richard Warburton whoo right
just a minute you talk for one minute
we're gonna get panel of people are
gonna get marking people from the
audience let's grab that microphone
where's that I could hear a little world
in a set place you know you need to talk
at a subject for one minute that topic
is going to be is going to be given to
us by the audience yeah there we go now
the idea is you can talk for that
subject but there's no deviation no
repetition or no hesitation what does
that mean well deviation means you've
gotta talk on the topic which you
actually are meant to be talking about a
repetition means you can't say any word
twice it's up to the judges so I think
that's me right as you it's up to my
discretion basically as to what that
counts previously people have been
banned for using the word ver twice we
to begin with maybe a little bit more
leader tonight and hesitation means you
can't stop so when she started talking
just gotta talk talk talk talk talk so
when when would you women panelist what
would they do to stop someone they're
just bang the desk or shout or whatever
they need to do to interrupt things and
say hey you've hesitated or what have
you whatever the problems let's get some
panelists just long gosh hey I see you
as well Thank out why don't you join us
as video yay again these guys had no
idea now coming up no no let's get dr.
deprecated or on stage okay Syrian come
on Stuart go Stuart right yeah cool yeah
the horses d Finch in a man of class
brings his own trappist beer to our
podcast unbelievable do we need some
music last thing let's have you got
music
ah perfect this is a BBC World Service
by the way we do recommend you check it
out before the Conservative government
gets rid of it okay so we need a topic
shout out some topics see some topics
IOT wars that one vinyl fiber God more
topics when I just heard Swedish
something about serialization feel I
think that's a nice dumbarton I then
that's good candidate so yeah I think
something fierce you do so you will have
one minute to talk about the topic of
serialization and perfect and who we're
going to start with Simon I start with
venkat you've got the microphone right
by Venkat you've got one minute and it
starts now well civilization at the
first uh you know look appears like it's
awesome idea I can take objects and just
utilize them save them restore them and
then once you start doing it of course
you realize well this seems to be a
little difficult because how do I
version this stuff well that's just the
tip of the iceberg once you start
dealing with versioning of course it
gets to a point where you say well okay
I can deal with this but then what about
singleton well it breaks singleton well
that shouldn't be really hard I can fix
that too and then you realize that over
time this was actually created in hell
to torment programmers forever
that's pretty good hesitation who's
calling the hesitation there you guys
are meant to be interrupting and
shouting out that's taking okay mercy is
gonna join it okay so I totally failed
what time they're so Martine you now
need to take over the topic of
serialization and you have six seconds
to go starting now so one of the most
fun things you can do is you can
serialize to all sorts of different
formats you can serialize too far you
can see rose to a database right there
you go your time is up perfect Martine
wins the round so just to clarify
engines your goal is to interrupt your
co workers shouting hesitation deviation
or repetition and you're you know the
way to win is to interrupt just before
the end as Marte this is being very
polite this is very British this is very
British very British fantastic so
Martain won the previous round should we
go with Stephen Drew the next one so
there you go as your microphone and
what's our new topic what would it what
are your suggestions ladies and
gentlemen DevOps what crashes JavaScript
boxing have a JavaScript yeah so you
have one minute to talk on the topic of
JavaScript and everyone else has that
meant to try and interrupt on either
breaking the rules for deviation
repetition or hesitation and your one
minute starts now so I've heard about
this other technology called JavaScript
which I think was just a poorly named
variation on the java programming
language which was illy conceived
without actually thinking about type
systems are actually thinking about how
you'd actually build large-scale
applications but apparently it's caught
on quite a lot for user interfaces which
is something that a lot of us have to
program on a daily basis and it turns
out that when you have a language which
actually has no protections no checks
lets you do pretty much anything without
throwing any faults that makes for a
great language when you're having
repetition interfaces
rapid session using the word language at
least five times using the word line at
least five times that is correct that is
correct okay so Martain you you take
over the mic at this point and you have
twenty one point five seconds to talk
about the topic of JavaScript starting
now javascript is so popular that even
our 14 year old next-door neighbor uses
it to mod minecraft and now I'm lying
that's all I've got there we go there we
go perfect so Stuart called hesitation
fantastic to shoot you have 11 seconds
to go your time starts now one thing
that many people do not realize is that
the history of javascript is that it
used to be called live script and was
renamed with an agreement from sun
microsystems which trademark java which
is now oh I Java time up fantastic she
wins the round glorious glorious okay so
Shri parsley wash now yeah for the
fantastic so topic of your choice got on
shout them out here this is the last one
to make it good Java EE and Sun safety
see anyone else java ee ah what was that
last one for those who don't know josh
works for a company that uses a lot of
java fantastic fantastic so josh your
topic to talk about is java ee you've
got it's basically depends upon how
comedic the interruption happens to me
at the time as to whether i'll allow it
or not so yeah you've got it that's for
you to ask him for us to determine
exactly the rules are fast and loose so
you're one minute to talk about java ee
starts now the modern ecosystem of
developers today is using lots of
different technologies fantastic
interracial you have an cat you need to
have a microphone yes yeah yeah yeah
you've gotta be buff buff buff right hey
do you think I want to talk about Java
EE
oh I call him Terps on myself
unfortunately that's not a rule so I'm
not allow you to injure of yourself
you're 54 seconds starts now oh well so
I once ran into a programmer who said I
want to use Java EE and I asked him why
would you want to do this he said
because we convinced of her boss that we
can develop an application without it
and once I understood what his needs are
we found out that he actually doesn't
have any need at all I said he could do
this with street I know servlets why
would you need something like ejb
remember back in days well that's when I
realized what he was applying is a
really great methodology called or DD
which stands for a resume driven
development and a lot of developers
actually do this and so the entire you
know software technology around you oh
there was a hesitation there was a brief
hesitation right seems in about eight
seconds here your time starts now Finn
Dioner so I'm probably best known for
doing client work but actually I've been
doing more server-side development in
Java oh you develop that your time is up
you win the round fantastic work
fantastic look cool are we calling it
yeah thankfully thank you very much that
was our little piece of British culture
we've exported the deluxe and now we're

two people have been speed dating people
were they together no I was sitting
quite far apart maybe arguments happen
you know yeah so speed date we're gonna
do some speed dating into busy are you
with us Trish no skype I am yep I know
yes I with me p you were muted right
we're gonna do some speed date interest
you gonna do some interviewing as well
as us so who should we get to speed date
we're going to be two minutes each you
can talk about whatever you want for two
minutes it's going to be a Q&amp;amp;A
when the brother go when the buzzer goes
so do we get another speaker on board so
who's a speaker here because actually
West Simon Ritter let's get Simon on
Simon you can come on over here I don't
close to Simon now Simon I notice you're
standing next to the debt dr. deprecated
from Oracle which is quite interested
yeah should be yeah we'd like to point
out i'm not actually a speaker here well
i am now yeah yeah ladies and gentlemen
this is how we get you a speaker ticket
into devoxx it's a special guest pass on
to did you go to the speaker dinner I
did don't differ yeah right so who's
going to be staged going to be Simon
Trish ok cool so two minutes starts
who's got a phone oh there's time it
down there there is a time now that 10
minutes starts now that's your cue Trish
was gonna say attrition injuries meeting
all the other way around yeah go for a
Trish I I have no idea what we're doing
were you know you're good we should
rightly so tres we're gonna do it we're
going to know interview with Simon
Ritter we have Simon here so Trish
questions for Simon routes let me start
off with one Simon I hear you between
jobs right now i am i'm actually on
dammit that was gonna be my question yes
strictly speaking I am unemployed today
my last day at Oracle was last Tuesday I
start my new job next week tell us about
your new job thank you
first there's a delay sorry I will be
working with the java community because
I'm going to continue working on the
Java side of things but this time I'm
gonna be working for Azul so we'll be
doing things like zing and Zulu cuz it
has a Z yes not as it but as he is he
hmm no it was it because was it cuz
we're British yes okay um I'm out of
questions I'm so I'll ask questions so
mark said marks at this very little like
that that he thinks about it the morning
he wakes up think damn I wish that was
out of java or wish that was in Java
right what's your hit list HM that's a
tricky question um i would like to see
javafx part of the java standard i think
that there's one thing i would like to
see um smell was it he's got a fix Oh
actually more than last year yeah bad
yeah maybe but you see because of
modular ization you know it's gonna be
it would be easy to include it and then
you don't actually have to put in your
application if you didn't want it so
people who wanted it of which there are
many could use it and then people who
didn't need it would be able to leave
the module now but i would like to see
if understandeth yet hmm interesting uh
I have a quiz okay for Trish I want to
know if you put a Raspberry Pi in your
new car yet no no because I got I'm
terribly getting confused with dates at
the moment but I hope that my job starts
thanks Monday and I don't get that wrong
but now my new car is actually arriving
next monday i thought it was going to
arrive last week and I was hopefully
going to drive here in it but no so I
haven't put a rather big guy in when you
car yet so what i see so you'll note
your new car sorry your new car hasn't
arrived the same way my baby hasn't
arrived yet that would be a yes that's
the reason Trish's on the phone right
now skype by the way she's not just lazy
she's well i reckin islands yeah cool
two minutes up don't you very much sorry
thank you very much on him who else is
here but your hand up is what an
interview don't be shy where's Haddie
howdy howdy DS run rd I see Charlie
nutter Charlie honey come on down
that's right if we can see you in the
front row your your fear game and Chris
Charlie wears a hat that was just so
junior would you like to interview child
our interview Charlie hoped up to a beer
Charlie what's that episode of it yeah I
need another beer I'm out there we go
getting into other people thank you it's
not carlsberg which is what they were
serving at the speakers are much better
choice hey look so I saw on the
interwebs that jruby has a brand new
marketing version out there jruby 9000
good 9000 you explain the BS behind that
one please oh yes 9000 so 9000 we had
jruby 1.7 we were looking for a new
version and 1.8 would conflict with ruby
1.8 to point out and like with Ruby 2
point I would be very confusing so we
just said screw it 9000 that's the
version we're gonna go with it and so it
actually turned out it was kind of fun
and we played with it and went with it
for a while but it turned out it
actually was the ninth major release of
JRuby so JRuby 9000 became JRuby 9000
and that is now the version of the new
version of JRuby decode it's just worked
out that way so it is JRuby 9000 and
that's the way it goes this is how you
finish them self way people exactly
exactly so the Ruby community and the
java community to be fair you'd say are
culturally quite different shall we say
how many times have you being lynched
mobbed at a ruby conference it gets its
less and less less and less of that it
is still a massive challenge to convince
people that Java is not an evil thing
and the JVM is not something they need
to stay away from but over the years
it's improved now we go to ruby
conferences we do our JRuby talk we ask
how many people are using it and pretty
much everyone raises their hand anybody
that's doing ruby has something on JRuby
in production and so vast part of the
Ruby community is running on the JVM now
and doing real work with JRuby this case
it's gotten much better over the years
so do you find any differences between
sorry Geoffrey this delay is killing me
do you find any differences between the
java community and the
see ya uh and you are being recorded ya
know I have to be I have to be polite
about this uh Java people are very
business focused a real world
application oriented Ruby folks really
don't care about that kind of stuff they
do crazy new projects they come up with
micro frameworks like every other day
and like new versions of rails all the
time but that's part of the charm of the
community there's new frameworks there's
new libraries all the time they're
willing to play with things that may not
be profitable that may not be part of
their job but they can do really cool
stuff in short period of time try it out
and see what sticks and that's that's
one thing that I really like about going
to ruby conferences I come here because
you guys are actually doing real work
getting real production stuff out there
and looking for something that makes
your job easier to do and the Ruby folks
are just throwing anything at the wall
they can it's a great combination and
that's kind of why I like working on Jay
really I I like that quote Ruby
developers throwing anything at the wall
they can that's right just leave it
sounds pretty good Charlie you have your
first date and second date there thank
you very much thank you all right thank
you let's have one more before we do a
quick panel who's here let's get let's
get dr. deprecated back he seems to be
working we don't want that yeah he was
trying to write some code yeah kinda
have that so dr. deprecated er has got a
hand mic so dr. deprecated why you
called dr. debt dr. deprecated ER all
right for the record I was tweeting not
working so and this is why twitter is
still not making you with it yeah you
were deprecating come on okay so there
is actually a Jeff out that I wrote on
enhancing deprecation and so the there's
a brief history of deprecation is that
in I was introduced in jdk one point and
cry oh my gosh you can't you can't
deprecated all that stuff we can't do
this one huge amount of disruption so
basically this process of evolving API
set by introducing new things in depth
getting old things ground to a halt I
aim to fix that yay come on people be
excited we're going to deprecate stuff
in Java literally java.util.date may be
may be could be going well most of
java.util.date is already deprecated in
fact everything except getting the
Milice milliseconds offset is deprecated
but we might deprecated the rest of it
at this point especially since Java time
got into into JDK 8 so controversially
you've used the term condemned as a
proposal for one of the types of
duplication is that too strong a term
should we be condemning software that
people have written in the past well
condemned is indeed a strong word and so
it's a it's difficult to come up with a
vocabulary for for saying that we are
actually going to remove something but
if you don't like to use the word
condemned what I like to do is to say
instead we're going to refactor that
with extreme prejudice I can't wait to
see at the Java comments it's gonna be
great so apart from the obvious Java
date Java calendar perhaps what else do
you think is right for for some pretty
rapid deprecation some some real
duplication condemned deprecation well
so so let's see actually there are two
questions in there so one thing is there
are some real weird things at the in the
weird corners of the API that really
ought to be removed so for instance
there's something in the system class
called get localized inputstream has
anybody ever used that has anybody ever
heard of that a one person Oh Charlie
yeah okay don't believe him so good I'm
glad nobody uses that because it
actually doesn't do anything so I think
it's a Noah so I think at some point we
are actually going to remove that now
the problem is that there aren't very
many things that we can truly remove
because there's stuff that depends on
them but one thing that we are strongly
considering deprecating is all the
legacy collections right there's this
whole fit well not collections but the
legacy data structure classes like
vector hash table Oh
back dictionary back and dictionary
anybody remember those observer and
observable right the only thing those
are used is because all the AWT events
stuff subclasses that I think but
there's actually this stuff in Java util
that is there's basically useless in
fact there's recommendations in there
says don't use this use something else
instead so that's that's what we're
gonna that's what we're going to
deprecate ok so and and don't forget
include by reference Oracle safe harbor
statement yeah okay we have time for one
more interview and thank you stuart
marks Thank You Stuart one more
interview then we do a blind ignites so
let's bring Josh long back to the stage
yeah again so just long travel Eamon so
we'd ask you some questions this is a
date our second date I guess so Josh yes
sir is spring really open source yes
okay to try bit harder I mean that Jedi
mind trick really okay tall is spring
really open source where's my beer yes a
bit okay okay what's your favorite part
spring right now it's spring cloud
spring cloud let's bring be billed on
spring boot to get there with it it's
free be ok so answer with one answer to
two cool projects compare and contrast
the JCP and the way spring works Patrick
Curran is the coolest cat ever but he
doesn't work on spring haha love patrick
cohn he's the JCP chief right and the
greatest guy ever that's the big
difference I see mm-hmm that's the
difference someone i can so how about we
don't have a patrick i will say talking
more about standards putting on a spot
come on i love good standards who does
it mm-hmm so there's enough yeah yeah
I think everybody furthers this den is
rock so spring spring spring boot
extremely popular it's gonna be a big
one day why all of a sudden like what's
made it you know beat Grails what's made
it beat all the other little rapid
application development frameworks it
was so popular 23 years ago well I think
spring Buddha's just it pulls together a
lot of the best of breed components out
there not just in the spring ecosystem
and so I think it's kind of a return to
form to maybe what spring was about 12
years ago was like that's just where
ever we can that's pulled together this
breasted beauty components and and
optimized for delivering applications
and it has an opinion which is also
different like rails did but this is
Java which has a larger community so I
think those two things together you know
it helps so I was awesome right and then
spring lets you get a lot done with this
wonderful language and quick straw poll
the audience how many people here you
spring how many people here use Java EE
how many here use both many people how
many people really don't realize that
spring is actually built on top of parts
of java ee uu see a couple of people
there you go learn something new every
day it supports lots of different things
yeah yeah very cool awesome so josh
alone thank you very much thank you very
much for having me man thank you okay so
let's talk about the next 20 years of
java to finish off okay so this is gonna
be a blind ignite talk hey Trish oh
there she is she's hiding the background
is behind Skyfall that time see when you
become a developer advocate you get
really serious microphones and gear so
like okay this is gonna be quite scope
so these are the slides that I haven't
seen before I wrote these slides
assignment on the train on the way here
there's no idea what's happening and
either ignite talk so this is like
transitioning every 15 seconds yes so on
I know the topic Bay which is kind of a
cheap very blind ignites which is the
next 20 years of Java so I'm 20 years in
the future now 20 years in future years
in the future show here we go okay so
wait wait scrap interfering it's it
there we go okay so 20 years and 20
years in the future then what's
happening so I guess I guess Oracle may
be brought back by son who knows we'll
see let's wait for the next slide let's
see what happens Wow java 8 modules
jigsaw and osgi so Java Java modules
jigsaw is gonna is going to pretty much
punch you in the face like this man's
chin no borrow this is a book by neil
bartlett and tim ellison so this is
going to be how jigsaw is actually built
on osgi in java 9 ok so this is this is
oh my god this is garbage collection and
this is presumably the g1 so garbage
collection is really going to be done
via that by the tetris application and
if there be slightly different shapes
but when you when when it fills up
that's when you get an out of memory
exception this is jay shell so yeah
basically the repple is going to be so
big and java 9 that enterprise
applications are actually going to be
written in rebels and run straight
through rebels there's gonna be no such
thing as application okay and yeah java
is going to be written in these new in
these new format so rather than final
strings and things like that we're going
to use these new icons that's going to
be pretty cool easy to diagnose easy to
maintain oh my god what's next okay so
Microsoft cliff he is going to come back
Oh gonna they're gonna they're gonna
take on java and linux we're gonna have
a massive sword fight and I imagine java
and Linux are going to win yeah that's
that's pretty standard I think everyone
knows that's going to happen value types
hopefully in Java 10 probably 11 or 12
but we'll see okay i'm getting a fairly
straight look for a ma trihard let's say
java turn then we will see value types
in Java power agreement absolutely right
ok so the node guys the node.js guys are
going to be out to get us the note guess
guys are going to be sniping for us
I don't know what else to really say
about this picture tell call recursion
in Java 14 so we're probably lifting at
around 10 20 25 for this one maybe who
knows I don't know what to say about
this slide oh my god so okay so yeah
we've we've crossed out some of those
lines that's brilliant excellent right
another slide so control oh my god 15
seconds Oh continuations okay so yea
rather than rather than making vacations
across and get those returns back we're
going to do continuations and yeah one
call back in blah blah blah excellent
yeah okay so in the future rather than
rather than try and debate whether Java
is the same as JavaScript we just accept
it and we actually make hamsters out of
ham that's what we're going to do this
is going to this is gonna make the
conversation a lot easier okay this
woman here is eating a hamster made out
of hand this is a virtual reality world
where you know we make these beautiful
hamsters this is got you're going to be
a new food group and obviously we're
going to be using Java in many oh I OT
things ok Tom Cruise is going to be a
Java developer he had a big struggle
whether he's gonna be a Java developer
or no developer but here he's actually
developing in Java this is this is going
to be the new IDE jetbrains this is
JetBrains 25 ok yeah we're going to have
we're going to have Jedi children and
they're going to be these are going to
kind of be no developers as well this is
actually how we're going to fight nodejs
java developers are going to you're
going to grow up as Jedi Knights I'm
going to attack them just like this oh
my god what is this closure Lisp closure
closure this is closure ok yes over so
everyone's going to be talking about
node and jet and node and Java and
really in the background Lisp closure
that's going to come out it's going to
bring all its brackets and they're going
to win to do RTO what everyone loves and
hates so Oh projection by 2035 will be
eighty percent everyone will realize C
C++ and C sharp of cheating because
they're pretty much the same thing so
they'll remove them and Java will have a
massive massive oh my god Clara IOT
right IIT everyone's going to realize
you t is a fad and they don't actually
need
talk to their fridge so that's going to
be deprecated by Scott vide Stewart so
what a beautiful picture okay this is
kind of like the matrix which is got she
going to be rewritten in Java and we're
actually gonna realize that we are
already plugged in and we are actually
know Jess developers all along and the
Terminator and the Terminator right okay
oh my god Judgment Day Judgment Day is
going to be 20 35 20 years from now
we're all of a sudden we realize Skynet
is written in Java that's me I will
never do this again here I thought I was
been quite kind they're actually okay
yeah that was pretty good didn't put any
hesco at me that you didn't okay Wow
blinding light if anyone want some
advice never do a blind ignite talk
official times up officially Swift
officially times up so thank you very
very much for the job from the Java
Council massive thank you to Stefan
firfer for having us here massive thank
you to vox life who are going to be
streaming this and other sessions which
is available on parlett YouTube hello
YouTube a massive nod and thank you to
the java posse for making our lives so
much better over the last 10 years if
you want to hear about the java council
more go to a virtual jug calm or java
council calm may the force be with you
and don't forget to take your bottles
out with you yes otherwise we will not
be allowed to do this again next year so
please grab all your bottles any caps
and take it straight outside and put
them straight into the straight into the
keg cask things as well thank you very
much very much thanks Trish mistress</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
