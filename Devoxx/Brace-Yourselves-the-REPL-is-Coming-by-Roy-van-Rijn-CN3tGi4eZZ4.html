I've got like 20 minutes to program
something it's we need to hurry i'm
going to talk about the repple most of
you are probably have heard about the
ripple and yeah it's a new feature in
Java 9 and in my opinion it didn't get
as much attention as it should that's
why I sent in a paper to do talk on the
repple afterwards I learned that Robert
field who's actually creating yeah he's
actually working on the rep alyssa is
here he's doing a conference session so
I'm going to treat this like an ignite
session to to just show you guys how it
works and if you really want to know how
it works go to his session there is so
my dear first for the people don't know
what a wrap boys it's a very wait print
loop that's it since last week it's
available in the in the general jdk 9
build if you download the early access
build rebels actually in there i'm still
using my own custom build version
because i didn't want to change anything
last minute but if you go to that link
you download the latest early release of
GE canine you can play with it it's
there let's do some live coding this is
actually what i want to make in in 50
minutes it's a fractal and it's got the
cps key triangle what you do is you make
a triangle then you create three
triangles out of the first triangle and
then you go and you go deeper so let's
stop the slides where are we okay let's
go we have to go into the 22 my own
custom build it steady canine builds jdk
if you go to the bin directory where you
normally your java is located um you see
all those new commands like jay depth
you should try that as well and
somewhere there
is jay chou we can just start it what
you get when you start JCL is like
nothing you only get a prompt and
sometimes if you print stuff the prompt
gets in a way so I usually turn the
prompt off and now you can just write
Java so for example if we do system out
print line we can say hello world and it
prints out hello world the up arrow same
as always you can that's it and you can
do other stuff as well for example we
all know that tau is better than pie so
we can define tau by doing pi times two
now it says you have variable name tau
which is a double six to eight etc and
we can use that for example to print
because printing is very important we
can print out this is basically how it
works you can you don't have to start
with a public static void main you don't
have to make a class you can just write
you off and it runs so it's perfect for
scripting but also for prototyping and
that's actually what I wanted to do
today prototyping to make it to make it
easy i decided to use swing because
that's like way cooler than javafx
because it's must tell jake or something
let's make a frame oh no it doesn't know
jframe when you start it up it only
knows the the java based classes so it
knows matt because that's in the base
package so we need to import but you can
just write an import script there we go
we've imported swing and we actually
we're going to need a WT as well
the hot star and now if we run this
again it actually makes a frame so
somewhere in the in the in the JVM there
is a frame um we can actually make it
feasible and it should pop up somewhere
of course on the other screen there it
is that's our jframe and it's running
life and we can interact with this
jframe for example if I want to do I
could put a button on it that's not what
i'm going to do i'm actually gonna make
a jpanel panel be cheap and all and i'm
going to override the paint component
method so we make public for its paint
component and it takes a graphic fix and
let's call a method named that well
let's let's don't do anything at the
moment and now we can say frame we add
the panel let's just copy and that's
been it has been added to our frame but
you can't you can see this but because
we don't do anything in the paint
component yet and but it's going to
change the next thing we're gonna do is
to actually do something inside the
paint component because we actually want
to see something so first I'll make a
method called row you can also make
methods so this is a method that's not
bound to a class but it's bound to the
rep 0 itself so we make a draw method it
takes the graphic width and height and
let's just don't do anything so we've
created the method if you want to see
what we've created we can use the /
force to see other variables we've
created you can use / methods to view
other metals with create
so we have a panel that doesn't do
anything with the draw method that
doesn't do anything so that's kind of
worthless so let's edit p our panel when
you call this and it's on the other
screen you get a small editor this
editor allows you to see the previously
created variables and methods and
classes and you can edit them and you
can push accept and it gets loaded into
the record so this makes it just a
little bit easier to to edit stuff adapt
you can read that that's probably better
so what you can do now we can call draw
with weed and get height and we can push
exit
now it says you've modified the variable
P yeah that's it now we're going to edit
the draw method and actually do
something so let's edit draw there's
metro and let's say we're going to do
draw an oval for example just to show
something with with um yeah it looks ok
except so now we repaint this component
which is still here we should see a
circle oily lips so while this code is
running we're able to change methods we
were able to change variables and we can
prototype stuff so let's go back to to
to the example this is what I want to
make so we have to start out with making
a triangle this is not a triangle so
let's edit the draw method again wait
there it is for this triangle will need
three points so we can make the first
point it's actually first point is
actually located on the top in the
middle so its width divided with divided
by 2 and it's on the top the second
point is all the way in about them so
it's at I don't know zero no yeah zero
height and the final point
and with a knife it's all the way in the
other corner and we'll say Phil trying
oh gee p1 p2 so we've created three
points and we're calling the field
triangle method and some of you might
already have noticed we don't have a
triangle Phil triangle method so now it
says you've updated the draw method and
your efforts Lee you're referencing
something that doesn't exist you're
referencing feel triangle but it's okay
you can always make that just just make
sure you actually create it before you
call the draw method I'm not going to do
that let's just resize this and and call
the method that doesn't exist yet yeah
you get exceptions it's referencing
something that doesn't exist so so we
need to make a fill triangle triangle
and with the graphic subject geez crap
fix G point B one point you know what
I'll just copy it from my cheat sheet
you're not here to watch me type
so Phil trying now when we go to where
is it there it is now it should feel the
triangle that's exactly what we need
right the next thing we need is actually
to create a fractal to create a fractal
we have to take the triangle and divide
it into three triangles so we need a
method to divide one line into the exact
center to get the exact center of the
line so that's why I have the MIT
function you give it to point you get
the middle so we can actually test this
out we can calm it with a new point at
zero zero and we make another point I
don't know 2010 we get a new variable
back and it's stored as a temporary
variable in dollar 18 that's its
temporary name actually name's not
temporary that's its name from now and
it's at ten and five so we know our mid
function is working we've prototyped it
and it works so what can we do now well
I'll just quickly show you the soup in
ski triangle this is a recursive method
so it starts with Foyt triangle we give
it a triangle and a depth if the depth
is 0 we call the field triangle just
like before and we return when we have
that left we divide the triangle into
three new triangles and we do that by
using the top point and the two middles
the other point in the two middles and
the other point in two middles and we
call it with Deb minus one so it's
recursive and now when we edit we added
the draw method which is it always pops
of the other screen
instead of calling Phil triangle we can
actually call the soup in ski triangle
and we can give it a depth for example
to now when we accept this and we go to
our running example yeah there it is so
this is our fractal and we can actually
we can make it a little bit prettier by
using a bit higher iteration depth for
example 66 you look good and we can
change our code while it's running if we
refresh now there we have a fractal
thank you I've got a fan but yet this is
basically how you could use the ripple
it's it's a new tool we don't know what
we can do with this and there are they
are working on an implementation of the
Jaffa rippled J shell in netbeans for
example other tools will get support for
the ripple and it has loads of other
stuff which I didn't didn't talk about
you can use the help function to to see
other stuff you can do for example you
can export everything we just wrote
which is important if you want to save
your work because if I exit now
everything is gone you can load scrapes
in for example I can see this being used
as a scripting language using the new
Java files API it will be easy to write
your scripts in Java as well that's easy
because it's easier when everything is
Java right instead of shell scripting we
don't know how it's going to be used but
if you want to know more go to robert
fields talk you he'll explain everything
in depth time's up
on if you have questions ask him</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
