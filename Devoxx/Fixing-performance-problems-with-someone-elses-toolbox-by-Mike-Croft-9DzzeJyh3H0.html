fixing performance problems with someone
else's toolbox my name is Mycroft and I
work for a company called see to be too
so we're independent Java middleware
experts so this talk really is pretty
much just sort of like a tales from the
front line so it's based around one time
when I went out to a customer who is
just having performance problems now
generally what I would do in that
situation is I've got a set of tools
that I would use I'm quite familiar with
that I know how to work I now had to get
good usable data from the system that's
performing a bit badly but in this case
there was problem after problem after
problem and each one of my tools was
just completely useless for various
different reasons so I thought well
actually all of us have got favorite
tools and things that we know and
understand very well but what happens
when the things that we normally rely on
just aren't there anymore but for
whatever reason do we know what the
alternatives are even available I do
think that we don't need to absolutely
be aware of the ins and outs of every
alternative but I think it's useful to
at least be aware of what else is out
there to use so I'm going to get through
as many as possible in 15 minutes it's
not being recorded so if you see
something that you're not familiar with
you know snap a photo and you can look
into it a bit more detail later because
I won't be able to spend a huge amount
of time on each so first things first is
generally walk into customer site and
they say something like help server is
slow and I said well okay good that's
good to know we need to know what what
what next so this particular customer
they didn't actually have any insight at
all into the system they knew that a
login was taken 45 seconds or so but
they didn't know particularly why they
just saw that the they sent the request
through 45 seconds later something came
back they didn't know how
long was spent in the database how long
we spent in the application server there
was a whole lot of information that they
just didn't have so first step when you
kind of as someone coming in from the
outside looking into this sort of thing
it's very useful to start with live data
you know how is the server behaving
right now what can I see that's going on
so generally what I like to do is start
there see what I can find out using
hopefully some graphical tools some of
these might be familiar to some of you
maybe some of this that would be new do
we all know jconsole I would yep yeah
that's a lot of hands as good I would
hope that most people that have spent a
little bit of time with the JVM writing
stuff for production would be aware of
jconsole so it gives you a lot of
information about the memory that the
heap usage so you can see instantly well
am I just running out of heat space but
it also gives you information on the
threads and a really great lightweight
way of looking at jmx mbeans so we can
see what's happening with connection
pools am I just running out of the
threads to serve HTTP requests visualvm
is something that again i would hope a
lot of people are aware of by now it's
been around for a little while I'd quite
like it because it's a little bit more
advanced than jconsole we've got some
quite nice plugins like the visual GC 1
which I'm quite fond of which gives you
a really good detailed view of the heap
but one of the things I really like
about visual vm which i find that not
many people are really aware of is you
can just see on the left there i've
connected to a payara micro server but
underneath I've got snapshots and a
tomcat snapshot so what visual vm does
is you can connect it to a process it
will gather all this data and well yeah
this is live data that's good but you
can then take an application snapshot to
then be reloaded into J visual vm later
and then do something more exciting with
it at least you analyze it when you've
got a bit more time later so the new one
is Java Mission Control
has everyone heard of John Mission
Control okay that's good as a reasonable
man so if it's jay console is your kind
of little renault hatchback visualvm is
your nice BMW saloon Mission Control is
more like your Formula One car there is
a huge amount of extra stuff that it
does it comes from B's j rocket and
alkyl made the fantastic decision of
thinking this is a great tool let's
integrate it into hot spot so it gives
you a huge amount of extra thing you can
probably just see the tabs down the
bottom it gives you triggers diagnostic
commands so that you can react to events
that happen and you know gather a thread
dumper or some other kind of stack trace
so that's really good really useful so I
went through this kind of thing with a
customer and said okay we've got these
tools these nice graphical tools that I
can use to they're all on my laptop so
you don't need to have them and then I
just need to connect up all I need is an
IP address and a jmx port number and
then well the problem there is that we
are firewalls are quite restrictive so
we don't actually open those ports so
that was a bit of a spanner in the works
really be I'm a guy who likes to look
for solutions not problems so well what
we can do is just you know forward ports
and then we can connect through an ssh
tunnel so this is a party if you want to
do this on Windows Linux you can do it
on the command line natively we can just
set up a port forward thing so that I
can connect a local host 8686 which is
the GlassFish JM export and then that
will just forward my request through a
normal SSH thing so it's just port 22
firewalls are fine so that was ok but
server dozen actually have jmx enabled
and when I did suggest that maybe we
turn on CH a mex and we enable those
flags well you know that's got to go
through the change board and that
doesn't meet again till next Wednesday
so that's out as well so ok let's you
know have another workaround let's turn
on X forwarding and then we can launch
these
tools on the server but view them
locally so again when party you can just
take a box to enable excellent
forwarding with under linux command line
it's just minus X great you know linux
will understand that natively on Windows
you need to download an extra tool like
xming if you want to view where X
Windows from there but unfortunately the
server that we're connecting to doesn't
doesn't have an X server because it's
just headless you know they've never
needed one before so so yet at this
point I thought well I don't need to
kind of stay calm take a step back
reevaluate my options and think well
what what are the tools can I can I get
along with so again let's start the
beginning let's view live data on the
command line so we don't have any graphs
or any any sort of nice tools like that
but what we can do is use built-in JDK
tools so this is always the first one
that I start with JPS if any of you
familiar with linux administration
you'll be very very aware of the the PS
command which is list processes JPS will
just list Java processes it's very
simple the minus V flag gives you the
verbose output so if you've got a ton of
Java processes and just the the name of
each it gives you the bit of extra
information to know which one you're
doing so we can see here poor process ID
31 142 is my tomcat instance so that's
the one that I want to do a bit more
more investigation on next up we've got
j stat so Jace that gives you a lot of
really good information into garbage
collection there's different fields that
you can set this one I'm using here is
the GC cause which is quite a nice one
that I find purely because the numbers
that it gives you are percentages so it
tells you what percentage full that the
heap is are the ones will just give you
numbers of you know heap usage in bytes
or kilobytes the number after the
process ID which is obviously what I
used JPS for 4000 that is the period in
millisec
that it will print out a new line if you
don't supply that you'll just print out
one line and that's not massively useful
so the next thing J map if you're not
aware about this this is the command
which will give you a heap them which is
obviously really useful if you think
this looks a bit like a memory leak now
unfortunately that's really something
that goes down well on a customer site
purely because the best time to take a
heap dump is when the heap is full the
time when the heap is fall is almost
certainly when the heap is being most
used by your customers and when that's
not the time where you want to introduce
a minute or two spores which is
sometimes what can happen next we've got
Jay stack now this is how we would you
know just collect a thread dump other
than kill minus three which is a Linux
specific or unix-like specific command
so Jay stout would just print out a
thread dump every threat that's in the
JVM so we can see what's going on and
now you can see that I've used the
double arrow to pipe that through to a
file which means create it if it doesn't
exist or append to it if it already does
so what that means is that instead of
just having a single snapshot of what
threads were doing I can take a couple
over a period of seconds maybe when i'm
doing a particular test so in this case
it was a login start login and then just
run that command a few times while the
login is happening to say okay we spent
we got one thread that's spending twenty
odd seconds in the database or 28
seconds trying to process some
information or something or waiting for
another service to or resource to become
free so that's really useful next thing
once we've finally managed to get some
sort of live data its look at historical
data so maybe the issue is naturally
happening at the moment so we need to
look back and see what what data have
you collected so far that's given us
these things now on this particular
customer that was nothing at all because
that's just who they were but we do have
quite a few options here so best-case
scenario really ideal thing that we
have would be I would say mission
controls flight recorder now this will
give you all of the huge amount of
detail and information that you get from
Mission Control but in a historical way
and you can actually configure it to run
continuously sort of like a ring buffer
so it will be a time box period so it
will always retain just an hour two
hours a full day of information and it
would just be the previous length of
time but unfortunately it's not a free
feature so very often you'll find that
the customer that you working with just
hasn't bought the commercial features
that they're not allowed to use that in
production which is a shame because it's
really good so the alternative to that
would be verbose GC I would say
generally I would recommend that anyone
uses for both GC all the time in
production it's a really lightweight
process and it gives you a huge amount
of information it's really good i really
like it we've got a tool like the one
the right there which is GC viewer
available on github at the moment it's
the company that made it don't don't
support it anymore but IBM do a really
good one called the garbage collection
sighs GC MV is that is the acronym i
cant rember the full name but the
disadvantages if you don't turn on
verbose Jesus you all you haven't got
any data to work with so I've already
shown you how to collect some live data
with j stat what we can do is kind of
repurpose that and as i did with the j
stack the thread dumps piping that out
to a file i can do the same thing with j
stat so use no hope to make sure that
when my terminal session ends it doesn't
stop stop running this will every four
seconds print out the status of the heap
to a file which I can then analyze later
with some kind of fancy Linux commands
such as these so there i'm using cat to
just read in the file then piping that
through to sort i'm sorting by key six
which is the y GC column
doing a minus of you to only select the
unique one so that's basically just only
selecting the at the times when I
garbage collection actually happened
which is only really the interesting
ones and then the minus end to make sure
it's sorted by number otherwise it just
sorted alphabetically and everything
goes a bit wonky then piping that into
less so I can at least traverse it and
the one thing that i should say about j
stat which i forgot to mention earlier
is the the column headings you can see
at the bottom sort has ended up putting
those right at the end but these
actually for those of you that haven't
already noticed correspond to the the
same things that you would see in visual
VMS visual GC plugin so we've got s
naught s 1 e 0 and p those are all areas
of the heap survivor naught and so over
one then the Eden then old and then perm
gym it's what we can see is that for
those two blue highlighted lines that's
that the top one was a garbage
collection and we can see that the the
four in the fgc column which is the
count of full GCS that has happened
jumps up to five and then we can see
that the cause for that was a system GC
call which is generally not the sort of
thing that you want to be doing yourself
in in code so finally once we've gone
through and we've collected some data
obviously we haven't done things in an
ideal way this is really not the sort of
thing I would recommend doing all of
these of a lot of these have been last
resorts obviously ideally you want to go
with the tools that work and do things
in the best way it's time to kind of
bask in the glory of your own success
because well despite huge amount of
problems you've done it you've collected
some data except that's only really the
start isn't it so we collected data then
it's time to go into the analysis
so I hope you know you've come across
something that's been a bit new
something that you can maybe take back
to work and be a bit useful so thank you
