918 we are here with chat I the under of
front faces and priming G I know I'm
faces like four years for ten years how
do you manage to go through all these
years and adapt to the new challenges in
Ted and the technology yeah I think the
key is updating the technology because
it's just Jess's I don't like to work
all but I prefer to use the word mature
mm-hmm it's been like more than ten
years it's been around we keep updating
it there were many techniques that we
were using in the in the past the future
updated to html5 to new CSS stuff so the
front end is really modern looking and
we're also adapting the community
changes as well people are requesting
other nice tips and tricks and offers
new features so we adopt them so I guess
it's the the front end is really
developing we love fast you know these
all these technologies coming up and I
think we're doing a good job on updating
the prime face so that it's it's look it
looks modern and easy to use
the key of JSF is you know it's really
productive although it's you know old
technology it's really productive once
you learn to way so that you can just
create your forms and especially in the
enterprise and in the internal web apps
it's still quite popular and so we will
continue making it up to date as well in
the future isn't it hard to maintain all
all these versions because you have kind
of a version for each new technology you
have a version for Java you have a
version of an angular have a virtual
project and you even have something for
you GS isn't yeah hard to maintain all
of this but it is it is very hard so I
mean it's really hard to catch up so we
right now three main projects primefaces
prime ng for angular practice for Java
and prime rack for rack we're playing
with buges
but I mean a day is like 24 hours we
don't
once I missed
primefaces in iraq do they ants so yeah
we need to expand our team to work on
Blue Jays but right now we managed to do
it but it's a lot of work that's why I
was very interested in web components so
that we can write it once went
everywhere but you know it doesn't play
nice with react we already had primary
ng there's a native confidence we don't
really maybe I mean practice is already
done so yeah first of course maybe for
vue.js we can write web components in
part it's because we just supports web
yeah yeah we're just kind of doing
projects yes of course I'm a big fan of
the angular equation and the music gig
like like I know from 2016 or something
like that yeah from field operations and
a linked up it's very fast because I
remember I was crying at the calendar
wasn't available something like that and
just two weeks it was a calendar
function yeah and we had to it's because
in angular there's a really you know
stiff competition Google has its own
library yeah there are a couple of
bootstrap ones in metal ones so we
always have to be you know one step
ahead it moves too quickly angular
itself is FS so we have to catch up
there we are trying to come up with new
stuff and always try to improve the life
of it I think we do release the every
two weeks lot of things otherwise you
know you will just there's a competition
we'll just stay behind so how do we
tackle the problem with browsers and
mobile devices do you think single eye
bro you can do both or do you have
components optimized for mobile and
components of you know not actually I
mean we don't have like you know for
example we have in the react person we
don't have any react native mm-hmm so we
actually never done any you know the
native stuff is no like web components
you know the compost that run in a web
browser but they just adapt in in terms
of responsiveness and you know swiping
but I mean we always tested on the
mobile device at first to make sure it
runs the problems our responsiveness to
make sure it fits nicely and the second
one is the older Killick events and
touch event so for example in data table
we have this feature called that's
multiple selection where we select
multiple rows with a meta key but on a
mobile device there is no meta key yeah
so we detect that if there's a touch
enabled some of the tips and tricks that
be found from stack overflow is touch
enabled if it's a touch device that we
just disabled the key functionality and
let the user just select multiple O's
with tapping so with tips and tricks
like that we try to optimize in terms of
responsiveness and you know touch events
and things like them it's quite a lot of
work yeah it's it's it's fine that to
you you find the right balance between
open source development and making
making coffee together later today you
are yes it's more hard it's harder than
you know creating libraries wanting
making it popular yeah more challenging
creating a business model is just crazy
I mean but from since couple of years I
mean we managed to do it and when people
I mean if you offer something more and
commercial people who made shy away from
it so yeah we need to find the balance
with open source functionality and our
business model on themes yeah if they I
mean it's not mandatory they are not
forcing anyone and you know those
business models bit where you have a
free version and premium version in free
version you have buttons and inputs and
commercial framers you have a full data
file we don't follow that we have
everything
functionally free yeah if you want
support and nice-looking things whether
it's it seems to working for so it could
be a tip for future episodes projects so
if they instead of maybe getting
sponsorship or your cat games and things
like that maybe they can sponsor
themselves by offering some premium
stuff on core will take from wait for
having me
cause it's it's a real pleasure first
time and hopefully I will be back in
future sure thank you very much thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
