I'm here but stays dear at Chris Mikael
and you've given a talk extracting
knowledge from cryptocurrency where do
you start ok so the talk is about were
kept down in 2012 as my Master's Jesus
and it's a software for analyzing the
Bitcoin blockchain mostly for extracting
knowledge by analyzing the blockchain
maybe I'm wrong here but and it kind are
they supposed to be especially secure
and anonymous systemic so these are two
different questions right i mean about
security well it is a Bitcoin it is
secured by the amount of hash power
thrown in by the miners so we could say
that unless some cryptographic
breakthroughs happen bitcoin is very
secure but from anonymity point of view
bitcoin is not anonymous and it was
never meant to be anonymous the actually
its creator pretty explicitly said in
the white paper that Bitcoin was
supposed to be pursued animals and not
anonymous it means that you can generate
as many addresses as you want which are
like pseudonyms you would use in a chat
but if they are not directly linked
above your identity but by analyzing but
on the other hand the blockchain is this
public ledger where every transaction is
public and everyone can see which
address send to which other address
money and how much and so from that
point of view bitcoin is really not
anonymous and by analyzing the auction
you can get a lot information out of it
so it's not what you're a your
exploration was then it was finding what
you can find out from the block chain
yes exactly i mean there is a lot of
potential right it's like a treasure of
information that are just waiting to be
a to be mined it acclaim found it's it's
very interesting too is a bit of the
techniques used by vitaliy unable to be
used for very high profile cases also
legal cases such as dark web markets
such as a secret and
some investigations also by law
enforcement device the value in the
knowledge is that it is it finding out
whether or not the bitcoins opinions for
anything they shouldn't have yeah so
maybe they can for example assist
traditional investigation by law
enforcement for finding for example
money laundering or well it's been used
by the secret for the secret trial so
but also for example if there is a scam
and you know someone files a complaint
well it could be useful to track the
bitcoins to exchange so that law
enforcement can go through their
traditional ways such as you know a
warrant to ask for real-world data of
the person that wants to cash out the
Big D Bitcoin of course this is not
deterministic like it's not it becomes
probabilistic after after a while so
caution has to be to be taken I really
like the technology I also very
fascinated by the the privacy aspects of
it so for example there are new
cryptocurrencies that are not the kind
that are meant to be anonymous and they
use some very advanced crypto to achieve
that and it's super exciting actually
too because I I personally feel that
there is a there are a lot of legitimate
use cases all for private transactions
for example I don't know from just
supporting a no-profit that is maybe not
very liked by government such as
WikiLeaks or you know in some countries
may be there is no freedom of expression
so you might want to support journalists
that that may be do not adhere to the
ruling party's directive and I do feel
that there are a lot of legitimate uses
or like private transaction</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
