who wants to go on an adventure today to
learn the ancient art of discovering
bounded context which we all seem to
have forgot no one well you can all go
and I can go home and that was a good
talk thank you very much
a machine we just don't like playing
your hands up so I'm going to take you
on this adventure but are we going to
find the bounded context treasurer or
are we going to run into danger so it's
a very it's not a safe journey I'm going
to take you on so I had to do lots of
research about these bounded context
things and work out we've been using
them in DVD for like 10 years and now
suddenly all you lot of searching for
them so why why did you start searching
for them over the past few years why did
you suddenly start caring about them
we've loved them for years and now you
like come along and I'm going to take
these bounded context things why anyone
why did you start liking boundary
contexts anyone it's okay I know the
answer you don't need to tell me I did
some research I was checking out the
news from April 2013 with Justin Bieber
Justin Bieber's new haircut sent people
bounded context crazy it's the only
answer I can possibly find to explain
this place or maybe it wasn't maybe we
need to have a chat with uncle Adrian
uncle Adrian Cockcroft telling us we
must be creating these fine fine grained
micro services that implement bounded
context maybe it was experts like him
and Sam Newman good old Sam Newman
aligning bounded context and micro
services so bounded context has become
very popular we're all searching for
them but as it's a problem you don't
know what they are you don't you can't
agree amongst yourself what these
bounded context things are if you've
seen this conversation before bounded
context exist in the real world know
that sub domains know yes
you're an idiot I'm taking my toys back
well how about this one there should be
a one-to-one mapping between
micro-services and bounded contexts why
is everyone so obsessed with this
one-to-one mapping between
micro-services and bounded context no
one can agree on anything how about this
one
bounded context don't only you I yes
they do whatever so I wonder have these
bounded context things just become a bit
of a buzzword and people like to use
them to make themselves feel clever oh
yes we're using bounded context and that
bvv stuff we're doing it all right I
think they have become a bit of a
buzzword but there is some useful stuff
in there but before we get to the useful
stuff I need to warn you you can't just
go around calling anything about in
context is he going to have problems
last year I was at a user group in
London giving a talk about digital
transformation one of the things I was
talking about was yeah gently small
things nice and independent bounded
context blah blah blah it's quite good
talk actually got the end of the talk
everyone was asking me loads of
questions the pizza had gone cold I was
quite happy with my night's work people
normally don't put their hands up like
today they don't ask me questions or
anything like today but this was a good
talk and after the talk this guy comes
up to me he say hey Nick I'm a deaf
manager for company bla bla we were
having that kind of problem he talked
about the bounded contacts he said six
months ago it was so long taking so long
to implement even the most basic feature
in our code base so my developers they
asked for six months to take that big
monolith and break it down into these
small bounded context things I said to
him okay that's a lot of companies going
through that nowadays do you break it
all down in one big rewrite or smaller
pieces
that's the kind of tough question and he
was like no no no you don't understand
I let them do it and now the work is
taking three times longer the developers
are always fighting and the execs are
going nuts at me I've got three months
to save my job what should I do enjoy
the free pizza didn't have an answer for
hit I didn't have an answer for him so
you can get in trouble if you go around
using bounded context and micro-services
and you don't really understand what
they are
I'm not saying you'll lose your job like
he probably did only if he's here
that'll be quite embarrassing wouldn't
it now he's not here I don't think so
yeah there's a lot of lot of you can go
wrong with these things so I want to
show you how to find bounded context and
it doesn't start with code or anything
like that it starts by understanding the
business problem so before we can whoops
yeah imagine I just read that out to you
it starts by understanding the business
problem so a couple of things I teach on
my workshop are the business model
canvas understand your organization's
business model the value propositions
customer segments the key activities and
the key resources and those things will
tell you what's important and then when
you're looking for bounded contact you
have an anchor point we're creating
bounded context to satisfy this goal but
it's not just enough to understand the
fuzzy business stuff you also need to
understand which the core use case is in
your system that your users care about
who here is doing user research in their
organization shame on the rest of you if
you don't understand what your users are
saying you cannot possibly create
software that is satisfying their needs
you can't possibly prioritize your time
and energy creating bounded context to
satisfy their needs because you don't
even know what they're asking for but I
won't hold it against you and I won't
hold it against you like didn't put your
hands up earlier we're going to move on
to the next part so we've started
understanding
business we've started understanding our
users and we begin by looking at those
core use cases we find where value is
and we start there so you can create
user stories you can start the
whiteboard by talking about things like
about finding the core use case so I'm
going to talk to you about this domain I
worked in when I worked in the
government I had to rename a few of the
words so I don't get sued but it's
basically as a business you can log into
this system and you can move you
information held about your properties
and how that's used to work out how much
tax you pay if you're not happy you can
amend details and you can resubmit
details and if you can renegotiate how
much tax you pay so in this system we've
identified the core use case customers
care about renegotiating their tax
because everyone wants to pay less tax
let me tell you so we think of the
system as a black box we think about it
from the perspective of our users and
that's when the interesting stuff
happens but then we can start doing DBB
you don't know this stuff and you're
doing vvv yeah you're doing it wrong
sorry so we start thinking about the
system from the inside now and how the
domain actually works but again we start
with our user what are they trying to
achieve in this core use case in this
case I'm an overpaying rate payer the
first thing I want to do is review the
information held about my businesses so
I can check if it's correct or not and
this is where we get to the interesting
part of modeling now you want to work
out okay well which bounded context is
responsible for enabling this this
action to happen where does this
responsibility live so you'll be at the
whiteboard with your domain expert so
waving your arms and playing post-it
notes everywhere are you putting all
that stuff we kind of work out which
context does this belong to you and in
this domain the obvious the obvious
solution we enter is okay well we'll
name it after the business process step
so we're like okay this is handled by
the assessment review context but you
can't say context to like at the main
expert it means nothing to them you're
kind of talking about these things and
they yeah it's difficult so what you can
do is just start with a bubble or just
put the name of the step so here we're
calling it the assessment review step
not calling it a context calling it step
then you say okay well we've got this
assessment review step how do the
assessments get in there and then the
main experts start going off into all
their lovely speaking they're like yeah
yeah we we contact the survey we send
them out to the property they assess the
property the supplies all the
information fantastic what happens next
well I'm a rate payer I see the
informations incorrect
my resubmit it I don't have two hundred
car parking spaces I don't you have any
car parking spaces
great so which context owns this and
again you can't say to the domain expert
or which contacts don't exist because
there is no context so okay what shall
we call this step let's call it the
attribute V submit and the domain
experts like none and I we don't we
don't call it attribute resubmit us too
many words we just call it V submits so
in this domain the word V submit means
to resubmit some property attributes
that you think are incorrect and then
we're like fantastic what happens next
let's have a coffee come back to it you
have a coffee you come back what happens
next
a case is created hmm tell me more about
this case well it's sent to the case
management team I'm like okay well we'll
create this context and we'll call it
case management for now at this point
it's just a hypothesis you're not
committing to any context yet and then
you're like okay well what happens next
well the caseworker comes along
they've got 14 days to process it how do
they process the case they send them
surveyor back to the property to check
the details bla bla bla
so I'm going to stop here because that's
not the full use case but I think you
get the idea right you're trying to
guess at these bounded contexts and you
might name them after you might name
enough to step to the assessment review
step or you might name them after a team
the case management team then you go
through more of these use cases you
create different use case diagrams or
you sketch different news cases on the
wall and you look at all these different
use cases and you try and work out the
context you'll need and I'll talk about
that in a sec but then you'll come back
to a context map you're going to take
all those different use cases you're
going to abstract them away into a
context map which is still just a guess
at this point you're not committing to
any context and during that process you
can use clues to find bounded contexts
so the first one is language if you've
read the big blue book by Eric he's
absolutely obsessed by language and
precision and using words and it's a
very good thing to help us find these
contexts so what this means is in your
domain you look for words and phrases
that are used together or you look for
the same word which has different
meanings in different places so in this
example when we're in the V submit
context we're talking about property
attributes floor space air conditioning
car parks physical attributes but when
we're in the renegotiate context now
we're talking about I want to pay less
tax and this tax band and that tax pan
and this rating and stuff the language
is completely different so those
boundaries look quite clean and
separated but then we get to the case
management and it's a bit awkward
because we're reusing language from the
other contexts when you create a
resubmit case it contains language about
these submits when you create a
renegotiate case it contains language
about renegotiates
so that context doesn't it's not obvious
me yeah you're not quite sure so you
think okay let's look at the other clues
another queries data
I've got data in this context and I want
to make a change to it
but have to change some date in another
context that dependencies are warning
that got a dependency coupling might not
be good might not be good boundaries
maybe we can turn those things into one
context another is the main expert
boundaries what does this mean
it means that in a large complicated
problem domain you might have different
domain experts and they will care about
different things and what they care
about can give you clues about good
clean boundaries so for example in this
domain when I'm in resubmits the main
expert here is a surveyor goes down to
properties collects all the attributes
drink lots of coffee and stretches the
day out but one you get to renegotiate
with the main expert now someone who
deals with tax bans and finance and
politics different domain expert so it's
telling us those boundaries that the
resubmitting renegotiate they look quite
clean and they satisfy these clues but
then one gets a case management and it's
like well yeah those both of those
domain experts have to have an impact in
case management they both have to
provide input so maybe case management
isn't a good boundary we talked about
existing organizational boundaries can
be useful can be a bit of a red herring
and we've also got business process
steps in some of the names to find your
contact you just take your business
process step chop it up into it and take
your business process you chop it up
into steps and each step is a context it
really is that easy sometimes so we've
got here review resubmit renegotiate and
case management only the problem with
this is you think it's a business
process step when you start modeling it
and when you start implementing it in
software it's a bit more than just a
business process step you crack it open
and you see multiple different
responsibilities and that's where this
organization kind of went wrong they
create Aviv context in a high-level
strategy document by some senior
executives who get nowhere near the code
but when they went to implement it they
found that yeah a case management is two
things
it's processing the V submit case and
it's processing the renegotiate case so
it's not really satisfying any of these
clues so what we get to now is the
tricky part and this is why it's an art
and not a science because these clues
are telling us case management is it's
not a clean boundary do we need it or
don't we need it and this is what DVD
helps us to do DVD helps us to create
these different models encourages us to
look for different models of the same
domain but then we have to choose which
is the right model for us to choose and
this is where a lot of people go wrong
with vvv they can't justify why they're
using it why are you collecting value
context while you're creating creating
models I read it in a book soin told me
a conference I need to create bound good
context that's not not really going to
make much difference to your manager or
someone who's not into code I'm sure I
clicked that so how do we justify these
founded contexts and how do we know
which model to choose it's probably not
something your customers care about so
they're not going to say oh yeah we're
going to take this organization kiss
those developers either they got I've
read their blog and I got these amazing
valued contacts
feel free to prove me wrong on that you
can call me out any time but what we
need to think about is at a higher level
so let's think about the organizational
factor so we've got this context map now
let's think about the teams that are in
the context so here you've got one team
that owns each context that's a good
thing because they own specific parts of
the domain they have knowledge and
expertise and ownership but this
organization has a few problems we've
got a lot of friction here so the case
management team they're going crazy the
V submit team on the renegotiate team
keep five
changed out them when one of those teams
adds a new form to their field it has to
be updated on the case management system
that the case management team they have
their own properties they can't keep up
and so the V submit team renegotiate
they're now being blocked by the case
management team we have an
organizational problem here and this is
where we look at our different models
the model with the case management and
the model without it and we use
organizational factors like this to
justify which is the best model so in
this case we can fix that problem by
choosing contacts that look like this
and actually these context suits are
clues much better
so think about language here when I'm
talking about V submits and not sharing
that language with case management it's
all nicely encapsulated in resubmits
same for renegotiate how about when I
want to add a text box on to a web page
while I can update the front-end and the
same team owns the full slice so they
can update the backend no dependency on
other teams now the approach we're using
here is composite applications and what
this means is are you so we don't want
to compromise the user experience that
we still have to focus on this but what
a complication means is I'm a user I'm
looking at one web page I click on a
link I go to another page the first web
page you served up by one context but
the second web page you served up by
another a lot of people think we have
all of these domains of and design api's
but monolithic web front-ends it's
really not true you're bounded contexts
can contain the UI and in most cases
they probably should where was I ah so
that leads me to why do we why do we not
have one big piece of software why do we
not have one team all working in the
same code base which is it just doesn't
scale you'd have everyone flipping over
each other blocking each other getting
in each other's way no work would get
done and that's why
to why we create boundaries in the first
place we create these boundaries so
people can have isolation and the
ability to get always lighting stuff
without being dependent so when we start
talking about bounded context and
micro-services and people start throwing
all of these different rules and
patterns at us there's only one thing we
have to really care about and that's
delivering software faster so when
you're finding boundaries that's the
only thing I think you should care about
everything else he's just trying to help
you achieve this and so what we get to
now is we start tripping into the world
of Theory of Constraints
has anyone heard of this so Theory of
Constraints is said principles that kind
of manufacturing in the 1980s and it
basically says in any organization the
limiting factor on delivering faster
there will be bottlenecks if your
organization has a bottleneck the way to
be more productive is to fix the
bottleneck if you stick something else
but the bottleneck still there
you're not going to improve anything and
so that's what we're doing with DVD
we're using might with using bounded
contexts to fix the bottlenecks and
that's what we did here we saw problems
in the organization they were
bottlenecks and we use bounded context
to remove those bottlenecks and so this
is this is my workflow this is how I do
some SLA microservices bounded context
whatever we call it I use DVD I use
those clues about language and data and
domain experts I use those clues to get
all these different ideas for models by
use Theory of Constraints to look the
bottlenecks to choose the best model and
that's how I advise you to think about
things don't just think about TDD and
bounded context as these low-level
coding patterns it goes much higher all
the way through your organization
bounded context should allow you to
deliver software more frequently
and this is where people start getting
clever and they say to me yeah this is
great we have all of these nicely
independent bounded contacts and all
these teams that are nice and all time
and less blah blah blah but that won't
work
kiss what you get you're bound to
respond how you're going to fix it and
if you have all these teams who aren't
talking to each other I never said I
never said any of that stuff your
balance we do have to change your
boundaries will always change you'll be
working on some code and you'll work out
hmm yeah this this doesn't fit into our
model online doesn't really fit these
concepts don't seem to work together
it's not it's not clean fit and you'll
realize that another team you need to
combine your model back with their model
and then break it up in a separate way
once you've added the new concepts or
you'll find out that you'll see
bottlenecks forming in your organization
you might think you've got these
beautiful clean bounded context you
spent hours crafting them and going
through all these different use cases
you're convinced that these are the best
bounded contexts in the world and you
can't do any better but if there's a
bottleneck in your organization maybe
the answer is to reshape your bounded
context to eliminate the bottleneck so
you can't just look at the code and most
clues you have to align it with
bottlenecks and I was at a talk the
other day by Matt Skelton he saying this
kind of thing so as teams going through
different stages sometimes you want
teams who do have autonomy but sometimes
you need teams working closely together
when you're exploring new parts of the
domain and so this has an impact on your
bounded contexts so let me give you an
example so one one of these examples is
your bounded context can grow and
multiplies I was going to say like a
baby but babies don't multiply do they
would that be a weird analogy can I say
that can you edit that bit out please so
anyway this is it the main I once worked
in
is about music streaming and downloading
works in this organization yet got a web
store you can buy news you can download
the etc now let us start when the
company was quite small we have this
discovery context we had a couple of
responsibilities it allows you to search
for music so you can find artists and
tracks and albums that you want to buy
and download but then when you found the
one you like you can look it up
so this context enable you to search and
look things up as the business started
to grow search became a bit more
important search became more important
that part of the system started to grow
so it split out into a search context
and a catalog context and then later the
business changed its priorities like oh
no a competitor's all have amazing
recommendations if we don't implement
recommendations and beat the other
companies will be nowhere so we had to
spit out a new context useful
recommendations so the business could
iterate on recommendations very quickly
without being slowed down by teams
working on other pieces like search and
catalogue that weren't so important so
again if something's cool to the
business it's fit if there's a specific
piece where you need to iterate quickly
that's another reason you can have
bounded contexts and team sizes then you
get to this stage where you've got
different bounded contexts different
teams own them and it can get a bit
complicated so I work at Salesforce
please don't hate me I work at
Salesforce
we've got like twenty five thousand
employees not hundreds maybe thousands
of developers quite a few salespeople as
well but they're all nice so we have
this big system
we can't it's not it's not possible for
every team to know about every single
other team it just doesn't scale so you
have to find cohesion and you have to
find out which of these contexts and
which of these teams need to work
together and you have to make easy for
them to collaborate so in this example
recommendations and search they were
involved quite closely in different use
cases but in the organization
those things didn't really interact with
payments a lot so even when you find
these bounded context and you've got
great boundaries you still need to work
out where the cohesion is to enable
collaboration between those teams think
about it like countries you've got towns
counties countries galaxies different
levels of abstraction you need to find
at each level the things that need to
work together so here's one for you I'm
going to talk about Salesforce now so I
work in the marketing cloud at
Salesforce I help people to put adverts
on the internet which is something else
you might want to hate before please
don't not the horrible ads that start
playing noise at you even ice ads anyway
we have these two contexts one is called
the management context enables you to
create advertising campaign set up a/b
tests et cetera place bid
change how much you're on a bit etc but
we also have the optimization context
this context goes out collects lots of
start
there's artificial intelligence all that
fancy stuff and it tells you yeah this
ads performing really well spend more
money here this one year it's not doing
too well forget about that kill it save
your money put the money over here we
have these two separate contexts and
these two teams who are Knight and
independent and innovating very quickly
and then one day the business came along
with a great idea we've been looking at
the numbers and we can see this market
they're spending X billion pounds a year
we think we can build an exciting
product in this area and no one else can
build these products because we're
Salesforce we have special ways to do it
we need you to build an MVP over the
next three months we're going to test
out this idea get some feedback and if
it's good well if there's more time and
energy into it which is great you want
to work with ambitious companies you
have great ideas but then it came back
to the teams and they're like well who's
going to build this MVP then because
it's got bits of management in there
it's got bits of optimization stuff in
there
ddd people keeping our clean boundaries
yep clean boundaries you're not
affecting our model I think you've got
the agile PD for all that
not one team who can intimate very
quickly can't afford to have two teams
collaborating who wins DDD or agile
who's voting for DBB who's voting for
agile to ham you're right but you're not
right because it's that's the wrong
comparison to make DVDs never been about
keeping these clean models and not
compromising that's absolutely not what
it's about
so what we did here is we said yeah it's
evasion speed is the most important
thing here we have to iterate quickly
get some feedback work out if this
product is a good idea and then we can
think about later on scaling up and
breaking it back out into separate
models but what we did do is we said
okay a couple of people from each team
you can build the MVP but these two
teams you are now using Spotify
terminology you are now a tribe so these
two teams are going to work closely
together there but that both teams are
going to understand this MVP so when it
when it does grow and it does scale
they'll have the knowledge to break it
back down into different contexts or
maybe new contexts so what they're
saying is these two teams are now going
to insulate a bit slower because they're
going to collaborate more but that's
important here because Discovery's
important we'd rather have two teams
going slowly in the right direction than
going fast in the wrong direction okay
another question for you since you
answered the last couple of questions
I'm feeling good about this one how do
you create alignment between your teams
anyone want to guess so if there's one
thing you take away from this conference
if there's one thing you go back to work
on Monday and tell your boss you need to
be doing you need to be telling them I
want to play more video games that
Nicktoons guy he told me if we play more
video games
our teams will be more aligned and we
will be more productive 100%
scientifically proven that was a good
day that was we were playing Mario Kart
having a vector n64 day pretty cool by
the way if anyone likes to run play
games I invite you to come up and join
us at the Salesforce power where we
where we play games in between the most
hard work but there are other things you
can do there are other things you can do
so show them cells is a good way so the
point here is whether you're doing
discovery or not you need to understand
how your model fits into the rest of the
system it's like we talked about these
boundaries will evolve and so you need
to understand what other teams are
working on show and tells or a really
good way to do this help so at the end
of each iteration you should try and do
a show and tell and it doesn't mean you
have to go to every other team but if
you're doing show and tells you can be
talking about your business priorities
your user research and how that's
changed your your domain model and other
teams may come to your show and tell and
realize our well we're working on
something very similar to that we should
be collaborating with this team or so
Chantelle's enable network to form and
that's how you get insights about your
boundaries needing to change it's
happened to me a few times something
else you can do is cross team pairing so
go and spend a couple of days working in
another team just pair up with a
developer work on work on their parts of
the domain and that will help you to
build up this big picture of how your
model fits into the overall picture
gives you a wider understanding all the
different pieces you can also try cross
functional pairing and this helps you to
get a deeper knowledge so go and work
with a product manager
or business analysts and understand more
about the business priorities and that
side of things and when you have all
this information about business
priorities and what other teams are
working on that allows you to think
strategically you can see across
different teams and you can suggest ways
to realign your teams and realign your
software if your teams got problems and
your models not clean and you're being
blocked by the teams if you only say
you're having problems people tend not
to listen to you if you can say look
we're having this problem we've been
blocked all the time I know this team
has this part of coding in the month I
know this team has this part of the
model in their code if we can realign
these two teams we can fix it but you
can only say that if you understand what
other teams are working on and something
else is offender storming has anyone
heard of event storming it's that thing
where you put lots of post-its on the
wall it looks really cool in the
pictures and it is actually quite cool
if you get a chance to do it so the
point with event storming is again we
want to map out as much of the system as
much of the domain as we possibly can
spanning across many or all of our teams
and when we see it all laid out we can
see optimizations we can see where our
model fits into the overall picture and
that helps us to work out when our
boundaries can be improved so with all
of this in mind I want to propose a
different way of thinking about bounded
contexts and I said something similar to
this at the main driven design Europe
and guess who came up to me after the
talk Eric Evans all right you didn't
like that did you and he went No so he
doesn't like it this isn't improved EDD
stuff this is me me freestyling it so
what I think is that bounded context
they're a proxy heuristic for autonomy
so when we're talking about language
that's used together when we're talking
about data that's used together we're
trying to create autonomy by removing
dependencies removing dependencies in
the software and removing dependencies
between teams so we can deliver software
faster
so I think of them as autonomy contexts
so what i'm trying to do here is find
things that change together for business
reasons and thinking about business
capabilities specific products or
specific parts of a product we then want
to get all of the different technical
pieces needed to deliver that capability
inside this boundary so like we were
talking about you can have UI in there
if you want to and finally its it's all
owned by a single team so this team can
innovate very quickly now we can take
new new ideas implement and quickly put
them in front of customers and get
feedback because we don't have any
dependencies and for me that's the goal
of bounded context but like I told you
it's not a big store so here's what you
probably should take away from this talk
if you don't take away the video gaining
thing if you want to be you should take
away the video gaming thing but yeah
it's Iran so to be good with DVD if you
want to create bounded contexts that are
truly useful that provides some purpose
to your organization your organization
has to be in the right shape so you you
need to be good at saying yeah I want to
connect this modeling code and I need
the organization the teams to be
structured in this way here's a quote
that says that much better than I ever
could and basically if you want to be
good if you want to create these great
models in your code if you want to be
effective with DDD if your organization
is instructed in the right way you can't
be you've lost already you have to fix
the organization first or at least work
on it so here are some things I think
you should do so experiment with models
don't think about DVD is this way of
creating a perfect model modeling the
real world forget about those things
just just use those clues and look for
different models the model with the case
management the model without the case
management etc create lots of ideas and
learn about Theory of Constraints
this is how you can justify your bounded
context you can say yeah I've got this
model it eliminates bottlenecks in an
organization we can deliver software
faster justify your choices yet so you
can live a software faster and alignment
like we were talking about you don't
really you don't really just find bound
good contacts and that set your models
perfect because your boundaries will
evolve as you learn more about the code
as business priorities change your
boundaries need to evolve so you
personally you need to have a broader
understanding of what's happening in
other teams so you know when the models
need to change so event storming cross
team pairing etc so we're almost
finished now the pain is almost over did
we find the treasure so I just want to
tell you about someone who did all this
stuff if you want to find the treasure
do what this guy did so back at the
start of my career I was working for a
lot of companies where I'm having
meetings all the time I'm not getting
any work done and I'm thinking to myself
seriously series true story I'm blinging
to myself I don't really want to work in
IT I don't really want to work in
software I mean I love coding I just
don't get to do any of it seriously
don't get to be hardly any coding always
politics and meetings driving me mad but
then I heard about this company they
were doing continuous delivery they had
open source code on github this was a
long time ago and github were just
starting and they had this cool manager
so I'm like hey can I can I work for you
and the manager was like sorry Nick if
you come back in a few months we might
have a job for you right he could see
the passion in my eyes he didn't want to
shatter my dreams right there and then
he thought if I can get rid of this kid
for a few months yeah he won't come back
but I didn't take his hint and I did
come back in a few months and I hey can
I can I work for you now and he's like
oh no he's came back he getting back
what do I do now is like Nick can you
come back in a few more months I'm like
what about if I have an interview now
and then when you are hiring I can work
for you he's like oh he
so awkward he couldn't you didn't want
to like keep I'm like a little puppy
looking at him he's like I can't shut up
his boys dreams
she's got okay you can have an interview
Nick so I had an interview first stage
and I passed and I had a second stage
interview and I passed and suddenly he's
like oh Nick when can you start suddenly
he had a job for me straight there and
then but that's not the story basically
when I started working at this company
on my first day I paired up with the
senior engineer we wrote some code after
lunch we had a glass of orange juice we
clicked a button and we deployed that
code into production Wow
I wrote code and I deployed in one day
no meetings their house was none of that
rubbish stuff and like six months later
I'm doing this every day I'm just
thinking to myself it's unbelievable
like no other company they're like years
and years behind this and so I starting
asking people how did you how did we get
to be this good how did you make things
like this and some people were just like
I've been here a year I'm still still
trying to get used to it myself it's
unbelievable but one person said to me
oh yeah yeah was the manager he started
here was a developer about a few years
ago he started talking about this DVD
stuff and serious constraint stuff and
we started doing it we started reshaping
our boundaries and reorganizing our
teams and that's how we got here I'm
like wow and that's when I started going
DVD in theory of constraints mad
learning about all those things but that
manager he is now true story hundred
percent true story that manager he is
now the head of technology a huge
organization and then got businesses in
different industries and he started out
by applying this stuff and just fixing
his organization and all of you have
that opportunity so I think that's the
treasure you should be looking for used
EDD and use bounded context to transform
your organization not just to create
pretty models in your code and you can
just remember one thing
the art of discovering bounded context
like reading lesson at school the arts
of discovering bounded context is the
art of aligning organizational technical
boundaries quotes ever cavernous doesn't
this we're finished thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
