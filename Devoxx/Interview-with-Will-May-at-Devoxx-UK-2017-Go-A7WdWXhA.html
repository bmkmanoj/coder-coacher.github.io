devoxx UK I'm with will mate he's talked
about monolith to microservices which is
something that we all love hearing about
and I think everybody's probably got at
least one was war story where they've
been desperately trying to move from
something huge and archaic to the kind
of goal state and do you think it always
produces the desired outcome if you
decide on a project right I'm going to
move from my monolith to mike reservist
is it sometimes dis aspirational but
actually it doesn't quite work out um
well I think whenever you have such a
big project it is always a danger that
either you'll get halfway through and
then simply stop or you will simply get
an end with a massive ball of mud clods
you need to be careful when you try and
break up an anomaly
I mean even so the Twitter had to have
mana royalty I think they still got some
of that monorail around somewhere and
they connect architecture so you've
probably never ever get rid of still
modernist but yeah I do is try and
shrink it down to a more manageable size
apparently there's nothing wrong with
the monitor I mean people do have
monoliths in their architecture and it's
their blog fun with it you need to make
sure you're not going to micro service
simply because it's a new buzzword and
you just make sure you're you're going
to that because it's going to use it for
you yeah any neon are doing it because
you feel like you should because yeah
just because it's cool and if I was
talking about sizing I just like you
should be doing anything containers and
because everyone tells you you should go
into containers yeah
Nick looks they just use a my images
yeah each server has its own instance
and that's it I mean can easily argue
that you can save lots of money both
shrinking down the size of each server
so it's only been in small container and
you have much bigger instances there on
save money that way but
it depends on what works for you yeah
what's the most important thing that
you've learned in your approach when
you're thinking when you're going from
the Molitor motor services what are the
steps that you take do you plan out do
you start by drawing diagrams and
planning everything out or do you just
say okay first order to move this chunk
and what well you know the sticks are
one too many so you're getting a first
microservice yeah it's difficult then
going to get your second one you just
start worrying about how do I talk and
then way to get menus are happening to
the whole coordination business is
getting of solicitors get one like
reserves out yeah that's the key that'd
be the first tickle point the general I
would say get between really good
practice go to hold BDD of BDD approach
term name basically try and have your
micro-service focus on a single big
single coherent item of your application
so actually I guess party yesterday
we're talking about the distributions
actions
yeah and so you shouldn't have you have
to worry about having distributions
action course and go mini market
services because that means that those
marketers actually talking about the
same thing yeah so this will be really a
coherence area of your of your
application such as payment maybe yeah
or delivery that's a key start or maybe
another one will be simply trying to
provide a same API in front of some ugly
third party yeah API they can strangle
the Gallinas
yeah cool yes I see that with start with
your first micro service which we very
difficult and then
so presumably you have it where it's
very difficult it gets bit easier and
then suddenly gets difficult again
because you have you go from having a
few micro sensors too many and then you
have to think about the data separation
and yeah and then deal also
orchestration fortunately now and when
we did the normal high streets and there
we helped them to move to a more modular
service architecture and we did that
there's only you have may sauce has only
real option yeah talk to you kubernetes
you know what they still well it make
sense it's still very confidence the
software the bunch of communities is
that you have a lot of stuff built in is
easy to get all the bits rolling
together yes so that's generally it's
only where the industry seems to focus
on having proven it is actually manage
your micro services where again it's
make it do it makes it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
