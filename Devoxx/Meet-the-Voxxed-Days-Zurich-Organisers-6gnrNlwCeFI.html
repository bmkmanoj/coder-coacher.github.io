so I'm here at Volquez Erick and it's
the 23rd of februari 2017 it's around
6pm which means only one thing it's the
end of the event and Jewish yeah so
Federico chalice Tino organizers of box
days here in Zurich and also in Ticino
and instigators of Fox asian CERN I mean
like you're wearing it I'll on the teeth
of those um just doing the three boxed
events in Switzerland that mean I know
you're slightly crazy but hey um so has
it gone come on talk to me about today
went great it has been a great day we
had 394 of these 390 know them coming
from Indonesia drink that the royal
family unbelievable is you guys were
kind of worried that they'd find up for
a roll call yeah by the speaker for
Singapore more sense yeah does confirm
everybody they want a compass in an IT
contest and with the three people in
Europe for four days in the decided to
send one day in this communist fan and
they paid the ticket themselves so it's
amazing we are really proud of them and
we really want to thank them thank you
again and beside that the contractors
being great a lot of sweet people local
people a lot of seed companies
supporting the event so yeah that's
something I wanted to say actually
because when I look for a Miss from the
whole hair yeah it all switch companies
I mean I my red hair in the resort but
it's driven by the Red Hat so you like
go to original post office yeah and so
it really feels like you're managing to
create these bombs between the
developers here in Switzerland and the
companies that are based here as well
and I think you need to be congratulated
for that because they're really
supporting you yes i'm importing the
developer community here as a result we
really want to thank all the sponsors
because of this they plastered two crazy
guys and i think we are giving them more
or less what they expect so they are
happy about that and they want to
continue to sponsor us so that's the
first feedback we are hearing today and
we are very proud of that
I mean cheers to that dimension less
cheerfulness with companies in the ite I
mean we have really big expertise in
Switzerland a lot of investment United a
factor and for us the main goal was to
show these to the world war we are now
having a quite you very good she's
pretty that's also one of the goals
somebody started last year with the
freaky and busier got a 50 minute talk
and they are getting very high balls by
Japanese so we're very proud of the fish
mass of our conferences but never from
where it says swiss-made or later or one
of the faces of merchandise I know you
you're really really proud of that and
you know long may it continue so talk to
me about what's next so this has been
great I know you need to sleep yeah yeah
totally totally packed with one hour
last night although hours last night
after you slept and calm down a little
bit you've got Fox ice casino in three
months come on yeah it was less than
three Molesley everyone's well a little
bit late they think in the organization
but and we already have a lot of support
also there we already have sponsors lock
up on source also there and we received
a lot of proposal good proposal from Ray
on the community for them but for
serious trouble processing where it is
sold out all our blind book tickets and
such as 1000 amazing because it's the
third year there now so people really
know that you're there for an constantly
editing and so for those that don't know
and might be interested in coming to a
developer event in Switzerland what's
the difference between cochino and Fox a
Zurich and why is why you have to
eventually just combining them all into
one so if you know we are focusing more
on on the local community so we we grant
at least ask content you need to be in
Italian okay so that that that's our
value in teaching and and in Jewish
instead we do an international more
international conference and
it's completely in English or the total
in English and yeah in both cases we are
involving all the local communities to
build the demon to have a lot of people
love us in the in our symptoms to build
the structure and build networks to know
each other to share the knowledge each
other and to maybe find me opportunity
for your job for getting new ideas to
try at work you know we have many
companies doing the 5th team event by
conference that's great it's something
amazing they take that the boss really
pay the ticket as a gift for the team
and motivate the team to come on a
Saturday the undercover it's amazing
it's something really in this happening
every year and they are all LP at all
and it's important that people know as
well a little bit about your background
because you guys work with respect yeah
both for whole time eighty percent okay
yeah four days per week there are plenty
person for the rest of the pre time it's
been organizing to develop a
concentration but you don't stop there
either because you I so for this event I
know you created a check-in registration
app which is all open source so we don't
belong to Carlos we can be for other
people to use as well and you tied it
into alpha 0 which is a ticketing system
for events where yes yeah I know works
really really well and you tried all of
these things together so do you ever
stop I mean I don't know no but you're
doing all of this so that not just so
that these events run so smoothly like
they do now but you're open sourcing
everything so you can make it to that so
that other people can also benefit all
right already people using already let's
change to conferences using now for you
rough day yeah they they are happy with
that and they were they are helping us
in finding boxing and they are open as
we knew
with develop and also and that's that's
great yeah i think if yes that Dutch
goal yeah it has to be a win-win
situation and this is a key way to give
back to the other has provided us
example the cultural paper application
or yeah baby mobile application for a
schedule and there we got that for free
we have been able to improve a little
bit sometimes and we're giving back
obviously direct by developer energy a
lot of passion a lot of times but after
a day like this I think you are full of
energy we can get just go on for another
year for sure yeah but we have different
interests yeah we're not gonna hold you
to that yeah okay because I love coming
to Switzerland and coming to your values
because of you guys but also because of
the people that you have following you
yeah from amazing program committee or
and mario i know is leading the efforts
there but there's a whole heap of people
under the under the surface you don't
generally get that much recognition
apart from flashed up on on the screen
and if you see them on the website and
all of the volunteers the only half as
well I mean and they feel they all take
their lead from how committed you are so
imma say again congratulations thank you
very moment you know I feel like each
year I keep sitting here or in one of
the other events and I keep talking to
you and they keep getting better and you
keep getting greyer well done thank you
take a break we'll come back strong and
where I fear into sino por sure thank
you very much thanks froggies cheers to
