national laboratory and i'm here to talk
to you today about the eclipse advanced
civilization project which is an eclipse
foundation science working group project
for a site integrating scientific
visualization software angel collapse
work benches so let's talk about eclipse
a little bit they were probably already
familiar but it's an ide one of the most
popular ones in the world it is based on
osgi for providing services and packages
and yeah this is important for extending
in eclipse with what leads to the idea
of the Reds client platform which is
nearing the eclipses toe base to create
your own custom for expensive and in our
case we wanted to create a scientific
work flow and we might think well why
would you give a clip for scientific
workflow management well Vic when the
scientific workflow can go some
everywhere from writing code to running
simulations to pulling back and
visualizing and analyzing the data and
that's where Eclipse really comes in
because with eclipse you can you be more
oh that's still readable but ok sorry oh
thanks thanks Ella with a silent with
scientific work flow then what we did
was we created the integrated
computational environment I switch of an
eclipse RCP and what you Vinay few could
do a new eclipse of programming ide to
write your code then you can create a
model builder that one you have a
graphical interface out could create and
verify your
input model file and then you could also
create a job l'enfer with what launched
the program you wrote and using the
multiple file you created and there
could be either on your own machine or
remotely and then finally once we have
done you could pull back all of the data
and you could analyze and visualize it
but if you think about it that isn't
really the only reason you would ever
want to have a little elevation inside
of an Eclipse workbench so what we did
was we took all of the villa laid live
Basin codes from with a knife and we
fund that off into its own science
working group project cow ADP and that
if what had the history of exactly what
motivated this so a little bit about the
architecture of lip yeah I'm not aware
of anything that would help details my
head that would break if you used it in
or Phoebe 3 I don't think I've ever
tried it but yeah so basically
everything type of visualization that we
offer is excellent as its own bundle
within ofg I or a hierarchy of bundles
if you have more than one implementation
of it and they each one contains a bit i
vs service which is an RFP I serve the
second if consumed you can also review
via collapse extension point and
basically the rcv app will select these
a lot of asian you want from within the
ones offered by EVP and then we also
have a way to configure it food
preferences menu if that's necessary so
going through what we have in the repeat
our most basic case would be too deep
lying for graph
basically you've done something you have
some data you want to see a graph of it
so we use a exploit YZ plot for the
implementation basically we take in a
CSV or a DAT file we will automatically
try to detect the delimiter and then we
will plot at ma graph and put that into
the equipment so this might be so we'll
have a variety of control you could for
example such things what series are
being plotted what's being plotted only
the axes the colors resuming taking
screenshots this kind of thing and we
also have in another tab the text file
itself but we're in case you want to
edit or just create a text file from a
data file from scratch so here is a
screenshot of that working in ice and as
you can see we've got the product via
file we're opening and they say basic
dress there but a little bit more
interesting if a visit or a peer review
these are third for our party programs
are really kind of state-of-the-art I
believe paraview ative that have the
world record for the largest scientific
visualization they're both open force
the pivot is out of warranty little more
and national laboratory pair of you with
from kitware and as I said they're very
both very robust various event they work
on in a VC environments and can cover a
very large number of a case of a level
of a small sample of the yellow types so
if the or third-party software you
didn't forgot integrated into easy p you
have to download them separately but how
we don't necessarily require that we be
on the computer you're trying to
visualize on you may want to run your
gov elevation on a remote machine such
as an HP CDs mostly
viewer and in that case you can set up
your connection to a remote or you're a
local instant so you've been basically
when you have once you have that set up
and then you've given it be POV ever may
be needed to open the program what it
does is when you try you Axl said it
will launch that connection open
reprogram and then love run in the
background and you would have a back end
so what when you try to open a file it
will pass we file along through the
connection to the third party program
and then the program will create well
create a mobilization abnormal for it
and love pump the Pixlr back to ice so
that it can be put into a boutique
apposite and we use the mouth motioned
to do things such as controlling the
camera just as we would if you were
using any of these natively and then we
also really an offer some UI pieces to I
can have a more full control so for
example you might reset cameras things
like opening a pair of you web developer
in case you want to spawn one of those
you can end with an AP yeah create the
web the whole life or and then look at
it within a travel with a knife or you
can use whatever your browser of choice
is outside of the clips if you like
another thing we do here is vivid to
have a very group of Python scripting
engine that allows you to have a great
deal of control over the model that
you're visualizing and basically what we
will do if we have a button that it will
prob open a cell and within that you can
left type in whatever script you want
loaded from a file and then let's send
that directly to the vivid instant
so here we have a pair of you in
visiting within eclipse on the Left we
have a will open in pair of you and I'll
be right a battery in a heating
simulation within visit so find the
third kind of a category here is we
don't just want a you third party
program we won't be able to offer our
own bubble evasion for custom new faces
so we turn to javafx which have a basic
3d rendering engine within it at this
event really professional like bleeding
edge with kind of thing but it is
sufficient for our needs because we
aren't doing some kind of video game
here we have some scientific data and we
just want to assign a tea jacket or if
you look at it to detect you know we're
irregularity or to further the domain
scientists can see exactly with the
output of their simulation lines up with
a lot they were expecting so we use EFX
clips to integrated within eclipse
basically we have an FX campus that will
transform all new ver interactions over
to the gel vaccine that is displayed
within the fw t candice and that will
allow the basically complete control
over it FS you were guided and within a
javafx native program you can do picking
camera control that kind of thing like
so we have two different method eaters a
with in rolla 3d editors within a BP the
further they both have only javafx
implementations at the moment but we
have it so that the rendering engine is
able to be easily swap out so that in
the future we can have other and women
so the first of these is the mess editor
this is for a 2d mess editing so our you
mainly of cases for next slide Salvin of
lower dynamics simulation and that
importance a lot of what we have right
now in it even basically love you mouse
clicks to create your mess and then you
can drip click and drag we mess around
to edit it or within the Eclipse
properties view you can do things such
as set out exact coordinates for your
points and also you can have properties
around edges point or polygons and right
now as I said these were mostly the
apartment these were mostly devoted to
fluid dynamics boundary conditions but
in the future that can we'll be able to
have arbitrary amount of arbitrary can
doesn't own any of them and here is a
screenshot of being map editor in action
you can see the blue highlighted
polygons you can see the grid and at the
bottom here you can see some of our
conditions for the fluid dynamics
problem these are all edible editable
and then our second case is the geometry
editor which with 3d mapping so with you
with constructive solid geometry in
order to have a multiple shapes on the
screen at once it does the CFE function
event terribly complex but it mostly so
the our main use case is visualizing
files so in that case we have a variety
of file supported each of these is done
through a domain-specific language
written with X text and these also gives
provided to the geometry editor through
extension points that makes it very easy
to add new file types to it as the need
arises
you love to create your dsl in XX un to
implement a simple service and that
basically put in so the mouse to give
you to control the camera and for
picking with lava you can see a safe
property than the property view and a
safe can have a variety of properties
based on the scientific data associated
with them and also with the graphics so
we can also edit the mess in real time
so if you want 2k view the explicit
method of every point on every triangle
you can do that and change that while
you're looking at your file we also
provide a variety of decorators for each
shape and the data factors that we have
written for the geometry so for example
here you can see a slot machine the role
in row a reading from a single file so
that is why it is automatically created
a vacant composition of each individual
safe from with any file and you can see
you hell you can you change the center
to move them about the space and you
also can see the UI decorators so in
this case you can have covered scale and
here we have set the entire thing to
display of wire frame and each of these
can be toggled on or off so that how you
go down the hierarchy you can decide
which piece is in control of the display
so in here we have the entire thing set
to wireframe if we wanted we could turn
that off and set each individual piece
to wireframe to solid or etc and here is
a look at what it things look like in
solid mode we've got a drill bit a clamp
and then everything all in these
seen so how do you actually you leave
you have you know basically take the
file year data you want two different
life and you get the IV service that you
want and each ivf service publishes a
list of data type of a file types that
it can handle you basically finally one
you want and then you pass it is the
file to me creates can't canvas or
create plot method the difference here
is that create canvas is more for
meditative that where you're actually
creating or modifying the data where it
says that says the mediterranean tree
editor the create plus creates an i plot
which is more for a visit pair of you
things where you're the variable revolve
it purely to looking at the data and
then you just draw it at to a an
arbitrary composite and you have your
realization right there ready to go so
and then we also have the Preferences
menu wearing we can set up the
connections to our third party program
we can support both local and remote
connections we make use of the parallel
tool platform to inform a lot of our
connection properties so for example if
you set up a PPP connection to a remote
machine do lots a simulation and then
later you want to do a bull racing of
that day of the decade you've got from
it you don't have to go through and set
up at the same connection place you can
take most of what you need from ptb
three so you can also have the set to
connect automatically on startup if
you're going to be using this word meant
to work the less kind of elation over
and over again so here is a screenshot
of our primitive menu you would see how
will you get the connection you want to
fight on the port you want for the
connection
and point it to the program you want to
lunch and you want to that you're ready
to fizzle rise so the variable you want
to go in the future one of our main
goals as we look at what else can we put
this in can we put this na we've gotten
us working in fw t composites could we
put this in swing could we put it up on
the web through a javascript can we put
this into a bad end window and we also
want to look into creating additional
implementations right now java taxes
kind of limited we usually have a aj
monkey invent implementation of these we
went into ice oh and do a club's
foundation IP a few there but we would
like to offer is that in a marketplace
of any other option again in the future
we are also looking at an institute with
motivation the idea there is that you
don't necessarily want to wait until
your simulation of complete before you
can see some data if there's something
wrong you want to be able to catch that
as quickly as possible so that you don't
waste your time sentencing else a
simulation if you could look at it and
say ten percent down and say oh no wait
something's gone wrong here let's back
off and stop wasting our billing time um
you know type so we're looking into
using audio QA do that we also want to
do some volumetric mass editing so right
now we have the 2d mess editor it would
be nice if we could use that if we could
extend that into a li third dimension so
that we could have methods that have
volumes and sort of just polygons and
the use case there is we would like to
instead of just having our fluid
dynamics problems we're in the future we
would like to be able to you know extend
that to a finite element support so that
any finite element problem can be
expressed and a viewed in a BP so just
if anything
here we have the product page we've got
a repo we are open fourth of course and
I got a small tutorial and for dust for
a beginner who wants to be with a new 2e
2f GI and wants to see what the hell it
was the correct way to set up a service
of to get that into their program and
your way expedite the process of getting
the service working all right so I now
I'm going to now open to the subscale
present anybody okay then as thank you
