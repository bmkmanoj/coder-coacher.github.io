thank you very much I think I'm live can
you hear me on the back
splendid you know that's one of my
favorite chat-up lines was opposite if
you said I had a beautiful body well you
know some years ago maybe anyway I'm not
Jose Oliveira I'm actually am BYO Jose's
boss because Jose is otherwise engaged
today but I'm just going to give you a
very very quick Whistlestop tour of the
perfecto platform and how you can use
perfecto to actually debug your code so
I'm showing you here Android studio but
equally we can work with with them with
the Xcode IDE as well and I asked taps
so what you can see on the screen right
now is a digital video stream taken from
a real physical device so we don't work
with emulators at perfecter these are
real devices and I've just basically
taken the stream out of the actual skin
the skins there to make it look like the
device you're actually testing on so
this device is to say it's in the cloud
in this case it happens to physically be
located whoops
put them on there I brought my own Wi-Fi
with me as well because the one who's a
bit over subscribed and I've got my own
this device here you know it ham
strategically located it just on the
outskirts of London at staples corner
and for example if I was for example I
would just launch I'm just going to show
a couple of things in here so for
example was to launch Google Maps
because this is a real device it's not
rooted it's not jailbroken it can
actually show you the location wait
actually thinks it is so it's telling me
there that actually it's close to bank
cross which is which is physically
correct and we've got a few little
widgets and stuff that you can play with
like for example the image injection so
I can pretend that I'm actually in oh I
don't know let's pretend that wouldn't
Berlin Germany so this goes away under
the covers to Google talks to Google
gets the GPS coordinates and injects
into the device and then we should see
they go we know things were in Berlin so
all these facilities are available to
you if you're writing a Geo sensitive
app you can test in this particular
environment so you don't actually have
to jump on updates much nicer to travel
to Berlin and do it locally but your
company funds might not actually stretch
that far
so we've got lots of banks lots of
insurance covers lots of trouble come
business customers and they use this
facility quite heavily anyway I'm here
to do a sales pitch on perfecto as I
said this is this is a real device so
what would you want to do if you're
actually writing the code for your app
in the IDE so I've got a very simple
calculator app here inside of of the IDE
in it literally what I'm going to do
there's the code here I'm going to
upload the up and show you it running
with with the debug point so it's going
to launch the calculator I'm going to
click on one and then I'll step through
the code to be able to show you the
actual digit appearing on the screen
there now for this to actually work I
need to create a link to that device so
right now yes I can control it and I can
I can run things like selenium and
appium automation against this
particular device but for me to actually
use it from Android studio I would need
it to be locally connected so if I was
to type in ADB devices you can see there
that there are no devices attached okay
so three to actually remedy that we need
meteors this thing here called dev
tunnel so what this is doing is punching
out a connection from my machine here to
the devices in the cloud so if you're
inside the company network and it's
highly secure for example lots there we
go that's all serving at running
fantastic don't you just love live demos
it's because I've been bringing you up
and down on line in probably just
retries out to see if that's going to
work so you can actually put the because
you're pointing out from the network
you're secure boom scuse me your
security architects sorry got
myself they'll be less bothered about
that okay now if you're working in a
situation where your app needs to talk
to a secure internal server inside of
you on that work then what we can do we
can basically create a VPN and IPSec VPN
sanal between our private cloud
dedicated just to you and your customer
account and into your company network so
we do this all the time for our large
customers and where you can see here
that I've actually got this tunnel
established so for now - ADB devices you
can see that I've got this device ID
connected
- nine - blade six so if I actually
compare that with the information which
I've got here I don't know if you can
see that at the back there well it
starts 9 - blade 6 so it's the same
device ID so now it's like having if you
like in this case a 30-30 mile-long USB
cable but equally I could have in this
cloud I could have opened the device in
Sydney Australia and that would have
been an unfeasible like thirteen
thousand mile long USB cable and so that
that's that that's how this works the
advantage of doing this in the cloud of
course is that you've got a much wider
choice of variety of variety of devices
available to you okay so I'm going to
now upload this device assault blood the
app and put into debug pods I'm going to
click on debug and you can see that I've
actually got the device there in the
list of connected devices and then I
click on OK so what it's doing now it's
doing the Gradle build and then it's
installing the apk file onto the device
and it's launching the app in debug mode
so it's exactly the same as you will be
doing this if you were working in an
emulator so some of you if you guys are
all experienced Android developers iOS
developers you might be thinking well
why don't I just carry on working in the
emulator and the answer to that question
is you absolutely should carry on using
emulators because that's where you're
going to be that's when your fastest you
know you want to work with a particular
device you want to make sure you can't
give you code out everything's local to
machine these can work really quickly
but we all know that apps behave very
differently in the wild on real devices
and they do on emulators there's a
different chipset for one thing so the
advantage of this is that you can work
in your emulators get to a point where
you really want to you know think okay
I'm ready to push this out to the wild
and then you can come and test this on
several different devices maybe in
several different locations if it's
enough if it's easier to do it that way
so I've got this app launched and we
just zoom so we can see more of the
device there so what I'm going to do
right now is I've said I've got the
debug breakpoint set there when I click
the number one key so they click number
one you can see there this is sponsor
life and now we've hit the breakpoint so
I don't propose to walk you through the
ins and outs of the Android studio
debugger at this
I'm basically just going to step through
the code just just while I'm then notice
we can see the number one appearing in
the logic there so like my I'm just
doing that there are there any questions
from what I've shown you so far because
I need to click OK about a thousand
times talk amongst yourselves I need to
work out a slightly different path
through this logic so I do last clicks
and in a moment I'll do something very
similar on the the iOS platform yeah far
away
no no yes perfecto provides we've got 14
data centers scattered around the world
and we've got them we've got about 5,000
devices give or take around the world
that we currently have under test for
our enterprise customers and we have a
much more modest public cloud which has
about 150 devices in it and so yeah
right now this physical device is on the
screen right now is in London or the
outskirts of London although again I can
show you one in Sydney you know at the
end of the day everybody thinks that
you're looking at an emulator but you're
really not it's a digital video
streaming that's taken from the device
my last click so you can see the number
one appearing in the in the IDE there so
so this year so this gives you this
large variety of devices to connect into
so I'm just going to disconnect that
tunnel from there now if you wanted to
do for example an espresso test I've got
a different one well basically we've got
this rule on clouds so I could just do
the same sort of thing that mania dark
cloth clips on that so you don't need to
have the decimal connected to do that
so essentially what that's done it's
built a non debug version this is the
same app and it's pushed it up to the
clouds it's runny so the advantage of
this I can actually open a second device
so that we just find a tablet here in
the UK so we've got a where are we now
Galaxy Tab there we go
so this is literally the run on Clyde is
just taking the AP cane it's pushing it
up so that it's a ton of the devices
first we're finished with this gas let
me just close it now okay so I've opened
a different device this is a tablet so
get if I if I click on one cloud again
it's taking the same source code the
same UI design building it and pushing
it up and installing it to this
particular device so any second now
there it is large and you can see this
is one of the real good values of this
particular one one cloud feature because
this is an app that clearly has not been
designed for a tablet you know that
layout is truly awful but that's the
point you you might have done a great
job designing UI that works on on a
smartphone profile but as soon as you
get it to a tablet profile it's not
going to work so what your difference is
you can have a different app are you
going to try and find a happy medium
that works on all the different device
profiles and this tells you that very
quickly okay yeah you can do it on
emulators again but again you've got the
student large variety devices available
to you and excited to be able to do that
sort of test so that's the run on cloud
capability and the sage just just to
prove all those bases because I've got
five minutes left so here we are in the
Xcode IDE let's just minimize Android
studio just to get the nose out of the
way so here we are inside of Xcode if I
click on window devices you can see
they're got I've got no locally
connected devices so I know what I'm
going to do I'm going to come over here
to our web IDE we've not yet got a
plug-in for Xcode it's coming shortly
but I'm going to open mine my trusty
iPhone 7 just takes a moment to open
okay so what I can now do I do the same
thing again I can launch the death
tunnel so this is the same piece of
software so like just take a few few
seconds again just to initiate that
connection but though you're there's a
session connected so now if I come out
of there and go back into it again
hopefully I will see the same stereos
just appeared
being impatient with it so that's the
device that I can now interact with so
again it's like a local each other
device and those of you that are well
used to using getting the Xcode IDE for
locally to the device you can do that
everything exactly the same way that you
can as though you have a real device
literally plugged into the USB cable
here so I've got a very simple up here
and I'm simply going to do the same
thing again so I've just hit the play
button and I'm going to flip back over
here so we can see it being launched on
that device just rearrange my screen as
well that's doing now so this is
basically building the IPA file and it's
installing the API file so the IPA file
and it will then as I say launch in this
particular device
I'm not going to debug this particular
app you've seen me do it once so a
debugger is a debugger so I'll just
leave that for a moment just for it to
to isolate and there is launching so one
of the really nice things here is that
we aren't dependent upon third path
ecosystems to enable us to be able to to
to stage our devices see to test on them
before the release of a particular
operating system version so by that for
example we're going to have iOS 11
devices in our cloud probably late June
early July if it's the last two releases
or anything to go by so we're not
actually dependent upon likely the
appium ecosystem or anything like that
to be able to support this because we've
got our own platform connectivity fear
that abstracts away if you like the
device automation from any front-end
automation that you want to work with it
so that's that's a really nice feature
our actually the processes well we've
got a mixture of UI automation and XE
test automation right now we're going to
go to pure-play exceed test automation
they're coming few releases so so that's
the the run on device on the on the
xcode side of things so i've got three
minutes left which is fine i've showed
you over to show you so i'll open the
floor for questions
absolutely yeah
so I don't if you heard that at the back
but the question was can we actually do
anything with a screen orientation so we
can absolutely do that so if I just
click on rotate device there is the
device rotated I mean they go on the out
rotates as well so so then you give me
come interact so for example if I wanted
to enter a meal so this was basically a
free tutorial I found on the internet
for coding in Xcode so I could I could
be if I wanted for wanted pizza for
example I could just use my keyboard
there and then I can use the actual text
injection capabilities to inject that
text you don't actually have to use the
pop-up virtual keyboard so the returns
like for example pin notification pin
entry for mobile banking apps frequently
use a custom keyboard so text injection
won't work for that quite rightly
because it's a security issue so there
are times you need to interact with the
objects for the actual digits to do that
sort of thing but we can work with
custom keyboards quite happily any other
questions so you're all in shadow
because I'm being so gentleman over
there only one because these are real
physical devices you know so you
wouldn't share your own phone with
somebody else at the same time because
they're not designed to do that so it's
just a single connection okay there's a
question at the back oh absolutely
absolutely yes so that's the other part
that the platform so we support desktop
web browser testing but we also support
 like an open URL let me go I don't
know why not go to google because
everybody goes to Google some people
calm so here I'm on an iPhone it's
actually going to launch the Safari
browser and it's going to take me to
when to to Google calm as a Sam I'm a
local Wi-Fi hotspot so and in fact it
might just because I've got the dev sort
of connection I've never done that with
the desktop connection
active before but what I'm going to do
yeah husband a severe we are gone to
Google it's actually defaulted to Google
cada UK and my times now up so any last
questions before we finish if not please
come find me down at the protect our
base and thank you very much for your
attention at lunchtime and see</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
