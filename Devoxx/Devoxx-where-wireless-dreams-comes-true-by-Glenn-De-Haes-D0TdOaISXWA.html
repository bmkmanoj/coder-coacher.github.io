this session on the wireless network
here deployed at devoxx thank you for
showing interest in what we actually try
to do for you because we do understand
that your user experience on the Wi-Fi
at an event like this is really
important and we also know that people
think about Wireless as something very
easy because how difficult can it be to
deploy a network that has no wires in it
can I ask who of you has deployed their
own Wi-Fi at home everyone who of you
has had or experienced issues with the
Wi-Fi at home all of you obviously we
encountered the same stuff as you do at
home over here you have difficulties
with your neighbors with conflicting
channels interference the same applies
for us so if you look at the
installation here we have to take into
account about 58 rogue access points
that are surrounding us and they are
still counting because everyone tries to
make their own Wi-Fi or sets up their
own access point sponsors come in
immediately start building their own
wireless network so they all are
conflicting with us and we try still to
give all of you the best possible
experience in order to do this we have
used about 800 meters of fiber cable we
have about 4,500 meters of UTP cable
there are 250 x sports on about 20
switches and we deployed about 47 access
points in all of these rooms which you
can see mounted against the addresses
and in front of some rooms so the
placement of the aps is not ideal but as
with everything about a temporary
conference in any temporary setup we all
live with what we can do there are a lot
of trade-offs we have to make wireless
is all about making trade-offs
so we have to disable some 2.4 giggles
we have to live with that but bad ap
placement not really centered to you
next to the APS in the next room so it's
all not that I deal in terms of the
incoming internet connection we have
about 500 gigabits available for you
both upstream and downstream the system
setup is actually quite simple we have
the internet feed coming in right into
the Barracuda f400 firewall which
basically doesn't block anything so we
try to give you a most seamless
experience as we can give this is
divided over the switches going to two
controllers with then the little less
than 50 Meru now 40 net access points
deployed and if we have a quick look at
the numbers of the system up to today
the maximum amount of simultaneous uses
we have had on the network was well
slightly over 2600 knowing that there
are about 3,500 people min average in
these rooms that's in fact quite a lot
because this is really instantaneous if
you look at the number of unique station
so that means the unique MAC addresses
that we see on the network then just for
today that was slightly less than 4,000
so that means that since you are with
3,500 more than one device is being used
but person quite obviously today if you
look at the numbers from Monday to
Thursday you see that we have seen more
than or nearly 8,000 clients on the
network and their capabilities also
differ quite a lot the numbers are
brothers low on say 11g and 11 a
unfortunately the number of AC stations
is also still quite low but you see that
the majority is on 11 n about two point
four and five gig and that's what the
graphs next to it show as well which is
the number of stations per channel and
then the amount of channel utilization
by all of those stations and quite
locally and that's also the
aim of the setup this is all well
divided so you can see there are three
channels in 2.4 it's well divide at the
station count per channel and also the
airtime utilization per channel is
really well divided into one third for
every channel meaning that roughly you
guys are using the deployed equipment up
to the maximum which is also in fact
really the case because just today
around believed was 1250 we got five
alarms stating that some radios were
five or six radios who really up to the
maximum of 128 uses the radio obviously
the radios can go higher but this is the
limit that we say go to the inside the
system to really advert and make sure
that we pay attention to the fact that
you guys are just with too many people
on one a B and that's actually the first
time that has has happened we have been
using this setup with roughly the same
numbers since 2010 so this is the sixth
year that boat multi-cap and tiger works
are supporting their vox in deploying
this wireless equipment and up to now
the diploids system has always held
strong but you do really see the
evolution coming from about 1500 to 1700
simultaneous users back in 2010 now up
to 2,600 seven hundred users save it in
a time frame of 10 seconds that is
really connected to the system if you
want to see more numbers the big
bandwidth that you guys consumed was a
little less than 400 megabits so the 500
megabits pipe is still sufficient we can
upgrade it to 1 gigabit if needed so
come on and do your best the volume that
we that you guys produced from Monday
through Wednesday was slightly over 2
terabytes of download traffic and well
over seven hundred fifty gigabytes
upload which is rather ok concert
considering the amount of people we have
and if we have a look at what you guys
are actually doing
this is a screenshot of an instantaneous
system then we see that most of you in
in terms of volume produce most of
YouTube volume and iTunes which is
operating in the background etc but
other than that Google services amazon
web services twitter facebook and
spotify so the actually the usual
suspects good thing that we see is also
throughout those six years that we have
seen that we went from about forty to
sixty percent division between unsecured
and secured traffic that we are now
almost completely up to one hundred
percent ssl encrypted traffic so that's
definitely a good thing and rather than
boring you to death with all of these
things i want to show you some some
stuff in in reality so this is a for
instance the interface of the controller
but that shows only say daytime data
rather than over the entire week if we
have a look at the easier if network
manager we can look back in time and we
can see the actual division of clients
over the last couple of days where you
see that we had the biggest peak
yesterday this is room eight for
instance which is the big room on the
other side like about 700 people can sit
and you see that yesterday we had a peak
of 664 clients connected to the network
which basically means that nobody
listened to the talk and everybody was
looking at their iphone or whatever so
obviously we can we can use this to also
see what you guys are doing so from from
the trend perspective for instance we
could see how people would go from one
room to the other if we see drops in one
controller going to the other means that
a lot of people change rooms because
they are divided from one side to the
other side of the room
at the same time we obviously see how
much you guys use and produce so free
quickly select back again the conference
you see the last two days that it's
quite a vast amount of people connecting
and not really disconnecting anymore
whereas most smartphones actually
connect and disconnect automatically so
that means you guys are continuously
checking your phones or you're
continuously doing something for work on
your laptop obviously as set the the
bandwidth used is about 370 376 megabits
so so some room there if we look at the
division of the stations this is
obviously instantaneously now taken from
the entire conference we see that well i
would say about sixty sixty-five percent
of our clients is connected on on five
gigahertz which is obviously what we
want but apart from that we obviously
also still want you to connect on 2.4
which is the the lower red line here in
this graph in the same if we look at the
other controller why it is just capacity
that we have for you and if we can use
everything that we have the experience
from your site will be better in general
if we do the testing ourselves while a
complete room is full depending on the
amount of people in the room say these
smaller rooms are about 350 people the
bigger rooms are about 700 then normally
what we try to achieve is that you get
about 4 to 5 megabits per person
depending on the usage you will see that
it goes up to 35 40 mega bits if really
a lot of people again or checking their
agenda and doing work related stuff then
it might actually drop to half a megabit
to 1 megabit but there should still be
sufficient resources in the system to
help you guys come to the next couple of
years and
having you enjoy the network here at the
at the devil's conference and if you
should have any questions related to
this always welcome to come and ask them
yes sir now we have looked at putting
like a proxy server locally since as you
have seen a lot goes to the same amount
of novell dresses everything that's
Amazon Cloud and well we see these days
quite a lot of a measure as well but
thing is we can dream of an ideal setup
that would actually include more than
the caching server it would also mean
that we would have a separate dhcp
server redundant setup but unfortunately
there's also one implication and that's
usually on the cost side and even though
we all just assume Wi-Fi we would be
there and that the Wi-Fi will be good it
definitely comes at a certain costs and
we try to to offer both you and the
organization the best possible system
for the money that they want to spend on
it which is not not less but that means
that systems like that are not being
used the same for instance with the dhcp
server we me just earlier today
discovered the book in in the system
we're actually all the logging that we
were taking to to make this presentation
even better actually made the made the
firewall crash because it for some
reason the logging just continued
growing and it had somewhere a memory
leak where it to go over the system
memory and nobody got and dhcp address
anymore because it just hadn't gotten
any space anymore to put them in there
so interesting things to do these kinds
of conferences you actually really get
the chance to push all of your equipment
to the limit which is usually never
decays in any other deployment so we
also learn a lot from these things
anyone else in a small way yes but it's
not that we do a lot of things to really
prevent you from doing anything harmful
to other people like I said before also
on the firewall we don't really disallow
you to do anything attendings and
partners and speakers etc are well
separated from each other they can't
really do anything to each other meaning
that if one of you guys are trying to do
anything to the 0 2 demonstration the
partners try to give that would not work
if one of you would try to hack into it
bc of another guy we would actually well
that would be ways to do that to be
honest we can put that a lot more
clothes we could basically prevent you
from doing anything connecting to other
APIs and the ones that we want etcetera
but we also expect some well it's
difficult to say that way but some
maturity knowing that what's good for
you is good for another guy as well and
that it is still an open hotspot and if
you get into an open network basically
around your own to protect yourself as
far as possible enabling your firewall
if needed if you want to connect to the
workspace use a VPN but it would
actually be something that we could
consider in during the next year thing
is by the fact that this is quite a
heavy load environment doing more stuff
on the system can have its influences on
on the experience itself as well like
we've seen now everything is is really
nicely divided but i can actually
enforce it even further that it's really
done on the basis of one by one that you
get on to this channel that channel and
that everything is divided and that in
theory all of you should be
exactly the same amount of people on the
number of radios that are present in the
room but also that comes at a cost where
it might be that people have or needs
longer time to connect to the system and
we want to keep it as seamless as
possible to get you as quickly as
possible on the network and that you
don't have to bother about too many
things at the same time other questions
yes
yes and unfortunately that's something
that that has happened quite a lot we
have a system that can completely
isolated but it's not active on this one
it would really enforce us to use
different day PS or actually use them as
an overlay and they can really see these
are my authorized a piece this is the
authorized SSID in this area so even if
you would copy the SSID it would also be
tied to the SSID to the security used to
the brand of access points to the MAC
addresses of the APS we can all define
that and then you could actually say if
you now see any other possible
connection just blog that so if someone
else uses a divorce out spot with the
same encryption we would still block
that connection which is something again
in my ideal world and if I had to choose
that would be something that we would
deploy you never know how things go and
we are looking into a certain number of
things so it might well be that we that
we come with that solution next year if
we get a chance and and then use that at
the same time so that you have then tree
again three radio access points where we
would then use one radio rather than
four capacity at the moment for scanning
and for security reasons
other remarks questions tips
no all right let me quickly see if I can
show you anything else of interests then
if we have a look at is then you also
see that the majority of devices
deployed is Apple it's roughly forty
percent which is also what we see in a
lot of the other statistics where it
basically goes between Apple and Samsung
devices from an OS perspective a lot of
apple iOS 9 we do see iOS 10 as well but
to be honest amongst you guys I would
have assumed that everybody would have
changed to iOS then by now which wasn't
the case from google we be are quite
used to seeing well around treat
different versions like in this case the
KitKat lollipop and jelly bean and
marshmallow the marshmallow is
definitely the smallest part so that it
also includes we have other systems to
really monitor and then act as clients
on the network and they will actually do
the same things that you guys do but
they will report directly to us rather
than to each other or to Twitter and
then what we see there is that all of
these different versions really behave
differently on the network where it's
quite clear that that older iOS versions
or older Android versions might or might
not have more tribute issues compared to
others so if you can usually updating
your device actually really helps
sometimes well that's about it from my
side and thank you for coming and enjoy
the rest of the conference</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
