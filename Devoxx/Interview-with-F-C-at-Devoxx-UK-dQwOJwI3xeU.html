Aquino that I can't wait to be in a few
hours
and so for those who don't know I see
I'm in stylist question and you can work
out what we're talking about okay let
the best Thank You bubs
the first anchor rob was a multinational
style bank they deal in gold bullion and
yeah they were the first ones they got
me to test their security and I got in
most of all a lot of money on Expedia
and quite a lot but I had to give it all
back over the answer well that's basis
but sometimes it's nice to snow you have
it you have it for a brief moment it's
just like in life you get a salary in
the middle we get stacks so whereas I
had to give it all back okay how did you
take it how did I think it picked out it
was just just gold bullion I just had to
make sure that I could like true so I
got something from it and they're quite
heavy
um but yeah they're kind of cool can you
tell me how you got the gold without
giving any buildings I literally walked
in it was it was that easy I just saw
bypassed all their security by walking
and that's that's how I do it most of
the time so there's a lot of preparation
love scoping out the building seeing how
it works bit of a funny story on it it
was my first of a bank I've ever robbed
and so I I was there at 3 in the morning
looking at this massive building in
central London and very confused as to
how I was going to get through all this
security and when I hear someone behind
me say excuse me mate what you up to
and I was like I'm slightly lost in the
building I was like working out how to
rob this Bank and I turn around there's
two policemen so who was there that was
an interesting light where I had to
explain my job and what I did yeah they
say they let me go in the end so yeah
but they don't quite confused I I deal
with the police quite a lot end up
interacting different just because of
how things happen and and yeah all of
them just blown away that there is this
job that I do where I go in and I test
and security banks and you know
government buildings etcetera
you have to have a piece of paper like
this yes really so there's a you get a
letter of authority to say this person
is doing a test on our systems and it's
signed by a bunch of people but that is
also part of the test I will often make
a fake one of those with fake telephone
numbers of friends and such so if I get
if I do get stopped
I will hand back to security and see if
they just find the numbers and then
believe it I've never had to use one of
those so I've never really tested it
however a colleague of mine did get
stopped once and he used his fake letter
and they phoned me and I said yes fine
Mike's allowed in let him in and they
let us let them in so they thought
they've done the right thing but they
haven't so probably been a difficult
conversation for them to have had with
their classes accurate yeah
there has been once where I thought it
was going to go wrong I thought I'd
produce a letter but instead the bank
called the police response which they
shouldn't have done is way outside of
their processes of what they shouldn't
like they got too nervous called the
armed response and they showed up around
the bank and just surrounded the bankers
yeah that was interesting I can't even
imagine what that would be like scary
yeah it's very scary Thanks and support
your job many social engineering is fun
yes it is yeah so it it's a fine
balancing social engineering people into
either letting you through control
systems they shouldn't or just by
passing them completely like hopping
over fences calling through ditches
through tunnels down lift shafts that
sort of thing typicals of James Bondish
spy stuff trying to get into a building
in any way that you can what's that make
it interesting challenge you had his
skin trust character was one particular
place where it was guarded by X Gurkhas
so they're quite tough Millar to be and
so I ended up kidnapping one of the
Gurkhas and driving them off site and
that got a little bit sketchy
yeah that was a challenge definitely
challenge there on yes we did yeah so
okay after that is that good for me but
it was quite funny I ended up going back
to the same site
several months later to do another type
of text and the security guard
remembered me and his harvested button
it's the guy that kidnapped me and he
was very proud of being kidnapped is
very old yes at least write home about
yeah exactly there's not many jobs where
you can kidnap people for a living when
everyone's fine with it
yes well what do you what gonna see it a
most memorable story that you have I I
have so many I'm slowly writing a book
of all of the stories and all of these
little encounters I have because every
job comes with some crazy little thing
that happens yeah yeah I'm chatting a
ditching in the snow we'd like
night-vision goggles like watching a
door or yeah I'm running away from
security guards finding secret
passageways
trying to steal a helicopter just oh I
can't fly a helicopter and I know there
wasn't there anyway it's very odd um but
yeah there's hundreds of little stories
like that that hopefully will make up
this book that everyone will school
you'll find entertainment yeah I'd love
to read that it's so partied a lot your
job is social engineering
yeah so that's not all you provided that
it's a more of a holistic yeah exactly
am so we provide user training and so
how to prevent phishing how to prevent
social engineering attacks against your
coming how you should behave in the
culture in your company and how you are
you interact and communicate with it
both up and down from like the technical
perspective of the c-suite and from the
c-suite down to like the end users zc3
is like CEO CTO CFOs etc Nixon and so we
provide training we also do pen testing
and so like security testing it's
networks against applications etc so
yeah we we try and do the whole thing
from the very very technical side all
the way up to the human behavior side
which Jerry my partner we don't kidnap
people that much now
it's like it do it make sense</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
