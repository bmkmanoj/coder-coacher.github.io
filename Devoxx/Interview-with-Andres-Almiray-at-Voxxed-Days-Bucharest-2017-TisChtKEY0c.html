Bucharest and in NASA the second
language is Romanian because the number
of scientists and nothing you are from
Romania and I'm joined by Android who's
giving a talk you're now a very famous
Java libraries who can't afford to miss
I wouldn't say it's very famous but as
some people have seen it or in the past
and that I'm very happy to say that he
has been very well received by that's
Andy's I think not least because it's
such an important subject
there's no point reinventing the wheel
if you can find what you need in the
library and there are a lot of libraries
maybe that needs more people to know but
yeah exactly the whole point of the
other talk is to showcase those
libraries that make your work much
easier you feel more productive and in
many cases it brings back joy to doing
your work because as you say it makes no
sense to reinventing the wheel and just
go into the same implementations and
algorithms and to find out that there is
a group of people that have done this on
the open-source where they have much
more resources perhaps there are more
different point of views into a
particular implementation so you're
bound to have a much better
implementation because of this if you're
interested in open source you're a
longtime open source contributor and
evangelist that led you to concentrate
on Java libraries well it is because I
do open source because I like open
source that I discovered most of these
libraries and at some point in my life
besides being just a consumer open
source I also decided to be a producer
open source and with our customers we
tend to use many of these libraries
because we have found out that they are
quite good they're quite productive and
it's my goal to let people know why it
would be a good idea to use these
libraries and in which cases it may be a
good idea to use them because not all of
them some libraries may be a little bit
restricted in
of the license one thing that we have
there's developers have to be very aware
of when we work with open source it's
which are the terms of the licenses they
are very wide in many cases we have no
problems mixing them with commercial
offerings but you just have to be very
careful with the with the small
lettering medicates I'm not a lawyer and
in case that something gets in trouble
with a good idea that everybody will be
used the terms of services of tomorrow
based on do you think there's any way
that that could be made simpler the
terms of usage
well the our libraries are very very
literal for example there is one would I
would not say the name because it's
inside profanity but pretty much says do
whatever you want with this I don't care
it's complete free I will get it asked
is there there's no liabilities nothing
it's out there you find it useful but go
with it you don't like it no worries you
go with another one but that's the whole
point they give you no guarantees if you
messed up if somebody gets hot because
the usage of the software then what
happens right and there are some of the
libraries that actually go the distance
and not only protect the other person
that created the server but also they
end-user what are your top five
libraries if you had to pick five to
coach them up with that's they have web
help a web app yeah but in the case of
web web app I will definitely choose
some dependency injection mechanism and
probably a spring will be the first
choice just because it's very prevalent
in this area perhaps pair it with
extreme boot just because it's so easy
to get started I will say it's free but
it's more like a framework rather than a
library so let's focus just on a spring
core if you are sending data processing
of course you're pushing out JSON most
likely then Jackson but if you're using
a binary protocol you can vary Jackson
with some other codecs for example
message back which is much
much smaller more compressed much rarer
in some cases will probably use nettie
transport even we are not using HTTP
okay we're getting our little bit wet up
a way of Web Apps but it's still good
and for logging I will probably use as
left for J just because it's more common
out there in many open source projects
if not the alternative will be locked
for j2 and finally what we have to
combine these things with testing
eventually so if you're testing a web
app there are two things that you will
like this from the server side you want
to query using a fake client for that I
will use
rest assured but even the other way that
your you have built a client and you
need to fake out the server then my
suggestion will be warm up if it does
maybe 90% of what you want it to but you
feel like it's missing something or
there's a bug
would you just move on and look for the
next one I will evaluate it if there is
an alternative that may be more mature
and if the debark is I will consider a
showstopper then we'll probably move on
but before I move on I will let the team
know that there is a problem if the
bucket has not been reported and I will
report it if it's already reported and
it doesn't have enough information that
I will just have more saying I was able
to reproduce the problem with in such
environment with such conditions
following a list of steps so be much
easier for them to reproduce it and it's
time permitting if I can I will
certainly push a patch to see if I can
fix the problem projects when you're
using libraries that you need to go back
and almost review the libraries that
you've used and see if there are
alternatives where patches might have
been pushed
so maybe better solutions that have been
overlooked the first time for whatever
reason do you find that you have to
curate the libraries in project
well I'm very pedantic in that regard I
tried to keep the variants of the
libraries that I use to
as much as up-to-date as possible if
they follow semantic versioning since it
easy to figure out there may be a
breaking change when you upgrade from
another many open source projects are
very friendly into developers in terms
of compiling a list of changes like a
change set or release notes so it's easy
to figure out all this kind of easy to
figure out there might be some breaking
changes
I haven't found much although it has
happened that in the early days for
project to select a library X to perform
certain function and all the time you
switch to another one it's a mixed bag
of results sometimes when you pick one
or the other over the other the api's
may look very close alike so the changes
are easy and sometimes there are way way
different but it makes sense to switch
because the other library the second one
is the better one it will give you the
results that you need
