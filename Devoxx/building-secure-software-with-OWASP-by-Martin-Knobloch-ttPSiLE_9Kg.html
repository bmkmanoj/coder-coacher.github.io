take care of our child and monday i
found out that i scheduled for today so
that's why we have an additional
entertainment please don't take pictures
and post it on any media but maybe can
continue when i'm too bored boring okay
let's talk about of course Who am I why
I think I can talk to you about the
subject my background is java developer
and being charged developer and caring
about your code I early came into
security and thought about what is about
secure coding what does he keep coding
about and what it's about code quality
back in 2005 I was able to fund an
secure task force I'm a previous
employer and from then I had with major
split should I go fully to security or
should I stay in development and I
choose to step to go to security there
are times i really regret us i miss
developing but on the other side i hoped
i can make sense through security
community to achieve to develop us
differently understand development and
make security a sensible saying another
blaming sting double a Kia I was like
okay I was presented a together with my
colleague and friend recover the Carter
who hopefully can take a bit of cystitis
babysitter and I said I won't talk about
Oh was yeah owasp is an open book open
web applications group or check and 501
type 3 nonprofit organization that means
everything we do we deliver for free all
our tools and guides was our tools are
guides you can download and use them
with no limitation for licensing or
pricing OS was found in 2001
from developers for developers was it's
not about to blame also while helping
you writing secure code of course we
have a wiki where you can find
everything or actually you can find
nothing if you don't know what to look
for so today I hope to be able to point
to give some pointers what to look for
and where to find it to improve your
call quality your security of your code
is over sterling who if you have heard
about owasp Wow let's go whom of you
have heard about our sub 10 whom of you
have heard but also Tim compliancy that
does not exist here so many times like
oh we are always complaining what I had
a custom they said we did a partial or
worse stuff now and we will do a full of
us from half a year full of wasp what is
this yeah we really compliant will or
stop them I would say I was 210 is our
blessing and our curse I'll placing for
the name of knowledge because it gets
very much attention when it was
mentioned in the PCI DSS you have to do
an hour to 10 check but I will curse
because unfortunately a lot of vendors
abused or so 10 today now we have only
10 things to check for and we can make
it make a very nice almost 2 10
certification and a check pass or our
tool will check your application for the
post of 10 and you get a green bar and
people think they are safe but it's the
top 10 it's not the whole security story
and of course it's not grayness document
since 2010 or was is not going about
vulnerabilities but about risk because I
was recognized in 2008 we have to change
our mission statement before that our
mission statement was the finding
fighting and defending of course of
unsecured software those very black
wives is developer sir 0 &amp;amp; 1 everything
has to be secure and then we learned we
cannot do that and more important we
cannot do that without this out the
business so to also 10 chain
from being about vulnerabilities to be
about risk because most of 10 guide is
an advanced document that helps you to
explain the business why security is
important what is the business impact
what is the business risk that's what I
Austin is about awareness document will
help the business to understand what
will be their problem if you have one of
the floors in there who hath heard
anything anything else about oh us in
the ortho 10 who knows more about ours
and that's really scary it's very few
almost everybody heard about all of us
almost everybody knows that also 10 but
all the other tools we have you haven't
heard about so I hope you change her
today I said I was is made from
difference for developers you are
developers you do continues to level the
development and very agile scrum ads are
confused 11 development continues
deployment so you write your code you
are in the code is that and then they
come to security guys they stop if the
fast-growing continues differently
availability train and then it's a
tollgate the security tollgate stop we
do a security check now heavy h3
understand yeah and what you get them
you get a check list of things that are
not good in your code bad Peppa
developers let us actually happen
because when the security people speak
about this developers it only showed him
that's all you did wrong where the fair
was I'm a hacker I am very smart i can
break your stuff but i never think about
the complexity of development that never
been developer unfortunately most of
tigers never have been in an enterprise
situation to really develop a new
product recent project manager breathing
in your neck so they know nothing about
the complexity there's only one goal
find the vulnerabilities what you get a
list of vulnerabilities so you do
continues to the development so you're
in your code sprint hopefully two weeks
max so when then the security total
comes out and you get a check list it's
four weeks later where is your brain
in the next or even the next after that
sprint they come to you three weeks ago
you did this wrong so really great all
you working at you can de trop forget go
back two weeks in time and think about
what you have done why I have done that
that will not work it's too late anyhow
a security check afterwards it's like
taking a car you have fully built heaven
production then run it against the tree
and see what who survives a tree of the
car it's too late and for you it's like
what you come to me this course I
progressed for tree what is it who might
have you heard about cross-site request
forgery that's good who know how to
prevent it said much less so yeah they
come to you you have to nobility and
then you ask so what should I do they're
like oh no i'm hecka i can break it I'm
not a builder let's fail they should
help you and a good report should help
you doing discover moon abilities and
how tell you how to fix it if Ann Hecker
cannot explain to you what he has done
in a simple way maybe he doesn't know
himself in and I experience from the
Netherlands is you get a black box
tester at Attica heck test pen test
whatever they call it these days it's a
one week five state security assessment
but in five days but can you test you
need a half day to start then you run
your tools for three days and you need
one half days for reporting so hey you
have a tool tritton skin and if you're
lucky the heck ahead son some mitigation
find the false positives and then of
course a nice layout for this company
and the feeling of almost a ten guide
and normal Dino as other documentation
and then of the issue list that is
riveted spdf aesthetic it's not saying
anything it's not helping you it's only
saying you did something wrong yes me
let's orbit antenna so they're only
saying what is wrong and that aren't
helping and also has tools to help you
one of them all these tools we have it's
a guide is the most testing guide
and I know a lot of developers like
saying hey I'm in the tester I'm a
developer and buying invest on a what is
a spin yeah the coolies unders though
the assessing guide helps you because
it's on stairs guidance doesn't mean
it's meant for testers it tells you how
you test an application what you look
for how to find it this part tools and
how to mitigate it it's very important
and much more important is but many
times it's forgettin in the appendix we
have a very nice overview on categories
because when you get a pen test you get
the list what they did so I run this
tool the test tool and this curve and
this time and that's the findings he
asked them did you get a hundred percent
of the application or give you 80 75
what did you check for they're like oh
yeah I did all the kind of black magic
heading stuff so you have no idea next
is something where security people can
learn from functional testers because
they didn't do a test scope they're
gonna test approach chicken over how
much test college they have and the
assessing guide in this category list
helps it let them fill it in what I have
done in which category and then you have
more understanding how to found the
vulnerabilities and how you can detect
them what are actually about so you
could continue salary when you use
development give all this nice autumn 88
automation tools isn't it and it's so
easy unfortunately the security tools
are different people are not built by
developers they are built by security
people so you are default about what two
environments you need give your ID and
your browser is there anything else you
have open most of the time that those
most used tools your IDE in your browser
for Tyra for every web based integration
tool and you don't need other tools
another dashboard maybe for every
security tool and not their sport that
will not help you you can i when i was
developer my world was really small just
made laptop screen and had two things
open
physics actually command prompt my IDE
my browser so you don't need to look
another email if I have a PDF I don't
need to another dashboard from this tool
a dorset first time ago oh you have to
check this every two hours that we don't
work so security tools yeah the security
tools should be addressing you in your
environment so you can use them in your
daily work and that's what actually a
lot of oils tools do because they outbid
written by developers for developers and
lets the project going on these days
it's called the object pipeline sorry
the absolute bedlam is about helping you
in your continuous delivery pipeline we
have this application security
integrated as in process with early
feedback so the intake tools the first
thing is you don't write all your coat
yourself on you these days maybe thirty
percent of the code is written by you
the rest of frameworks and libraries you
use but what is the quality of those
libraries are there any known
vulnerabilities if you input the library
what is your supply chain cleaners so
language it means means have you ever
looked in users library not only a kiss
me the functionality that I required to
have to a use the latest version how
fast are they with speed fixing their
bugs how our life is the project is
there any updates last half-year what is
on their bucket list how much they still
have to do I have to fix that the to
list this how secure how stable
Hammacher is this library and music the
first thing you should think not just
hey it isn't cool new a library let's
use it we'll see where it ends because
when you import a library it's very very
East assume it will stick in your
project for the end of the time so
before you import any dependency you
need a tooling or help of understand how
to validate if it's a good tool if it's
a good project and if the living project
is well maintained
the second thing is what is the ranch
tools what is the security risk of the
earth application you build with I
always say when a lot of people at rest
developers like Dana need to know more
about security depending on the priority
of the project actually it is not
because when you are coding or coding
that's only one way to go code let's do
right wait a secure way to quality rate
code it's not that you have a high risk
sons external application you have to do
all secure coding then you do another
application with another customer oh I
don't mind SQL injection just to a
string confirmation note that is the way
to code it's your coding standard I had
one customer they had encoding standard
and secure code extender I'm here so
they've coding center in the secure code
extender this is wrong because there's
one standard how you code that's the
best way the most quality way to code I
don't care as developers you should not
care what is the application risk the
application priority criticality only in
with Souls and what measures do I take
to fear fry that it's good enough but
the coder for the developer it makes no
difference the test holy and said give
so much tools you use already for code
quality dependencies and everything
sorry so there you have so many tools
you use already for automatic build
automates Blauman your complexion
cyclomatic complexity everything you use
for your cold quality so it's very easy
to increase security tooling as well in
your automated build process and I heard
many times yes when I will use the
static code review tool I get hundreds
of thousands of findings as of course
you do because you use the first time
and every tool you have to update when
you optimize and then you're not using
it once a year I'd use it for every
build then it makes sense to optimize it
and to top
to optimize it I think about from how to
can catch the false positives and stuff
like that which is a real irrelevant so
integrating in automating also in
security tooling will have it up them up
to improve your coding and last not
least delivery tools when you have
everything done so you have your
automatic bills the automated you have
to code quality you find box a textile
the steady code review tool then you
build it to deploy it or a test server
you can also run them of course dynamics
controls like one I will tell you later
so you can integrate on every step
security tools in your normal work in
all process but when you start with
security I always see it's plain to the
developer isn't it and then I talked to
different teams in a talk about security
it's like a sore spot because they're
our best so many times like you
developer don't doing it right not doing
it right now so when i call them
security like the others actually also
the security group is really really bad
because they always had security it's
complex and expensive so as a project
manager what it was here about a project
just a little projects on time and money
so i can be security and tell them is
compute is expensive in complex they
will not like you so we have to reduce
the complexity of security and one way
is to build a security program a
security problem is make the whole
company aware about development about
secure for government an open some the
city of Software Assurance maturity
model helps you in that I never every
time I come to a company and I asked
about security and I sent it to nothing
they do because they do about code
quality and over some helps you find
your blind spots and your favorites so
safe it's you have and a favorite you
always do good stuff so we improve the
favorite it's really hard takes much
more time and resource we had our blind
spots very a easily this very little
effort can improve the overall success
and quality also the first thing the
governance
but we forget it's not about all your
fault fifty percent of all security
issues are flaws and not bugs are
functional problems that caused by the
business not thinking about the
functionalities they really like it we
wanted if they needed what is the
security implication so it's very easy
to blame developers but still fit result
of all issues are created by the
requirements and of user stories so over
someone helps you to find that first in
what is your current maturity level and
then you can talk to the business on
which level you want to come and that
self-assessment tool as will help you to
find them where I want to go and make
the changes metal ball rather than say I
a management I need 10k 20k to improve
my security here we have a roadmap you
work out together with the management to
improve the overall security insecure
understanding of your whole company
another thing is the ases so when you
say I don't have internal if I'm I have
external development it's not enough say
it has to be secure how is the Cure has
it being as I said we do secure
development we always fight a secure
cold so much how much which measures I
have to take during the development and
deployment there comes SVS the
application security verification
standard the SAS helps you on those 16
categories things you have expectations
on on the level zero to level 4 3 you
can demand and level and security level
maturity level and there are measures
written down making the security if
station explicit you miserable
verifiable so it's not just it has to be
secure these are the actions the
measures we expect you have taken oh yay
come on a recorder another thing is then
what helps you in improving hvs its
clinic opium it's a gamification of risk
when you have give you a checklist in
the 80s list i said this a checklist
have you done everything maybe the first
and you start reading maybe halfway
through
third the first time is just the eye
area of course you are human you think
oh I have thought about that yes let me
see so of course this gamification helps
you to think about freshly about heavier
taking the right security measures but
it's very important when you play a
cornucopia is that everybody has a very
good understanding of the architecture
of the application and you need a good
incentive to win because when you're not
as an incentive when you play a card ok
no pictures of in place no bitch with
him so when you play a card you have to
say why this car is relevant and to have
the argument why this card is very
relevant in this context of your
application when it's about winning if
you can win something I have a counter
argument and can tell you why I think
it's not applicable so but data on a
game level with a competitive game Ling
level you think very sorry about
application security and race and
countermeasures you have to take but
this is based on the SVS gamification on
a risk assessment well I said you need
to have a good understanding of the I
textured and there must be an incentive
to win the game so they have the good
arguments yes you are doing another one
who helps you rather than gives you
static requirements like this should
work for everything or to try to find
one requirement document you know how
this works on hand to page page pages
for everything security read it's
divided by two friends of mine in
Germany they said it's always depending
on the business credibility on what type
of application is this a java
application it's Donette application is
it an android and mobile app or is it
IOT security read helps you on defining
a security requirements dynamically and
in the end when you say if it it will
generate Tyra our actions and actually
at rest people to have taken to have to
take care of it so rather than have one
book of all the static requirements
nobody reads it's their dynamic way to
create compliments and only address them
as Tyra issues people have take care of
yeah another thing is when you start and
he said I have nothing so the absolute
minimum I should take care of always has
created an OS top 10 of the proactive
controls a set of 10 is not a conclusive
list but it's at least isn't
comprehendible list of where to start
not stuff nothing it's a very basic
basic to think about it into a dress
when you're not mature yet north time
yet and of course because our sense the
tech is a great development guide all
the static guides they're not really
helping and it's very hard to develop
them because yeah knowledge changes in
people change so what we have now is a
chichi series let's demand it on the
website so you can find up one item you
want to address this one items you want
to address you can find how to detect it
what's a location and the most important
for how to fix it so very dynamic well
maintained list of items how to improve
security and specific things like and
this is where security knowledge framer
comes in so I give hand over to Ricardo
hello my name is Nick Carlton cotton I'm
one of the project leaders of security
knowledge framework it was an initiative
I did along with my brother we are both
developers and we also do a lot of evil
black hacker magic so that's the best of
both worlds against and yeah basically
we developed this application to help
developers create their software secure
by design so yeah a lot of times when we
talk with developers we we heard them
make a lot of the same mistakes yeah so
now we're here well so basically what we
did is we divided the development
process of the development process in
two different stages we have pre
development and prose development and
the pre-development face a developer can
say okay g-star the types of technology
stacks i want to use and these are the
types of functionalities i want to build
and security knowledge framework has a
very big extended knowledge base
extensive knowledge base Oh once an hour
does a fresh poo from github to throw
away all the test projects people make
so so as you can see with a very
extensive lonely space yeah so when you
do pre-development you select your
technology stacks and your
functionalities and the security
knowledge framework will make
correlations between those items and
give you feedback according so for
example if you fill in I'm going to do
something with SQL it says okay oh this
is for calling truncation it will tell
you for okay when you do SQL please take
into consideration and attacker can do
SQL injections what is the attackers
attack vector in a text surface when you
can perform an SQL injection and also a
solution on how to mitigate it and how
what to do in your code for example
parameterize queries so we can do new
project so like I said here whenever you
start a new project you can do a new
project do you have here your pre
development at your post development
like I mentioned before you this is
where you can add functions or
functionalities for example if you're
going to do something with session
management or you're going to build a
follow up load function you can add
these values at the start of your
sprints and then you get results
accordingly so for a foul about you have
to take into considerations if you don't
do it right you can be vulnerable for
follow blood injections yeah what can
the attacker do with it it's described
here so he could possibly get a remote
shell if you allow the uploaded
documents in the root of your
application and yeah well here are
solutions and steps you want to take
whenever you are building the file
upload functionality you have to check
for extensions but you also have to
check for the mime type and not only the
mime type and post request because the
attacker can temper that with an
intercepting proxy so you also want to
do a check
whenever the file is uploaded on the
surface so you put it in sort of Kara
quarantine then you check if the the
foul really is what it says to be and
you delete accordingly if it isn't also
for sessions as you can see here for
example sessions has a pattern this
pattern exists out of 14 items so all
these 14 items our knowledge base
artemis on itself because yeah session
management is very extensive very
complicated you have to take into
considerations your attitude HTTP only
flex your secure flag if you're working
with domain you have to yeah be careful
for cross subdomain cookie attacks and
stuff like that it's all sounds very
scary and complicated but the security
knowledge framework will give you
information accordingly beforehand so
before even you wrote a single line of
code security knowledge framework now
tells told you already okay you're going
to build file upload you have to take
into consideration the file upload
injections you're going to do something
with sessions this is how you want to
build your sessions management according
to these items so that is your
pre-development also if the text doesn't
tell you only tell you so much you also
want to go step by step and get the
feeling on how to really do it in your
code good example for that will be I can
tell people to use secure random
functionalities but people will still
make up their own algorithms and will
still be become predictable and possible
so it's always good let's see we also
have code examples so if you're going to
yeah generate a random token you want to
make sure it's a cryptographically
secure random token which cannot be fast
by an attacker so also for example we do
pre-development I you select I want to
make for example a password forget
function
you're very dependent on the tokens
because when you build a password forget
function you do not want to send clear
text password to the user in their inbox
you want to send them recovery links but
those recovery links contain a random
token so if I built a little Python
script who Fuzzy's a new password new
password links and I get new tokens and
it's not cryptographically random secure
I can build a list of it and when it
becomes predictable I can see when there
is a token missing and then I can submit
a token take over an account yeah by a
token not being cryptographically random
secure so we do not only want to talk
about it we also want to show it in code
okay how it's done the good way in our
opinion there are a lot of opinions so
that is the pre-development face we also
have the post development face this is
basically when you have built your code
and you want to do the verification like
Martin mentioned before we there is the
application security verification
standard it's very good standard it has
the level 3 has about 170 security
controls you want to take into
consideration when building a critical
application but even me and my brother
even less experienced hackers /
developers had a hard time understanding
the context of these security checklist
items so that's why we thought okay we
want to use this but we also want to
give more additional information per
item to give more context about the
things that are being asked so as you
can see it has architecture
authentication verification session
management access control malicious
input handling and so on and so forth
like I said there are 170 security
controls you
to be compliant with when building very
secure software so not going into all of
them of course so just safety checklist
and again when you fill a checklist item
security knowledge framework correlates
those items back to the knowledge base
to give some more in-depth information
here on how to mitigate it and what when
you have a certain vulnerability what
that means for your applications yeah in
terms of attack vector of an attacker so
as of now we also we have two different
types of applications sort of first of
you can use it two ways basically first
you can use it as a standalone version
on your own laptop or your desktop
whatever you prefer you can also use it
as a surface in your company yeah edge
users at groups to users assigned
projects to different types of users so
you can share projects and you know what
the status of your application is
basically yeah well like I like you
already seen maybe is we also support
different type of programming language
as of now we have PHP and dotnet we're
currently waiting for a long time on
developers to supply us with Java
function so if some of you know how to
securely develop them want to help us
please do would be very nice and also
all the the the code examples we get we
will check we build we hack we improve
we hack again we improve with documents
so that is where also the whole the
description and solution came from Anna
knowledge base is basically we
different types of functions ourselves
and we attacked it like we normally do
in a pen test and then we yeah right
down the results heck again right down
the result hack again so in that way we
made mitigations boot example for that
would be for example path traversal sore
file inclusions you know a lot of people
you see they do a regular expression on
the dot dot slash but as an attacker you
can mitigate of circumvent that regular
expression by doing dot dot slash slash
so dot dot slash will be get filtered
and what do we get another part reversal
so you have to do within the loop and
things like that all those things we
test it and that way yeah we made
mitigations basically so yeah so this is
a security knowledge framework very
short missing no fees yeah of course so
a little bit of history we started the
PHP application then we wanted two
people to have a spinning standalone on
their own environments so that's why we
built a python flask and at first it was
beautiful that around three hundred
lines of code so very UK and then people
said yeah but we want to have users and
groups and we want to share the projects
so now it's a big giant snake of raw
evil code we cannot manage anymore not
nicely but really so now we're building
fightin flask API with a nice angular 2
front end so that our future plans also
what we wanted to do is you know build a
testing guide for developers so you do
not only read about a vulnerability you
do not only see the code about the
vulnerability but you can also test your
own code you get basic guides and ok you
have for example you have a cross-site
scripting
let me get some code for that first of
all of who how many of you are aware of
different context of cross-site
scripting that you have to escape user
input in different contexts so not only
HTML context but only other types of
context can I see some hands ok cool not
as much as I hoped but so there are a
lot of types of context you want to
escape user input then you have to
normal type of context normal HTML
encoding but you also have an attribute
encoding and you also have URL encoding
for example if a user can fill it its
website on your application you can do
don't know if this browser is protected
but if an attacker submits this payload
SS website you can visit it will trigger
XSS and your user will get hacked so
that is the DD there yeah URL encoding
you have to apply because normal
encoding will not escape death attack
yeah there was a point I wanted to make
with this well anyways we're building an
API with an angular 2 front end oh yeah
and for you how to test your own code
after you yeah build your
functionalities you want to make sure
whenever you are using user input and
HTML attributes you can properly test if
you really do the encoding right so yeah
those are plans for the futures and
thank God for us Martin is doing good
job helping us with that helping us with
the architecture and stuff like that
also the development so that's pretty
cool
more experienced guide and the US young
ones so yeah well that's it thank you
for your attention oh well my part of
these there's more I should become bit
more to come here so this was you know
American that's the kind of things that
really could be attached to OS when I
meet guys like Clinton ricardo de
guardar who really put their own time
effort in like two guys from the
security read and build something and
deliver to the over screwed deep so for
free that everybody can use it so
there's much more so also what's also
has its a set of type proxy it's
actually currently our best running
project and I always said that I said
the tape broke she is such a success
because it's not written by a security
guy it's written by a developer the same
banette wasn't is a Java developer and
here's an application tested and he gets
coffee for the security comes back and
the sky is in has been control of the
application so Simon said what tool is
there that helps me isn't available to
ride secure code in favor my code
actually we couldn't answer that so he
fought the past proxy and made Java for
us etc thick proxy to integrate in your
continuous delivery so it's a java-based
tool with and fully API you can access I
your browser so the typical use case
would be when you run your functional
testing you selenium automated a browser
automated automation you point your
browser fire the sellotape proxy you
recall the session so stilted box he
gets his scope and then you want an
extra skin and then again you have your
resource I done in XML gr HTML and also
there is an English equation in sono
tube and in Jenkins so in your champions
you can integrate it already when you
have all your build steps to do also the
securities test by a set of type proxy
and then you get a resource pack and
sonar q so not only in the beginning but
also then running in the
test environment or in production
environment but I said the pair basic is
the most of the color code you use is
imported it's not you written by you and
you just assume everybody used to
library so it should be okay in church
chromophore and the camry he says supply
chain management supply chain cleanness
is so important because there's def the
worked software group and the devil
setups and say do you actually know when
you buy the library where it will be
used we don't know these days so maybe
mate we used in some consumer get just
like I don't know a working fridge but
maybe it's also used in a medical device
a network also the European community
about IOT security and they're always
focusing only on the cold veterans so
yeah I have an option I can choose if I
use an android or another phone but if I
need a pacemaker or insulin pump can I
choose this very good talker for Mary
more about break my heart she isn't
researcher in a Norway and when she Kika
lips and woke up and choked up as a
pacemaker and she asked him for the
security requirements in the scope and
API and they were like no idea because
the medical people so she bought a
device the same device she has
implemented and she found out there's
open interfaces it happened to her that
she was a doctor when they had to adjust
the pacemaker and her doctor makes
adjustment and she didn't feel anything
but one other guy was not a pacemaker in
a waiting room collapsed that is really
really scary we always think what would
go wrong with software everything yeah
maybe of some money is lost maybe
sometime section is not sent some email
is not sin but what is if the code you
write directly influence the health or
the life of people that code is used
this is what we have to these days to
think about when we write libraries
because all the IOT devices are also on
their own libraries are also used in
this IOT devices their medical influence
then there's a complete different story
so don't interrupt software says you
never know where your location your code
will be used therefore I will take out
of the best quality secure code think
about it nothing in own four hours we
have an free annual conference where we
spread knowledge all of this about own
kicker so the next hours conference a
local event up in alex day nerimon
recover so the next one would be will be
in two weeks five is the 25th in belgium
11 we do it every year it's a benelux 10
so next year will be in the netherlands
and the year after will be in Luxembourg
again it's a two-day free conference one
training day one conference day oh yeah
for the training day we charge only to
be an almost member what is fifty
dollars it's all we charge for you
episode of the yeah the trainings will
be and fillmore people will not show up
for the trainers and the conference day
it's for free the next one in Germany
for those who are from Germany if I was
German data will be the November to 29 s
in darmstadt and we also have a big
conference that's own set of two things
beyond our money we earn our money with
still we try to keep the price cheap as
possible we try to keep it around 500
euros i think it's affordable for two
day conference where you also get food
in the brakes so next day the next time
will be a begin of May in Belfast it
will be through three training days and
two conference days so again we try to
keep it cheap as possible to make
accessible possible and we focus not on
breaking we are not the next praying
hecka conference we focus on building
and improving quality of sku code
so again what is it about code quality
you are developers is your code you are
responsible to ride quality code and you
have the tools in place you if
automation in place so it's very small
step to add security tooling it's a very
hard first time because you get on many
of many findings but those who use PMT
in the beginning you know also when you
use PMD first time you'll get a lot of
findings contradiction findings Ruth
addiction so it takes time to optimize
and what it's a good saying in America
it's don't try to boil to see of course
people get overwhelmed in the beginning
wait yeah thank you if we will get over
them the beginning when they have 150
200 thousand findings but the thing is
don't boil see the first step is not to
make it worse the second step is to
improve so when you have these findings
mark them as baseline this is situation
s is and then slowly make sure that you
don't get worse and the second step is
to improve early feedback when you are
developing dependency check kinsella
code review tools if they make them
available make them available for you to
developers you developers developers
demand to have some available in your
local build because when you're building
when you're writing code I wonder here
like that back if it was good or bad
twitter has 200 rly software releases a
week the founder that build something is
called set B that means the moment the
developer writes code checks in two
minutes later he gets warning if it was
not good and they found out actually
wait a minute so if we now created its
application that the developer checks in
in like wait for two minutes is off of
not if they're coming in email so
they're bashing again it's not what I
want to do so you get an email like hey
well done or please look at this again
we have the idea that sounds is not good
but not for all findings you can detect
the problem is what is more scary a
false positive or false negative a false
positive I look
for finding so a true positive is a
finding that really is validated finding
a false positive is a finding that this
norm and the first negative it's saying
it's all okay but there's something
severe problem in there what is more
scary and for me as a security guy
false-negative are scary because there
are security issues they're not traced
but for the developers false positives
are very very ignoring and they will not
help you virtual acceptance because when
i sent the list of ten issues to
developers and seven are false positives
this is not your job to validate the
tool your job is to write code so I need
somebody else to look at it and only
give the one hundred percent sure fire
security findings to developers and the
rest has to be many more elevated by
security champions yeah why don't you do
know I'm of my line so demand the tools
to have optimized and be reasonable you
cannot change the world in one go first
step make sure it's not getting rid of
the same steps to improve and secure
coding is something you have to do every
time not only on the high-risk
application but it's the way you should
code it's the way you teach your should
be taught to write code only the
validation the effort we took after we
take afterwards to verify that it's the
code is written security that was
changing depending on the priority okay
if you want to come by our booth when
you get down to the boost vendors to the
right and we have a lot of knowledge to
share and we have our sockets that's it
