it's 5:30 so my presentation is on
working with J and J or writing and
running and debugging docker
applications inside of Eclipse J
I guess moreover it's it's writing
running debugging doctor applications
with docker applications and some of the
challenges in doing that
I'm James Drummond I'm the release
manager for codenvy which develops clips
J
among many others so code Envy when we
develop one of the things we're striving
towards is dogfooding which means when
you're developing a an IDE it's not
enough just to design for the end user
when developers actually start to use
their own software it typically will
improve the product and bugs will be
found sooner wretchedly
creating an IDE you should be using your
IDE as well saying that a saying comes
to mind practice what you preach and you
make your bed you lie in it so I
personally use code in D which is based
on J daily to edit documentation
for both the clips Jay and codenvy I
tend to create a lot of issue bugs in
our github repository to improve the to
improve the product but moreover to
actually improve my life using our
product so I'm going to kind of go
through an example of the development
process of developing che within che and
some of the unique circumstances when if
anyone's use che here it's that's great
but che is not only a browser IDE but it
actually generates a workspace that is a
it's running a docker container that the
Linux runs inside of so when you run
applications within a container it
becomes tricky if your application
actually spawns other docker containers
so this was one of the one of the big
challenges with trying to use our own
product that uses docker to improve our
own product so I'm gonna kind of explain
what we did to do that okay so I'm going
to go through the steps of the
development process so first we actually
clone it's a git clone of the clips Shea
repository from github we make our code
changes we compile the assembly using
maven then we volume mount the che
assembly that we compile
into a new eclipse che docker container
we load the chase server web page in in
a web browser and test and that web
server is running inside a container a
docker container then once we're done
testing we stop it remove that chase
server or docker container and we repeat
from step 2 and we do the process over
and over again so when you're working
with containers that's one of the great
benefits is that you can spin them up
real quickly and remove them just as
quickly all right so I'm going to kind
of get into the specifics of how we use
docker syntax in order to use both our
product and which is based off a docker
and the specific syntax we have to use
so I've highlighted throughout this
presentation different aspects that I
thought were important to highlight
that's different from what you would
normally do so if you've worked with che
before the big difference is the
highlighted portion here typically
Eclipse J for security to protect the
hosts environment we do not mount a
docker demon from the host inside of
workspaces because you can actually
route the host environment and get
access to that so through a web page
browser so typically we do not do that
however if you're in a secure
environment behind a firewall
or you put some sort of authentication
in front of this application this is
pretty safe to do so this highlights
syntax what it will do is it will
actually volume mount any workspace that
you start up it will actually volume
mount the host docker socket file in in
doing so just with the docker socket
file you're able to use a darker client
to access the hosts docker daemon to
kind of give some background with behind
some alternatives like darker and darker
the problem with that solution if anyone
knows about it is you have to give that
workspace or container privileged access
to be able to do that so we wanted to
find a different way to do that also
there's if we give privileged access
there's still some variables with darker
and darker that can cause some issues ok
so how well you can see it there I'm the
projection but this is just giving it a
sample of after you run Eclipse J the
output that's generated by our COI and
once it's all done what it will do is it
will output the actual URL that you
should go to to see the IDE and
okay so what I'll try to do is I'll try
to go back and forth between the
presentation and in actual working with
this through our IDE interface so it's
not too confusing so first you click on
here let me show you first the interface
and that is pretty small get it bigger
all right so this is our this is the ID
this is where it starts out
I created a workspace just to make it a
little quicker but I'm gonna go through
all the steps let me switch back to the
presentation okay so you you click on
dashboard create workspace then you go
through new forms and you click on the
template so if anyone's looking at this
presentation afterwards this is a good
reference but I'll go ahead and actually
show it live so do create workspace
create a new workspace from stack and
there's been some changes to our stack
so I actually edited it and there'll be
a PR and and it'll get merged so you'll
eventually use this but for this demo
I'll be using eclipse
shade depth alright and I set this down
to 6 servers limited and
the project that we want to select is
eclipse J so just to give you a
run-through if you're not completely
familiar this creates a workspace the
stack defines the workspace generally
it's mostly defined by a recipe which is
a docker file and that docker file has
certain things loaded into it in this
case we have Java maven in an alpine
actually it's Debian but and it's got a
docker client pre-loaded and then when
you select a project that's actually it
clones github repository in this case
it's our actual Eclipse CEI repository
I'm go ahead and create that and I'm
going to switch back over to the slides
loads alright so the next thing I'll
step through is building J and J so this
this actual demonstration is how we
build a docker application within our
own product so we're actually building
our product with our product but you can
use this template and we'll get into the
run syntax in a little bit and that's
really the magic behind this but you can
use this as a template if you do have a
docker application and you wanted to
develop with J
okay so eclipse J stack uses a clips
Jaidev docker image that includes an
environment with all dependencies
required to compile and build clips Shea
we can easily build our program via
predefined commands available in the
command drop-down so I'll show you
select che root directory and I'll go
through all these steps and I think it
should be loaded down okay so what you
see here is a project this project was
cloned from our github repository what
you'll see up here this is the commands
that are defined in our stack so if
someone was I'm familiar with clips che
these commands are predefined and they
just have to click on this and it starts
building the build cycle is pretty long
so that's why I have a separate
workspace to kind of skip forward but
what you would do is you would click on
the project root directory you would hit
build command and you hit play now I
won't get into other specifics but
there's ways to reduce your compile time
if you working on certain modules of
Eclipse che but you can select the
different modules and the offline mode
is just to make sure that you're not
pulling in anything from a maven
repository and everything is local ok so
let's say hit the
button up there and it compiled what we
would have is under assembly main this
is specific for our project but this is
where we have our binaries or assembly
that our Tomcat server uses in our
server so I'll go back to our back to
the slide okay so I kind of skipped
through the bill because it takes a
little bit of time but this is the
command that we run and when I clicked
on that certain path this highlighted
portion is what can determine where in
that path you are so if you want to
build a certain module you just click on
it and it's the same play button that
you would click all right so running a
new docker container within a docker
container can be tricky business the
reason is is because with chaé we want
to secure the host environment and if
you allow by default a a docker demon
from the host inside your workspaces you
could open up your host to anybody that
may have access to the webpage so in
this example we're assuming you're
behind a firewall and you're in a secure
environment and everything's trustworthy
so we actually do mount through some
configuration which I've shown earlier
the host doctor demons socket file into
all the workspaces that are created so I
kind of explained that there
so volume mounts okay so so why it's
tricky to develop docker applications
inside a docker container volume mounts
use the docker demon host file system so
that's important to know because if you
compile a program inside a container and
then you use a host docker daemon that's
on a different file system if you try to
volume out something that's local inside
that container it will volume mount on
the host file system
so volume mounts are not where the
docker client is so we have a docker
client inside of our container that can
access the hosts docker daemon so the
way I accomplished to use change a
currently is I actually copy over all
the files to a temporary container that
will then transfer it to the hosts file
system to a new directory and then I use
that the volume out currently CheY only
allows filesystem mounts but this also
could be modified to transfer those
files to a volume container in docker ok
so that transfer from the container to
the host what you'll see in this run
script that I do is I have a middleman
which all it does is I add files from my
container into this middleman container
and that middleman container then copies
everything to the host it'll make more
sense as I go through the slides
all right so this is the big long
command that I run you can probably
condensed a little bit if you were to
add some of the commands I do to your
project but you know all these little
pieces here that you see will be in the
next slides and I'll explain each little
piece of the process
all right so compiled assembly needs to
be in the same folder as our docker file
a separate folder is created and used
for this purpose and that long command
this piece of it is up here at the top
and I'll keep going through each so what
it shows here is I make a directory if
it exists that's fine and it's an
assembly then the build stage that you
saw earlier I copy the assembly from
that folder and I copy it into this new
directory that I created the docker
client local file system is used to
build images that's another important
thing to know about docker when you
actually build images it's done from the
local file system host is not done from
the docker diamond file system host this
allows files to be in when we build the
docker yeah when we build the docker
image so what you'll see here is I've
got some scripting which just generates
a docker file so I'm using the Alpine
docker image I make a directory inside
that docker container which is assembly
and then what it does is it copies and
this is the important part that's why I
highlighted it it copies from the
clients
docker client file system into that
docker image so that's how I transfer
from a container into the docker daemon
so now my assemblies in this docker
image and then I build it and it does
that all right so that builds step we
created a new docker image alpine slash
copy files to transfer all the files
into the container
so what I'll explain here is the next
step we do is we actually launch the
middleman container as I phrased it
earlier so what you'll see here is I am
volume mounting a when you run something
with docker and you volume out this
directory here the Jade dev repo is
actually on the docker daemon host file
system not in the container that I built
everything from it's on the docker
daemon and then the commands afterwards
what I do is I remove anything that
might have been in the Che dev repo
because if I run this multiple times I
want to make sure it's the new assembly
and then I copy over the files in the
assembly folder and I copy them into
that volume mount so that's how I
transfer from the container I'm working
into to the docker daemon folder okay so
once we have the assembly on our docker
demon host file system then we can
actually launch
our clips che CLI and specific to
eclipse che we use the CLI and we're
gonna vol out that Jaidev repo that has
our new assembly into the container
assembly and our CLI will it detects any
time that there's files inside the
assembly and if there is it uses that
assembly which in this case is Tomcat
assembly war file and it uses that
instead of what it has originally so it
replaces it the one other thing we need
to do is because there's another che
server instance I need to call the
container something else it's already
called che so I call this Chang Cheh and
then I also have to give it a different
port number so they can't both have the
same port ok so I know this was a lot of
stuff
maybe over everyone's head but let me go
ahead and give an example with my last
three minutes so we built earlier so now
I'm going to run and if you look at the
docker PS originally it has a workspace
running which is what we're working in
now and it also has another container
called check which is our server here
and after this launch is what you'll see
is a new container that started which is
the new che environment
there you go
so as you can see that that address that
I showed earlier it was 8080 and now
this is 80 81 so if I was to go to a new
web page this is the new and I was doing
some experimentation that's why there's
a stuff already in it but this is our
new Eclipse chase server alright so that
it was kind of quick with the run
command I think the more important thing
is to understand what's going on behind
the scenes so I'm hoping this
presentation isn't just about che
developing che it's more how you can
actually take your own docker
application that may require docker to
run other things and you can use this as
a template to create your own all right
well that's into my presentation there's
also a button to stop it cleanly but if
there's nothing you need to save if once
you run it again it actually will stop
the container before it executes all
right thank you all for coming
bigger turnout than I thought it was
gonna be so thank you guys you guys have
any questions at all or you need
questions of
the doctor and docker know how familiar
everyone is with docker but that's one
of the big challenges we have it's just
allowing other docker inside of the
docker well thank you everybody I hope
you enjoy thank you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
