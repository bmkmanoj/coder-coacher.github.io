here with Alexei who's em well most of
you will know him very well as
performance expert and so you're giving
a talk about a new garbage collection
that you want people to adopt shenandoah
yeah that's right we are developing it
in Red Hat for the simple goal to target
large heaps or any other workloads that
exhibits GC pauses that people do not
like one of the major things that
Shenandoah does it does concurrent
contraction so if you look at the
spectrum of OpenJDK DC's you will notice
that there is the shift from they've
completely stopped the world deceives to
morgan current ones j-1 for instance is
the good stepping stone to that and it
does concurrent mark then currently and
it solves the large part of the GC pause
but there is the second part which is
actually relocating the objects and
fixing the hip pointers after you
relegated it and this is where
Shenandoah comes in it solves that
second part of the GC puzzle when you
solve both of them you realize that your
GC pauses at that point are not
dependent on the hip size anymore they
are dependent on the root set size but
that's usually much much smaller than
the active hip size and so you are able
to pull off very nice GC pauses the GC
poses that are not attainable with the
current opportunity collector in every
scenario okay so we have a much much
smaller garbage collection this more
frequently we have smaller GC pauses
yes we still have concurrent juicy
phases that are wrong but application is
not stopped at that point so it might
run slower because it's still the same
hardware and GC also needs cycles to run
but at least it's not stopped the world
event that you stopped the application
and it has to wait for five seconds
until GC comes to its senses and gives
up some of the heap it's not like that
most of the phases are most heavy
physics or concurrent and where is the
in development is it ready to go
we are development developing it as the
open JDK project and so we are targeting
GDK 10 as it is now probably will the
release LTSs we will target what's it's
called right now Java 11 I guess
so there is the lots of integration work
going on in the upstream to fit this
collector for instance we have incepted
and we hope to develop the GC interface
which makes plugging in new GCSE to the
hotspot easy after that is in hotspot
plugging in Shenandoah would be a piece
of cake but as red hot as the owners of
one of the major open JDK distribution
channels we also distribute downstream
builds and our downstream builds in
Fedora and rel today include Shenandoah
so if you have option fedora on your
laptop and you have the open JDK build
installed there you can just enable it
and it will work and so many derivatives
from rel I'll also including Shenandoah
in this regard for example Amazon Linux
if you install Java 8 there it it
defaults to Java 7 right now I think but
if you install Java 8 and update
alternatives to it
you still caption and order so it's not
product ready yet
but it isn't data quality so if you are
if you think that this GC would be a
solution to your performance problems it
is a good idea to try right now and
luckily there are ways to try it right
now without messing with turbos or
something like that
it might come with your open JDK build
right now on your system thank you very
much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
