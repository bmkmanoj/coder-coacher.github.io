joined by Jay fraga Berg saudagar ski hi
thank you very much for testing with us
thank you thank you for having me I
what's your relative or what Dez I'm a
developer advocate with Jeff frog so but
this is what I do baby and you guys have
had quite some big news recently haven't
you like a real yeah yeah we release our
first third product and it's pretty
exciting 12 years that you've been
around so pretty big things yeah it is a
big thing it's not every day we released
a new product actually the first one was
announced before the company so it's a
frog it's a second announcement yeah
that's big we have our age Arab Mission
Control now which allows monitoring
managing multiple instances of a factor
and ben tre it's exciting stuff and have
you had a lot of interest in that at
this event I said what people have been
coming to talk to you about oh oh yeah
yeah so we got quite a bit of interest
about that but also bother stuff like so
since last year since we were on d'box a
lot changed so yeah we have a lot to
talk about with the people and I can't
have it Nate if you are wearing a groovy
see but of course young love oh
there we are at devoxx we do love a bit
of gravy at boxed then don't even this
big if groovy an eventful year bit to
you is it still going strong absolutely
and I think it's stronger than ever
meanie yes because an Apache foundation
being apache groove it's it's a big deal
and it actually helps adoption in grails
resources three is huge gray locating
momentum I think it's good time for
groovy so what's new in gravy so groovy
the tudors five are now going through
better stages and going to be released
very soon and and they have is a very
very interesting version groovy macros
are going to a get in and it's a very
empower way to add started
metaprogramming
to your code and a lot of a lot of very
good features supporting Grails as well
so and so it's a big deal soon for that
the group ecosystems is still alive and
kicking absolutely I think more than
ever that's that's been and looking
forward and I know that you guys have
had some big news about what's new and
things in a frog what can we expect from
you what's your roadmap ahead for next
year well so that's so we we have a very
and i would say interesting and
challenging road map because we plan to
support as usual more more more tools
and more it's only getting more crowded
right there's any more things to do so
it's actually with moral support more
tools actually brings the requirement to
support even more right so we have quite
a book vivid community that come to us
and say okay now you have that that's
great now we want even more and we see a
lot of requirement oh it's it's in been
for years people want us to support
tools that we are not there yet so for
example for PHP or for objective-c and
mac OS and iOS development quite far
away from the original travel oh well we
we are we are proud already but at bhp
it's kind of philip is just getting more
polygons as well they're right let's say
right it's rightfully we already started
safe in that little job of bubble and
they've had to branch out and that's
interesting i play a little game here
every time someone came to our booth and
ask about artifact orange a fog and I
I'm telling the story about artifacts
are being a universal artifact
repository and I'm just I'm asserting
that you have more technology than only
java and it's always the answer is yes
yes that's a good yes and it works like
ninety-nine percent and that no one does
only java anymore that's great i gotta
be safe any other tech trends as i was
class dude yeah they like this time last
year everyone with microservices mike
rizzo right doc again it so that
people's mood a bit on beyond that now
yeah yeah so i would say it was
microservices last year and it's dr. of
this he
right and the end and the probably will
be something else next year docket UK
system reactive your reactive yeah
activity it's a good guess growing
extreme yeah yeah if it was on it yeah
we will see next year will be the year
of the reacting okay excellent i'll buy
you a beer if it's not buddies right
that's a good but let's see you back
here next year then hey I very much hope
so yeah I hope we are due to give some
talks and have fun especially well thank
