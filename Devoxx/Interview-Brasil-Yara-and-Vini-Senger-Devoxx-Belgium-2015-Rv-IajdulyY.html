joined by Vinny and y are a thinker
thank you very much for coming guys and
you guys feel of veterans of DevOps
aren't you yes we just love to be here
it's our pleasure and thank you very
much for an invitation we have been here
in 2011-2013 2009 2010 and it seems
there's a pattern there what the fact we
love that and hope to be other years
here as well and we can see that your
brand did you are java champions yes but
what exactly do you guys do till date oh
yeah that was good java champions
program it's a program that helps
support people that are actively
speaking on java conferences writing
tutorials articles helping to spread
java and they identify these people and
help them to go and travel so thanks
java champion to you know with your help
we are here at devoxx this year Vinny
was nominated Java champion
congratulation yes what made us the
first couple that is Java champion so
Leslie yeah yeah it's a pleasure honor
for us to be Java champion and what have
we had you guys doing here at devoxx a
fake so we have been working on the java
community since 2001 from 2001 to 2009
2009 we were extremely involved with
Java EE and after 2009 vienes saw a big
thing coming a big wave coming it was it
was the makers waved something that came
before the Internet of Things and now
it's more solid and we are doing lots of
things with Internet of Things with home
automation and a little bit of robotics
and helping to teach java ee experts and
also kids to enter on this wonderful
world of internet of things kinda launch
pads yes right because the cs javaone i
think probably think that everyone said
oh this is most exciting thing was the
i-80
that everyone was talking about in Java
in the IOT it seems like it's really
taking off this year yes I think you
know we see several numbers people from
all the big companies Gardner and
everybody pointing for a billionaire or
you know a very rich opportunity on the
next year's but the coolest thing as
Java developers is that with IOT you can
bring the technology to your life in a
more intense way when you are doing java
ee or working with big corporations you
are touching people's life through the
systems but you are not touching you
know your own life in a very physical
way and when you work with Internet of
Things you can you know do things like
Vinny did which was automate the boat
right Vinny yeah that's it yeah if you
look at the internet internet history in
69 internet started with three computers
being connected in us and now we are
almost for billions device is connected
and they estimated that in 10 years we
are going to have at least ten thousand
ten at ten times more devices connected
to the internet so we are created
creating the second generation of the
internet we progress from the University
to people connecting communities
companies making business and now is the
time to connect the things to the
internet and is a great moment for all
the people that work with technology in
general because you need to make
hardware you need to make security you
need to grab the data to starting big
data business intelligence so the demand
for technology professionals will grow
in the same way that the internet are
things will grow the number of devices
so amazing moment for everybody so do
you think kind of maybe developers need
to be doing a little bit more to get
into the IOT do you think are you hoping
that kind of more people and this will
be part of
I'll developers life be soon it's all
red part of most developers life because
you don't have is like cell phone if you
look at the cell phone and the mobile
applications now it's very rare to see a
company that maintain important website
and they don't have a mobile application
right the same thing will happen with
Internet your things more and more the
companies will have the website the
business on the cloud the mobile
application and also additional devices
connected to the Internet to aggregate
value to that business IOT fest as the
first two very well first you think but
there there's another thing that I think
you ask if the developers should go more
and learn and have their own IOT
experiences and there are several facts
that I believe that makes this two
communities very near so when we think
about IOT we were thinking about the
makers movement right people that wants
to make anything make pizza make toys
make bicycles make hardware make their
own you know biking helmet or automate
your own boat and when we are talking
about the Java developers community we
are also talking about people that make
right the open source movement bring the
same responsibility to the developer and
obviated energy as well as the failures
exactly right the open-source developer
shouldn't be waiting watching reading
they should be coding they should be
making they should be sharing so these
two communities they have lots in common
in the sense of the attitude that the
developer should have but the similarity
doesn't stop there so when we think
about this new Internet of Things wave
that is not just the makers but the
internet of things as venis ad big data
and cloud and all that we we faced
several of the same problem that we face
it there last year's with Java EE so we
face the problem you know like how I'm
going to update all the device
or how I'm going to make it very
separate the device from the cloud what
should I use patterns for that you know
what are the technologies to use to
communicate that from this client to
that server so lots of things in common
lots of api's and concepts that the java
developer can leverage to do their own
IOT projects it's a little bit of a
paradigm shift in what you're using
maybe but it's just kind of a case of
don't be intimidated you can do this
it's not just slightly changing shifting
in a bit and one what's that that you're
touching that so when we were starting
with Internet of Things we found what we
and our friends and our local community
found hard to deal with so when you are
working with Hydra most people are
developers and working with hardware is
not the thing that we do that make us
very comfortable so when deal with a
hardware you need to deal with
interruptions you need to understand
which sensors are you going to use how
you are connecting the sensors to the
main board and what's the format of that
data that data comes and then you want
to send to the cloud what are the main
set of sensors people wanted to use and
we see that as the first barrier to get
all this Java developers and and push
them to the Internet of Things so for
since last year's wienie have been
working on this board that the HP left
foot that that the IOT surfboard the
board that enables the Java developers
or any other developer to serve easier
the Internet of Things its kind of
always like a launch pad exactly it's a
launch pad some people ask it asking us
this is this is that does this
substitutes and Hart raspberry pie or an
Intel action and the answer is no this
board is an aggregate aggregate report
it aggregates it brings value to any
other boy that you are already using
as the brain as the main Linux for your
project so this board has an Arduino
Nano which is this here is the Arduino
Nano and here we have all the code to
access the sensors that are on this
board can you talk a little bit about
the sensors yes once you plug your USB
cable into the board and plug in your PC
the board will be read to be connected
to the Internet and we have here gas or
alcohol sensor which is a very alcohol
sensor specifically is a very good one
for devoxx bujin to test different
spheres they get projects we have
infrared temperature humidity sensor
light sensor we have some transistors
relay and we have many connectors that
you can extend your surfboard look new
sensors or you can plug like our
displays and you can increase the
surfboard and customize your surfboard
to your project so it's very fast to
start prototyping and creating a new new
project IOT project using peyote
surfboard we also have a great solution
for wireless communication so surfboard
can communicate using a wavy or using
bluetooth or zigbee or 3g 2g 4g you can
put a GPS NFC RFID and many other
technologies you can aggregate into the
same bored and just plug and play in
your cloud or if you are using the USB
cable just plug and play in your
computer and start having fun even if
you are not a developer so we have some
clues that you can grab the data and
make some logic like if you want to make
a breathalyzer you don't need to write
code you just drag and drop some boxes
using some specific tools and you can
create your own solution very fast and
I know that there's different projects
out there like IBM have an IOT starter
kit I think maybe Microsoft do
everyone's kind of jumping on that but
this is a bit different in it that it's
a crowdfunded project is that correct
yes you know when you have something
that might make a crowd happy it's a
good project for do crowdfunding so I
let the crash is aside if they wanted
when I got exactly so you see a
fantastic experience for us so we what
we did we created the project and we did
a local crowd funding in Brazil so we
use it a local platform that was all in
Portuguese and easier for local
community to understand and participate
so we did a 30 days campaign it was very
intense it was lots of adrenaline lots
of content being generated and it was a
life experience so if you have your own
project and you want you believe on that
and you want to try to take it out from
the paper and bring make the dream come
true as the Disney people would say
crowdfunding is a life experience i
really recommend you java developer or
mobile developer or Internet of Things
developer or maker or make Erica Tamika
try that because it's fantastic they are
you know two months of pure adrenaline
so that with j unit lunch i resell
earlier this year had a fantastic
response i think it's kind of an
interesting sign that the java community
is actually happy to push forward things
they don't just want to wave enterprises
and sometimes you do need that little
bit of an extra kind of capital behind
it yes exactly exactly and I ochi is
also growing a lot with the new economy
if you look at Airbnb if you look at
huber and and the new are sorry they can
share the economy and ground funding and
makers like everything together create a
very nice atmosphere for people that
work with technology so it's a great
moment to be alive and to believe in
this moment in technology works split
that into the Kenai beautifully there
yeah thank you very much thank you for
joining us and we'll put the address so
people interested in your project can
jump on and have a look thank you very
much now we are preparing for launching
the Kickstarter project in US and world
wild so that's a year what should face
yeah if you are interest just google i/o
cheese surfboard we are lucky to be a
rank head in the first of it varies
right away thank you for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
