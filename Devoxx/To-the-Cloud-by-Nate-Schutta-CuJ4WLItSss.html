appreciate it so the cloud strikes me as
quite frankly the fuzziest of the
buzzwords these days I'm not really sure
if we've got anything that's even buzzy
er now I know it's eventually going to
be replaced because that's just the
nature of our industry and my talk
earlier today that was one of the points
I made that over a long enough period of
time whatever choice you make is going
to be wrong and you'll have to move on
to the next thing you have to learn the
next thing evaluate the next thing and
so I do realize that even as big a deal
as the cloud is now in some time period
I don't know if it's two years five
years ten years we'll all be talking
about some new hotness and that's just
the nature of our industry certainly a
lot of this has already gotten to server
lists I'm sure a few of you have played
around that I know Matt did a talk
earlier today about server lists so
there will be something that replaces
this that's natural I'm fine with that
but regardless of how you feel about the
buzzwords or not the cloud is a focus
for a lot of our organizations today and
having come from a large enterprise
organization recently was very clear to
me that a lot of these organizations
people want to own the cloud but they
don't want to actually own the cloud and
so what I've seen repeatedly in my
career is there's a lot of people who
want to get it on the resume they want
credit they want to get the bonus the
promotion for being the deliverer of new
technology but they don't want to
actually sit down and solve the problems
that come along with it because I'm here
to tell you even as someone who is a big
believer in the cloud a big proponent of
the cloud there are real engineering and
cultural issues that you are going to
have to overcome in your organization to
embrace this particular development
model now I know a lot of folks in this
world seem to think there actually are
magic Sparkle ponies I have never seen
one certainly not in any development
projects I've been a part of I know a
lot of organizations seem to think this
is just a technology choice but all I
have to do is pick a platform and all
these problems go away doesn't quite
work that well I wish it did that'd be
really simple I wish it was always a
technical problem I know how to solve
technical problems
my experience with technology the harder
part is the cultural stuff that goes
along with it so what I'm going to try
to do here over the next several minutes
is give you guys a sense of some of the
pitfalls that come into going to the
cloud environment how to avoid some of
them and how to watch out for the
inevitable resume driven design that
seems to crop up in our space now having
come from a larger organization I spent
a shocking amount of my time just
explaining to people what the cloud was
sometimes this was technical staff
sometimes this was our non-technical
business folks but what was very clear
to me after having lots and lots of
these conversations is the cloud means a
lot of things to a lot of people and
amazingly a few of them are even right
about what the cloud means a lot of
misconceptions a lot of people don't
really understand what's at play what it
means for the organization what it means
for their applications and part of this
of course is all the buzzwords that gets
thrown around I would argue one of the
most important things we can do as
technologists is to find them I know
that seems very prosaic and very boring
but it's stunning what happens when
people don't agree on the meanings of
words this is why we came up with things
like patterns so that we could say one
or two things that everybody had a
common understanding of what that meant
so getting to this common vocabulary is
very very important one of the big
things that I had to struggle with in my
last position was getting people to
understand the differences between
private cloud public cloud and hybrid
cloud amazing to me how much confusion
and angst there is around private public
hybrid especially the word public I'm
amazed at how many people think oh well
we can't we can't use the public cloud
because well then our data will be on
the Internet
and we don't want that you know or if we
use Amazon Web Services that means that
our data shows up on Amazon com they
don't seem to understand this
distinction and it's important that we
help them get through that and
understand the implications for public
versus private now a lot of people will
then ask the natural question well which
of these models makes the most sense for
me and my project in my situation there
are three answers that work for every
question we ever get asked in computers
forty-two that's our geek check another
layer of indirection and of course my
all-time personal favorite its pen so
people tell me you know sure we should
be public should we be private I don't
have a default answer that we would need
to have a conversation a lot of this
boils down to your needs how do you feel
about isolation if you have a private
cloud situation you are by definition
isolated this is probably on premises
this is in your data center you're
isolated from anybody else now you can
pay for that on the public cloud
providers cost more and if you're not
isolated but a lot of what this boils
down to is how does your organization
feel about risk I was at a company that
built a data center within the last few
years and I was really surprised that
they made that choice but their version
of risk was we prefer to own this that
just made everybody sleep better at
night can't really fight that a lot of
organizations frankly don't need the
geographical dispersion that comes along
with public cloud you guys remember when
Amazon East went down what was it last
year somebody that fingered basically a
command and oops half the internet went
away for an afternoon you can make an
argument that says why wasn't everybody
backed up and why did everybody have all
sorts of other you know plans and you
know geographically dispersed over here
for a lot of organizations you can't
really justify that expense because how
often does that kind of a thing happen
probably not often enough to really
justify having this duplicated across
multiple regions and the cost that goes
along with that a lot of our existing
big enterprise organizations already
have their own data centers they have a
legacy data center in which case you
might as well reuse that there's not a
whole lot of point in shoving that out
the door quite yet however it's clear
there are an awful lot of workloads that
makes sense to put into the public cloud
once you get over the initial angst of
but what do you mean my data is not
going to be in my data center the Morla
story with anything in technology it has
to make sense for you it has to make
sense for your projects for your
organization and what inevitably happens
when we have these kind of conversations
in a company is somebody is going to
throw around fear and
and doubt as a way of combating what
you're trying to do that's one of the
biggest challenges I face at my last
company was getting people over the foot
of what this cloud saying was all about
and what it meant for our applications
for our developers for our business the
other thing I had to spend a shocking
amount of time defining was all that
azza stuff it's kind of like it's a new
way of defining everything everything is
as a service you know so we got the I as
the past assess the faz pretty much put
anything in front of AAS and it's
probably something in our space whenever
I'm at a conference like this I really
wish someone would invent bathroom as a
service it'd be really nice if the
bathroom could just like dynamically
resize itself based on the crowds that
would be awesome one of things that I've
noticed as we've had these conversations
is of course there's pros and cons to
all of the different approaches I've had
some people argue with me that all we
have to use is because we know we
already have all this infrastructure and
we should just take advantage of that it
look I've got a script that will set
this up really quickly so that's pretty
close to having you know a full cloud
environment and it's better because I
control all of it now personally my
experience has is a pretty darn good
balance in this world it does limit us
in some ways we don't have unlimited
choice we have a few things to select
from build packs but it gives us a very
nice place to be as a developer I don't
have to worry about all the esoteric
that comes along with creating a server
and installing the patches and worrying
about what versions of everything I have
on there and in response to that I get
the self-healing the elastic scaling the
ability to deep revision the deep
provisioning to me is one of the biggest
benefits of cloud that we never really
talked about I think about how many
environments the average organization
has spun up 24 hours a day seven days a
week that are not being touched
if those could go away when you're not
using them for a lot of companies that
would save seven figures that's a big
deal for our companies my last company
we had this conversation and we had
applications where this was the major
driving force to get to cloud was so
they could shut down regions that
weren't being used and then when they
needed them for two days a month a week
a month they could spin them back up use
them and then again shut them down when
they were
I hate reinventing the wheel and so one
of the things I will stress in any of
these situations is you should be able
to take things from off the shelf reuse
them where appropriate do not roll your
own I've seen this happen I've seen this
happen in the cloud space where people
decided hey we're basically going to
create our own version of Cloud Foundry
rolled out of all sorts of piecemeal
stuff that's great if that's your job
it's at your businesses do then create
and sell that kind of a thing but if
your business is something totally
unrelated to that you may have a hard
time justifying that to your business
partners the other thing that becomes
very clear in this world is it's going
to impact your application architecture
and this does bother some people they
seem to think that they can take their
existing workloads as is just deployed
on the cloud everything will work
perfectly and they get all the
advantages of cloud and I never have to
touch anything not how it works there's
going to need to be some amount of
refactoring that's done here again
you're going to get a fear uncertainty
and doubt thrown at you now the
technology aspect of cloud is
fascinating but what's a bigger impact
on organizations from my perspective is
how it changes the way you think so
moving to the cloud fundamentally shifts
the things that you're thinking about as
an application developer and more
importantly it challenges an awful lot
of the assumptions that we've had over
the years as developers I've gotten into
some knock-down drag-out arguments with
developers on scarcity versus abundance
you think about how we've typically
thought about our servers or
infrastructure for an awful long time
boy that's a really scarce resource we
need to optimize it and if we duplicate
this jar across three different
applications well that's waste I've had
that argument with three or four people
in the last six months it's like yeah
there is a slight amount of waste here
however I get an awful lot of benefit by
wasting a few Meg's of space on the
server so if I start treating this as an
abundant resource it changes the way we
think you may remember back when sort of
nuclear power first became a thing and
one of the tag lines that came along
with it was power so cheap we won't need
to meter it same kind of thing here when
you get to the point that instead of
this being this scarce resource that we
need to protect it's essential
limitless and abundant that really
changes how we build applications deploy
applications etc permanence versus
disposability Sam yesterday in a
security talk talked about sort of nuke
and paved and there's a lot of real
benefit that comes from being able to
say I'm not certain I think there might
be a problem
let's just blow it away and start over
you think back to when we first started
building these kinds of applications we
were the people who physically built the
servers our software was running on we
handcrafted these bespoke servers with
love and care and when they got sick we
nurse them back to health
we were very attached to them we gave
them names it's great we need to treat
our servers like cattle today if they
get sick that's a bummer that's too bad
we just need to put out of its misery
and get a new one right and again that
fundamentally changes the way we think
about our applications stateful versus
stateless if I think back to how much of
my career I've spent dealing with issues
revolving around state I sure wish I had
gotten on the state was bandwagon much
earlier stunning how many issues revolve
just around that we've all probably had
this debate the monolith versus
microservices now I'm actually not that
big a fan of everything should be a
micro service this feels like a pretty
large anti-pattern to me there's a lot
of organizations that seemed hell-bent
on turning everything into micro service
without actually asking themselves do we
need the benefits that one gets from
micro service or we better off
delivering this as a modular monolith
model it has like this negative
connotation to it that it's obviously
poorly designed and tightly coupled and
whatnot it doesn't have to be you can
write good code in any language you can
use good patterns in any architectural
approach so we can create a monolith
that actually has some of the features
of micro services without the tax and
the penalties that come along with micro
services Ted talked a bit about this in
his previous session as we move towards
this model it does allow us to be far
more polyglot than it did in the past in
the past we basically had to standardize
and say no for economies of scale
everybody's going to deploy on dotnet
everybody's going to deploy on Java and
this is going to be the app server you
use and that's the way it's going to
have to be for everybody because
no way for us to justify having all
these different environments well now
for just a build pack and it makes sense
for you to use this particular build
pack and it makes sense for this project
you is totally different build pack
that's fine we can get away with that
now that does open up another
interesting question which is how much
leeway do you give people do you truly
let folks just pick whatever language
they want whatever stack they want
whatever database they want that might
lead to madness and probably will in
most organizations
that's the proverbial juggling chains
off a lot of people probably can handle
it but a certain percentage will not and
they will create some major messes that
someone like us will have to clean up at
some point in the future now in order
for this model to work you have to
automate everything this is a huge shift
for a lot of organizations there's still
a lot of companies that have this
dedicated ticketing process and there's
you know weeks if not months of lead
time and all this kind of stuff that
goes into building software deploying
software we need to have as many things
as possible be automated human beings
don't do the same thing every time we're
just not good at that we're not capable
of that that's where robots and
computers become really beneficial if
you write a script and you execute that
script a hundred times it's going to do
the same thing exactly 100 times if you
ask a human to do the same thing a
hundred times they will not do that they
are not capable of that so we need to
get as much as possible into the
automated space we have to deal with the
fact that so many of these things are
now temporary we may create a service it
may be around for six weeks six months
and then it goes away get your place by
a different service you can trash that
with our thinking in the past we were
making these permanent decisions this is
where we're going to live for the next
15 years we have a couch this is going
to be our couch for the next ten years
we will not change it to a model that
says well you know what this isn't quite
working I'm going to rewrite it in Scala
because I think that'll actually perform
better and it will solve these other two
problems we're having we get into the
wonderful Conway's law versus reverse
Conway's law turns out in many
situations the easiest thing to do is
actually reorder your company as opposed
to trying to get people to break out of
Conway's law our systems will almost
inevitably reflect the org chart the
communication channels and our
this is one of my all-time favorites
when I think back to how much effort and
energy most companies go into preventing
failure the reality is you can't prevent
failure you need to plan for when that
failure will happen this to me is one of
the most brilliant things that Netflix
has done with the whole simian army
chaos monkey etc imagine the courage
that took to propose that the first time
that came up so here's I'm going to do
I'm just going to randomly pull out
plugs in the data center and see what
happens make sure your application works
I'm going to unleash essentially our own
denial of service tack on us to make
sure that we respond appropriately
that's amazing but look at what it's
done it's given them a remarkable
ability to be resilient
I can't prevent failure we just can't
it's going to happen bad things will
happen we need to make sure we have
planned efficiently for it and that we
can then react appropriately there's
been an interesting debate my last
company we had this conversation for
about a year and when I first sort of
broach the subject about a year ago the
reaction was of course we need a server
we have to Java EE have to have an app
server and within six months that
attitude to completely flipped to the
idea that wait no no we don't really
need app servers if you're using an app
server you better have a really good
reason why and when challenged most of
our teams weren't actually using
anything specific on the EE side of the
app server and so it's like why are you
paying this licensing cost because we've
always done it that way that's not the
answer they gave me but that's really
what they were saying one of the big
challenges here is it does mean we're
going to have to change our legacy
applications maybe not as much as you
think I've been amazed at how many folks
feel like they have to completely
rewrite their application into a cloud
native micro service polyglot Pali
persistence thing it's like that's not
necessarily the right approach for you
in fact I would argue that the vast
majority of our applications are not
going to be cloud native at least not
right away you make a pretty strong
argument that anything you build today
should be a cloud native but your legacy
code is going to be migrated over a
period of months
years now the closer we can get to that
cloud native Nirvana the better in terms
of really getting all the benefit out of
the cloud platforms but we can still get
a significant amount of value just by
getting our code into a cloud ready
environment I mean some of the things
that I noticed at my last organization
huge improvement in developer
productivity I never met a developer
that after giving them a couple days to
play around with Cloud Foundry they
weren't enthralled they did to loved it
because look I can spin a space up I can
do a push and there's my app and it's
running and it takes seconds not weeks
it's massive my biggest appreciation of
the cloud environments when I first
started playing with them with
consistency
I have lost days weeks months of my life
to well that worked on this server but
not on that server why not well it turns
out the patches were applied in a
different order on this server so that's
why it didn't work there that's a total
waste for an organization and yet we've
done that throughout our careers so the
fact that in a cloud environment what
I'm testing as a developer is the same
thing that my testers are going to test
is the same thing that my customers are
going to sign off on is the same thing
that I can deploy to production that's
huge I would much rather find these
issues out much sooner as well that's
another huge part of being in this cloud
environment I can get things out to a
real environment so much faster start to
find these interesting issues that only
happen once we start integrating and
that fundamentally gives me much much
faster developer cycles you consider the
typical deployment cycle a lot of
organizations it can be hours it can be
days you shrink that down to seconds or
minutes that has a massive impact on our
ability to try things out see what
happens try things out see what happens
get in front of customers get feedback
etc another thing that I really
appreciate about the cloud environments
is currency impact this is another thing
I've spent far too much of my life
dealing with is currency and as much as
we may care about what version of what
server and what operating system we're
on our customers don't they just want
their stuff to work
and so we're spending an awful lot of
time effort energy moving things from
version n minus-1 to version n that's
another form of waste and I think about
how much of my career we've spent all
right we got upgrade the servers so
that's going to be 18 months and we're
going to have to do all this massive
planning and it's going to be this wave
and we're going to do this set of
applications and then inevitably
something doesn't go right and then the
schedule pushes out by six months nobody
enjoys these experiences I've never
enjoyed it maybe your mileage will vary
here self-service this is another thing
on our developers review you really
enjoyed the fact that they could spin up
an environment without having to get
somebody else involved now you can do
some of this in the is base I would
argue it's easier in the path space fact
that I can scale my application up or
down as necessary
as opposed to our typical approach which
is what do you think our worst-case
scenario is all right well let's double
that and then add a little extra and
then that's the amount of capacity we
need so let's go ahead and get that set
up we have to do all that projections
before we've even started any code
because it takes six months to get a
server spun out so we need to do that
before we know really anything about our
application that's generally not a
recipe for making good decisions
I love auto healing my last organization
we had an app that went down but it fell
field and so the architect on that team
was a little upset he's like hey you
know what's going on why'd my app crash
and so we of course did the root cause
analysis but as we were doing that one
of my peers pointed out hey don't you
think this is pretty remarkable the
application crashed and the customers
weren't impacted they didn't notice it
didn't have any effect on the business
that's really powerful now once you
recognize those kind of things you start
to go out of it this is a really big
shift for us in the past and on our non
cloud-based stuff if something like that
were to happen everybody would have
noticed and it would have been a very
big deal there would have been lots and
lots of unhappy phone conversations one
of the things that I had to really
struggle with in my last company was
getting people to understand that cloud
ready is not a binary situation this is
not
you know flip a switch kind of a thing
it is a sliding scale and obviously the
further along on that sort of scale we
call it 12 factor compliance if you want
the more benefit we get from a cloud
deployment however we still get benefit
even if we're not 100% cloud native
Nirvana now the more the closer we get
the better that's cool but it's not a
hard-and-fast requirement the way some
people seem to think it is that's
another thing I've had some pretty long
drawn-out arguments with people about
now that then leads to a really
fascinating question which is we have
this legacy portfolio full of
applications what makes sense to move
what doesn't what should we move what
should we move and that's where we need
to actually do a little bit of planning
now this can be a painful experience but
it is vital that before we plow headlong
down this path we figure out where the
heck we are is if we don't know where we
currently are it's really hard to figure
out where we're trying to get to so we
have to spend some time assessing our
applications undoubtedly some of the
apps in your portfolio are going to be
fantastic candidates others not so much
you need to kind of figure that out
there are certain red flags that we
looked at on our portfolio
look for vendor dependencies an awful
lot of vendor stuff is not certified to
run in the cloud so if you have a tight
vendor dependency there's going to be
some work done there or maybe that
application you're going to have to punt
on I was amazed at how many of our
applications either wrote to the file
system or read from the file system and
that of course is an issue because the
file system might not be there when you
come back we might have to blow that
instance away and start up in which case
the file system is not durable you need
to write that somewhere else if it needs
to be there the next time we talk a
shocking number of Java apps have really
really long startup times that's because
we seem to have this desire to go and
cache the entire database in memory for
performance that's great except if your
application takes 15 minutes to startup
your cloud container looks at that and
says well obviously there's a problem
let me spin up another instance and it
does that ad infinitum until your ops
people come in and crash the whole thing
because your system never started up
same thing on the shutdown side we need
these things to go away quickly and
gracefully so we can spin them up and
spin them down surprising number of non
HTTP protocols have snuck their way into
many organizations this can be a real
problem in our cloud environments I
guarantee you've got some hard go to
configuration hiding in your system
somewhere what do you do about that how
do you get that out of there
a lot of container based shared state
applications expecting somebody else
will have written something here so I
can use it I was surprised to see a lot
of distributed transactions that can be
very painful because again whoever owns
that transaction may not be there when
the transaction actually completes so I
strongly advise you to evaluate your
portfolio evaluate the applications for
how they're doing with 12 factors how
are they doing with these various red
flags very few of these are binary it
tends to be a sliding scale so what
we're fundamentally trying to figure out
here is how far out of alignment are our
applications this is not an easy thing
to do this is not a quick process you
need to have subject-matter expertise on
the project I cannot do a great job of
evaluating your applications I don't
know enough about it it would take me
far longer than it would take one of you
to evaluate your own app my sort of best
guess here is it's at least a few hours
per application with a significant
expert with a subject matter expert
depending on the size of your portfolio
I strongly advise you to build a little
application to capture all of this data
I can tell you from personal very
painful experience Excel is not an
application platform when I did this a
couple years ago we did everything
inside of Excel had I known now what I
knew then I never would have done that I
would have insisted we build a little
application because after we collected
all this data my management team kept
asking me sequel questions how many
applications have XY and Z like I know
you think that's just a simple sequel
command but this data is buried in Excel
spreadsheets but for my good friend John
who is an expert at all sorts of crazy
Excel macros I would still be waiting
through Excel sheets today now
interestingly enough you can use Excel
for HDR photography which is fascinating
but I
would strongly recommend you use it for
HDR photography will before you try to
use this as your platform for figuring
out whether your apps are a good
candidate to go to the cloud now if
you've only got five applications that's
a different story but if you have any
decent sized portfolio you're going to
want some way to store all of this
information that you're going to be
generating doing all the successful work
it's fundamentally going to bucket your
applications up a little medium-high red
yellow green something like that so
you're going to have good candidates bad
candidates kind of in the middle
candidates and understand that wherever
you draw these lines is going to be
arbitrary and people are going to argue
with you about that it's not the
important thing you just need rough
buckets but you do want to kind of
sanity check it does this seem to be
about right or not strongly advise you
to consider the life cycle of the
application as part of this is the
application we're talking about
strategic is this something we're going
to continue to invest in over the course
of the next three five ten years or is
it going away in the next few months now
be very very cautious with retirements
it's amazing to me how many applications
are marked as retired but nobody knows
when it's actually going to be retired
I've run into an awful lot of these in
my career
oh this applications going away and you
ask the wind and it's like well sometime
in the future is that two months is that
two years is that never actually had
this conversation with a person I used
to work with he said yeah you know it's
funny you mention that
when I started the app I'm working on
was marked as sunset that was 25 years
ago
I'm still working on that app today it's
amazing how often that happens in
organizations we want to get rid of it
but the business still has a reason to
keep it around so if it's going to be
around for a year two years probably
makes sense to move it if it's going
away in a month or two obviously
probably not worth the experience the
expense but you have to do that
assessment yourself now once we have
these rough buckets we can actually do
some planning we can try to get a sense
of when does it make sense to do this
what are we shooting for this is another
thing you're going to argue about do we
want everything to be cloud native or is
forklifting enough if we just get it
running is that close enough I guarantee
your legacy applications are going to
require some amount
refactoring and you can have a really
interesting argument over how long
that's going to take in general to get
it running not nearly as much time as
you may think a couple of weeks maybe
maybe a month at the outside of course
ultimately it depends I don't know your
applications I don't know your portfolio
I don't know what kind of patterns
you've used you'll gain experience the
more this you do to help you level set
with this strongly recommend you do a
pilot app or two or three this will give
you a rough feel for what does this
translate into in our organization with
our applications with our patterns
you're going to see all sorts of
different things now my experience at
least with one organization two to four
weeks seem to be about what it took to
get a typical Java app even a dotnet app
running in the cloud not cloud native
not optimized certainly not refactor to
micro services or anything quite like
that but at least get it up and running
effectively and give us at least some of
the benefits of being in a cloud
environment you may want to actually
have a lab full of people that help you
with this develop a certain amount of
expertise work partner with teams to
actually migrate their applications if
you go this route you should definitely
be pairing so that this expertise can
grow you don't want this just to be two
or three people in a room at understand
it you want your whole organization to
understand it at the end of this
planning process you're going to have
essentially a roadmap this is when we
think we can move what now once you have
a rough sense of what that looks like we
can start to have a conversation but
whether or not everybody's happy with
that some people have interesting
incentives to either move faster or move
slower so we need to have a bit of a
sanity check there one of the big
debates that we had in my last company
was does the entire application have to
move to the cloud and the answer that is
pretty unassailable you know it doesn't
there's a lot of portions of
applications that make a lot of sense to
move to the cloud in other portions we
just can't get there at least not now so
we used to refer to these as deployable
units and I hated that phrase we
couldn't come up with a better one if
you've got a better one please let me
love to have a better term here became
very obvious that some portions of the
application would be very easy very
trivial to move to the cloud and others
would be virtually impossible so move
what you can watch out for the
terminology the other thing I strongly
advise you to do is be incredibly
opportunistic about the migrations yep
we have an opportunity let's get that up
and running but you want to have at
least a rust sense of when do we think
this can move and then you start sharing
that with management essentially and get
their buy-in does this seem about right
and you may be in a situation where your
CTO your CIO your senior management says
I want to move faster what's it going to
take to move faster and we partner with
a cloud provider can we bring in some
some consultants can we bring in some
mentors what they can take to move this
faster now I hinted at this earlier but
as I get older as I do more of this the
more I realize just how important
culture is in our organizations now I
would love to tell you that cloud is
simply a technical problem as a
technologist I know how to solve
technical problems my computer science
background never had anything on solving
cultural dilemmas that would actually be
incredibly useful to me in my career to
have a better understanding of how to
move culture shift culture persuade
people change their minds etc technology
is easy technology is an easy problem to
solve it's easy to pick a framework
bring in a vendor bring in a platform it
is much much harder to change culture
culture is where good ideas go to die
it is one of the hardest things for us
to change in an organization it can be
done it's very difficult there's a
really interesting invisibility of
podcast earlier this year and last year
talking about the new norm how to change
norms in an organization and one of the
examples they had was actually oil rig
workers it is very masculine you can't
cry there's no emotions we're all hard
and
and how dangerous that actually is to
their culture and how many people get
hurt and died because of that and the
steps they've had to take to make it
safe for people to say you know what
there's a problem here we need to fix
this people are going to get hurt a lot
of organizations as soon as you try to
change culture culture and side bodies
get released and people push back like
no I like the culture the way it was I
have a vested interest in the way this
culture is i shaped this culture I am
doing well in this culture and you're
trying to change it on me so don't be
afraid to take a step back and ask
yourself as my culture ready for this
how is my culture going to react to what
is a fundamental reimagining of how we
do software one of the most important
things you can do in an organization is
have conversations as people and get
them to understand hey this is what's
going to change in this new environment
this is what isn't going to change I did
an awful lot of day-in-the-life
conversations with people and so you get
all these groups and when they first see
this change one of the things that then
the back our head is am I going to lose
my job is my job going to change so
fundamentally that I'm not going to want
to do it anymore and when you have this
conversation and you basically walk
through ok here's the things that are
going to change for you and here's the
things that aren't for a lot of people's
like oh well that's not so bad
that's not nearly as big a deal that
thought it was going to be there's going
to be changes in practices and which
ones you adopt up to you what fits for
your organization some companies use
this as an opportunity to fully embrace
fair programming others say hey we're
finally going to get on board with TDD
now tests for the win
we're really been saying up what 20
years we're finally going to embrace
continuous delivery we're going to look
into this whole hypothesis driven
development thing maybe we're going to
allow our developers to actually get
work done by removing interruptions from
their days maybe instead of having lots
and lots of meetings talk about status
and progress we'll just have one meeting
called a stand-up meeting we'll do it
the morning but everybody vents get it
over with and then that's it for the day
maybe we'll decide we want everybody to
be together maybe we'll decide we want
really strict work hours maybe we'll
even decide that developers
can use whatever technologies they want
provided they can live with it is what a
lot of companies are doing today you go
ahead you can use whatever technology
you want but by the way you're the one
that's going to get paged at 3:00 in the
morning so make a good decision now
which of these practices make sense for
you and your organization depends
depends on your company depends on your
appetite depends on what your culture
will accept you knew that
what's really fascinating as you see
companies embraces is how often the
silos finally start getting broken down
and this is such a big change for our
company I think about how many times in
my experience I've had this well that's
somebody else's job and I can't help you
with that even though I know exactly
what you need to do my plan says I can
only do a B and C and that's D I can't
help you
it forces people to change these
mindsets you get away from the Big Bang
integration down to hey let's do small
changes do them all the time though
we'll get really good at it maybe we'll
decide this whole Bluegreen deployment
makes a lot of sense and we'll invest in
getting that up and running maybe we'll
finally automate so many of these things
have been a manual process for the last
ten or fifteen or twenty years and they
were never done the same way twice maybe
as we explore some of these alternative
database technologies we get really
comfortable with eventual consistency
I will admit as a developer this one
still kind of gives me pause what do we
mean by eventual when is eventual are my
customers okay with that
maybe we need to think differently about
what an application even is what does
that mean what's that term mean if we're
getting rid of all the model this maybe
all of a sudden application has a much
much finer drain meaning than it had
yesterday and this is obviously true if
we go all the way down the path of
microservices
so now maybe an application is just a
set of deployable unit or maybe we want
to call that a distributed system it's
just a collection of apps now ironically
enough this terminology is one of the
biggest problems I had at my last
company was getting people to speak
different
about the portfolio because our
management had a very vested interest in
talking about the portfolio in one way
at the highest level is that we have an
app called foo and that's the way they
were used to thinking about it's a foo
app well in reality the foo app was at
least 13 different deployable things and
by the time we were done moving into the
cloud it was like 70 different
deployable things but that just kind of
made the CIOs head explode so no can't
talk about that way it's just a foo app
so you have to expect these kinds of
challenges that people are going to get
caught up on seemingly trivial things
like what we call an application one of
the hardest things you're going to have
to deal with here is changing the
culture and I wish I had a magic recipe
for this I wish I had you know just a
wand or I could snap my fingers and make
it happen it doesn't it takes time and
one of the things that became very clear
to me is you need to pick your battles
there are some things that matter a lot
and you should absolutely go to bat for
them and there's others that you can let
go by and that's okay you need to save
your ammunition for those battles that
really matter you need to ask yourself
which things make sense in my
organization I know some companies that
are very dogmatic about we have the same
work hours we start at 9:00 we have a
meeting that goes from 9:00 to 9:15
we take lunch at 1 o'clock lunch is over
at 2:00 and we leave at 6:00 that might
be great if you're 23 24 25 if your
workforce is all in their mid 30s and
above and they all have families and
they all have hobbies all of a sudden
these strict work hours become very
problematic that would sink me
personally my son is involved in way too
many things for me to be able to adhere
to a very rigid nine-to-five type
schedule the other thing that's
abundantly clear is people are not big
fans of change so as soon as you start
changing culture people are going to
push back like whoa whoa whoa I liked it
the way it was even if they didn't
really like it it's comfortable so we
need to have a conversation with them we
need to build that understand hey this
is the benefits to you this is where
we're all going to be
better off when this is done and is
tempting as it is to start fighting
don't it's much more important that you
listen take a step back what are they
really concerned about there's probably
some very legitimate issues here and
it's super tempting to just sort of wave
your hand as they off don't worry about
that that's not a big deal it is to that
person so have the conversation address
that issue as soon as you try to get
angry about it push them around force
them to do something I said this earlier
but developers are like cats if you ask
a cat to come here the cat goes in the
opposite direction on principle
developers do the same thing if I try to
order developer to do something that
generally backfires if we have a
conversation and we help everybody
understand why this is the right thing
to do
attends to work out a lot better for all
of us it's hard to get people to change
it's hard to change your habits have any
of you just laminated your New Year's
resolutions so you can reuse them again
next year
saves on time we don't have to type them
up again I mean it's hard it's hard to
change
there are basically two approaches to
getting somebody to change there's the
hammer and there's the ninja now the
best way I can describe the difference
here is tell you a story about my boy
he's 10 now but when he was younger the
daycare center we took him to had a
standing rule before you release your
child in a general population they're
supposed to wash their hands any of you
that has kids knows their little walking
petri dishes so we'd get there in the
morning I'd say Everett please go wash
your hand any of you that has a
three-year-old and those what happens
next
No so I put on my dad hat I would say it
louder remind him that I'm his father
just in case he wasn't clear on the
relationship Everett I'm your father
go wash your hands twitch you just say
no never
now I would start to escalate because
that's sort of my reaction to a lot of
things and my wife would usually step in
at this point say hey buddy I bet I can
get my hands washed before you can and
she would take one step towards the sink
and he would run over he kept washing
his hands each day ha ha mommy I'm gonna
beat you yes honey yes you are now I'll
admit even at the age of 10 I can still
manipulate him this way I don't know
what happens when he realizes that
though I'm not sure what parenting
technique I'm allowed to use once he
figures out that you know this reverse
psychology thing is how we've been
parenting him for the last 10 years the
moral of the story guys is I cannot
force you to change if you've ever been
in a relationship with another human
being you know it's impossible to get
them to change I can nudge you I can
influence you one of the most important
things we need to keep in mind in any
large company is to awesome we try to
force change on people and we need to
understand that understand the change
has to happen with people not to them
one of my favorite quotes from Dave we
also need to be patient and I'm not good
at this this is one of my weaknesses I
want things to happen quickly get over
with let's go go go if you want culture
to change you need to be patient you
need to let it run its course you also
need to understand that if you change
everything I guarantee you people's
heads are going to explode there is a
finite limit to how much change a human
being can accept in a given period of
time so please do not change everything
at once that said keep at it
keep pushing help people understand why
this is fundamentally in their best
interest keep having that conversation
about this is what a day in your life
looks like now this is what a day in
your life is going to look like in the
future here's what your current tool set
is here's what your future tools that is
going to look like that goes a long way
towards making people feel comfortable
about the change in my experience people
get there especially once they
understand why this is better for them
than the way it used to be once they
understand the benefits I've never seen
a developer run in the opposite
direction it takes time it takes effort
it takes a lot of one-on-one personal
kind of things I have given an awful lot
of cloud 101 sessions in my career
totally worth it every single one of
them was worth it another really
important part of this is give people an
opportunity to play I've never had a
developer once introduced to these cloud
environments that says I don't like it's
not for me once they start playing with
it they're like can I have this now can
I deploy my application there now
because this is way better than what I
have now it's that kind of grassroots
that's a vital for our success and in
the same breath we need to watch out for
the skunkworks teams it's amazing to me
how often a team will go rogue and they
go ahead and bring in their own thing
they roll their own thing and I've also
wondered like why do developers do this
when we have something off-the-shelf
easy if it imbues why would they go
write their own this makes no sense and
that's when I channel my inner Neil Ford
and I'm reminded of a great quote that
Neal has which is simple meta work is
more interesting than work so yeah I
could build the account page or I could
create my own self-healing auto-scaling
cloud environment using docker because
docker is cool and I put doc on my
resume and life is good
that stuff is going to happen you need
to be ready for it you need to prepare
for it and understand that that's going
to happen regardless of what you do
all right so Holly pave the way here how
do we try to make this journey it's not
maybe smooth at least smoother now I
would like to tell you again that just
picking a technology is all you need to
do pick a cloud platform and every other
decision just sort of falls out and
actually and easily it's not how that
works the most important part of this
what I've spent the last two years of my
life doing is helping teams be
successful on these platforms giving
them what they need enabling them to
succeed a pilot application or two or
three is vital to this you were going to
run into all sorts of interesting
roadblocks that you didn't anticipate so
using the pilots we can knock down as
many of those as possible so once we
start doing this in Mass those kinds of
issues have been solved so once we work
through that we can start to take a step
back and say alright do we feel pretty
good about this or their changes we need
to make what kinds of recipes that we
want to give our developers so they know
when you run into this problem here's
how to solve it as an architect I spend
a lot of my time creating little white
paper kind of things or recipes guides
whatever you want to call them we've
used a bunch of wikis for this as well
give people information so that when
they're doing this they know where to go
they're not reinventing this out a whole
cloth had some developers also give
experience reports that's been hugely
valuable this is what we did to move the
is what we experienced this is what went
well this is what didn't go well this is
what we're seeing now that we're on this
environment this is what we're happy
about I've given more Lunch and Learn
sessions on this topic than I care to
count that's also been incredibly
valuable just getting information out
there repeating it again and again and
again you can take out all the way up to
doing full-on roadshows where you maybe
visit various offices and walk people
through this can be a one or two day
kind of deal you put on your own little
internal conference if you want to take
it to that level bring in some training
sometimes that's very very helpful here
sometimes just bringing in some people
who have done this before who can help
mentor your team is all it takes to get
over these homes I'm a big believer in
transparency it's important that you be
able to talk to people about what
applications are moving why they're
moving what applications aren't moving
why aren't they moving and make sure
that folks feel invested in that that
they actually feel part of the process
if they have some ownership in the
outcome now again I can't stress this
enough
this all takes time none of this happens
overnight
you need to get out ahead of that and I
assure you you will repeat yourself this
is a feature not a bug I learned very
early on in this process that I was
going to have to say something three
times before it finally sunk in to the
most of my audience that's okay
it takes time you need to be patient on
this journey whether it's a buzz word or
not I don't think it's terribly
important because the cloud is here is
part of our world so we can get into all
sorts of interesting debates about
what's next but this is what's in front
of us now we need to be very cautious
about our DD good-old resume driven
design there are potholes here hopefully
I've shown a light on some of them
hopefully you can avoid some of them but
I wish you luck on your journey and
thanks for hanging out with me I will be
here the rest of day if anybody has any
questions or comments enjoy the rest of
the show
