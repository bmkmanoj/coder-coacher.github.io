with Jen Tong developer advocate at
Google so you can bring a few talks
about a mobile development platform or
your demonstrating the mobile
development that well could you tell me
a bit about it is it firebase yeah yeah
it's called firebase and firebase is I
use it for a lot of my mobile
development hacking it is a platform as
a service that was originally really
focused on web development but this kind
of hit its stride with mobile
developments and it's a lot of fun to
use and I use it in a lot of my projects
so it ends up working its way into a lot
of my talks and what distinguishes it is
a platform so the way I kind of think
about it is kind of like a bag of
different goodies that can all stand
alone but also integrate really well
with each other so the thing that makes
it different depends on which part of
that bag of goodies you work with but
the one that I tend to spend the most
time with is the real time database
which is a kind of like a big ball of
JSON in the sky but what makes it really
special is that the client libraries do
a lot of the regular boilerplate code
and heavy lifting that you do when you
write an internet-connected mobile
application so it makes a development
process very very rapid rapid and you
know you get to the point of having a
working prototype really quickly which
is a lot of fun so can you give me an
example of an application that you might
build using it maybe like so I mean I
haven't done any mobile development
application any mobile application
development so I wouldn't really know
where to start as a beginner I wouldn't
know what language I needed to learn
what I need to look at if I could this
is easy to drop in libraries as it is
for non mobile application development
like I capture library or something so
kind of our hello world on firebase is a
chat program because it is something
that traditionally requires I'm not a
negligible amount of back-end stuff that
has to be spun up and you can do a
completely server list and it kind of
hits the sweet spot of user generated
data that you want to sync across a
bunch of different clients in real
and in terms of like languages and
libraries we have languages we have
libraries for popular mobile development
like iOS which plays well with Objective
C and Swift Java Android although I've
been packing mostly in Catalan these
days and it plays pretty well with
Kotlin and then JavaScript with
integrations with angular and racked and
stuff like that and all of the features
of the real time database my favorite
feature on firebase is pretty
consistently available across all those
libraries but the library still managed
to kind of capture what makes those
languages good which makes them makes
them excel at their particular purpose
so you hopefully you don't have to learn
any new languages you can just pick up
something you already know and start
working with it yeah thank you very much
thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
