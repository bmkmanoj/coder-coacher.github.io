about the communication gap and if we
can Bridget's and if tools can help we
are this Alka statements my colleague
and myself we come from a different
background Alka has a PhD in computer
science and she used to work at the
Catholic University of Leuven while I'm
coming from the private sector and I
have been working among others as
software tester and a j2ee developer but
at the moment we're both teaching at
university colleges live in Limburg
we're teaching the bachelors applying
flight information technology and you're
teaching them how to build software we
would also like to teach them how to
build software right and how to build a
right software which is not always that
easy that is one of the reasons we try
to introduce testing and our curriculum
so they learn how to build the software
right and for the right software we even
try to bring test-driven development in
the curriculum because with test-driven
development the focus is more to
preventing bugs to write better software
because you start with writing your test
we all know it so writing your test
first forces you to think about what the
software supposed to do then only and
then you start with writing the code
your refactor and then the process
continues we notice it wasn't an easy
thing to do to introduce this we
actually would love for students to work
always this way each assignment start
like that that proves to be impossible
there's no time left sometimes technical
it's two technicals especially for
first-year students so about I think
three years ago we were sitting here and
we were dreaming and saying I wouldn't
not be nice if he could have some tool
that students could just write down the
risks in plain text and I'm press a
button button and then the test would be
generated which was a nice dream but we
never managed to find such a tool but
still that search brought us here
because of course tool automation is
important in this process of test-driven
development typically you start writing
on unit test levels you start writing
your test classes first using tools like
J unit or
Kito or an order mocking tool first test
classes then you're real classes then
you go to have level higher writing
integration tests you might need other
tools like DB unit or arquillian or
whatever tools for the integration and
then finally you end up and the UI user
interface where you start testing like
tools like selenium and so ever so
that's typically how we do it but the
question is is this really test driven
development because if that's driven
development really is about thinking
first and thinking about the
requirements first is this not too late
shouldn't we start earlier on with this
process shouldn't we start at a very
beginning when we're sitting down with
our customer when we were talking about
mock-ups mock-ups and talking about what
the software supposed to do and writing
the user stories shouldn't we start a
test driven process at that exact moment
and not later on when we start coding
and that was actually the question and I
think BDD comes from that background as
well be D D stands for behavior driven
development and it's not really
something really new it is what some
people say test-driven development then
write what you should do is really the
focus was on preventing test the focus
was on was supposed to be on writing the
software the right software and then
North when he wrote his article about
introducing BDD he wrote about how he
discovered that if in your test methods
you used sentence ins and if you just
replace the word tests by the word shoot
that you actually already end up with
other tests a better test because even
that focus would change your focus from
testing and finding books to behavior
and thinking what a software supposed to
do and then he realized that the
vocabulary you use in your test that is
actually very important and so the
template was originated there and even
when then a template you use for writing
specification you start given a certain
context when you do certain action then
you expect a certain outcome and the
idea is to write your specifications
your test your requirements in this way
with this test
this template the good thing is it
forces you to focus on what the software
really is supposed to do but there's
also another aspect which is good
because you're starting to use a
language ubiquitous language everybody
you have you using a very clear language
you're using very clear sentence and a
very clear layout you also encouraged to
work to use examples and because you
write your specification this way you're
avoid misunderstandings you get a
language that all people involved
understand so you have less risk of
information loss instead of one person
doing the analysis and giving the few
documents to the developer and who's
writing the code and will then pass it
on to the tester it's actually you get a
language that that enables you to set
together and think about what the
software has to do together and that's
you might have heard about the three
amigos that's actually the ID that's the
business analyst the developers the test
if they also together to think from the
beginning to think about requirements
about the specifications and about what
the software is to do and having that
ubiquitous language enables you to do
sand and enables you to work this way
anuria one more advantage may be of
having such a language if you start
using such a domain-specific language
that opens possibilities for automation
again and then we're back to a dream
where you could press a button and the
test will be generated which a stellar
dream but still it brought us into
contact with some tools that already
existed so if you have a look at BDD the
first step is specifying your
requirements using the given one dance
style and in the second step the goal is
to make these specifications execuse
executable using a tool well as you can
see there exists a lot of tools for
doing this however there's no golden
standard yet so the question is which
two to choose in the past two years we
have done a research project on which we
made a list of all the existing BDD
tools
as you can see on the right side of the
slide did this became a very long list
so the thing that we did was we defined
some criteria the two main criteria
where that there was activity on the
tool within one year because there
wasn't release the last year and the
second one was that the duel has to
exist almost three years or more more
times and then at the bottom you can see
well we focused on Java BDD tools so the
past two years the list even became
shorter well so this were the tools that
match the criteria the activity and
immaturity and doing the research last
post you two years well even some tools
disappeared because they didn't match
the criteria anymore so like you can see
janerio fitness twist that were tools
that disappeared from our list and in
the last two years also to other tools
became available well green pepper is or
at this well it is coming with a new
release so we still are looking at it
and then the first one well it's the new
version for tryst actually and well we
experience with all the tools so we did
a lot of experiences demo applications
even with a customer and well the
question is did we find a winner well
actually the tool that you need to
choose depends on a lot of factors as
you can see her on the slide one of the
fact factors is the involvement
involvement of the customer do you want
that your customer also writes
specifications well then you need two
choose some of the tools other tools are
less available for that another goal is
do you want to write acceptance testing
or a unit testing or even more focus on
a UI driven testing that also is a
factor that you will need to handle and
to choose between the different BDD
tools so the thing that we did was we
saw a categorization of the tools as you
can see you sea cucumber and JB FL there
are two tools that are made to write
your specification in the given one
dance style you can use that style there
if you have a look at Concordia well the
specifications are written in HTML and
on the right side you see the more Skala
groovy specific BDD tools you can also
see a robot framework that's more
specific when you want to use when you
want to may make UI tests so that's
robot framework and then serenity it's a
wrapper around some tools which give you
more nice reporting in the next 20
minutes I think we will give it a
demonstration on three tools we will use
a simple demo application which focuses
on the calculation of the body mass
index of patients so the thing that
people can do is they can register
themselves they give a social security
number their birthday their gender and
they also can give examination details
so they can say well at this moment my
length is that and my weight is that and
then the the body mass index can be
calculated the scenario in which we will
focus in the demos is the scenario where
we want to show all the details of one
specific patient with that specific
social security number so on the slide
you can see the scenario with the given
one dance which we will go into detail
and for some of the BDD tools we're not
going to do any real life coding you
were too scared to do that because we
didn't want to get anything to go wrong
because there's not much time so we just
made a little screencasts for each tool
I'm going to try to lose to learn no so
the first tool we wanted to try boss I'm
sorry ah sorry okay I can see I have to
change my display okay can you see it
not that should be better so the first
two litters trying to show you Scarlett
as Scarlett s is one of it was on the
third column and that column was the
tools who were using other languages but
also languages who could work with the
Java Virtual Machine so mostly Scala or
groovy that's not the only thing they
had in common they also had in common
that their focus was more developer
centric while the other tools or
sometimes more customer or business
analyst centric those are more developer
centric which hopefully you will see in
the coming movies so I hope you can see
it when we should start sorry he's not
starting okay i'll see if i open it in
the browser of this will go better
sorry for this I thought nothing to go
wrong with this one a way of working but
I was wrong yes that's perky mirror so
you see i'm working in eclipse know with
a scallop plugin enabled and i'm
creating a scholar class which already
considers is already a scholar clause
not the plaintext class with a scholar
class its coding and a scholar class has
to extend what they call a feature spec
that means i'm telling scala that i'm
going to write features with scenarios
and that they have to consider each
scenario as one test and then i'm using
the given when then trade as i say which
say you can use to use that given when
then syntax i can also choose for other
types of syntax but here i choose for
the given when den style so I start
writing a feature I hope you can see it
the code I'm writing a feature I can add
additional information for instance the
narrative of the user story i can put
here with us in four lines and then i
have to start writing a scenario so i
can use a scenario keyword i have to
give the sentence or generic title of
the scenario and then I can start adding
my given when then statements and so
you'll see i started given i should
start with given so i use a given
keyword and then I give the sentence a
patient with a certain security number
gender and birth date and then the
patient had also has a length and a
weight and I have to make sure that
patient is register the system otherwise
I won't be able to retrieve it and then
when which is actually thing I want to
test when I ask for the details of that
patient then he should return all the
information so that is actually my
scenario that is the way and that is
what BDDs about you try to explain a
positive or a moment you try to write
your tests this way this is a little bit
technical but I mean those are also
sentence
summer can read and understand and it's
it's very detailed it's formulated very
detailed so there should be no
misunderstanding what this code is
supposed to do that is the whole point
that your dad detail that everybody
whether it's a customer or the analysis
of the developer or the tester that they
all have the same ID that they all have
the same expectations of the code I
write pending because I don't have any
implementation for my test yet but I can
still normally I should be able to run
it as a tests which I'm going to do now
so what is happening well two things
well first of all in the console you can
see that he actually and the feedback he
gives you he shows the whole scenario
the whole user story he shows it in
plain text so for a customer this is
already more readable there's also a
little bit of statistics about the tests
in my scarlet test window I can see the
output which is more interesting for a
developer phone from a developer point
of view again you can see the user story
you can see the whole scenario but the
really nice thing about this tool is if
I run it as a maven build no because
that old put in text was maybe readable
for the customer not really fancy but if
I ran my maven build normally he should
show me he should generate some HTML
which is of course then nicer to show to
your customer or anybody else on the
team to all of stakeholders so he's
running the build and then he should
have generated an HTML file which is
here and when I open it then you can see
it so he will show you he will create an
HTML page content containing all the
information so you can see here on the
bottom the story i just made you can see
how many test succeeded well there's not
much of course that's just one pending
for now but everybody involved I mean
this is HTML so you can just put this on
a server that's accessible for everybody
so everybody can also see the status of
your project which of course makes it a
nice tool
and wish which improves the
communication if you want to see more
about the story can click on the link
and then you see the detailed scenario
and again everybody can see it as the
customer can see this customer can see
where a home which you have tested we
can also see if there's something he
doesn't agree with when a few minute
misunderstood something everybody can
see the information so everybody can
give the feedback as well so this was a
part of writing specification but I
haven't done much testing yet so that's
we have another movie for that one so
here's my specification again I said
others was the test about showing
personal details the class i'm actually
testing is this one the person service
java api which has a few methods and the
gate person method is a 1 i'm testing
returns a person detail object so that's
one I'm going to test so what I'll do
first i'll create a variable containing
and reference to my service object it is
scala but i didn't know any Skala before
i was doing this and the learning curve
is not that bad as you can see you can
use java classes here just a class to
quickly work with dates and then i start
implementing my steps so I have my given
step and then i have to add code here to
create a patient because i have to
register patient first before I can ask
for his details so here I'm writing the
code to create this patient the next
line here i'm going to add some
examination data length weight and so on
then in the next end i have to make sure
the patient is known to the system so i
have to add it to the system and then i
will call in the when step i will
actually call the method which I want to
test and I will store the result in an
object date details retrieved and then
if you look and in the damn steps that's
where you were going to vary are going
to do the verification so here I'm going
to write assert statements to see if the
information I retrieved from my system
is
what I expected so that is very actually
writing the real test know so you still
have to write some test code that is the
bad news but the good news is it's it's
you can combine it with more with
functional information with logical
information with non technical
information and you can create nice
reports for your customer I'm going to
fast forward a bit because those sorts
or really self-explanatory I think so I
write all the assert statements normally
then I have to check the beach body mass
index as well and at the end I have to
remove the pending line because now i
wrote my implementation so pending stuff
should go and then when i run my tests
then he really should execute it and
show the result
and here you can see the test result
which is no green and nothing pending
man one test succeeded so this was just
a very short little Dame of Scala test
as you can see you still have to write a
test yourself but it's from a different
point of view it's for a more functional
point of view which is what we liked
about this tool next alch is going to
show to other examples okay so i will
start with the concord ian i will first
open it
okay so if you use a Concordia you will
write your specifications in an HTML
file so first of all we will make the
HTML file well if you use Concord Ian
this bag says that you need to do it in
a folder test specs so not in the test
resources or folder but that you can
change if you want so you make the HTML
file we have the same example here so
you can see the narrative you can see
the acceptance criteria so the first
scenario with the given wet dance and
then we will make a java class in which
we will implement all the steps so all
the given when dance steps so we call it
show patient details test and here we
need to add some annotations so that
it's a Concordia entrenar so that it's
not a plane j unit a test that you will
run but a concordant a test and you can
so that's sitting it is done here if you
go back to the HTML well there you can
see that we still add some the den
Clause the end close I will forward a
little bit because we are running out of
time the main thing is this part I think
well the thing is here you in your HTML
you will make a link with the code that
you are going to write in the show
patient details test so here i'm
specifying that the social security
number is a parameter so at ya hashtag a
number i do the same for the gender and
the birth date so we can use parameters
here and then in the p in the paragraph
in the next step i will make a method
that will be executed so i will still go
forward a little bit i think i just set
all the parameters here
I'm so sorry the making executable can I
open it faster than this can i just drop
it perhaps so here you can see that we
add in the paragraph of the given step
also concordia HTML tag but execute and
we will call a java method initial I'll
initialize person details at which we
will pass all the parameters so the
social security number adda gender which
is male and the birth date that is given
there in specification so the next step
is that you implement this method in the
show patient details test so that's the
thing that's been done here so we make a
method and it's just the same
implementation like has been done in
Scala test example so i will go forward
so you can see all the things are done
then we run the test you just run it
like a Jai unit test would you get more
information well you get in the console
you see that you have no successes and
no failures but if you go to the j unit
view you can see a green mark but the
main thing is that you need to go to the
HTML file which you can find somewhere
in in a folder so that's the thing that
i'm going to now and there you can see
well if you use asserts that's not done
yet but i will show it in a moment if
you use asserts then you can color your
HTML green or red depending on whether
your test is succeeded or is failed so
this is the HTML well in this case the
given step it's only a execution so it
doesn't report anything but the given
step is now executed so that method is
execute if we go forward then you see
here
in the in the end a step and in the
dance step there isn't there's an S so
true yeah is it true then you can see
that in the HTML reporting you can see
that those steps are by color green so
those are succeeded and you also see in
the console that there is a success of
two steps I think that's enough for
Concord Ian if it's the left i'm i will
do a cucumber okay so if you use
cucumber well the thing there is you
just specify your given one dance in a
separate file in a feature file so we
make a show patient details feature file
there you just write your given one
dance your scenarios so that's something
that your customer can do or your
business analysis I can do and the thing
then is if you have all your
specifications here you also make some
Java classes I won't go into details
because we don't have time but i will
show you what cucumber does well if we
now run one of the Java classes then you
can see that in the console a lot of
steps are generated for you so the thing
that we did in conclusion was we did did
it ourselves we did it we needed to make
all the methods ourselves in the given
one dance here or based on your given
when dance steps the test methods are
already generated so you can copy paste
them and you can implement them in your
java class also in cucumber you have
reporting so you have an HTML file which
you can ever look at here you can see
that it's yellow or meaning that it's
not implemented and it changes when we
implement all the steps I think we will
go to the conclusion or shall I show the
dream us 10 mins in cookie so we have
them
the specifications written now we want
to implement them so the thing that you
do is you make another Java file in
which you implement other steps well we
copy the thing from the console to our
Java class and then we will implement
all those steps like done in the scala
test demo we will implement it we will
run it again you see that it's a queen
it's not all green only the first given
step here is a green so that's I think
an advantage of a cucumber because in
conclusion it's all green and if we
refresh that HTML report again then you
can see that the given step is also
called Cree so that's tank thing the
basic things from cucumber it will go
back to the slides yes so those were
very short demos but I hope you saw I
mean the different ways of working with
Scarlett as we started with one Falcon
clear everything which contained
everything in Concordia there was
already separation of concerns you had
your logical point of view your business
point of view and your HTML file and
then your developer point of view in
your test file and cucumber took it a
step further because they had a business
point of view a text file with just
plain text so nothing else nothing you
have to expect from your customer or
your business at least they don't need
any technical knowledge they can just
focus on writing the specifications if
you're more interested if you would like
to play around with those tools yourself
there's actually hands on lab tomorrow
morning so then you can try it out
yourself maybe a very short conclusion
at the end it's not about the tool the
whole thing about BDD I'm you showed you
some tools that was a point of a tool in
action of course but BDD of course its
value it's not the tools it's actually
the way you express your specifications
and this way because it really leads to
better specification whether your autumn
eyes it only make them executable or not
it's it's it's a process itself of
course which is info
orange but if the other question of a
tool can help we think yes because
you've seen all those tools I mean
they're comparable comparable comparable
with other test tools like j unit but
they have that extra documentation
reporting aspect which improves your
communication with your customer and
which creates living documentation of a
high quality if you use them we said to
be continued because we saw in the past
few years how the landscape narrow
toddlers with fewer and fewer tools
remaining but we still don't think
there's a golden standard yet who is the
best tool there is some tools definitely
more popular than others but we still
think there's a lot of work to do there
that there's still a lot of
possibilities to exploring all those
tools so i will definitely look further
into the subject i don't know if there's
any questions I know if you have time
now we don't have much time it may be I
know there's any questions okay thank
you very much for your attention</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
