experiment we are today we're going to
try to play a game with 100 phones and
my name is Ennis McClay I'm a lead
developer of you bonita platform and
before we start playing the game and as
I understand we have a half an hour so
we can we can really enjoy ourselves
today I'd like to explain something
about the you bonita platform itself so
that you understand why i created it and
how it was created and ability is really
a cloud platform for developing and
running games as a multiplayer game
platform in the cloud basically so there
are a lot of game engines out there
right this there are a lot of 3d engines
t2d engines and by building the this
platform we really target two very
specific kind of games first of all we
would like to have single screen display
so we all see together with friends and
play a game looking at one big three of
course we introduce 2d graphics and 2d
graphics is typically easy to to view in
a big screen whereas 3d graphics 3d
graphics could be difficulty and we put
in physics because physics are fun right
and any platform really focuses on
multiplayer functionality so it's all
built in and one aspect it's really
clear from the start is well everybody
should be able to easily join a game so
it doesn't help if if people need to
install stuff or buy hardware or and so
on told so we thought well why not use
the technology and the devices you
already have and to make this this game
available to you as a player both to
interact with but also to watch so we
use a browser to watch what we call the
cinema part of the game that's why the
two game is actually displayed and we
use the same browser on your phone as
the controller part
this is one of the example games we were
facing it so here you see two guys pick
up the phone and the play or they
actually test again pre-roll for dr.
Illes is it this visible I think so yes
so like I said earlier it should be easy
to join so no installation right no
special hardware are then smartphone
which is capable of just sending the
interactions you do with the phone no
registration of this game it also it is
it's really preventing people from
joining existing game and of course no
payment who who pays for games right to
play and then we thought besides of
thinking about well so that we have two
dead fish realization part and the
controller part how about creating these
games and then then we do realize well
JavaScript API is really simple language
to learn very powerful there are lots of
libraries out there so why don't we
provide this game platform a simple
JavaScript API using that API you can
create sprites move them around respond
to events and so and of course again is
another game without images sounds and
data to to process and that's how they
all come together in one platform this
is one of the first working demos I
created this is actually my daughter
playing on the ipad as you can see she
use the ipad to interact and she just
draws shapes and and then tries to
interact with objects created and view
so i use a simple monitor arrested what
we called the cinema and just touch
input from the ipad HD controller
so let's just ha let's look at how this
actually was created so we created at
least two input modes for the controller
one is called the draw input mode and
the other is called the edge input mode
using the draw input mode you can
gesture put gestures on your throne so
for instance if you want to draw a
triangle notice that it is
counterclockwise then the control will
send a gesture event to the server here
somebody draw a triangle and you in your
script react to that event inside well
maybe I want to actually draw the
triangle itself and on the right you see
the edge input the edges input is
triggered when you take your phone and
place to touch two fingers basically on
your phone that you create an edge
injection let's look at this small part
of this script this is actually the
script you write that gets executed on
the server and this particular part
reacts from the event called player
joint someone connected to the server
play a joint what should happen and the
first step we enable the input draw so
you are not on your controller this this
particular player will actually react to
destroy events and send gestures but
also the edge input sub both be single
and to touch our enabled next we give it
in a bit of a color and we also tell
player well if you use the edge mode
then we want to show it on the on the
cinema so we enable the output called
edge so why not reply this so I'd like
you to join me on this game enter this
URL that fox given is calm and you
should see kind of a wedding screen that
looks like this
just waiting and that's because I have
to start again first yes thanks so is
somebody draws the six egg and we can
stall her start all over I see at least
one person who's able to interact stara
yes oh okay it's full yes hi only
allowed to 10 people but I don't see ten
tenors moment but there will be a next
game or all of you can join so as it
this is an example how hard it can be to
be to build a game that actually is
really playable I mean do you know which
control switch and so who's doing what
so let me continue to the next part so
we can really play the actual game so
so I make you wait now that's correct
keynote
so I afraid I'm afraid to start it again
let's do it anyway so we were here so
this is a beacon of an overview so this
was happening i created the game i
called it one of the assets i uploaded
to do this game server and the game
server is now ready to accept
connections and there are two kinds of
connections one is connected to the
cinema in this carries my laptop shown
the cinema part of the game it will
receive all the display information from
the server and of course you having a
phone or any other controller device
it's connected to Wi-Fi or 3g sending
all the commands sort the interactions
to the server and as a developer I just
publish these scripts and images and all
the other data and Alan you Benito calm
I can start as Gabe and open in a
display on this particular game and as
soon as the game is running everybody
can join like I just showed you so
before we do the the bigger game I was
planning to do today I want to inform
you that we are doing a better testing
now so if you send me a request to this
address I can provide you with in a URL
so that you have your own development
server and you can start playing and
write games yourself so I'm going to
switch again at this time it works
so I makes age
and this is level one
so the goal is to occupy the circle so
you are on the left in the blue team or
the Green Team so the purpose is to get
the highest score so that you win this
particular level I see blue is really
trying hard okay you give me the music
oh it's not on
I create some music with goes with that
damn it sorry about that guys open
reasons looked
yes
you sound
can you put it laughs yeah it is but
so what happens
hmm okay I first not be fixed game
itself to crash
oh my internet has calmed connection
dammit
I no longer internet so maybe you guys
switch to Wi-Fi instead there it is okay
yes
and you let a lot
yes I'm not touching it
assume you're close to each other c72 so
if you manage to be that's the same
number then you stay on this level I
noticed
bye
you
maybe we can try another one
so let's try this
you
you
yes of course the difficulty is is yeah
we do I represent I should have given
you number so you know which number is
yuzu but maybe you can do better i
invite you to create your own game
yes
ok
give me one more
excellent
do you want to try the other one what's
more
so actually I actually prefer four
levels some reason we gon get past the
first one and so when creating this I
realized that you compare the part is
really interesting in the game right
having two teams rookie you can see
chara chara and then it no longer reach
it's really important who's who in this
case so let's see if we can get to level
two
you
nope sorry guys
with missing
okay thank you for joining me and have
to see your games so thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
