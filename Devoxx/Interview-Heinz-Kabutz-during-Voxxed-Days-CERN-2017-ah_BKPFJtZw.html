expert in concurrence the in parallel
programming so we're at cern in the home
of the large hadron collider and one
event causes team megabytes of data the
readily with billions of events so that
should be easy for you right yeah right
yeah i'm completely intimidated by this
place absolutely and I yesterday we're
internist or CMS I always thought that
substantial concurrent mark sweet but
it's something else and contraband what
it isn't something move on or something
collider and just seeing the the stuff
they do here I'm compete intimidation
crisis place and here they invented
internet so how do you get up and talk
about dinner Travis wedding or manage
block off to that one you know this just
you can't get back from that well folks
join is pretty complicated not compared
to inventing the internet maybe now or
getting a trackball invented touchscreen
or inventing just goes on and on you
know so yeah it's a sweetie the suffered
is really very simple in comparison to
what did you hear it's a it's it's
supposed to be simple it's supposed to
be easy to understand tourists us
basically I've got a job to do break up
the drop in 22 and 23 so I might be a
must afraid cool and yeah I'm delegate
one dub to you another thread your and
another thread we don't have a third
person and when you have finished you
come back together and give me the
information is that right no not really
because the marshall street is not it's
not going to sit idle awaiting for stuff
too happy the Marvel is going to put up
this seasonal help to the you gotta
work stealing our going in part of shut
up here so that's that's where the works
the working is related to that and
basically what happens is that the most
of it would say got too much work to do
let me for cough with me let me divide
the work in half I'll do half and give
out half to maybe someone else to do so
the other side would then pick that up
and say well it's not too much for me or
the master might still say that work is
still too much even harvest
should I break it up again and we keep
on breaking it up it's called recursive
decomposition and this way the work
stealing comes in that you you sometimes
have have have traits where the cues are
too long and threads which are idle so
the faith and steel work off other
traits choose and it's better like when
you go to block a check out and you
nutella opens up and they steal this
still work or other cues so the big
words I need to do what's with the idol
see make sure using like the full
computational right very available
number one exactly known problem is that
you can have is that you is that time of
the threads might lock there shouldn't
block but if I do then you you'd have
less rates actually doing work with a
sitting there waiting for stuff to
happen and it's bit like when you go to
the checkout counter and the person in
front of you didn't ring up the didn't
weigh the vegetables right and so there
now they they they block the line and
they say what we're going to block the
line and in the meantime there's
somebody from the runbook to weigh the
vegetables you're standing behind the
gang like why don't their way they midst
of all singer stupid so you have to wait
for them to so the teller is blocked
alright so what the man is blocker would
say it would say right that's fine d
said cue the the person who is who I
tried to wait because it's vegetables
now goes to another tool and open that
up it is right just come here so the
others go day and keep on working so you
have more throughput ok so the managed
blocker when it noted the blocks move
the bottleneck somewhere else no you're
cute I mean I said the fork to Uncle
itself does it so the fuk Torin eternity
when it sees that they're the traders
blocked with the managed blocker then it
goes and it's my start another fridge to
pick up a snack city the pearl isn't the
same throughout
