Federico you're giving a church date can
you tell us a bit about your talk okay
hi everyone
well yes I gave a talk about
domain-specific language and about using
them in specific language in a pragmatic
way because I come from an Academical
background and you know there are a lot
of ideas that are very interesting and
looks very good on paper and when you
try to apply them they really don't work
out because the return on investment
don't make them worse so I try to
present an approach for building
languages that give advantages but have
a limited cost so that they are actually
feasible is something people can do even
in small companies so what's the first
step when you think you're writing in a
specific language say for a particular
use case well the first step is not
technical at all this understanding the
domain so that's a some intellectual
challenge there is there because you
have to understand how people think
because you are building a tool for
people thinking so the first step is
understanding what kind of abstraction
people use in a specific domain and
there you dar know mammals for that but
so the only thing that I can help with
is that the technological path so what
comes after and for these there are
different tools and different framework
in this case we've used
antor these permits to generate election
on the part serve very easily and we
also use cotton to breaking the code
it's our sort of superpower because it's
so concise made things so much easier
and nicer to write that really helps
bringing down the cost of creating a new
language when you think it's a good idea
to buy a domain-specific language and
when is it not really worth it
well given ideal language for living for
me it's always a good idea to hire me to
be the language
but I would say when you have domain
experts I'm involved in the process I
think that language can be the perfect
tool to make them participate in the
process I like to think that by using
them in specific language you can have a
sort of extreme mature process because
you can really involve users in the
development they can at least give you
feedback even on a daily basis because
they really can understand the system
they can interact with the system and so
they have a completely different role we
don't have the risk of developers
talking once with domain experts then go
away come six months after and everyone
has a complete different idea of what
the system was supposed to do in these
ways they are part of the system they
can help ensuring that everyone is
aligned so it's very important well so
you're kind of using its main specific
language not only as a tool but also the
way to ensure that you have consistent
communications yes definitely it's it's
a way to capture domain knowledge in a
way that everyone can understand and
contribute to it and there are also
other benefits because once you capture
this knowledge at the very high level
you can then change the technology that
you use to leverage this domain-specific
knowledge a simple example a company
used to work with they created this
language they used to generate console
application 20 years ago now they change
the generator at the language stay the
same and now the generate web
application so it's very important
because the domain knowledge that is
started as a real value can last and
survive even technological revolution</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
