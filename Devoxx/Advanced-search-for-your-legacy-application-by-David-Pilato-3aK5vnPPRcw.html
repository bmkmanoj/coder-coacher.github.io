add the social shine on top of your
Lagasse application IFC that has been
trending topic today legacy things
that's cool by the way we speak in
French speaking French so I'm from
France but this talk is in English in
French English so this talk is based on
my own experience when I was working at
the French customs and I get exactly the
same use case I had an application
running with the Postgres database and I
wanted to add a social trainer on top of
that and so this is basically my story
at the end of the talk I would really
like if you can go to the to this
webpage and hear and feedback if you
have questions during the talk with each
other elastic you can ask for any
question you can vote for the question
from the overalls I also post you know
my repository that I'm going to use
today and if I have time so elastic we
are
product the name basically we are
providing an open-source typed name
based solely on the elastic search
realistic search is a search enjoy where
you can you can send Jesus documents
everything is index inside isaac search
it can scale horizontally it can deal
with petabytes of data whatever you so
really easy to use you can see that in a
second I think us-cuba know that you can
put on top of elastic so it's a UI we
are going to see that also here and
there is an interest layer named bits
and logstash it's our agents that you
put on your edge machine tools are
collecting data like logs
matrix of activity whatever you and
everything is done to elastic section
where you can visualize or that Rockstar
is a ETL tool and all this tag is open
source right you can use that for free
if you want business what what you want
as a company we are providing what we
could expect expect is a set of plugin
so where is a free version of its
commercial offers and it brings you some
new features like security alerts in
monitoring reporting
of exploration and machine on I don't
want to want to mention two details but
everything is available also on a cloud
so you go to cloud that elastic that
probe or that set for you and ready to
go so I'm definitely torn that we need
on Twitter I want to follow me when I
will share also linked to the repository
that I'm going to use today
so tell me my name I have been working
on the elastic search for more than five
years now so we can see my treat here
since 2017 I starting to become more an
evangelist so we can see less crowd now
I'm speaking more I'm cutting less I
need a summer winter summer I have some
time to curtain continues still under
project okay so the repository I'm going
to start from is this one so it's on
github that one day / Leggett see -
research and you will see some
instruction in the readme and with those
instruction you will be able to repay
everything later and you have different
branches those are the major steps that
I'm going to follow and if you want to
compare what
and basically what I'm going to to
explain today okay so this is the
repository planning to use what do we
have so we are starting from an
application the application is a java
application I hope that you're familiar
with Java you I also this application
this application is managing persons
so those person have feel like a name
the date of birth gender and more
children some marketing that others are
controls here I'm not going to use that
today and also an address which is
containing a country or city the country
code and geolocation point with a
latitude and longitude so this is the
pins that is my model and I'm using
Postgres database I'm using IBM behind
the scenes and I generated this scheme I
am well I have a table for concern the
table formatting and the table for
address where I have to let it inside so
this is what I have with my application
I'm also providing so this is really
like this what I want to do I want to be
able to search for people right I'm
going to inject report in my database
and I want to be
to search for them for now I know every
person so I'm going to use an injector
that I did so it's going to generate
quantumly let's say ten thousand person
in the database so random data that I'm
going to search for just after noon so
this is a burning yeah we are sending
data to the process database and if I'm
searching so we can see that we're so
tentacley right and why those data is
coming I can start for search for
something like okay I want to search for
true of white amber this is the least of
the drew that I had so I have to put a
girl legs in future and I also have a
bad one sided search feature which
specifically I want to search the name
field in the country field and those are
the two kind of search that I have
okay so what's wrong everything is
working right so I am here so I can
search in different fields let's see if
I can search on the gender the way
counts okay with that later so I can
search for Joe Smith it works very well
I can search for Swiss obviously Smith's
Joe I can search for Swiss Joe right I
have a implementation issue here we are
going to see what is happening gained
assignments we understand what is
happening okay
can I switch tables
that's another Israel I can search for
city for every yes that's okay I can
search for country sorry
ah that's interesting with your senior
exactly that's the point actually I'm
super surprised by the risk by the way
do you know whatever so what is
interesting here is that on the risks
that I have I have this false guy but
for God is committing the second place
second position I'm not expecting that
affection you because false game is like
a unique term in the name field I would
expect it to be on the top of the day
this is more important for my use case
if I am socially for France to fight
someone which which name is from the
century
so that's French that I have this
results in that order and actually we
can explain that because I have injected
probably in my database once again into
second position
after Joe Smith so that's the reason
it's coming into second position instead
of the top authorities so this is not an
issue because I have a new hue of data
so I can go for the babies to fight my
guy but I'm not expecting that what I'm
using research on drying like if I'm
using I'm expecting that on the top of
the first page I'm finding that I was
looking for watching so this is a
question of 11c right you want to
provide a search engine which is
whatever to your user and now you can
fix that use a social join mr. sunshine
is before that right so I'm going to use
a social idea yet search is the best
choice ever
but I'm is
the question is now how you can send the
data that you have in the database to
move elasticsearch you need to
synchronize all those information so
what you can do you can use an ETL
Thailand for example or maybe it was a
very good tools or works - I mentioned -
so you can do that and now you can run a
batch every five minutes we're going to
run a sequel program your database
transform that to Jesus and that we last
exposure but what is the problem let's
say that my user click on the Save
button is the application here he will
have to wait for five minutes to see the
record appearing in the interesting
sense right so it's not real time and
how can I deal with updates or deletes
if I'm updating a document what should I
do the next time I'm running to the
batch should I consume again the whole
database or index everything or just use
maybe I can add a technical field in my
database which is the last date I
updated something and then compare my
date until it is even worse because you
need to remove something which is not
coming back
if you remove something that abase you
need to be aware that something which is
not coming back as - may remove the nest
itself so it's super power and to me
this is not my favorite way for doing
that what they prefer to do if possible
today I prefer to pack your application
as possible in the same transaction
where I'm sending the data to the
database into some prediction I want to
send that to elastic as well that makes
me think that I forgot to show you the
actual reading now so let's see well cut
that we have so first of all I'm going
to show you this method so I have a
service layer and in this obviously Here
I am using the safe actually I would be
saving a method when I'm getting a
person and I'm starting at I've done a
transaction and I'm using transaction
sorry like an NPI dressing to save this
entity in the database right and when
I'm committing the transaction when it
comes to so this is a search like Google
method I'm getting from the interface
queries what the user hasn't owned and
what I'm doing you know I'm doing fine
like the implementation is here so when
using a generating a query and what I'm
doing here with what the user is until
I'm writing person's query person's
strategy so I'm going to rather like
throw some strategy because I'm
searching
Benson table and into address table I
have to do a join here also I'm doing a
join whatever the user is until I am
searching for that in the name field
address that country and address that's
it that's the reason why Chandler was
not working previously that's also the
reason why when I been searching for
Smith Joe it was not working because in
the name field
I had chose is right so I can split
maybe tell that the user is searching
for and trying to find different
combination but it's not super nice the
advantage search is trippy or similar so
I'm getting from the interface the name
field so your name value country value
or city value and if the user hasn't
told anything in the name field when I'm
searching with the like person strategy
in the database within the name field
same for country I'm so she always odd
country and same forces so this is
everything so let's add now elastic
search first thing to do is to add a
dependency to the elastic such client
here so I'm going to use you know the
latest version that we have been
released recently that's Big Bang which
is discussion system 2.3 so I'm getting
here I Riverwest I own this is our
recurrence and what I told you is that
in the service layer anytime I'm selling
document
entity in my database I want also to
save it in elasticsearch I'm going to be
lectures do class and I want to save it
in elasticsearch so let's create this
that will build elasticsearch class
let's make that final we need to create
the tress in the package so I'm using
you know a rustic sleight of spring
would fit but it's not so I can annotate
also this class as a component so I can
inject it automatically in my
ok so I have my dear 602 you I need to
implement the same method
let's do that so I want to create this
save me father for it ok
what do I need to L to communicate with
elasticsearch first thing I need to have
another rest I know that I am that I
mentioned before so everything is rest
in elasticsearch so this is the rest and
I'm going to so I need to build what
what this is doing its building a rest I
know variant which is going to connect
on the default elasticsearch boat so a
success will be running locally on time
too so I had my claims I need something
else
I mentioned that elasticsearch speaks
schism so you need to send she's a
document where astok self note pins
matches on documents so to do that I'm
going to use the Jackson library Jensen
is a super popular library and Jackson
is providing this object made maybe of
class that I can I can inject you so
with this library I can
until as stream of ISIL bite every as I
wish I'm going to use patreon so you
know in the bytes I have a diesel
representation of my own titty my
personal jet with second step I need to
call elasticsearch I have the tryouts I
want to index something I want to create
a new index the questline so what I need
to tell you a stick search I need to
tell what is the index name that I want
to use I'm going to throw my documents
inside index name pencil so
elasticsearch is multi-tenant which
means that you can send multiple indices
with the sacristan different kind of
documents here I'm going to add the type
the type is duplicate things so by
default I'm going to use touch as what
is the eye until of the document so this
idea has been generated by ryley on it
when I stole the document and when I'm
just informing Intel which is a document
I'm missing something here I need to set
the document itself
so I need to provide the GZA so bytes
and I need to tell that this is actually
which isn't so basically with those two
lines of code I'm able to create a JSON
document and send it to a sick search
and it takes it
let's combine that and holy
okay so I can even except shall you why
I'm communicating with elasticsearch
maybe something can goes wrong
all right maybe elasticsearch is not
available or whatever so let's write
some code I need to write some
pseudocode just to make you understand
what you can do so for example here I
can say is anything goes wrong with
elasticsearch maybe I can do something
like holdback the current transaction I
don't want to say my data in the
database actually when I was working for
the French customs it was super super
important for the use case that whatever
is happening with the sunshine we are
always always able to save to that item
is storing the data into that a store is
more important than anything to social
change model right so what we did is
something like this actually we said
okay we do that we what we did we sent
that object to a message queue system
and when we were able to replay whatever
has been accurate in the message system
okay let me show you how you can deal
with it now I mentioned that it can be
out to synchronize both systems so when
you did it
Ananta t in the database within the same
transaction you can also call elastic
search I don't eat method and say I
we do human bein it's a it's great that
that we did--we him what we have to do
call it Leon's called the delete method
either delete request what is the index
name so this is the index named person
what is the type touch what is the ID
because with super easy right - I
believe us
any time you add a new document you are
going to call exact same thing and to
remove document as well so we are almost
ready so I can restart the application
but I'm missing important piece which is
elasticsearch itself so yeah I fine
so I will use the couple for simplicity
but you can use whatever you want so I'm
just going to enforce so it's going to
start elastic session it's also going to
start cabana that I'm going to use later
we should see at some point HTTP message
the HTTP over here earlier
I'm just being too open Kiera it's ready
okay when I scream so Cuban - ten as you
can see I'm not going to explain default
and for now I'm just going to go to the
the dev - dev - disrepair and D because
instead of passing karai quest with a
sister and you can just but simple
requests like this one get slash what
you can do is to do a cookie Australia
and execute the same thing in share you
wish of course
because I took a course on what are you
so this is the request that you can ever
so if I look at what I have for now I
know any index the in person
I have nothing so I can restart my
application
let's restart and hopefully this is
going to work
okay so first thing first I need to
insert again new documents in the
database and elastics
so I'm going to sign one for some
documents here follow me let's be super
conservative okay so the rate is lower
than what we had seen before that we are
going to see if we can fix that if we go
back to the Gosar and look at what we
have we can see the number of documents
increasing okay so documents are coming
to elasticsearch and if I run a simple
search like search for everything which
is what we could match for you can see
back a JSON document the recent document
is giving the total number of documents
which is always increasing and you can
see the first ten documents in those ten
document you can see Phil name source
which contain basically the JSON
representation of the bills that we have
seen before but still when I'm searching
I'm searching database I did not change
that yet so let's move to that part
let's change the way elastic search is
actually search so to do that we are
going to change the search method that
area so instead of calling the database
we are going to remove all that what we
want to do we want to build a query it
has Excel so for that we have primary
builders something to use
improving and what I'm going to do tell
you know is that if I have nothing until
payday user I want to build a specific
query and this query is is what we call
the magical query which means give me
everything that you have I don't have
any theta also give me a version
otherwise the user hasn't anything I
want to build another kind of query I'm
going to use here what we call the
beauty much prayer queries so what the
user gave us excu
and now in which field you do we want to
search for that value we said that we
want to search in name field we want to
search in address
we want to search an address that sits
me as well and because everything is
indexed by USC search by default we can
search in whatever you want general
forum so we have the penny let's use the
deal again let's create a minute search
with the query parameter I'm just going
to show you how you can implement
pagination kind of you know so let's
implement this method
first I'm going to call Italians going
to cool research method and I need to
create a search linguists I can pass
some parameters here by default
elasticsearch oh sorry
this client is going to search all the
indices because I can pass any specific
index I just want to search within the
better index and then I can provide that
so we do so I can pass now what is the
great query is what we say and just to
show you how you deal with pagination
you just pass the form and size
parameter so size is the size of the
page and form is the first record or
whatever that you want to get back so
this is providing response and I'm going
to return that response
so here I'm getting back a response and
my application is not that biggest I'm
not using styles or whatever you over
all the things I'm using angularjs
application which can speak this isn't
so I'm cheating just a bit but the talk
is about the backend of different and so
I'm just going to send back the GZA and
everything everything is already ready
okay so i have implemented the simple
search thing i'm going to do the same
thing for the constant search let's
remove
I'm going to type faster
so what I'm saying here I think that if
the user did not enter anything in name
field in compression and in CitiField
van again random actual query otherwise
create what we call a Berea inquiry and
if the user hasn't told anything in the
name box then it must match on the name
field if the user hasn't tell anything
under country field it must match under
a dresser country okay same process so I
think this is so I'm going to restart
and I should use agility reporter
3:12
so now you know I'm using the elastic
search to search for data ice why I ever
made sure yeah
fantasy for true hmm does that work it
was working before open is what okay so
we have is true we have just miss but
just misses on the top of the list which
is Smith's sure okay oh it's better that
we can search for gender hey you okay
let's search for the country France it's
much more relevant for me because once
God is super unique in the name field so
it's super relevant for my use case okay
grants itself so we have the same
problem if we don't have the full term
at work but if we have the full so we
have to fix some few things but before
covering why it's not working as I would
expect
I just want to see if we can improve
that we are able to reject on need 23
document a second which is and why is
that it's just because the way we are
calling elasticsearch for every single
document we are sending the high-score
elasticsearch we are provided
and we are getting the response back we
are sending a document getting the
response back which is not efficient
yes except we have API name the API and
the Berg API helps you to send a batch
of operation to do so within one single
HTTP request which is much much faster
and for that we Java we are ready we
have this nice process of class I'm
going to explain what it is so I'm
building here this process of instance
and what I'm saying
I'm going to send a request to the
processor so I think we're so do you
request what did you and what I'm saying
I think that everything frozen actions
that are in the bird when floating about
Twitter success with one request
if you don't have 10,000 actions than
every five signals fat first a very
realistic so what I'm doing so I need to
change a bit my Konya instead of coding
index I'm going to call the processor
and I'm going to add this request and
same 14 it's I can do the exact same
thing you
I'm not going to restart now I'm just
want to fix the problem that we will see
we think of that
just after so why it was not much when I
was searching for June we are we to keep
at her again
you need to understand something
sometime people are speaking about
elastics voluminous or new scheme Exeter
but very the scheme is extraction but
the schema is automatically generated
for you if you don't this is what we
call the mapping and we look at it what
the man King is here you can see that
elastic search automatically guess that
you had provided address that city field
and by default elastic search we
consider that you want to run full text
search on it and to run full text search
on it's like I say such as repeat an
index index and to build this index it
has to do some transformation of your
text what what is the the kind of
transformation which is happening this
is what you can see when you use the
analyze API that we have you will
understand what is happening behind the
scene when you index text like Joe
Smith's using the default analyzer that
we have the name is the standard
analyzer so if I execute if I'm
executing this method you can see that
the output of this analyzed operation is
two terms Jo Ann Smith so this is what
is going to
next into English emails we are using
Racine behind us in white so this is
what is going to happen in Racine what
happened at such time when the user
until true for example and we use the
same analyzer and token which is
produced at such time isn't she but she
is not equal to e that's the reason it
does not match if you are searching for
Chico Valley produce work instead and
she is exactly what we are you so it
much so that's the reason it was not
matching because at such time when we
use the same analyzer we we don't find
the token in the area till index we can
deal with that there are many options
for that but one of those options is to
create our own so this is what I'm going
to show you here I'm going to create a
test index and I'm going to provide some
settings inside this index one of those
settings is the analyzer that I want to
use I want to create an analyzer name
any one analyzer and it's going to use
what we call tokenizer and tokenizer i
define it it's tokenizer i'm not going
to enter into today's I'm just going to
show you what is the effect of this and
you will understand so if I'm using the
income analyzer that I just created on
the Joe Smith text what is going to
produce
which means that now if I'm searching
for cebu obviously you and you are equal
so I can find by my document so we need
to provide that analyzer to
elasticsearch so what I can do I can do
manually that you know I can just say
okay I'm going to create the index
binary but I would library the name is
for its for Chara
it's a pewter with bloom I'm going to
ask but to simplify that and actually I
want with the settings and the main
thing with my code within my code
repository so we know if I have
directory in the glass panes in the
class pass by function name he has to
search and if I have directory
it's that will be the next name you know
that means that I want to create an
index name person and if I have inside
the file name underscore
then this fire is going to be used the
way of someone from teaching you I don't
know
yes barely branch and then I don't know
why it's been correctly
that's
sorry
Oh
it's a recent that iPhone when I updated
my individual last time that I need to
report it anyway so I created this
underscore settings that JSON document
and what I'm saying here I'm saying that
I'm providing the analyzer that we have
seen before and I'm also doing something
else I'm creating the schema instead of
letting in a sense of gasps the schema
for me I'm going to force elastic search
tree user schema that I want so for
example here I'm saying that you will
see a address that city field this will
be text field is still more to do for
the exertion in choosing duty fertilizer
but in next time you are going to
complete the content of this field
inside a new field which is generated at
the next time named full text and with
full text field
I can run full text search on it but I'm
going to use the income strategy that I
just mentioned right so I will be able
to search for centigrams what I'm also
seeing here is that for the city field
you are also going to generate set
fields when you eat exit like city that
autocomplete where I'm going to use the
same makeup Saturday that I mention but
also city that acts and I'm using a
different kind of type I'm using a type
of keyboard which means that this field
city that type I can run what we call
aggregations I'm going to show you that
and I'm can also run sorting and for
that stuff so I have different use cases
for the same contents so free use cases
so what is missing I need to call beyond
oil at some point so yeah I'm going to
go start with the client
okay so I think I removed the index so I
can now restart my application again
go for it
how can all misdemeanors that I was
waiting for which means everything is
okay
so if I look at the mapping that we have
we can see that beyond okay so we have
the same kind of settings that we have
seen before so we need to index again
documents inside yourself so let's start
with 1,000 so it's better than it was
right we are increasing the performance
let's change the fields I'm searching
I'm searching with so I need to change
that so let's so instead of searching in
the name field gender address and
country at wizard City of attention I'm
just going to search within the full
text and I can do something more
interesting I can say if when the user
hasn't matched match on the name field
then this document will be much more
than formal so I want to boost the
result to the score that we are
computing by a factor of 3 for number
name is very important for my use case
when dealer fields so let's buy that
so if I saw Chino for Joe it's working
right France and France is much more
important for my use case I'd want it
searched so same problem does not match
why because we are still using this all
feels so instead of searching in the
name field we can search now in the name
that were to complete which is using my
angle of static a that I mentioned
before and same for country same for
city so it's can we do more than that
yes so let's do a simple experiment here
I'm going to in the same method I'm just
going to not call I bear it anymore I'm
just going to call elasticsearch okay
but in the same effort because I've done
it is not generating an ad I'm going to
ask elasticsearch I generate a 1940 so
it might if I'm not providing an idea to
elastic so dressage will do that form so
let's play that again
let's see if it's faster when for them
boom okay
10,000 okay so let's go with so it's
mass mass much faster and it was it's
not that fast on my laptop because I've
used doctor and the file system layer
between the Mac no money if you hurry
you should be able to earn up to 12,000
documents about something like this but
it's fast right because this is a search
engine it's fast
also as at search type right if I'm you
can see the number of the kamati
increasing yeah if I search for Joe okay
it's real fast it doesn't take a long
time to search for France France okay
that's fine can we do more where I
dissident XE yes
what you have a number of documents I
have here I would like to a
representation of my dad I said I would
like to understand what is the
distribution of data broken by Euro by
country or whatever so for that we have
a nice framework named aggregations
elasticsearch I'm going to create one
aggregation two aberrations here
actually so what I'm saying
I'm saying that on the reason said that
you have what we call a term segregation
the cancellation is like goodbye on a
field couldn't order by the most
important values and to that on this
field next time so this is the first
segregation that we have and we want to
create a new Innova regulation which is
a data Soha on the date of birth field I
want you to create a back-end pair here
and come to number of document that
we've been here basically that's it so
let's compile that
we are there with the 1 million
documents monkey so we can now search
within our result set and we can see the
result here of the dissipation of the
data right so on the front end
I have already caught or that so i have
the distribution-- you can pay by
country or walking by euros so if I'm
searching for Joe now it might not I
said ok I know that in 11 minutes ago on
my 1 million that I said I have 1006
documents those are the distribution of
the documents so we can do more we can
replace this aggregation by so let's do
this one so we still have the first
level of aggregation which is altered by
country so by country but then we are
asking for sub aggregation for every
country I want to have the number of
documents open by 110 years and for each
packet I want to add a celebration which
is computed as original option that you
have so I need to change interface
interface talk because I just had to
uncover that
what is the effect of that if I restart
I have the complete button and now you
can see the distribution of my million
documents walkin by country by ten years
and for every ten years the average
number of children that we have in each
packet and of course we can search for
true here right so with our full letter
set we have that representation and that
information and it can scramble I if I'm
indexing new data
this is updating automatically I don't
have to run a batch that it's opening
every time you need to to ask us we just
left to ask ourselves and that's all I
still have something to deal with the
table right can we fix that
so what can we do to fix that you can
where is it yeah you can TR say I'm
borrowing you to have what we call a
fizzle inspector like I'm allowing you
to with one character be seeing one
character more one flip of characters
whatever you write so with that with
this Brazil inspector if I'm searching
for smooth okay I'm a Razorback and they
can do the same thing here G does that
work but I can use the same fizziness
parameter say so if I'm joshing fortune
I'm getting back some reason
what did last thing because we are in
Cuba now we can use keep an eye for what
it has been beautiful we can go to the
your distilled opener and say I won't so
I have 1 million its and this is the
distribution of my document so this is
basically the result of the data so one
that I've shown you just before I can
select some feel like I can save that
that thing I can be in service
validation and I can build then some
dashboard I'm not going to cover that
with details show you the final result
so I have already built a dashboard for
you so this is basically a set of
visualization which is representing my
data set
yeah so this is my that I said I have
some recommendation if I remember you
know I know that I have 126 thousand
person living in this area
the Jew points and I'm can search as I
said for you why not
so this is a description of my job I had
some females I'm going to click on 50
eggs oh this is only the Joker female
its I'm going to zoom in for women we
are the 70s evening friends okay
and if i zoom in you can see it's a long
damn thing as well but I mean I can also
say I'm meeting here actually I won't
so I miss my dating system here I have
the list and because my wife is also
using the same system I won't just
negate that I don't want to see my wife
for the exhibit just you know
so what about I tell you every realistic
search you can just index that and then
use that powerful and giant to make
whatever the world with that with social
join your ti - quite a few
so just want to show you again the
repository that I use that's the ocean
okay so thank you very much our very the
question there we have time
yeah so we are going to take it on the
caffeine boost break the question after
doing the coffee break
right okay ist cozier you want to take
some stickers please and thank you very
much what</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
