much for joining me in this presentation
my name is panda work for a Swedish
company called J way and feel free to
follow me on twitter if you like and
mostly retweet funny videos and cats so
today I'm going to take you on a journey
into a somewhat unusual topic of
biohacking and well when I was a kid my
mom used to say that I was special I
quickly realized that I wasn't special
at all I was just special to her few
years later I attended high school and
my teachers used to say that I was
special I wasn't special at all I was
just the average obnoxious stupid
teenager running around in the corridor
making mischief now at the age of 40 I
came for the first time ever say that
I'm special or at least a bit unique and
what makes me unique is this chip that I
have implanted in my hand this is the
same kind of what I want you to remember
what I'm about you I want you to forget
what I'm about to say now but this is
the same kind of chip that you implant
in in pets so forget about that so if
you were all cats or dogs I wouldn't be
special or unique so stay human it's 12
millimeters long and 2 millimeters wide
and you can see it from from a few
meters away but if you get up close you
will see a it's like a cylinder or rod
protruding for my hand so it's clearly
visible when you look at it and you can
come down afterwards if you want to feel
it to just you know look at it or if you
want to try it with your phone so I can
move it
so I can move it about a centimeter in
my hand and this chip is supposed to be
in the crevice between the thumb and the
finger now I've been wearing it for
about a year and it's slowly slowly
slowly be moving and it's a bit
misplaced now I would prefer to have it
here because it's more convenient so the
question is how did this end up in my
hand and about a year ago I attended a
conference where biohacking was in the
limelight they offered workshops they
offered sessions and they even offered
free chip implants for all and attendees
and you know I felt the urge to become a
cyborg or at least push the boundaries
with technology so I thought you know
I'm going to do this so I spend an hour
reading up on the subject you know it's
still an alien life form in my in my
hand and I want to know what that means
so I read up on it and I understood that
this is you know in this case it's it's
not dangerous at all so this is going to
be this presentation is going to be a
journey where we start out with no
discussing thing in my hand and then
we're going to expand the view looking
at use cases where we can use the chip
and then we're going to go further into
the future and we're going to you know
we're going to discuss what could be
possible if we expand this so I'm really
excited and intrigued by this technology
the things we can do with this today and
and especially in the future are going
to be awesome but at the same time at
the end of the presentation what I'm
about to show you it makes me feel no
from a privacy and security and
integrity perspective it makes me feel
scared and I hope you will too so the
thing is that i'm just going to you know
I've been doing a lot of research on
this topic and i'm just going to present
it to you i'm not going to be an
opponent nor proponent you will just
have to make up your mind if you think
this is a good idea and as i said i did
a lot of research before i took the chip
for
went the procedure but I still want to
make sure that this was ok so I called
my wife and I said hey I'm on this
conference and they're offering free
shipping plans and were thinking about
taking one what do you think and my wife
being in the pharmaceutical industry she
has a different view of this so her
response that is the stupidest idea
you've ever come up with and the thing
is my point is I think we're both white
from her perspective this is I think
this is stupid but being you interesting
technology and wanted to push the
boundaries it makes sense to me so you
have to make the same you would have to
make the same call and see what what
you're you which responds to get here is
a picture of the 64 people accepting
chips that very day and it happened to
be 64 implants that a because that was
that was all the time the implant guy
had so he worked for full day and he did
sixty four of them it's a so doing this
procedure is you know it takes a little
bit of time but it's you know it's
mostly talking to him and him
instructing me what to do so from the 64
that I know and the rest of my my
colleagues or friends that undergone
this procedure only one have chosen to
remove the chip and in his case his chip
was moving just like mine and he's doing
a lot of heavy lifting which I'm not
doing and his chip was was scratching
the bone and that's not a pleasant
experience so he went to the doctor and
he he had it to cut out other than that
I haven't heard of a single person well
we're going to get to that but a single
person wearing a chip like this with
some kind of bad experience so what is
by hacking well it's biology and is
hacking and biology like the study of
everything that's living you know and
spiro hacking contains two subgroups
it's due to serve biology which is
typically just you know you take the
kind of labs you have in institution and
and in companies and you bring that to
your home so you can it's due to
yourself
home biology we're not going to look
into this it's been around for a long
time you can read up on it we are going
to look into the grinding the grinders
and i'm typically grinder grinder to
people inserting things in our bodies
typically a chip implants that's what
we're going to going to look into so how
do you get a chip if you're interested
there are two ways you can in Sweden we
have a growing community and there's a
lot of biohacking going on there and the
community is offering chip implant
parties in different cities so they
announce the chip implant party and you
can just go there and get a chip implant
the cost for this is around somewhere
between 100 and 200 euros the second
option is to buy this implant get and
you can buy them at dangerous things
calm i'm not sure why they chose that
URL but they said they sell things that
are related to biohacking so if you buy
this you will get a box like this
containing everything you need so there
is syringe it's MC chip there is
sterilization pouch adhesive bandage and
everything you need except someone doing
the procedure so when you get this don't
do it yourself I would suggest you go to
someone who knows how to do it and
that's typically a body modification
artist piercer you could try to go to
doctor but they will refuse you because
this is typically not legal that we lose
the license and they were in the United
States there are states where we're
biohacking is bidden yeah you can yeah I
guess so
but I told you to forget about it right
no more questions like that but you can
I you can go to bed so it contains
everything you need don't go to doctor
go to someone who knows this okay don't
do it yourself there are two kinds of
cheap you can insert there is the older
RFID technology that you can insert in
your hand and it's typically used for
entrance systems so if you want to gain
access to your office but just swipe in
your hand this is the chip for you then
you and then you have the NFC and that's
what I'm wearing and that's typically
used for smart cards so if you're going
to go to the subway system or you want
to go to bus the tippity you smart cars
at the conference there was one person
couldn't decide so he chose both so two
chips I one in each end and I wouldn't
mind you know I think that NFC is a bit
more future proof but in the inside I
think that RFID would have suited me
better because what i want to do is just
gain access to the entrance on my office
i can store about almost a kilobyte of
data on my chip and that's enough for
the use cases i'm going to present its
passive this is just a chip implant it's
just an NFC that is inside a metallic
tube or a glass tube so I could just as
well just put a sticker on my hand with
NFC tag except that one would probably
go off in the shower I use the tool
called NFC tools to read and write and
you can use that for NFC stickers just
as well and one nifty feature is the
task tab so I can program a task which
just means that my mobile phone will
identify the ID and it will do a task
for me so I can I can just swipe my
phone to put it into airplane mode or
play a video or music or whatever
want to do I've chosen to write my
business card so if you come down
afterwards and you swipe my tag you will
get my business card on your phone so
what else can we do so I have my
business card and I can put my phone in
in in flight mode but there are other
use cases that is I think make more
sense so I've divided the presentation
into two parts the first one is when we
look at use cases today what we can do
today and then we're going to go into
the future and just speculate but this
will mean for us and tomorrow means in
perhaps five years 50 years or even
hundred years so that time scale is a
bit blurry there so the near future one
thing you can do is if you have an
Android phone with there is a feature
called smart lock and if you look at the
middle screen I have three trusted
devices that I can unlock my phone with
it's a Volvo it's a kia and it's a
device called my hand and my hand is
obviously my hand so I can just swipe my
hand to unlock my phone and that goes
for for a computer if it's the NFC
enabled as well this is my friend he's
leading biohacker in stockholm and one
of the persons organizing biohacking
implants porous and this is him getting
to work looks happy and it just swipes
his hand and his in that's how it works
it's very convenient you can also use
your hand to open other kinds of lock so
on the right side is just a generic log
that you can use in you know when you go
to the gym you want to lock your bike or
whatever you want to do on the left side
is a more advanced lock that you can put
in your home so you can replace your
home lock and you can throw away that
your keys and you can gain an access by
just swiping your hand and get in
yeah no it's NFC and I haven't talked to
my wife about this but we don't have it
now let's leave it at that and this is
another guy he's his colanders first
time I think he's based in Stockholm and
he's been collaborating with
Scandinavian Airlines systems and
together they come up with a proof of
concept and the goal was to embark on
aircraft using nothing but his hand she
got up to to the to the airport and
whenever the asked for his his boarding
card he just swiped his hand I should
say that this is a proof of concept it's
not available you can't go to SAS and
ask them to write your hat I mean that's
not going to happen I'm not sure I don't
think they're working on this is just a
proof of concept but it works and this
might be a part of the future they've
done the same in the subway system
INSCOM and you know collaborating with
them and a few of the bio hackers were
able to get access to the tube using
only their hands apparently the subway
system will have to replace the existing
mechanism for gaining access and that
will cost a lot of money so this is not
something that's going to happen in a
year or two but it works
another use case is payment this is
packed Patrick who teamed up with one of
his friends and the road some custom
hardware and some custom software and
they put that together with in Bitcoin
client and he was able to successfully
transfer pay money Bitcoin but just
swiping his hands and you might think
that ok but he's at a computer it's a
lot of custom software and hardware it's
it's really not that useful but if you
think about this in the future what we
can do with it what if we get chips with
the connectivity that is working over a
like a few meters maybe we don't have to
we don't have to do anything we can just
pass it through so I think we're getting
there from now on for every new slide
we're going to we're going to step it up
another level and it gets more and more
dangerous so now we're going to leave
the now we're going to leave the chip
implants and we're going to see what
else we can do with biohacking this is
Gabriel he wanted to achieve night
vision so they dripped a substance as
cellulose like substance into his eyes
and it was on to his I bulbs and then he
waited until he was absorbed by the eye
and then he waited for another two hours
and then went outside in the night and
he was asked pick up pick out 50
subjects hiding in the in the in the
neighborhood and they were were standing
somewhere between 25 and 50 meters away
from him and he could pick out every
single one of them compared to test
group a normal test group that can only
pick up one third of them so he was he
successfully achieved night vision if
you're interested he reported that 20
years after the procedure his eyes were
back to normal and he didn't xperia
any kind of anything that was unusual
after 20 days so we went back to normal
people are inserting magnets into the
fingertips strong magnets and I'm not
sure if this is a good thing or not I
wouldn't do it because I there's not a
that's not a proper use case for this
yet but I've read two stories about this
one person walking around in New York
City when he finally just stops because
there's a tingling sensation in his
fingers and apparently he had just
crossed either some kind of subway
junction or some kind of electric
junction with strong currents and his
fingers was picking that up so if you're
working with electricity this might be a
good thing might be use case in the
future another person who was he was
studying geology wrote about this and he
was going to an excursion in Tanzania
and he said that he was able to to to
approximate the amount of iron in the
soil but just running his finger and see
how much you could pick up and I by
doing that he found new places where
they didn't look for it otherwise so
again a bit far-fetched but I but it
might be something
echolocation it's the sound system that
bats and dolphins use to navigate so
they send out the sound and thats gets
reflected and when they get that in
return they are able to see where the
objects are or here with the AH boobs
are so where where they are and where
they're moving and this is a biohacker
called richly and it's going blind so
one of his eyes eyes already blind and
is quickly getting binder the other eye
as well and he want to create some kind
of echolocation by doing a biohacking so
on the left side you will see a
protrusion next to his air and that's
magnets strong magnets any figure he can
have this ultrasonic sensor you can walk
around with that that will send out
ultrasonic sound that gets bounced on
objects and returned just like passing
dolphins then that device is going to
produce a current that it feeds into the
cord starting with the three-and-a-half
millimeter jack on the top right side
and that current is going to go to the
transmitter where it's amplified hence
the battery and then it going to
continue into the coil and that's copper
wire so what happens with current going
into a coil like that and he's wearing
that as a necklace well it was it would
produce an electromagnetic field that
would affect the magnets so basically
the sound he gets will be transported
and it will resonate according to the
sound so his magnets will push on his
inner ear just like a sound wave would
so when he goes by and he can just walk
around with this not visible at all and
just heard that the surrounding now if
you're clever you might think can you
just use headphones I mean he just you
know skip the magnets and just put on
headphones and you can listen to the
sounds but being a biohacker how much
fun would that be
so this is where we this is where we
leave them the sound the safeguard and
we go into some stuff that I wouldn't do
here's a biohacker who got tired of
waiting for you know he got tired of
wearing this earpieces bluetooth
earpieces to communicate with his phone
they're getting smaller but they still
clumsy it's still you know piece of
something in your ear some of them look
look terrible so he bought the smallest
earpiece he could find with Bluetooth
connectivity and he hooked it up doing
some soldiering with a bone conductor
and what do you see you see the coin
there it's a quarter and you see the
size of it now he's going to rob lee
going to fold this and it's going to
code it in something that is a biosafe
and it's going to implant it into his
heirs just next to his there so he will
get to some kind same kind of earpiece
that you're wearing but implanted in his
ear by this size of it it's going to
hurt and by the size of it it's going to
be is probably going to be more obvious
than an earpiece but it's a science
right there are two things to note here
there is a microphone in there and he
figures the skin is so thin that he will
still work so he will be able to pick up
a call without wearing anything he can
just walk around in city talking to
someone on the phone and he could even
he could even set the alarm and when it
goes off six in the morning no one but
him will hear it the last thing to
notice here is there is a battery I
don't know if you read about the samsung
you know the explosions and the burning
that's where this gets scary and I've
written on his blog that he says that
I'm going to be the tester for this
don't do this I'll do it and I'll tell
you how it works and this is I think he
picked up them I think the battery is
something he found in a toothbrush
so I don't know how I was going to
charge you this is it going to go round
with like a charger I don't know so this
is well this is I wouldn't do it it's
very far off but again it's it's a it's
biohacking and people are doing this so
are you scared yet would you do this now
it's good everyone would do this good so
the next one would you do this I hear
yes this is a biohacker who's bit
frustrated because the human evolution
is not going quick enough you know it
takes time I don't know if you noticed
but we still still pretty primitive so
he's his working with a biohacking
company and they've developed this
device called a shaqada and it basically
picks up his temperature and blood
pressure and it gets transferred to his
phone and in the case with the
temperature the phone will transmit the
information to thermostat in his home
that we controlled the the heating in
the different rooms depending on his
body temperature that's one of the goals
the other goal is to send an alarm
whenever the device thinks that he's
getting a fever so think about that what
if this device was smaller than my
implant because we're going there it's
just a matter of time doesn't this make
sense to measure body temperature maybe
blood sugar sugar everything we can
measure in the body and we can send that
to your doctor so before get critical we
can take action it's just a matter of
making this like a thousand times
smaller this by the way is the size of a
pack of cards a pack of carbs and it
didn't use anesthetic so he said when he
got back I read the interview there's a
video of this just you can just google
it this is the first hit
he said that not using an aesthetic
afterwards the body reacts as if he was
being stabbed several times so he was
going down you know the body wasn't
really working it was really tired
another thing that I've been thinking
about and he didn't say anything about
it is this is an American and the
implant the procedure was done in Europe
and I don't know how he got back home
how do you pass security in this case
it's not a problem I'm here I'm from
Sweden I past I've been to the States as
well wearing this I mean it's it's
nothing but this one is not going to
pass I don't think so again it's big
it's huge and there's even a lamp
blinking when it's on don't mind that
the two it's not part of the it was
there before the is there I hope it was
there before the implant the device was
designed to work for I think it was a
hundred and ninety days the battery was
designed to work that long there's a
battery he took it out out after ninety
four days and the reason for that was
two things first he ran out of battery
secondly and this is important he was he
was getting anxiety attacks I was
probably you know connected to the
device somehow so he feel he felt very
uncomfortable wearing it but they're
working on a on a new release of this
where they're going to pick up
temperature they're going to pick up
blood pressure and even the blood sugar
as well so they doing this you know the
dude is risha the research and once this
gets smaller it's going to work next up
is
here's a guy who is suffering from
cluster headaches chronicle cluster
headaches and you don't want to have
that it's really bad so he implanted a
neurostimulator that can stimulate his
brain and it's controlled by a handheld
remote so whenever he is getting hit by
these cluster headaches he can just push
a button to stimulate the brain and this
is I'm not sure if this is really
biohacking I think this has actually
been been approved by some some some
kind of authority but it's still very
interesting like the previous use case
he also had it removed because he was
again suffering from anxiety and panic
attacks and he was he had this thought
that he was going to hurt the chip
inside of him somehow that was very
weird feeling inside so he was some kind
of alien thing in his head and he won't
hurt who wouldn't so this is my this is
my favorite use case is prosthetics for
brain so if you out barking and your
fault you can hit your head and you will
having a hard time remembering well you
can be you can be you can be getting
some kind of disease like Alzheimer's
and the way the way the brain works is
you have one part that is responsible
for short-term memory and you have one
part that responsible for long-term
memory and in between is the hippocampus
and when the hippocampus is injured you
will have a hard time remembering things
so there is an la-based company called
Colonel they have been spending a lot of
time and money researching the patterns
being being communicated by the
hippocampus and they've been
successfully they've successfully mapped
the parents being sent back and forward
so they've created this little computer
that you can put in your brain that will
help the hippocampus and augment it and
this is okay so what do you think is
this sci-fi is this some some weird guy
sitting in is eNOS is in his basement
just hacking no this is a huge company
investing millions of dollars and this
specific device is currently in FDA
trials in the States and as soon as it
passes it will be available and doctors
are going to be inserting this into
brains and as a side effect if we look
into the future I mean what if this is
available to to patients with
Alzheimer's and head injuries what's
from stopping us into inserting it into
our brain so maybe we can have maybe we
maybe in the future we won't be able to
forget anything that's kind of scary
there are certain things in my life I
want to forget but maybe we can have
some kind of filter but anyway this is
this is coming and this is one of the
again it's a scary thing because okay
they tension the intention from the
beginning is really good but when this
is acceptable what are we going to do
with it I mean knowing human beings I
know that we can never we're never going
to stop and be satisfied we always have
to go one step further even if it means
chaos and destruction so if we have the
possibility we will it up bionic
eyes so scientists have successfully
been able to reverse engineer the
operations of the retina in your eye and
they've been building a computer that
can recreate the same pattern and
they're hooking up this computer to the
optic nerve in your brain that means
that you can if you're blind you can put
you can put a camera whether I should be
and you can feed your brain with images
from the real world and again this makes
a lot of sense if you're blind I mean I
wouldn't mind doing this if it's safe
and again this is actually an FDA
trailer trials so it's it's we're coming
there it's going to happen and I know
there are two groups working on this one
of them
FDA trials and imagine what we can do
once this is this passes I mean what can
we do with it but I'm thinking optical
soon I mean what if I mean the the
camera could be so much better than the
eyes were wearing night vision no
problem at all we will be able to see
parts of the spectrum spectrum that we
can see today and maybe we're using the
the previous example we can just store
to memory we don't have to forget
everything this is Professor warwick
he's been doing biohacking for a very
long time and what you see on this
picture is his hand and he is he's made
a procedure where his open up is I think
it's just the beneath his elbow and he
inserted a mesh of interceptors
intercepting the signals going back and
forward to his hand and then he hooked
that up with a computer that
communicated with the robotic arm that
you see at the robotic hand and he was
able to move his hand and the robotic
arm hand did the same like this so if
you if you were a professor and you did
this would you be satisfied well I would
say yeah this is pretty pretty cool but
he was like nah this is not good enough
so we asked his wife to do the same
procedure and they hooked his hand up
with her hand and so it's not like her
hand is moving just because his hand is
moving we're not there yet we have to do
a little bit more research but he said
that he got a tingling sensation
whenever she was moving her hand so the
communication works and I guess this is
going to happen we're getting there
but i have to say that i feel very
comfortable just wearing this animal
chip implant it's enough for me so if
you want to continue do me this what are
the challenges what do we have to solve
to make this viable for everyone and
there are a couple of things that comes
to mind the first one is battery I mean
we can't walk around with batteries I
don't think that's a good idea at all so
we have to come up with some kind of
energy harvesting technology that we can
use and what comes to mind is just body
temperature maybe we can convert that
convert that into energy that's one way
we could do it and it's just a matter of
time until we get this right then we
need some kind of connectivity so
everything we pick up in the body needs
to be communicated to the outside world
and we need something else than NFC we
need something that is you know that can
really communicate to the outside world
we need to make it active so NFC is
passive it doesn't really mean anything
to us but if we can make this active
then we can download software scary
maybe we can go to say a play store we
can just find this incredible app that
works for my body mine is I think I have
a lollipop or some are great and I think
that you know I can just download it and
it will be deployed to my and I say this
is multiple implants because I'm not
going to be satisfied with one I'm going
to have a several of these and it will
just be downloaded and I we work like a
nap do on the phone collecting data
doing computations sending the result to
the outside world we also need to make
sure that it's stationary mine is moving
and you know this is pretty big 12
centimeters times 2 centimeters 2
millimeters it's big but they're getting
smaller and we need to make sure that
the stationary because i'm not going to
insert hundreds of these and they
accidentally end up you know in my
bloodstream and they end up sin my heart
that's not going to happen so we need to
make them stationary and then we need to
be really
is more so I'm not talking about you
know maybe I'm talking about like a
grain of sand that's the size we need
and looking at the history we're getting
there I mean do you remember the
computers in the 70s we're getting there
so what if we had all that so I want you
to assume that with it we have it what
can we do with it to answer that
question so we're going to go in to do
in to do that tomorrow part now this is
where I speculate and to answer that
question we need to understand why
biohackers do the things they do is it
just for fun is it to impress people
well that the cost is high so I don't
think so there is a reason we do this
and I'm going to explain this using your
terminology and using get so this is the
human release branch we started out
depending on your religious belief a
certain amount of years ago I'm going to
say a couple of million years ago and
that was the serial or one release you
know it's hundreds of meters to the left
and then we waited in million years and
basically nothing happened and now we
had the serial at seven release that was
maybe a million years ago and we waited
and we're currently at the serial of
nine release and we're waiting for the
Wonder release and nothing is happening
and what I mean by that that we
currently at the serial of nine and
we're having diseases we're having
Alzheimer's we have cancer and somehow I
think that evolution is going to fix
this if we just wait another two million
years and biohackers are the ones who
can't wait we want to fix this we don't
want open doors we want to fix the
problems that we see in our bodies many
of us do so the suggestion is that we
just branch out and we do to dot C
release and we just you know we fixed a
few bugs like cancer Alzheimer's general
generic degenerative diseases whatever
you can think of I mean this is
dangerous and this is kind of a joke but
you get it this is what we want to do
and we can just you know we don't have
to
back to the human release branch we can
just continue forever so basically what
you want to do is we want long lives we
want long and comfortable lives and we
want to be intelligent I mean that's all
we're asking for so its well-being
longevity and intelligence that's what
many biohackers strive for and I'm going
to go through some of the use cases that
we will see once we reach their goal the
first one is well-being and it's
combined with well-being its longevity
and it's a well-being so imagine you
serve in the future you're getting old
you have grandkids and one of her
grandkids just became apparent I mean
literally just like in a few seconds ago
the rain they're in the hospital and the
doctor is picking up the baby and they
usually count the toes and the fingers
they make sure the breeding and the
heartbeat is is as expected that's what
we do today then I imagine the doctor
leaning over to the parents saying do
you want the normal upgrade and the
parents ask answers yes of course and
the normal upgrade or the standard
upgrades are thousands of chips or subah
netic devices implanted in the body
everywhere tiny no battery connectivity
available active and later in life the
person have been upgraded well assume
that assume that the body temperature
increases over a long period say week do
you know what that is it might be
pending heart attack but fortunately
that the implants would pick this up
long before it becomes a problem and
we'll send the information to the doctor
who will respond with some suitable
action
another use case is what if you have
these implants in what of what if some
of these implants pick up a signal that
there is something weird with with a
part of the the cells again we're
talking about cancer and we can pick
this up and we can communicate this to
the doctor who will get back to you with
a suitable course of action that you can
take to prevent this long before it gets
gets into being a problem and if we look
even further into the future I think
that this is going to be you know this
is not going to be dr. receiving this
it's going to be an autonomous system
which just feed the information to some
kind of supercomputer that just responds
automatically and this is a this is it's
that easy so well being it's going to
take a time this is not around the
corner this is like maybe 50 maybe 100
years but it's going to it's going to be
we're going to be there then we have
something that I called seamless
integration so what if we'll have all
these chips we don't we don't have
batteries we have connectivity we have
everything we need so I'm going to go to
the grocery store and I'm going to pick
up whatever I need and then instead of
going to the queue waiting for the
cashier I'm just going to exit I'm just
going to leave because I'm wearing
everything that's needed and they and
the supermarket can pick up the
information about me who I am my credit
card and I can just charge me and this
is going to be true for everything that
we do in their daily life like going to
the movie going here you don't need the
tags you can just be here so everything
we do and this is kind of this is get
where it gets a little bit tricky
because i think that people want to have
that daily communication with the
cashier I mean it makes sense so it's
it's going to be a problem I'm not sure
if this is a good thing but maybe we can
spend the time doing something else with
our friends online
have you heard about new or lace anyone
this is an ID that comes from a specific
person his name is Ellen musk I don't
know if you heard about him he started a
few companies and the thing about him is
that when he says something it usually
end up strew solo city SpaceX Tesla just
to mention a few of them and his main
concern when it comes to artificial
intelligence is that it's going to be so
good that it's going to make us human
inferior and we're basically going to be
house pets to the computers and if you
talk to other experts in the AI area
they're going to say that this is going
to end in one out of two ways we are
going to be super humans ourselves what
we're going to be extinct there's no
middle road I mean we can stay the way
we are and Ellen's he suggests a neural
lace to solve the problem and make sure
that we become the super humans and it's
basically a mesh of implants around the
brain the picks up all the signals from
the brain and it and it communicates an
API to the outside world that you can
community you can that you can just hook
up to the AI so we can communicate
one-to-one with artificial intelligence
in just in blink of an eye so every
information that AR has will be
available to us I'm not sure how this is
going to work but his eye is working on
it and if you think about what we've
seen so far with the colonel company
they are doing this but with a very
limited part of a brain he just won't
expand that to include the entire brain
I know it sounds easy but it's going to
be you know this is again it's going to
be 50 100 years away but removing their
my last prediction for the future is
what i call the human internet so if we
connect everything that we've heard so
far so take the take the neural lace
take the seamless integration and take
everything else we as human beings are
going to be communicating with the
artificial intelligence but if we have
published an API what's stopping us from
communicating with our friends directly
we don't need to speak we don't need
keyboard we don't need screens we don't
need to talk we don't need to see
anything we can just communicate 11 and
this is where it gets a bit scary and to
be honest no pun intended I'm having a
very hard time wrapping my head around
this and again this is this is far into
the future but I think we're getting
there and looking at the colonel I think
it's viable we just have to figure out
how it works and the signals going to
tune from a brain and we're going to be
there and to end this I want to say that
when this happens I hope to be very very
old sitting in a home for elderly people
in a rocking chair drinking whiskey and
smoking a pipe not being part of this at
all that's my my final conclusion I've
saved time for questions and for
discussions and if you want to tell me
what you think about it if you're going
to get a chip implant and then do so
there is a mic over there I will answer
questions as good as I can I really
don't have anything to say about
security and integrity is it really
sucks you know I have no secure at all
so if I'm if I'm if I drink a lot of
beer and pass out you could write
information mation to the chip and then
you could lock it and there's no way
from heat her locket so security is you
know it's it's not existing at all so
how do i think nanotechnology is going
to impact I think it's going to be I
think it's going to be competing
technology so I think they can solve
this um the same problems that we do so
we have to work in parallel or hand in
hand so they're not really going to
compete they're just going to compete
for solving the problems more questions
yes
in the end it has to because if you want
to if you want to live forever of a very
long time we have to do something no
it's a so yes it's going to change us
but like anything else with the you
anything included anything part of the
evolution is going to take time so we
are going to be far away from that from
devolution and we're not going to be
able to adapt in a very long time and
that's going to be a huge problem
because evolution is always it's like
the master branch it's what decides
where we're going to go and we just
augmenting in their lives more questions
oh so how will how will the upgrades
work in the future and that's an easy
question I just have to remove it and
insert a new one and that's a problem
but that's where we are so if I want to
if I want to upgrade this I have to
remove it and have to insert a new one
but I hope that in the future but
looking at the phones we have today it's
it's the same problem in a few years we
don't get upgrades anymore because it's
too old and hopefully this will ask for
a longer period of time but i think you
know in 10 years time is we have to
remove it we have to solve the problem
in some way having some kind of generic
device that always works but it's it's a
tough problem more questions huh private
life issues yes plenty of them so how
will we make sure that government won't
spy on us good question and that's one
of the things we have to solve before we
take the next step into the future so
first privately privacy integrity and
security and then we can deploy it to
everyone so it has to be that way but I
don't have a good question but it's in a
way it's the same problem that we're
facing today with with with the with
this is security you know our mobile
phones we transmit every bit of data /
lives to companies today and with public
on the same in the future we just have
to make sure that we have some kind of
control of it I mean some kind of
control so we're going to we're going to
have the same problem but just to make
sure that we do it you know in the right
we do we do the security first yes
but i'm thinking if you get aliens here
that would be you could use case I me
some kind of emerging them yeah
absolutely i mean you show me the bench
now i emerge yes yeah convinced it was a
phone call no I I told her about the
consequences I told her about the
container it's glass it's it's a biosafe
it doesn't contain nickel or anything
else and i said that i read up on it and
she said you know I support you in this
just as long as you know that it's safe
so and I think that makes sense she
knows that again I've done some pretty
stupid mistakes but she knows that in
the end I do it for because I'm
interested and I'm going to work with it
in the future so so I think that reading
up on the subject is the best way to you
to come in someone so how many of you
would do a chip implant 12 ok plenty of
you thank you any other questions feel
free to come down and scan my chip or
you can even touch it if you like very
softly thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
