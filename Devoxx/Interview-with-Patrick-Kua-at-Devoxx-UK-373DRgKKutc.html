Patrick so Patrick um I'm a geek our
leaders team top 3 tips yeah so it's
really good that you want to lead a team
what I would say top 3 tips uh you can't
really approach the role like you would
as a developer so the developer you're
probably wanting to solve the problems
but actually as a sort of lead you
actually have to move to a different
mode so I kind of talked about move from
maker to multiplier mode okay so that's
tip number one what does that mean so it
kind of means that in maker mode you're
kind of solving problems yourself in
that you want to actually make the
decisions
choose the technology talk about the
approach and actually that can often be
one of the worst things to do as a lead
Neverland dictator yeah yeah so I think
[Laughter]
how much benevolent serious that's true
ok yeah I mean I think it's very
tempting a little easy to fall into that
trap of making all the choices because
it's kind of what you're used to
yeah but actually that kind of takes
away a lot of the sense of empowerment
from a lot of developers and also builds
up a bit of resentment as well so so
balance between that benevolent dictator
of us just being a dictator and being a
nice dictator ok multiplayer mean yeah
so the multiplier is really about this
thing about your focus changes from
actually doing things to enabling other
people to do things more effectively
yeah so it's really thinking about what
efforts you can do to actually improve
the development team so rather than
programming yourself it's more thinking
about how you program through the people
on your team and that also means to be a
better developer it's not really about
developing your own skills only but
actually helping other people develop
their skills and make sure there's
knowledge spread across the team ok so
pretty simple I might focus and go
wonder how Warren's doing yep he's got
the tools that she needs yep
do we as a team have the tools that we
need exactly yeah and it's trying to
exactly try to identify the gaps of the
tools and also probably knowledge as
well so as teams are sort of working on
different sort of features
new areas you'll probably have one
person that starts to understand how
that is solved in one area so you get
especially the knowledge but obviously
that's a risk if that person goes away
yeah and also it prevents other people
from country reading so it's then
thinking about how you I could spread
that knowledge within the team and
encourage them so tip point is I suppose
then in it to summarize it's letting go
of your own desire to control the team
yeah pretty much that's right yeah so I
mean it probably depends on the team as
well because I think if you're the most
experienced person in the team and if
you're maybe with a whole bunch of
people who are really inexperienced you
might need to be making a lot of those
decisions is it then maybe better to
switch to something like pair
programming and to go more into a
teacher mode yeah that can definitely
help so I think once again it really
depends on the team so and as an example
if I was leading a team of just all
University graduates obviously you can't
really rely on people's experience
because they haven't got any yet yeah
but people are really enthusiastic and
so actually a more explicit teacher mode
is really useful because they're really
willing to learn but if you're working
with a bit more of an experienced team
you probably come come across as maybe
you know yeah exactly so you have to let
people maybe contribute their own ideas
and their experience and then maybe
filling gaps where you see it yeah
so what you do then if you're in that
role and you say what you all think
and similar suggests something but you
know it's a bad idea yeah I guess
sometimes people have to fail for the so
they don't learn unless I get to fail as
well right so I think it's really about
can you help people find things that
don't work for themselves to allow them
to learn on their own journey but not
have a negative impact overall so I
think for instance you know if you're
going to lose like an hour or an
afternoon and actually if that helps
that person understand why the other
solution might be a better choice that
might be a good thing because people
have to go through those prices of
understanding sometimes pains will avoid
some situation versus just simply follow
somebody's sort of recommendation so
maybe you could do I'm gonna skip the
agile term now it's not called sprint
spike thank you thank you exactly
exactly yeah so it might be
just a short-time box thing that allows
people explore different things and then
you can actually make a better informed
decision yeah what stick to so chip two
would be actually finding a way to
actually still maintain some technical
hands-on experience so this is really
about that balance between you can flip
to much the other way where you're not
you know you're enabling people so much
that you're not actually understanding
what's going on the code base he's found
now he's in like a principal and kami
pinch principal engineer oh he's now not
engineering at all nobody sits down to
work it's interrupted yep so how do you
protect yourself then from going
completely away into management yeah I
guess it depends on the role because the
principal engineer might not have the
responsibility of leading a team and
technical architecture they might as
well depending on the situation but for
people who are actually leading a team
in a technical architecture there's that
trying to really find that time balance
and there's no real perfect way of doing
it I know it leads for instance you
really block out days where it's really
you know I'm in maker mode and they push
all the meetings other sort of days
other people can kind of flex with it
because they can understand sometimes
it's really just about a almost visual
signal to let people know you know like
I'm working some development mode
exactly flag or something on the table
to indicate but there's different ways
of doing it yeah exactly so it's really
just about finding the time and then
everyone has their own personal style of
finding ways of doing that so I kind of
talked before about also how tech leads
might end up sort of doing a bit more
going through get commit logs and
understanding what's going on as another
way of sort of staying in touch with the
code base and so saying technical or
maybe a bit more pragmatic pair
programming where they're not need not
really change the desks with somebody
yeah they're a bit more in between their
meetings coming back instead of resuming
where they picked up but they discussed
how they were gonna break up the problem
so there's no surprises and yeah so one
thing I found is that the the more years
I have in tech but actually suddenly
enough the more time I spend in my own
time keeping skilled up yep do you think
when you're moving in 20 these dollars
where you losing a bit of the technical
side you kind of more focusing on enable
other people do you personally find that
you spend more time at home on the
weekends reading up and things how do
you find that balance where you you stay
technically involved but you're not
sacrificing your personal life to just
to stay caught up so now a lot of people
who have this anxiety or it's really
hard technically look I've now got a
tech lead position or something like
that and I'm not doing as much tech I
keep it yeah yeah yeah I mean it so it's
a really tough kind of thing and I think
even develop this struggle with that
because yeah even there's always new
things to go out there with I just
there's a couple of things that I try to
keep in mind so one is really focused on
sort of the principles that outlast
tools yeah so you know the ideas the
continuous delivery it doesn't really
matter what programming platform or
which tools will say see ICD type things
or infrastructure automation you use but
those principles trends and some of
those things so I really try to focus on
those things first but then also make
sure that I find time with the team that
I'm working with to be a bit more
hands-on so it might be about spikes or
trying to make explicit time that it's
valuable for you to be on hands-on to
make better informed decisions and a lot
of that just comes down to expectation
management which is really hard but it's
a skill that you kind of need to develop
as part of this role what's your third
tip so I think the third tip for me was
maybe related to this one which is
actually about making time for yourself
yeah so I think one of the challenges
which is this transition from being a
developer to Tetley is that you kind of
feel kind of lonely so as a developer
you have teams of developers around you
or people and you can kind of you know
bounce ideas about technical problems
you have but when you're actually
dealing with maybe things that affect
the whole team certainly don't have
anyone to do that with yeah you kind of
can but then you might feel a bit weird
because you might be talking about
particular people on your team or
particular challenges and you need
somebody that's maybe a bit more removed
so actually think it's important to find
time to reflect but also maybe somebody
outside of the team they can kind of
bounce ideas off and it's so important
as well from a social point of view
because if you say you progressed the
ranks through the ranks in a team your
social status changes yeah absolutely
you might struggle with friendships that
you own
yeah absolutely yeah no that's that's
completely that which is like the
relationships of the people will change
regardless
of just because you have a different
role and that has different
responsibilities and accountability and
it's what's in the Greek power and
authority from an organization because
there are expectations of things you're
supposed to do that aren't expected of
the developer so your relationships will
change and I think you do kind of need a
safe space for you to be able to sort of
maybe talk about the problems that
you're having as a moun have a moon talk
about how you might deal with a bit of a
[Laughter]
crisis it's always good if you don't
have someone in your organization to
start maybe going to meetup groups and
find someone independent as well
absolutely so when I work with the
organizations and teams I try to
encourage people maybe in similar roles
in that group if your company's big
enough to get together yeah and to talk
about those topics because there's
probably things have actually are
affecting all teams that maybe there's a
system problem in the organization or
process that makes sense to change but
it's also healthy just to get completely
different you know friends who are in
that same role or just external people
because a you know you get to moan
nobody's gonna complain but also you get
a more independent perspective you know
somebody's ideas about what's not
coupled to your team or interests</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
