are we doing guys today all good I know
it's challenging time so because it's
just before the lunch
are you hungry ok I will try to
basically finish on time so I won't be
like you know in between the basic need
which is food and the other basic needs
which is knowledge obviously so ok
before even I start because I see that
some people are passing by I have a
question for you guys to use Twitter
okay if you do okay so there is like my
hashtag over here so please fill to
tweet and also this is the best way to
contact me I'm really bad in responding
to emails so if you have any questions
just please feel please feel free to
tweet me okay so what we'll be talking
today refactoring but the user stories
refactoring so how what did actually is
so this will be the topic around the
requirement and making the requirement
in a way that are meaningful so we'll
try to change a bit of our approach in a
way that makes our life easier and
basically better
my name is Kasia I'm lost am a few words
about myself I'm really strong in terms
of the agile community I was called on
either of the agile in Europe Krakow
right now I'm based in London and
basically you can also see that I have a
blog so again recommend checking out the
content you can try email me but as I
said twitter twitter is the thing that
is the best way to contact okay before I
will go further again questions so how
many of you are writing their
requirements some of them good so how
many of them are reading requirements
okay there are sometimes I don't know
so I guess that sometimes what happens
frequently is like okay we have
something we have some documentation
maybe maybe you have some user stories
but would we do your rather talk about
the requirements not really using the
stuff that we written down sometimes
because it's simply not understandable
or the information that should be there
are not there or are presented in a way
that makes no sense
so judging by the hands that were not
raised I think that it might be there is
in there as well
a few follow-up questions how many of
you are developers major 80 of the room
and do we have any testers one okay good
do we have any UX UI designers here one
as well
good do we have any product owners
project managers business analysts all
couple of fans like five are around five
that's good good representation and so
that's good
this will allow me to tailor a bit than
my talked to basic series suits everyone
who are in the room so a bit of the
story myself so I start from working in
IT department which was internal and
work were super easy why because we can
really easily refine the requirement by
talking with people so there was like no
problem then I moved to the software
house company we had multiple clients so
we need to basically compromise in order
to deliver customer agnostic solution
and again sometimes we had a trouble
with actually discussing requirements
why because we had an army of people
responsible for requirements like
product managers product owners
salespeople marketing people and some
other chain of customer relation people
everyone were somehow gathering
requirements and inputting to maybe some
documents maybe we had the user stories
or
other things that were meant to help us
with the requirements but again the
change suddenly got longer so again I
would like to know a bit more about you
guys how many of you are working in
internal IT departments okay sometimes
odd okay how many of you are working in
a way that you deliver software but for
companies that are buying it so there
are like external I would say that half
and half okay okay so I have experience
in both so it means that I move to
consulting and right now I'm delivering
powerpoints now joking obviously I'm
working in consulting but small
disclaimer those opinions that I will
present here are my own and hopefully it
will allow you to see the context around
basically landscape you are in and allow
you to adapt in a way that you can
reduce the requirements maybe less
standard way that we usually do okay so
what would be our journey today so first
of all we need to answer are we in
troubles because maybe you are using
already some backlog items that we
decided to call user stories and maybe
we use the format and we should be fine
because every book says off you need to
do user stories or you need to do use
cases or whatever else so we should be
fine because we are using them right
then we will take a look about a bit of
the project management scenes that leads
to the requirements that are not really
understandable and then we will figure
it out the solution okay so again
important thing context is aching so my
examples will be based mainly on the
more challenging bit which is working in
a software house or basically working
well you don't have the direct
cooperation with customer possible or
you have multiple customers or basically
chain of people between you and customer
so this is the context where my examples
will be based okay so let's move forward
so maybe before when I asked the score
around the issues of the requirements I
just wonder how many of you know what
user stories are okay majority of people
and is it like anyone in the room who
don't know what user stories are okay so
because I see that some people are
hesitating so user stories are meant to
be the items that build that together
should deliver the feature of the
application and again this should be
like small item that we can program in a
certain time box usually we are working
in Sprint's sprints it's a period of
time where the team is working on
delivering particular requirements and
again user stories should be constructed
in a way that it's decoupled you can
deliver it without any other
dependencies so it's like nice part of
the functionality that will just work
after the time box after you release it
on the production or the test
environment so we can like simplified it
like the land line item that we need to
deliver into certain time period of time
the question is okay are we we have the
backlog against this difficult word and
does anyone in the room have a trouble
is understanding word backlog okay I
don't see hesitating face but maybe just
in just in a nutshell is a list of
things that we need to do in particular
time box so again let's say that we have
two weeks and we have 15 line items to
do in order to make the particular part
of the functional activity and be able
to deliver them the production okay so
we have them basically requirements in
the backlog and the thing is okay where
is the problem is we have any troubles
with this so this is the part one
usually where sometimes
struggling to notice that if we have a
backlog with 10,000 user stories it's
not necessarily the best way right or
EP 10,000 items to do or some other
ridiculous big number so that's why
right now I will just take a look on the
possible troubles that we might have in
the problem with the product management
space that lead us to the full quality
of the requirements itself so we have
the trouble with actually understanding
and maybe executing them okay so first
of all roadmap this is something that
it's actually good because we know where
we are having that bigger stroke trouble
is actually roadmap commitments so let's
imagine the situation that we have plans
those our 10,000 user stories in a sense
that we discussed them we more or less
understand what we are building and we
put them to the like let's say Excel
spreadsheet or something that is
actually linear so what sometimes
happens we have like project managers
that decides oh actually discuss an
order let's put date on it and then
suddenly from the list we have a
commitment and someone after two weeks
you just go to other and say oh hello
you know I've seen the spreadsheet and
there was a date next to this particular
feature was not there so this is also
like the communication issue I will talk
about how to solve it and how to make a
road map in a way that no one will be
tempted to put a date on it because this
is dangerous while because we suddenly
do not have flexibility right so let's
say that we are working for a bank and
let's say that right now we don't yet
have the finger play in print login
because it's the new functionality on
the market and no one even thought that
it will be available and let's say that
we need to enhance our application for
the new login mechanism because it's
like nice and completed this feature to
be able to log in via fingerprint right
so if we have the commitment we will be
able to squeeze it in 2020 if we have
the flexibility because our backlog is
small and we don't have long commitments
that someone is actually waiting for us
because
as a dependency on that deliver
deliverable that we are doing we can
easily switch the order and and that the
new functionality in will revert every
small impact also what does it mean that
someone spent hours on planning this and
this in our 2017 year actually it's like
you know we all need to be flexible
technology is moving really fast we have
a lot of innovations who are encouraged
to doing innovations if we have no
flexibility on changing the order of
things it's really hard to innovate
because the new idea you had today it
will be obsolete in 2020 so this is one
of them dishes another one as I said
it's nice to have some requirements
because I seen also that projects where
we have the blank sheet and we actually
do not know what we should do but
trouble is with the size so what happens
if we have too much stuff on our plate
we can't see the priorities right and to
be honest if you have too many of the
requirements as the line items you need
an army of product people or business
analysts or other people who are
actually managing this think they have
starting to have the issues with
communicating within each other because
then suddenly they need to agree between
the priorities so it starts to be really
challenging there is no visibility and
there's also no way to progress again I
was one of the projects when there was
like five business analysts and it may
be guys let's try to guess how many
developers any guesses from the room
four
okay no one know a bit more yes sir so
five business analysts around 1,000 120
user stories something like this and
basically to developers and business was
really surprised why development was
slow mystery solved I guess we need to
have more developers who are actually
coding than people who are planning
so this is like also general advice and
then we can ask okay why this issue
actually exists so business want to feel
confident that we will deliver the
functionality so they want to have
everything captured right and they don't
really understand that maybe the
requirements will change so this is
obsolete work so this is a bit of the
education and conversation and building
the trust between the parties that okay
if we have smaller chunks and those
stuff we keep them but high level we
don't have to have small details two
years ahead it will actually speed up
the process and make the the whole thing
easier and smoother okay
next problem is user stories well this
is actually the problem well we are told
that agile solves our old problems it's
just magical cure there is probably
someone who'll say okay I was an agile
training it was online it took me two
hours to fill it so now I'm an expert
and I will tell you now you need to use
user stories and it has like format and
in order to fill the format we can do it
really easy and now it solves all our
issues and basically word is soft so
basically how many of you guys sell
stuff like this in their lives exactly
so this doesn't actually save our word I
would say that it makes it more
miserable why because we really want we
really want to you know be more flexible
agile and deliver on time and we think
that if we put the template in it will
just work now sometimes if we really
don't know what to write it's better to
leave one liner or even towards login
and they fell it down later then first
the format that doesn't bring any
additional value to you
right because idea behind those things
is actually asking the questions and
understanding what we are doing not
really filling the format really blindly
right okay another question how many of
you
are using agile in daily basis
oh my goodness hold the room that's good
I guess right so maybe I'll just move
further two more examples of the quality
quality user stories another one it
start to be little better right as a
transport planet I want to have all
planning functionality from prejudice
system to efficiency plan is better we
have some goal we have no clue maybe
what was the previous planning system I
did was Excel and so let's rewrite the
excel the magical cure for every problem
right so again this is trying to
understand the questions but as you can
see it's not really helping us we on the
one hand side we have up at least a
persona who is like you know want to do
something but on the other hand like all
planning functionality doesn't make a
lot of sense so going further with the
with the examples to show you the
granularity we would like to have - okay
as an email sender I want to be able to
send emails to efficiently communicate
right this is again slightly better but
we don't know it was like maybe
marketing person that needs to send like
multiple bulk emails or maybe it's like
private person that actually you know
sent one email a day or maybe two or
maybe as myself ignore emails who knows
and what is the efficiently communicate
that we need to measure it somehow or
what is the idea behind so again this is
a pretty undefined and by the way this
is just showing that you can misuse the
format even the best format than the
best ideas behind sometimes rme used and
let's have another example so as a
tourist I want to get ticket prices from
different airlines so that I can compare
the prices that is the type different
user story because we have a person
designs we have the information around
the ticket prices we know that the aim
of the person is like finding the the
basically comparison so I probably can
find
the lowest price trouble is that it's
still not perfect why we are missing
acceptance criteria I'm like maybe not
willing to wait two seconds to get my
ticket price because you know 21st
century I'm getting impatient if I click
and I need to white one millisecond to
get to retrieve the results so there is
a multiple questions behind this that
still need to be answered so general
message over here is format can help
even you will construct a user story in
a good way that is more meaningful we
still need to ask the questions around
what are the acceptance criteria that
will make to use a story more meaningful
for the person and then will be able to
deliver it appropriately okay so it's
what's the next issue sometimes we also
are you know we are doing our job by the
book or scrum by the book even more and
there is written that we need to have
tasks written down to as a user story so
someone decided okay you know because
what actually we always do the same task
right with the design code that the
toilets have everywhere the same tasks
and again it's just absolute thing that
we just feel and doesn't bring us our
much much of the value so those two
should think around okay hmm maybe we
need those tasks so that next person
will be for instance finishing our code
once you're on holidays is able to
understand what I don't know classes we
use or what kind of the functionality is
already there or things like that so
basically bringing the tasks when you
actually know that they will bring some
value in so again always think if the
stuff that you are doing is bringing
value to other people and your process
because otherwise the process just
become becomes heavy and we are starting
to be everything what agile shouldn't be
the basic philosophy before behind agile
is making it super light
and super transparent and flexible right
so if we build a lot of processes and
out of stuff that actually are not
bringing any value maybe we shouldn't do
it maybe we need to adapt the things
that are suggested by the books to our
reality
okay so let's basically quickly recap
what are the root problems of having
like the requirements that we don't want
to read or we are action of even bother
to open so first of all scary
commitments we are already you know
starting with knowing that our roadmap
is like five years ahead we are in an
agile way doing the iteration however we
have no flexibility which is basically
not agile at all our backlog is just to
be basically we have no visibility of
the priorities no one knows what it's
done maybe there is something important
over here but again we can't see it we
have a lot of obsolete tasks that we
cannot basically have any value from it
because there are just you know
copy-paste and they are the same so all
those things just suggest that this
issue's starts far before the even the
user stories are written right because
those things basically are embedded in
our culture and in the way that we were
doing stuff so how we can how we can
actually change those things so let's go
to the more like driving and more you
know exciting part which is the Cure's
so I complained a lot so let's now see
what we can do to make the stuff better
so road map itself right so why we have
the 2,000 user stories in the backlog
size and we have the commitments we have
no clue how to keep the vision so
someone just goes for the meetings and
third okay I have the requirement in the
document so let's put them in the
backlog as I user stories right what we
can do it's for instance product tree
this is the inspiration for
the book called innovation games which I
adapted slightly but basically I really
encourage you guys to check out this
book because there are plenty of games
you can implement yourself in a company
adapt them and use them so what does
product tree actually does when you have
the meetings and people are throwing
ideas around what the what the software
should look like we can gather it in a
way that it's not linear so what we have
inside is the current time box so let's
say that we are working in two weeks
prints it could be like one sprint to
spring to sprint depending how much
you're comfortable with and everything
else it's high level ideas that are
somewhere to be planned and defined so
how you're actually constrain
constructing it so again it's really
good to have in a room business people
sales people development team maybe some
security people maybe some
infrastructure people and so on and so
forth so they get the spectrum of the
stakeholders in to start talking about
stuff that we need to do because
frequently people from business you
won't know that oh by the way we need to
factor authorization because you have
sensitive customer data pieces people
want to not necessarily know it but
security partners will know so that's
why we also take it into consideration
okay so what are the branches standards
can be categories or basically modules
if we do it that way it's either for
business to understand that we cannot
have dependencies between the branches
because naturally tree is not merging
and uh none working right so if you want
to have like more microservices
architecture and want to decouple the
part of the application this is good
actually starting point because we can
visualize how to make the things that
are like basically not dependent with
each other since how it looks in real
life again how to make it efficient I
would recommend to have the high level
ideas pre-prepared
put and categorize and then on
meeting review them and add a bit of
more because then it will be just
efficient will take you less than an
hour and people will cooperate really
easily
making certain that their ideas are
captured especially is important for
business because then suddenly once they
have the sticky notes put somewhere on
the tree they know ok my requirements
sell it won't disappear no one will
forget about it
if I just send an email or just have a
nice meeting about it they will not
necessarily feel comfortable about ok -
do you really do it or maybe just as I
was hearing and you know they will be
stubborn and won't deliver it so this is
the way of doing the conversation so you
may ask okay what's the next step so
everything which is inside than the line
it's our current skybox so it is the
idea if you would like to detail down in
order to know what to deliver but
usually it's too many of them already so
what we can do next to even further
narrow down the things that we actually
need to deliver so this is the metric
that I call a loss versus ROI we are
using of charities so we want to have
some returns from our investments and
our business also expect some results so
one of the obvious metrics is money
right another one again as I said at the
beginning context is that again if I'm
were if I'm working on the website I
would really focus on the nice UI and
maybe response time because this is what
first customers are seeing if I'm doing
the engine that actually it's like
back-end system for other systems I will
be synced okay in my key metric over
here it's a speed is the response time
right so it will all depend on the stuff
that you are actually doing so you have
the requirements from the train and what
you are doing in the room you are
discussing okay where to put the
particular example of them requirement
in so let's say that I'm doing the
ticket booking engine and basically
let's say that I need to check ok what
will be the existence time if I add
functionality IPC and what will be the
potential profit again I can put cards
and then I can produce them in a way
that I see where is my magical MVP right
because those are the tickets really in
tell you do fast and then we can start
thinking about detailing down than down
and again we need to use a bit of the
common sense because what might happen
in their ideas over here maybe this
two-factor authentication I was talking
about maybe it doesn't bring that much
of the you know functionality
improvement actually doesn't improve a
lot in terms of the engine speed right
it does meeple anything it doesn't bring
any cost but if we don't do it maybe
someone will just break and get our
customer data right so it's really risky
so we still should take it so please
apply common sense as well again how it
looks like in real life as you can see a
lot of things are clustering gaps so
it's still we need to work and think
okay how if we shall do everything that
is in our magical MVP list the answer is
still no the third thing I'm actually
suggesting is like really high level
metrics why high level at this stage is
just trying to figure it out with which
tickets you want to transfer to user
stories those are just ideas so it's not
really worth spending a lot of time
trying to measure them because first of
all we don't know how and then it's
really hard to compare so again let's
have the example of the booking system
and the engine and let's say that we
have the first idea that will be ok
let's our our cost let's let our
customer to book the ticket based on the
color of the aircraft they did some new
trendy functionality that marketing
thought about that it will boost
ourselves right and then you think okay
third database that keeps the the
scholar of the aircraft is actually
behind the China wall so our response
time will be ridiculously low because
even it will be will be really happy if
we can actually get the data in and then
maybe we compare something different and
of the area actually maybe it's not too
bad because maybe we can actually boost
the sales and the first thing that we
are measuring let's say it's something
around again performance so what I'm
suggesting is find three key things that
you want to improve so for instance
let's say let's check if this will
improve our response time let's check if
it's boost ourselves and let basically
check if we have any demand from the
customers if all those three things are
not really like making us more happy
then it's not really worth to do it if
all three are making us happy it was to
consider and everything in between so
let's say that if we have two here one
here so to make this happy against worth
to do it and so that's why we need to
have odd number to be able to
differentiate shall we take it or not
the question is 1/3 why three key things
first of all if we increase the number
to five it will still work if we
increase numbers to seven it will work
but it will add a lot of additional
complexity so let's keep stuff simple
make it quickly and then once we have
refinement for those key things that we
already decided to take we can receive
it and make the metrics more meaningful
because again this is high level think
this is our feelings it's not data based
data based and after will deliver and
we'll have this assumption of the kite
this particular functionality should
increase our response times by 20% we
should actually measure it and validate
it at this stage is more like filtering
ideas to basically deal with the road
map that it's too big
like too many commitments okay so once
we have this also is really worth
highlighting that when we don't have
detailed requirements or even if we have
detailed requirements but they are like
written down to two years ahead
our rough estimate will be wrong anyway
so I usually recommend at this stage
when we are filtering the ideas not
focus too much about them so that's
where the message represent that were
like smile based and they didn't have
any numbers behind I'm usually doing
like engine and analytics so me saying
we shouldn't take numbers really
seriously okay so how we can fix our
roads and commitment issues first of all
keeping road map in a way that is not
literal frequently I got the question at
this point okay but we are not
co-located we kind of have the post-its
what we can do we can do basically mind
maps they are maybe not in the tree
shape but the basic concept is the same
because you have also kind of branch
structure and it's easy to collaborate
with the mind map there's multiple of
tools that allows you to create like
interactive mind map this thing I
usually do in PowerPoint and also it
works pretty nice and in an interactive
manner so this are the key things that
we can do in order to reduce the numbers
of commitments so first of all not
keeping in the linear manner then try to
reduce they think that we are actually
detailing it down to the meaningful
number of tickets again we can
communicate easily to business okay your
ideas are not being forgotten there in
our roadmaps and we will detail in them
down in the next iteration or next time
box so again this solves as well a bit
of our backlog size issue right because
once we have the roadmap and once we
decided what we would like to detail
down we can try to think about the
optimal backlog size
and the question is okay what it
actually is so depending on the number
of developers you have and the speed
some people do really sophisticated math
around okay what's our capacity they are
trying to figure out what is the
development speed and so on and so forth
and the trouble is that frequently we
don't have the data right or maybe our
team is changing there is not many teams
that have the luxury of having like
static team all over the time and 30
members are changing also if you have
big project right so let's say that we
have five teams in everything we have
like scrum by the book right we have
five developers and maybe one tester one
UX but again still this is the big
project and if we want to keep the same
measure for everyone it's really hard to
assess and so we tried and I all usually
from out to try to keep it simple in
terms of the backlog size so if you have
$5 developers just assume that one
developer will do one user story or one
backlog item per sprint or whatever time
boxes and then have some additional
stories in case the ones that are
planned are blocked right so let's say
additional 20% more or basically if we
have the team of in total 25 developers
let's have additional five user stories
in case Ivan get blocked and then
figured out together with the team how
many of the stories ahead you would like
to have in order to feel comfortable
with picking up it for the next sprint
usually one or two sprints ahead is like
enough so 25 people means like 30
stories per iteration two iterations
ahead it's around 90 user stories and
again with this size of the team so 25
developers 90 is still manageable by one
or two people just imagine if you want
to have it like few months ahead or a
year ahead
then suddenly the size grows in a way
that we still bother with backlog size
right and it starts to need the army of
people who are actually shuffling the
tickets around so once we decide what we
are building for the current time box
details this down and have the
reasonable size and then obviously this
gives you as well the sex ability to
change the tickets pretty pretty nicely
okay and then there is the crucial
question because the stag is called user
story factoring we talked a bit of the
backlog size we talked about the road
map but how about the user stories
itself right so how to make them more
meaningful how to change the approach so
let's start actually with the questions
right those are really good questions to
have and we should answer them and try
to figure it out okay while we are doing
stuff and secondly we just forget about
a lot of things that are need to be
answered
around the technical things because of
the details the business element but
frequently there is a for instance
additional things connected with like
security additional things connected as
performance especially we have the
troubles when we have a lot of
non-functional user stories or if you
are building building the engines again
I'm building Emma latex and back-end
things so people frequently ask me okay
but why are we actually doing it we
don't have as user as a such our user is
another system so we need to think okay
what is the performance how we can reach
it in sexual way what's the encoding
what is basically a lot of other things
that should be there so if we want to go
like with the standard persona uploads
to use a story there is a story would
look like okay I want to book tickets
because I want to book tickets which
doesn't work right we need to think
about okay what's discoverability how we
can
increase their maintenance all other
things a really important thing once
they start asking the questions even
before we start writing the user story
just write those stuff down in a way in
a bullets just to have the overview of
the things that we are doing again if we
want to improve let's say response for
the booking engine for the retrieving
the tickets again ask okay what the
database may be we need to reach all
those technical details that usually are
not in the user stories okay again
another question is okay what we
actually are doing and here I also just
maybe go towards more like technical
example because business Walker usually
is you write I want the ticket because
I'm going to the holidays so what I'm
doing I'm booking right but sometimes we
have like the stories that are connected
again with improving the speed of
booking for my user which is basically
some booking websites so I don't really
have the end customer and I need to know
okay if I have some refactoring there
that needs to be done that it's really
hard
by the way to explain to people oh yeah
we need to rewrite our requests to treat
the ticket because it's slow I know we
have this functionality but if we're
affector it it will get 20% faster right
so in to also answer those questions do
we need any of these that maybe we need
some spice because there is a new
technology and we really want to figure
it out if we can use it in order to
improve our experience right so again if
we have speed as a crucial thing in our
application or maybe we have some even
usability improvements that because we
are doing the web-based front-end
systems maybe we want to use the new
library and see if it's more new colors
will attract more attention so this also
can be as a what we want to do in the
user story okay what else and so also
there are a lot of questions
around those particular items that we
frequently even do not ask so again my
favorite example is actually integration
because there's a lot of things that are
business questions that we do not have
business because it just assume okay is
integrations they will know so again
going to the example with their Airlines
and let's say that we have the
dictionary management as a part of our
user story we should ask business ok to
your mind if we suddenly change our
dictionary right so let's say that
called a b2 was Ryanair and we changes
for c b2 and maybe under c b2 presidency
was british airways so guess what if
someone is searching for Ryan for plus a
British Airways and suddenly he'll get
like nice low price he gets booked and
then he'll get Ryan a ticket he may be
not necessary the best experience ever
so we need to know how we are managing
the dictionaries what will happen if one
out of our system is failing so again
let's say that we are the back end
system but there is a front end
somewhere some website that actually
gets from our engine their responses so
what would happen if you are down do
they shall show our old results shall we
have some maybe additional security
things that prevent us to maybe sending
the wrong results because let's say we
are having issues with showing old data
maybe there are some caching issues a
lot of questions again since it's a
price can we actually cache it right
maybe the price that was valid yesterday
is not valid today
so we can't show it again just imagine
and clicking book my tea cup for 20
pounds and then suddenly instead of 20 I
have 200 because it was cached for a
week back and then not the nicest
experience ever so we need to ask and on
the other hand if we have internal
reporting system and we don't refresh
data for a week might nothing will
happen because
maybe retrieve the data from ASAP that
is refreshed every half a year so there
is no issue right so we need ask and
understand the business reason behind a
lot of the stuff in order to be able to
define them and now them down and there
is even more funny things what we should
do is let say collisions in a sense that
we have two systems trying to overrate
the same data at the same time again
sometimes from business perspectives it
doesn't matter because basically there
is no need of having the most updated
data and the real-time and sometimes it
again really crucial because in which I
override the price because let's say our
island is sending us the new price of
the ticket we really need to be able to
do it so those are the stuff that we
really need to discuss and another
question is who so frequently we're
asking who is the user but also in here
I would like to sleep it a bit because
obviously we need know that our sana
I'm not denying but he also should know
who is actually reading the user story
of the backlog item frequently those are
like data analysts maybe some developers
obviously test us some business users
but actually business users frequently
are not even reaching out to delete user
story what I want to say here is we
should focus on the format that it's
clear for us and we should agree what it
is if we want to have the format in the
classical manner fine if we want to
sleep it slightly that's fine as well
but we need to discuss so in terms of
formats there is a lot of discussions
because for instance some people say oh
yeah personal maybe it's not really
relevant anymore maybe we don't really
know what we want to do in terms of the
action because again it's really hard to
decide and expected outcome sometimes is
also a bit of obsolete or maybe jobs
again
example I want to login in order to log
in and
think obvious so that proposal that we
can try to figure it out it may be
trying from the more situational
perspective what I personally encourage
you to do is experiment between the two
and try to figure it out what works for
you or maybe even try to find this user
story that it's ideal for you and it's
Tyler than maybe the mix of the format I
showed because again putting something
in a frame doesn't mean that actually it
automatically starts working again
sometimes you need to have more details
sometimes you need to have less details
one team I worked with really loved one
liner in their stories because they said
okay we have anyway
planning meetings when we discuss we'd
prefer instead of spending stuff on
writing stuff down discuss it and then
write the bullets when we think of
proprietary shot of time and I have
still a lot of sites to show I will
speed up a bit
okay so user story need to remove the
ambiguities and basically my biggest
advice is make it is cross-functional UI
stories and beckoned stories separate
doesn't make sense just imagine you have
button on the screen you click it and
you can't do anything because it's just
displaying it really doesn't have any
any business value again sighs this is
difficult one because we always say say
that we should be able to deliver it
within one sprint and guess what word is
not so nice and frequently we cannot
make the stories of the same size so I
think it's better to just communicate as
I this part of a particular user stories
below and it was still over and that's
the reality and just basically
communicate to make it transparent and
everything will be working fine again if
you want to go it to the more
or sizeable the same way that's perfect
but again especially if you build like
algorithm engines and other stuff you
cannot deliver half of the price
retrieving algorithm right you need to
deliver those as a whole again what is
really important having in the process
embedded feedback loop so sadly we
frequently don't have the opportunity to
learn a measure we'll just do build
build build build then maybe even though
we are agile maybe we have some small
opportunity to showcase stuff but not
necessarily have the feedback loop in
place what we can do with it we can try
to embed in our code some measurement
system selector when we see how the
people are using what our response time
and what are the data behind and again
we need to ask our business partners ok
we need to have a way of measurements
what is the stuff that are matters to
you so we can track them and see if
we're improving or not ok so really
briefly recapping the spine despite
remember user story need to be clear no
ambiguities agree with the team remember
to have it cross-functional because
otherwise it doesn't bring any value my
favorite example is let's say that we
have the water and the glass if we
deliver separate glass well it wasn't it
actually meet my requirements and
firstly I cannot drink if I have water
without the bottle of the glass well
still I can't drink it right I can't
reach it only together it makes sense
similar is with the functionalities and
again size
try to make it small however if you
can't break it down just communicate
that it will take longer ok
returning to the beginning question of
the part of the user stories does the
format matter ok I'm business analyst I
should tell you yes obviously we should
stick to the format and we should have
the army of people managing job there is
stores the truth is now if we
communicated within the team and angry
what we really want to have and how to
remove them big you ''tis because the
true idea behind having a backlog or
user stories is removing ambiguities and
having clear goal so whatever we have
that actually accomplished this that is
really good okay really quickly
wrapping up let's try to have like small
roadmap which is captured as a tree try
to figure that what we want to build
first using meaningful measures again do
measures at the beginning KY level don't
waste time on that too detailed measures
because it will be basically adapting
anyways try to figure it out how to
measure stuff that you're building in
order not to be in a trap and again even
in the user story itself we can actually
capture the stuff that what are the
learnings that we want to have most
important thing users sorry other is
about adopting and again there is no one
perfect way of doing stuff so just try
to figure those your way my hope that
this will be the inspiration of how you
can change your requirements gathering
process in a way that will be basically
meaningful for you so I really hope that
you will try down those and again do you
have any questions yes
conditionally represents one piece of
the puzzle with project but how do you
avoid having projects you end up having
projects
okay so you are saying that we have the
project with multiple modules correct
yes also you are saying that the story
is actually shared between the projects
okay so you have the dependency on this
particular story right okay so in JIRA
actually and in version 1 there is a way
of linking the stories so I would put
one story in with multiple tasks and
then link the tasks to particular
element in the different JIRA boards our
again if it's version 1 then different
projects in version 1 so there is like
link issue think in Durham that you can
you can use so I would do it that way
yeah okay so why even this question
appears business doesn't understand
right so four day for them if they hear
okay technical deaths oh my goodness we
want progress we spend money for
something we have no visibility right so
the way we usually approach is having
some measurements before beforehand so
let's say that this technical depth
doesn't allow us to build features on
top slow down the application maybe not
slow down because it's the application
is slowed and response time is like a
note 30 seconds or whatever try to
define all those things and see okay
where we can have measurements and what
are our the best guess is to the
improvements you can see afterwards I
think the hardest is the part when we
actually have something that says okay
we'll be able to build things on tops
because it's really hard to measure
right but also it gives the the
transparency in terms of time again I
would actually go towards like the goals
that will achieve after addressing the
technical depth in a sense like I will
be able to scale maybe instead of
serving one customer now I will be able
to serve 10 customers in the same time
and then assign the time that we need to
accomplish this goal because if you even
put the user stories which are technical
saying okay use different library that's
what people won't get it right they
won't understand it you won't bring the
transparency you will just scare them
off so if we just explain while we are
doing it then it will bring more
transparency and you can also ask okay
why they even ask this question how much
time you take again this is money so
they want to feel comfortable with
spending them right so if we put them in
a way that they can understand that it
actually benefits the whole application
it's more easy to understand and see why
we are doing
stuff yeah yeah there is no return
investment or well I believe that
actually it is especially okay so I
think that refactoring going for having
nice and pure code it's actually
pointless but if you are doing
refactoring in order to be able to
develop more features or improve speed
improve the quality of the stuff then
obviously there is internal investment
right
especially imagine if you are at the
beginning of the journey we want to
develop something quickly just to
shorten time to market right because we
want to be first we want to do
experiment and so on then we discovered
okay we had the wrong assumption so our
application is not scaling we cannot add
new fixtures features or even if we can
add them it will be extremely slow so we
can actually measure that doing change
for instance let's say that we need to
change our data model because we cannot
add dimensions by adding this new
functionality connected with the
expanding data model or making its
taxable let's say instead of relational
database some no SQL database which is
huge refactoring right we enable more
flexibility and ability to sell to more
people selling means more money if we're
internal and we do this kind of huge
change with like let's say schema change
model change or so on that allows us to
add more features again we can say okay
we cannot accomplish this requirement
right now but after doing this which
will take us let's say two months and
will cost us X amount of money we'll be
able to a B C and B so then business
people can more understand why we are
doing it right so I think there is
always there's always money incentives
behind these kind of things maybe not
always clear but we can at least try to
map it out yeah hope that answered the
question
yes okay
any other questions okay now so thank
you very much guys it was a pleasure and
joy your day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
