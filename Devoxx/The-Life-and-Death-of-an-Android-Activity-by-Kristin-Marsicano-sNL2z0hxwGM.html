for joining me today so I actually know
many of you but just for for giggles how
many of you are Android users okay oh
wow how many of you then our Android
developers or designers okay cool and
how many of you have an iphone curiosity
okay I used to but now I know right okay
so anyway I'm chris- marsicano I wanted
here today to talk about the life and
death of an Android activity and before
I dive into that I want to start with a
demo to motivate why you should care
about this topic so I'm going to demo
you my life is an Android user this is a
picture of the Fox Theatre in Atlanta
and I got a job moonlighting they're
being the door person not really but
i'll pretend but i would like free
tickets so why not so anyway I made this
ticker app because one of my job's is to
make sure we don't let too many people
in so we don't have the fire marshal
show up so anyway it's a slow night so I
start my count and I'm like this was you
know really boring and I love this new
multi window feature that was introduced
into Android so I'm going to watch some
video and use my ticker at the same time
and so I go in multi window mode and I
select the video player and oh my
account is gone that stinks and you know
I don't really like the fact that I am
NOT in portrait mode someone increment
my account and rotate and when you know
this happened the counts gone 0 okay so
basically there's a couple things going
on here as i am come out my account
anytime i rotate the device or I move
into or out of multi window mode my
account is getting reset furthermore you
may or may not have noticed that i play
my video and anytime i'm clicking away
look I'm clicking on my ticker app the
videos pausing right so neither of these
are very good user experiences so today
I'm going to walk you through what's
causing this or
problems so that if your android
developer if you're not already aware of
what's causing it you can address them
and even if you're not an Android
developer so that you can start to
understand some of the underlying ways
that the operating system is working so
to that end as we talk about what's
causing these bugs we've seen today the
state loss and the weird play play pause
behavior in the video we're going to be
exploring something called the Android
activity lifecycle so let's step back
for a minute just unpack what the
Android activity lifecycle is let's
start really quickly with just what's an
activity so an activity roughly speaking
represents a screen that the user is
interacting with all right and so this
is backed by a Java class which is
familiar probably too many of you do
vaccines and so you can see her what's
in this class right now doesn't actually
matter although it is important to note
because it's going to come up later
through the examples that we have this
member variables account and the count
is initialized to 0-0 and this will be
you know set to 0 anytime a new instance
of this class is created and then any
time the user is clicking on that button
it's going to increment that count and
then ultimately the UI we will you see
there that showing the count is
reflecting the contents of that count
variable and these activities usually
are backed also by an XML file and this
XML file is called a resource file this
is a way for you to specify what widgets
are going to be on the screen and sewing
a Java code you'll specify which XML
file should be used and you'll do things
like you know hook up quick listeners to
buttons so on and so forth so that's an
activity in activities as I said are
fundamental to your Android apps really
to the user your activity is the app
right because that's what they're seeing
interacting with but you don't ever
create instance of instances of these
activities yourself instead what happens
is there something called the activity
manager that lives outside of your
application it's an operating system and
what will happen is that requests called
intents are issued to this activity
manager and then the activities managers
job is to create instances of that
tivity and do something with them so an
example here might be that the user
clicks on an icon on the launch screen
which issues and intent to the activity
manager to start the ticker activity so
the activity manager is kind of like the
router right it's going to figure out
which class it should create an instance
of it's going to spin up a process for
your app by default every app is going
to get one process it's going to create
an instance of the ticker activity and
put it inside of that process and it's
going to move the ticker activity to the
foreground so it's what the user sees
and it's what they're interacting with
so here's a view of right or Android
operating system and its really just
meant to show right any given time
there's a whole bunch of different app
processes running on your device and so
when the intent was issued to launch
ticker activity the operating system
created a process for my terrific ticker
app it created an instance of my ticker
activity and put it in that process and
it moved it into the foreground and one
really important thing to remember about
Android activities and it's going to
come up again throughout the talk is
that only one activity can be the
foreground activity across the whole
system the foreground activity is the
one it's visible to the other but more
importantly it is the one that they are
interacting with it's the one actively
accepting the user input so now we
talked about what an activity is what
the heck is the activity lifecycle all
right and so really I think of the
activity lifecycle is three main parts
it's a set of states that an activity
can be in and we'll go through these in
more detail in a minute it's a sort of
rules about how and when the state will
change and then it's a set of callback
method I've got my clicker a callback
methods that will be called to notify
the activity that is moving between
states okay so with these states there
before from I guess I promise you me go
in detail there's really three main
things to care about number one is in
the instance of the activity alive in
memory number two is is the activities
view visible to the user and number
three is is the
in the foreground is it like the one
shining star that the user is currently
interacting with so we have a
non-existent state which represents the
scenario for instance when the app-v
activity hasn't been launched at it's
not in memory it's not visible to the
user and it's certainly not in the
foreground next is stopped so stopped
represents the state where now there is
an instance of that activity object in
memory but the new is not currently
visible to the user and it's certainly
not in foreground paused represents a
state where now we have an instance in
memory the view is visible to the user
if only partially and then but it's not
actively in the foreground so we might
get to the scenario for instance when
you launch the activity and it quickly
moved through the pod state onto resumed
so resumed is that for ground state I
was telling you about and it means the
instance is in memory the is the
activities view is visible to the user
and more importantly the activities now
in the foreground and that represents
that the user is interacting with it so
the activities and their state at
runtime as a developer you don't control
which state the activity is in right
then is dictated by what the user is
doing and in part what's going on across
the rest of the operating system so our
job is Android developers then is to
understand what those life cycle states
and callback methods really represent
with respect to what's going on with
user and/or the operating system and
then to structure your code within those
accordingly to meet your your system
your app requirements so i think the
lifecycle activity my experience has
been best understood through example so
we're going to take a journey into the
wild in the shoes of an activity
instance and i'm going to walk you
through five scenarios that sort of
demonstrate what how they when these
callbacks are called in relation to what
is going on so far a simple example i
like to call it like the build-up
scenario the we're launching the ticker
activity so the user presses the icon
and the ticker activity is launched and
display this slide I just want to take a
moment to step back
and tell you like what it represents
because you're going to see it over and
over so in the left hand side there's
that box called android OS there i'm
going to show you what's going on with
the ticker actor the ticker app process
and like what activities are living in
there and then on the right on your
right i'm going to show you what the
news you're seeing on their device okay
and across the top we're going to I'm
going to walk you through which state
and the activity of it okay so the user
presses the icon and we're currently in
the non-existent state and like I said
an intent is issue to the activity
manager which will spin up a process and
create an instance of ticker activity
right or count 20 and so we're in the
non-existent state oncreate is called
which moves the activity into the
stopped state then on start is called
immediately after that and moves us into
the pause state and immediately after
that on resume is called and it moves
our activity into the resumed state so
now we're in the resume state our app is
visible to the user and they can start
clicking that increment count button so
now let's oh and resume bright that
represents that this is the foreground
activity the one across the whole system
all right so now let's talk about
tearing down the activity when user
presses back on Android since you our
Android users you know but maybe if
you're watching at home and you're not
right there's this back button and when
the other press is back they're telling
the operating system that they are done
with this activity they don't need it
anymore okay so to that end the
operating system completely destroys the
activity instance as you're about to see
so let's say the user presses the
increment count one to increment the
count 21 then they press back there in
the resume state well automatically the
operating system is going to start
running it back down the life cycle it
will call on pause and then I mean it we
call on stop to move it to the stopped
state and then it's going to call on
destroy before finally destroying the
activity okay so now the activity
instance is completely gone we're in a
non-existent state and I want to pose a
challenge to you all so these are
presses the icon to launch the up again
what are they going to see is a number
of clicks zero or one who would think
zero where's your hands who thinks one
what I'll guess one okay so the answer
is zero and it all goes back down to the
fact that the activity instance right
would completely destroyed so it was
recreated from scratch and run through
this build-up cycle and if you remember
our ticker activity anytime a new
instance was created it was realizing
that count 20 okay good job Yul so now
let's talk about another scenario
pressing home so on Android there's also
a home button and pressing home is
different than back and that the user is
now saying all right I'm going away from
this task for now from this activity but
I might want to come back and to that
end the Android operating system is not
going to destroy the activity so let's
see what it does do all right so we're
going to increment our count twice we're
going to press home and we'll be on the
home screen all right so we start out
our ticker activity is in the resume
state is in the foreground we've
incremented our count 22 and the user
presses home it moves them back through
on cause to the pod state back to on
stopped and now the user sees their home
screen there won't other launcher and
the activity hangs out in this stop
state okay so now let's say user presses
the icon again to open the app what do
you think they're going to c 0 or 2 you
can just hold up your hand the number
all right yeah it's like piece right
okay so the answer is 2 and again it all
boils down to in this case the activity
instance would never destroyed so it's
not likely creating an instance from
scratch and overriding and count our our
state that was stashed in the activity
object is still hanging around in memory
okay answers to all right so let's talk
we've got two more to go hang in there
with me so we're going to talk about
fully a quote occluding the view of the
ticker activity so let's pretend that
our app has two screens now so I press
the icon to open my ticker and I
increment the count and then I want to
save the count I'm going to save it to a
file or to the network or what
it doesn't matter but this will launch
another screen and I can enter a file
name and then click Save so here where
we're at this is a state where our
ticker activity is in the resume state
now I click Save count which I'm going
to issue another intent intent and the
operating system is going to create and
spin up to save activity I'm going to
laser focus on ticker activity so we're
not going to like mess with the business
of what's going on with save activity
but ultimately it's there so now the
question is what's going on with ticker
activity right because it's no longer
visible to the user so it moves from
resumed through on cause to become
paused and then immediately through on
stop to become stopped and if you
remember if you think back to those
three dimensions that i talked about
that represent the states represent
right is it in memory is it visible and
is it in the foreground this starts to
make sense because the ticker activity
is stopped which stopped state means
it's in memory but it's not visible
right and it's certainly not in
foreground okay so the user is going to
press back now on save activity and save
activity will go through its own life
cycle and go away and then the question
is what will happen to ticker activity
and it's going to spin back up from
where it was to the resumed state all
right and so it moves through on start
because it stops it move from on stop
through on resume to the resumed state
so you can see now that the life cycle
isn't such that it always goes you know
all the way torn down all the way built
back up it can sort of Evan flow between
these states but it's always going to go
you know one by one through each of them
all right so last example here before we
move on so launching a transparent
activity so here is a scenario we're
going to partially occlude the view of
arc tivity another example of this might
be for instance if you had like a
dialogue log seemed activity that
appeared so we're going to have a safe
count button which I click and it now
I'm not a UX designer so please don't
fault me for this ok so I first one
reason thought it'd be good to you know
have some context about what's going on
but probably the execution of this is
not great but so you'll
see I've got my saved activity on top
but you can still see the UI for the
ticker activity behind it so start to
think to yourself about the states we
talk about what state ticker activity
might be in right so if it's partially
visible but it's not in the foreground
what state is that you don't have to
answer you can just think okay so we're
in the resume state we click Save count
to launch our semi-transparent save
activity and it's going to move our
ticker activity to the pause state right
through on pause because pog represents
like I said the instance of the memory
and the view is visible or partially
visible but it's not in the foreground
all right so our ticket particular
activity will hang around in this pod
state well our state of activity is in
the foreground so when we click back off
of our save activity save activity gets
destroyed and the ticker activity is
going to move back to the resume state
so you can see now it only had one hop
to go right one call back to made it
back to the resume state okay so that's
a walk in the shoes of an activity for a
few common examples so i want to step
back and summarize for a minute because
i think of this activity lifecycle and
sort of three main sub cycles when I
start to reason about how to structure
my my android code within these
callbacks so one is this this notion of
the entire lifetime of the activity or
the instance lifetime is there an
instance of the activity in memory and
basically the way I think about it is
that anytime after on create is called
I'm in this instance lifetime there's an
instance of my activity memory and then
when ondestroy is called I know I'm
moving out of that that lifetime then
there's this visible lifetime which
represents when your activities view is
visible to the user and so once on stars
called I know that notifies to me that
hey the user can now see my you I see my
activity is only partially and when on
stop is called I know it's my activity
is moving out of you and then finally is
this foreground lifetime this is again
like I said when your activity is at the
forefront it's what the user is
interacting with its accepting their
input so on and so forth and so when on
resume
is called that's notifying to me that my
activity is moving into this foreground
or resume state and then when I'm pause
is called I'm moving back out of it okay
so let's revisit the demo for a minute
right one of the problems we had one of
the bot bugs which is actually bug I see
a line which you may see is an Android
user is this notion of losing state
right my ticker count with getting lost
anytime I rotated or anytime I went into
or out of multi window mode which I
guess if I'd only count of three people
I wouldn't care but if I had not paid
attention and accounted all day I'd
prompt a pretty upset right so how do i
fix this prob well first let's try to
understand what's going on all right
when I am here happily counting and I
rotate my device what the Android
operating system is doing some
activities the following it's calling on
cause to move to the quad state calling
on stop to move to the stopped state and
then calling on destroy making it
non-existent it's so it's actually
completely wiping away my activity
instance for memory we know the problems
for my app as I've shown you because now
when instance is gone I've lost that
information about the count that the
user has incremented up all right so
what happens though as the device
rotates is it crew now creates a brand
new kicker activity instance and as you
saw before it's going to initialize my
count 20 and it's going to run to
correct Aviva's new instance all the way
up to the resumed state hmm okay so what
the heck is going on why is this
happening so this is a lot of time I
teach Android people someone pointed out
and a lot of times people are really
questioning like what's going on so
first of all a rotating the device
you're moving into multi window mode
that's what's called a runtime
configuration change so in android
there's this notion of the configuration
of your device and there's lots of
different factors that contribute to
that right there's things that can't
necessarily change at runtime like
screen density but then there's lots of
things that can change it one time like
orientation from portrait to landscape
or locale language or night mode or
multi
window etc so when a runtime
configuration changes Android as you saw
completely destroys and recreate San
activity instance all right and so part
of why this is happening is it's
allowing operating system to choose
resources that best fit the
configuration and the simplest example
this might be you might want to have one
layout file one xml layout file for our
portrait mode and another for landscape
mode where you've like display buttons
along the sides maybe instead of
underneath ok so the operating system is
completely destroying the activity and
then re selecting resources like strings
and images and layout files etc that
best match the current configuration ok
so now we know what is happening and
maybe a little insight into why the
question is then what the heck do we do
right there must be some way to address
this problem and there's more than one
way but one really simple way when
you're dealing with transient you why
state state that user would expect to be
around like if then the rotating advice
they don't want that state to be gone is
to use something called on to Vincent
state so unsaved instance state is
another callback method alright and this
will be called by the operating system
before on stuff but ultimately the idea
is this will be called to protect your
activity from destruction it such that
it's going to save the state that these
are my care about so you can override
override on save Vincent state and it
takes them something called a bundle
which is like a hashmap right it's a set
of key value pairs and you can stash
information into that bundle so in this
case I am stashing my count with a label
of ticker underscore count ok so then on
the flip side how do we use that state
to restore our activity and as you'll
notice this oncreate method right which
we get called on the activity instance
as it's being spun up is accepting a
bundle as an input and so the
information that you had stashed in
onstage instance state is going to
magically appear in that bundle and on
create after rotation or after your
runtime configuration change whatever it
might be so
can use that information pull it out
from this bundle and do what you may
with it right in our case we're going to
update the UI to reflect the count that
the user had before they rotate it or
before they went into multi window mode
okay so just a little bit of a
conceptual lock of what's going on under
the hood then so here's a picture of my
terrific ticker process with my ticker
activity instance living in it and I'm
calling an instance a and the count is
currently three so the user rotates the
device on st. Vincent's state is called
which stashes something called an
activity record somewhere in the
operating system the point is that what
really matters and is not where it
stashed but it's more important the fact
that this is not tied to your activities
lifecycle this is going to persist past
your activity being destroyed so the
record will get stashed with whatever
information you put in the bundle will
go along with it and your activity gets
destroyed so now as part of this
rotation the operating system will
recreate a new instance of the activity
and it's going to pass along through on
create that information that you had
stashed in the bundle right so then you
can use that to recreate the instance a
so this is actually a fully new instance
of a ticker activity but to your user
it's transparent that it was ever
actually destroyed and recreated okay
and then the record will get cleared and
we move on so key point here is to use
save instance state to stash transient
state a loss or cross configuration
changes okay so one thing that I hear
people say and this was a very slippery
slope is like all right well there's a
run current time configurations and I
saw on the documentation or you know on
Stack Overflow that I can avoid these
like I can lock my app into portrait
mode I can tell it that it can't go into
multi window mode etc I'm going to tell
you another story now but why it's not
going to solve all problems by doing
that by eliminating configuration
changes entirely and this is a
cautionary tale
I like going home but this one is a
cautionary tale okay so user is on my
ticker activity and they press home okay
so we move through on pause through on
stop to the stopped state now I will
play pokemon go okay or whatever game
more thing you want to do that's going
to take up lots of memory and all its
fine and dandy until oh alright there's
memory pressure and the system is
starting to stay we'll wait a minute I
need to clean some things up alright
your ticker activity is in the stopped
state it's no longer visible to the user
so it is fair game for the operating
system to just completely destroy your
entire process and when it destroys your
process is going to destroy any activity
instances or anything you have stored in
there alright so your activity is going
to jump from the stopped state to the
non-existent state okay and by the way
on destroyer will not get call but
ultimately your activity is gone alright
but so the message here is beware the
biking killer all right so you're even
if you're locked in portrait mode and
all these things in your handle and
configuration changes on your own your
activity can still get killed by the
operating system and so anything in
their interior instance in memory is
going to be wiped away so you won't have
some means to say that and one way to
save the transient you I state is to use
this aren't I Vincent state so again on
safe distance state is going to work for
configuration changes and also for this
you know Viking killer process kill
situation okay alright so we have now
addressed the issue with losing state
across rotation and now also in the
process of kill situation let's revisit
for a moment the issue with the video if
you recall whenever I played the video
and then click back in multi window mode
to increment ikar it would pausing my
video which is kind of a frustrating
experience alright so given everything
that you know about the activity
lifecycle at this point in time let's
look at multi window mode alright so
let's say that I have just clicked on
increment count which stay
do you think that my ticker activity is
in I clicked on it I'm interacting with
it it's in the resume state right it's
in the foreground it's in the resume
state so what about my video on the left
I've clicked on kicker what state do you
think the video player is in paused
exactly its pod so it's visible to the
user but it is not in the foreground
remember only one activity can be in the
resume state at a time across the entire
system ok so the video and left is
paused so probably what is happening I
know what's happened because I hacked up
the XO player demo code make it happen
but I assumed when on cause is called on
the activity I'd want to pause the video
right makes perfect sense but that
doesn't actually make sense right what
we really want to do when we're deciding
about what to put in these life cycle
method instead to think about what
though callbacks are signifying like
what it means it's happening to the
activity with respect to the user and
what our requirements are so my
requirements are I want the video to
play whenever the players visible even
if it's not in the resume state and I
want to pause the video automatically
when the player is not visible right so
then the question is in which callback
method would I want to you know say hey
start or unpause my video playback if I
want video to play start automatically
playing again any time the activity is
visible on start I heard use it so on
start that's correct because member on
start signifies to us that the video is
becoming visible again and when when do
we stop or so when am I going to pause
my playback if I want if my requirement
is I want video paused when the player
is not visible I stop right because
that's moving us out of the visible
lifetime ok so I had one more example
that i'll go through really quick before
we wrap
here to further give you an opportunity
to reason about the activity lifecycle
because you've invested so much time and
energy walking and activities shoes with
me today so here's an example where I
want to show you their their location on
my own now I borrowed this picture from
the documentation so these are between
out my apps right but on the right i
want to show any other the location on
this map but i want to minimize the
battery consumption right i want to be a
good citizen and so but i want to
maximize the precision when the user is
actively interacting with my math so a
question start to come about when would
I want to start sampling location when
might I want to upgrade the precision
like maybe use a higher cost radio when
do I want to downgrade that etc so I
want to start sampling for location and
sort of a low fine manager when the
activity becomes visible which callback
would I do that in you all don't know
you're going to be quizzed on start
right because I'm start moved me into
the pause state when I'm in the pause
state I am visible okay so when am I
going to increase I want to increase the
accuracy of my location sampling when my
activity is in the foreground when users
interacting with my map when would I
want to do that increase in either
sampling rate or use some other radio on
resume okay when what I want to decrease
the accuracy when my application is not
in the foreground so the user can see it
so I still want to sample but maybe I'll
slow down the sampling or I'll use you
know a less battery costly needs to get
the location when would I do that work
on pods right because that's moving me
into the pod state where I'm visible to
not in the and foreground and then
finally when will I want to stop
sampling when my map application is no
longer visible so I'm not like eating up
battery power when my application is in
the stopped state like maybe these are
his pressed home I kind of gave way the
answer to that one I'm stuff okay
so the thing is that the point one point
I want to make is that at least when I
started learning android I really like I
wanted a formula and I still do to be
honest for most things right I want
someone to say to me or be able to read
a book and it says yes in this scenario
you put the code there and that scenario
you know you do XY and Z but the fat
doesn't matter it's not really that cut
and dry okay there are some things that
I've learned over the years that have
proved very helpful when it comes to the
life cycle and one is the notion of life
cycle pairs and so the idea is that if
you are going to for instance register a
listener or something set something up
in a call back when you're building up
you want to tear down or unregister that
listener in the corresponding teardown
method so life cycle pairs will be on
creating on destroy all right on start
and I'm stop and then on resume and
unpause so if I like set up a listener
and on start I want to unregister it in
on stop perhaps okay and there are other
various rules of thumb that you'll learn
as you make more and more android apps
you know in oncreate you're going to be
you may want to be checking the saved in
state bundle you will be setting up with
you'll be setting up which layout file
your activities going to be associated
with you may be setting listeners on
buttons etc on start and unstopped is
usually where that represents remember
is the visible lifetime of the activity
so that's where you may want to be
considering setting starting an
emissions or shutting anything we would
see why that is using cpu and then a
non-stop you will want to stop that
stuff since the user won't see it okay
i'll destroy is your last call back
where you can tear things down but like
I said on onda stories not necessarily
guaranteed to be called but if that is
the case and the process hasn't
destroyed so you're usually in good
shape okay but in reality what you put
in those life cycle methods really
depends and like I said before it's a
narrative what the requirements for your
user interface are married up with what
the lifecycle callbacks actually mean
with respect to what the user can see
and do or is being doing and also what's
going on the rest operating system okay
so
now we have unlocked this is an old gift
but you have unlocked the achievement of
understanding the activity lifecycle or
at least you've gotten a quick tour
through it okay so if you enjoy the
stock or you hated it let me know you
can reach me on Twitter or my github
pretty much anywhere in the internet I'm
Kristen Mars or you can check out big
nerd ranch com big nerd ranch is where I
work and Oh as you can see here that's
the old version but I also co-wrote an
Android programming book which is great
for beginners I have a copy here to give
away for anybody's interested so you can
check out that we do app development we
teach week-long courses and as you
celebrate books if you're interested in
any of our big nerd ranch boot camps I
have been given a code that you anyone
can use to get ten percent off any class
we have iOS Android web front end and
back end and then also design classes
okay so that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
