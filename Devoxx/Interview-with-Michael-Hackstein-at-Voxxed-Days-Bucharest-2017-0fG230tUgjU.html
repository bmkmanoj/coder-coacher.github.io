a talk in about 15 minutes so tight for
time on handling billions of edges in a
graph database so back your turkey is
how you overcome the limits of
scalability with the graph database what
is it about a graph database that
presents that challenge that a
relational database doesn't you think so
the graph databases focus more on
actually the information on the
relations so you can do the same things
with relational - database in terms of
storing but for the query model
typically graph juries are very way more
complex by joining lots and lots of the
records together and if these records
are distributed in across several
servers in the cluster it's really hard
to execute this query because it just
jumps from server to server and back
again and then at some point you have to
pull everything together in one location
where the client actually requests the
data from and because these hops are
very very expensive it's pretty hard to
scale at the graph database if the graph
database the best thing then for
handling large amounts of data not
always but that depends on your use case
so if the use phase is certainly a graph
use case you don't have another choice
so the easiest way for handling like
large distributed data would be a key
value store but they don't have complex
very mechanism it's just okay get one
where you buy a fee and that is
somewhere in the cluster but you cannot
do joins and do complex transformations
or finding passes that interconnect
different things what's the benefit of
using a graph database that's the
benefit is that these conflicts clear is
actually possible inside the database
and you do not have to well implement
everything yourself
you get consistency guarantees you get
hopefully good from other speeds so it
rosal is the types of queries that you
can execute and grab Miri's or graph
algorithms are typically rather complex
so if you want to implement them
yourselves would be a lot of effort if
the database does that for you it's
better for you you want to use them in
your application
when you're thinking about how to
overcome the limits of scalability if
there anything you can do you can use is
their motive and so you talked about
queries and having to go from one area
to another and you might be moving
across cluster yeah
how what do you do what's your strategy
so you can well if the database actually
knows what the data actually looks like
it can take benefit out of it because
then you can move data locale
local so that you can do the search
mostly locally and just parts of it
remotely and therefore the queries in
total will be way faster how do you
programmatically ensure that you've got
the data that you most often use is
there a mechanism within the databases
oh yes there is certainly a mechanism in
database which is called charting and
the database that I'm working for has
some secret source of this charting
which I'm not allowed to talk about the
key takeaway from your talk what do you
want people to go away and have learned
so what I would like to teach people is
that when you are having a graph problem
sink twice if it's actually distributed
one if you don't get away with it you
have to think okay which is which is the
hard problems where I have to be
prepared for and where are the issues
that I want to want to tackle yeah and
yeah and try to find out this locality
and help the database to actually
improve the Crimson's and be aware if
you don't do it like take seconds of
periods instead of milliseconds which
you would expect which can be fatal in
some city yes of course especially if
you're saying okay I have one second to
load this entire page and I have to do a
twenty second for a rough database query
behind it then it doesn't work out yeah
um what's the most interesting question
you've been asked you gave this talk of
last week yeah so the most interesting
question is the one that I can't answer
how do we do it
[Laughter]
yeah but also it's always what are the
real use cases for databases because a
lot of people just can't imagine yeah
the graph databases are in use and
actually the use cases get more
more and more and more important so
Facebook for example social graphs they
don't do it with a graph database for
certain reasons but actually the data
that they have is a graph they could do
it in a graph database a movie that's
serious and clustering groups yes oh yes
of course
so that for Facebook for example it
would be a good idea to group all these
people that are tightly connected those
are friends and then you have these
queries or local look in your talk thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
