alright so this is the symphony of
leadership in case you didn't know and
you thought you were in a design track
or a developer track you are in a soft
skills top people anyone that does not
mean to be here get up and leave keys
alright you are spending the next 50
minutes in a soft skill talk thank you
for joining me my name is Heather Wilde
I am the CTO of a company called twit
and Rocketeer
but in my 20-plus years career I've done
many things as I'm sure many of you have
one of those that I've become a little
bit famous for is that I was one of the
founding members of a team called
Evernote many of you probably have this
automatically installed on your
computers and phones sorry about that
but it's one of their ways that we got
to unicorn growth it is something of a
point of pride though that we got to
unicorn status because people actually
loved us enough to keep using it even
though they were annoyed and they did
not install it when they rooted their
phones so I was very happy about that
but something that people don't really
know about me is that I was also a
classically trained opera singer so I
spent 16 years studying to be an opera
singer and I love music so pretty much
everything I see in the world has a
music lens on top of it and when you
have all of that inside of you you just
the world becomes a beautiful place and
for me everything is music and as Holly
was saying this morning part of what
you're here at devoxx to learn is how to
see the world a little bit differently
to learn another perspective on what
you're doing so I want to give you a
little bit of my perspective on
leadership so as I mentioned I was part
of the founding team
ever known but it was it started with
one guy called Phil Libin who was the
CEO and he had a vision for that company
and that vision was he wanted to cure
Alzheimer's I know right can you imagine
that
Evernote was formed for that well he
wanted to sit down when he was 90 years
old and when he can't even remember what
he had breakfast but had for breakfast
that morning he wanted to be able to
remember what he did when he was 12 he
wanted to see all of those terrible
ideas that he had in high school and
have a notebook for that and he wanted
to have a recording of all of the
memories of his life he wanted an
external brain something that could
remember his life for him that was the
idea that he had and he had a vision and
he also had an idea of how to make this
happen and who he was going to need to
do it and like me so Livan also had a
music background phil is the son of two
classical pianists so he grew up around
a musical family and he understood that
in order to have something grow and be
built properly you need to fill the
seats in an orchestra you have to have
the first chairs you have to have
woodwinds percussions strings the flute
everything you need to audition those
people and if you don't have exactly the
right players playing in harmony the
whole time what happens sounds terrible
imagine going to hear an opera or a
concerto and even one instrument sounds
off it doesn't work Phil knew this so
when he was recruiting his orchestra for
Evernote he put in his mind exactly who
he wanted and then who here has seen the
Muppet movie first one yeah well it was
kind of like
he was Kermit the Frog going around what
singing movin right and went and found
the people that he had gone to school
with or grown up with and people that he
knew could do those jobs could fill
those seats those best players and he
actually went around the world because
people grow up people move on from
college from high school from your
friend around the street they weren't
next to him at the time he had this
beautiful idea I was living on my
sailboat in Mexico when he shows up
knocking on my boat asking for me to
join Evernote took him three times to
convince me finally took his wife with a
basket of goodies of my exact favorite
things to convince me to join to prove
that this was something that I needed to
be a part of but he knew exactly in his
head because he was the conductor for
this Orchestra and it needed all of us
to make the perfect harmony this is a
terrible slide I know it's hard to read
in here but every team has roles that
need to be filled if you're a
solopreneur you're all of these things
at once you're going to be flipping back
and forth between engineer and marketer
and HR but you still need the best
player in that seat for it to be
beautiful music or you're not going to
succeed and you need to be able to adapt
so each team needs to understand how
this can be filled every part is
essential without these roles you cannot
move forward so
when you have a when you hear words like
agile you need to understand that it
means that you are going to be
developing quickly but still working in
harmony there is a lot of control that's
required and everyone needs to be moving
in precision with each other so unlike
traditional methods where a manager
would give somebody something to do and
then constantly be on top of them with
an agile development team like Evernote
everyone had to be highly technical and
highly skilled and be trusted to do
their job and I had to be very flexible
on how to do it so we all had our
individual skills we were all each
person had their skills and was able to
communicate with each other so because a
team assigns tasks among its members and
monitors a project's progress you have
to be a technical expert at what you're
doing
and that's why it's so essential to make
sure the best person for your team is in
that seat have to be motivated phil was
a great conductor for us it's a great
leader because we were constantly
motivated to go forward how many of you
are motivated by your leaders every day
yeah not many of you who unfortunately
what this is something that so many
people miss but it's a key to success
because if you are motivated then you'll
find it within yourself to get the job
done if you're looking to someone else
to do the job for you
then an agile team is going to lose
momentum and again each person needed to
be adaptive we needed to while each of
us be technical in our own field if one
of us played the wrong note you need to
be able to improvise quickly so it
doesn't sound terrible
because how many people release buggy
code come on yeah but what do you do you
you patch it and you cover up for the
buddy that released the Peggy come now
how many of you are in distributed teams
yeah so how important is it that you
communicate what you are doing in some
way to the people that you are working
with if you would Evernote with our
first team these people were around the
world Phil went around the world to
collect this but didn't bring us to each
other so I was still living on my
sailboat in Mexico filling my feet
playing my instrument while everyone
else was in their individual places if
we hadn't had a way to let each other
know what we were doing then would
Evernote be the company that it is today
I don't think so what we did was every
day we had a way to communicate to let
each other know quickly what we were
working on with the company and we used
integrated thinking to come up with
answers to problems now who here knows
what integrated thinking is all right
cool this is awesome because it's a way
to find answers to problems that no one
else is thought of before
you just think in an entire systems way
for example what I did why I was so
useful to Phil
the way that I apply things like
thinking about music in leadership at
Evernote I thought let's run Evernote
like an airline I created a
hub-and-spoke system of distributed
teams inside a text company this was
something that nobody had done in
Silicon Valley before and to my
knowledge only one other company is
doing it and that's somebody that's run
but at some company that's run by a
former Evernote or who cloned us it was
highly successful and it's because we
were able to apply systems thinking to a
problem that we were given but by doing
that by understanding what problems we
were all running into individually we
were able to post-mortem nest
post-mortems are a very important thing
that you do when you're running an agile
team because you have to understand what
you're doing every day and I mean it
every day I use a program called eye
doneness which is great because you can
just say literally what did you do today
so that everyone else on the team has
transparency and it's just that you just
put down the three things that you found
most important that you did that day
it's very point so what are the things
that are most important for a conductor
to lead their team they have to start
with a plane Phil had his plan his
vision for what he wanted to do even
though he had the team he knew who he
wanted it didn't matter he couldn't
convince me to join him until he could
prove to me that this was going to be
something important so if you have a
vision then you can get people to follow
you if you have the leadership skills to
do it if you're confident enough
and you can show that you have a plan of
how you're going to get it done then
that is the first step to how to get
your orchestra started then just like so
you recruit the best players
now that doesn't mean that you have to
go to Stanford and Harvard and MIT and
get people that graduate at the top of
their class what it means is you find
the people that will fill out your
orchestra the best who can play this
piece for you and that's not going to be
the same for everyone the person that
she is as a manager it's not the same
person that he is as a manager and the
people that will fall underneath you the
people that will follow you are not the
same so who is your team you need to
hire properly the conductor is visible
now in an orchestra the conductor is
standing on a platform they're always
there they're not hiding somewhere off
stage they're not somewhere that you
can't find them they are always there
ready to be seen if something goes wrong
so if you have a leader that's not out
in front of you but you can't go to that
you can't see their direction then your
company is not likely going to have a
direction to go for very long place not
in the companies that I've seen so
successful teams have leaders that are
visible that are out there and that give
you clear directions they take full
responsibility
for everything that they are doing one
of the things that I did after Evernote
was I was brought down by a man called
Tony Hsieh to help him work with
something he was working on called the
downtown project in Las Vegas he's the
CEO of Zappos which is an outpost of
Amazon and he was having trouble with
some of his investments and one of those
was actually the city of Las Vegas is
one of his investments the downtown area
and because he was out he was supposed
to be visible as the leader of this
project but there was no leader so
people didn't know where to go people
didn't know who to talk to
so one of the things that I did was I
helped to put a leader there I helped to
have somebody that people could go to to
talk to you about what is the direction
of this project what are we trying to do
what are our aims within a year we
turned around the ROI of the project
like it had been losing about three
hundred and fifty million dollars and we
turned it around to like over a million
dollars in profits I mean 100 million
dollars in profit so by it is a very
very big problem when you do not have a
clear person to turn to this is one of
the most important things that people
lose in their teams I love this slide
one on big Star Wars geek but I just who
here has a manager that just they just
cannot stand you can be honest yeah it's
probably somebody that they come in and
they take out all their frustrations on
you right yeah they're leaving with
heart in the wrong way you need to
express your emotions without being
emotional and
you need to care about your employees
because a conductor steals the music
they feel the passion that's within the
piece and if you're listening to a
beautiful piece of music a beautiful
aria a beautiful concerto and you can
feel that coming through I mean even
Harry Styles this new song can make it
cry a little bit so if your is there
playing full-out then you're going to
feel that in the music you can feel it
on the teams that care when you've got a
company that has leadership that cares
then you know that it's somebody you
want to deal with I mean just think
about the difference between oh I just
think about all the airline problems
that everybody's having right now Virgin
Atlantic cancelling all the flights this
week do they seem to care about people
half of the speakers didn't we're having
trouble getting here because of the
cancellations but they've left people
stranded in the airport we're having the
same problems in America right now those
companies don't they're not leading with
heart at the moment conductors delegate
if you have people on your team that
want to do everything themselves
and you have a manager that's allowing
that then what happens when that person
is out sick or is or leaves for a better
job offer suddenly all of the burden
falls onto the remaining people on the
team that is not a great manager that is
not a great leader your team needs to
spread the work amongst each other
the conductor doesn't do everything
himself
he puts people in their individual
chairs he has somebody else sell the
tickets he has somebody else make sure
the instruments are tuned he's not doing
everything himself he's conducting so
why would you as a leader try to do
everything yourself it's just silly
so we need to focus on our individual
talents and allow that to shine through
and good leader should allow us to have
that happen as well
every gesture every small little thing
is seen because the connector is visible
and makes an impact conductor can't
afford to make something unintentional
because what's going to happen going to
go out of tune again somebody's going to
play the wrong note I'm going to speed
up and slow down it's going to sound
terrible everything means something so
you can't afford to be careless just
think about for example what if our
fearless leader mark hazel what if he
had done something in public this week
that was something aunt Ida vaccean
would would we have 1100 people here
this week probably not maybe some
sponsors would pull out he's our
conductor this week and it's very
important that he makes sure that every
gesture he makes is perfect and on point
but the conductor keeps his back to the
audience too because what's most
important is that he's paying attention
to his team they're aware of what the
audience is doing they know if they're
clapping they know if they're snapping
they know if everybody's hating on them
on Twitter they know but their focus is
on the musicians their focus is on
making sure that that performance is the
perfect one and then the next night and
the next night and the next night and
that everyone is consistent because if
it's not then they're going to
post-mortem it and they're going to run
through it and they're going to make
sure that everything's good again and
they're going to bug fix that
but you can see the conductor as an
audience member and that's the
interesting thing
you can see what he's doing you can see
just like in sports you can see the
coaches you can see what they're doing
but you don't know what's going on you
know that something interesting is
happening and all of the team members
know what's happening but it's an it's
their own little world that that's going
on there it's magical
somebody that's really great at doing
this is Elon Musk
so Elon Musk is visible to the world
obviously we all know who he is he's
he's in charge of basically the world's
X we're going to go to Mars because of
Elon but he's really mostly caring about
his companies
everything he does is to make sure that
the people and his companies are taken
care of
even joining counsels and things he he's
public but he's still facing his team so
he's the one behind the scenes making
the music happen and the conductor
shares the spotlight when the concerts
over and the audience is clapping who's
the first person to take a bow the good
conductor turns to the audience and then
says thank you to my team make sure that
you understand that this is for them
they have done this it's not me a good
leader does the same thing they do not
take the credit for themselves whose
managers take all the credit for
themselves so yeah good managers
good leaders share the credit because
it's your team that gets you there so
here's some examples of companies that
get this right and some that didn't so a
company called reward me that you've
never heard of for good reasons they
raised a million dollars pretty good
right for a start-up company they were
founded in 2010 and they they strung
along for five years until uh they
scaled too quickly and closed down for
founder misalignment what's founder
misalignment well that's communication
problems these founders couldn't talk to
each other they didn't have the right
team another company that you've never
heard of is Google they couldn't secure
funding they started in 2011 closed down
in 2015 again four years good run they
couldn't secure funding and that led to
co-founder disagreements now money is a
problem for a lot of co-founders a lot
of companies they they closed down
because of funding this one wasn't a
problem for funding they raised thirty
five million dollars they were again
open for five years and yet had no
business model how do you raise thirty
five million dollars with no business
model I have no idea I'd love to talk to
them about that though now a company
that's doing it right and yes I do know
the problems with ubirr I am aware but
sixty eight billion dollar valuation
they've had a strategic marketing plan
they do have culture problems but their
marketing plan is extremely strategic
and they're using integrated thinking to
get it there SpaceX love Elon I think
their valuations even up a little more
this week have to check that one but
they are hiring the best of the best
Elon goes out and he recruits people
that recruit the best people and he
doesn't even need to recruit anymore I
mean who here would work for SpaceX in a
second at the good yeah or Tesla or
Airbnb 30 billion dollar valuation leads
with their heart this is a an
interesting scenario because their chief
marketing officer says the company's
motto is we lean in to the uncomfortable
truth Airbnb always wants to know if
there's any problems that anyone has
they always want to know anything that
you have any problems with so they can
fix it right away and it's something
that allowed them to scale in such a
disruptive market super quick their
marketing strategy embraces their belief
that brands startups and traditional
companies we need to use questions and
concerns to their advantage so how do
you implement these strategies in your
company or just in your like if you're a
startup without like a massive company
or a solopreneur with just one person
how do you implement any of this stuff
it's so important that you do try to do
something because it can increase your
ROI and raise you so quickly when you
get a 31% increase in productivity
by paying attention to even just one of
these things and a 37 percent increase
in sales if you pay attention to four
out of eight so the Harvard Business
Review says you get three hundred
percent increase in innovation if you do
all eight so it is important to pay
attention to these so what you can do is
you can start with behavioral
assessments so there are things like
doing the myers-briggs as the disc the
IOM fingerprint for success any of these
kinds of behavioral assessments when
you're hiring to find out what kind of
people you have on your team or if you
already hired them to do them now to
find out and this will allow you to know
who you have on your team so you can
communicate with them better
for example I'm an INTJ that means I
have an introvert so I would prefer
working alone in a tunnel by myself
under covered in the dark pretty much
all the time
my best friend is an extrovert she wants
to be the most social butterfly ever do
you think we love working together
absolutely we love working together she
like we work in silence together for
about 24 hours straight at a clip it's
but you wouldn't necessarily know that
but unless you understood multiple
facets of our personalities open
communication processes if you start
clamming up and don't talk to one
another then your teams will continue to
do that
and then you will fail you need to start
implementing things that allow you to
talk for example again I haven't
BIRT I like to do everything via email
or chat or something like that
best friends an extrovert she likes to
talk and be chatty so what I instantly
started to do was I created automatic
github check-ins so that she could see
in JIRA right away what I was doing so
that I could be quiet and she could see
all of the stuff that I did without me
having to open my mouth but having an
open communication process of some kind
that works for all of your team members
is important motivational assessments
this is different from behavioral
assessments because this tells you the
this gives you a pulse on what your team
is actually feeling right now behavioral
assessment tells you who they are a
motivational assessment tells you where
they are right now emotionally and what
you can do to fix it so for example the
happiness at work survey is a great test
that you can take for free online and it
tells you things like am i stressed at
work
am i happy with the pay that I'm getting
do I like my managers things like that
in synonymous so if you take this as a
team together you can find out really
quickly what problems you might have
that you didn't know about in your
company core values how many people in
have core values for their company how
many can name the core values that you
have for your company yes that's the
problem if you don't know what your core
values are you're not living your core
values therefore your core values are
useless core values need to be something
that you're living and breathing every
day if your core values if you have a
list of core values for your company
that's like more than five for example
and they're all like big long sentences
that you can't easily spout out those
aren't core values that's a mission
statement and somebody needs to get back
to the drawing board so core values need
to be active and they need to be things
that you can live and be
so your your company your core values
that's something that everyone has to
have buy-in and be able to just and it
needs to also come out not just in the
words on a wall it needs to come through
in all of the products that you're
creating in the work space that you have
in the playlists that you're playing in
the cafeteria in your office my company
we have core values playlist on Spotify
that we play so or they are The
Rocketeer core values are bold inspire
love and truth so we actually have our
built by Rocketeer playlist on Spotify
that we play for all of our team around
the world so that like when we need to
feel a bit of a little bit more loved
today like we just put on that playlist
and and then we're feeling it so that's
it's something that needs to be
actionable so that you know what you're
doing
what you're feeling and you can all be
on the same page and then hiring for
company culture which if you do this
wrong you will be hiring for biases you
need to be very careful that you're
hiring for the in the right way hiring
for company culture in the wrong way
causes problems like uber is having
right now because they're hiring a lot
of people that look like them because
that's the people they know hiring for
company culture means that you're hiring
the people that will make your company
live the values in the best way so it
goes back to what set values for the
company that make us the company we need
to be then hire the people that can help
us live that vision best and then
recognize your employees because whether
you're a man or a woman you're not
always going to be the person that
stands up and says hey hey I did this I
did this I'm awesome people need to be
recognized for the work that they do
whether that's in
a bonus a raise a gift card for Amazon a
cupcake gold stars and octopus on flak
whatever just recognize that people did
work and that they were good and that
they are good at what they do and it's
something just take a bow at the end of
a job well done and be consistent with
your brand's with your messaging all of
it because if you're not consistent if
you don't deliver the same quality day
after day night after night then people
won't return people aren't going to sell
out your show at the west end it's not
going to be a long-running play it's
going to be another reward me or Google
because nobody knows who those people
are except in my presentations so with
that I have a minute or two for Q&amp;amp;A so
I'm and with that we do rubber duckies
so now is the time in my presentations
where we give unicorn rubber duckies so
who would like a rubber duckie all right
okay what question have you got
so that's funny you asked that because
one of my other talks is management
skills for the non leader it's it's
actually something that you can
oops sorry you can step you can start to
first you can step aside and take the
manager and point these things out you
can go through proper channels in your
team and if they don't take the hint
then you can start to mentor this other
person yourself so I like the first
thing I would do is talk to the leader
and see like you're you're not doing
this help them but if if you if you
start to rise yourself take the
management skills yourself and and do
that then it will be it's it usually
I've seen ends up in your promotion to
manager at some point in time because
people then point out hey they're the
one that's mentoring me they're the one
that's awesome and they've been the one
that's most helpful and other your peers
start recognizing you rather than them
but yeah the its but it really is first
talk to them quietly and then if that
doesn't work then just take the lead so
all right here we go
Oh close all right
okay all right Oh barrier so
methodologies like DevOps and agile
often get implemented by bringing a new
tool in or say hey let's stand up once a
day or let's have a retrospective but
usually it boils down to changing the
culture inside of an organization and
changing the culture outside of the
technical team how was people who have
developers or project owners help to
talk to the business in a better way
that stops them asking what do I get
when do I get it and how much they're
going to cost me I found the best way to
influence the people outside the
development team is by tying a dollar
amount to it if you can prove that what
the change that you're trying to make
will save the company money especially a
significant amount of money like a more
than one percentage amount of money
which amazingly is a significant amount
then whatever change you're trying to
make they will adopt until you assign a
dollar amount to it it'll fall on deaf
ears but the second that you do that
things change so whatever you can do
turn it into an ROI of some kind and you
will grease wheels so there you go I'm
terrible at this okay yes
very interesting interesting when you
talked about tearing and on company
culture good could he say something
about how you do that most efficiently
in particular when you have a very
limited amount of times these lots of
candidates you have unlimited time and
the candidates obviously in the in the
interview processes are not gonna behave
the same ways is there going to behave
and in real life so are they any secret
tricks how you can be very effective
with that well it depends on the type of
person that you're interviewing for so
if it's if it's a technical candidate I
have different tricks than if it's a
business candidate and marketing
campaign for example but I generally
what I do is I always I always try to do
a if I can a job trial with people that
I want to hire of at least a a week
where they're actually on the job with
the team that they're going to be
working with because this is the best
way I've found for people to see both
sides to see if it's going to be a fit
if because in an interview people do
behave completely differently that then
what they're going to be at work and
sometimes you hire somebody and they
find out that this job is completely
different than they thought it was going
to be and then they're miserable and
then they tank the work and you're
miserable because now you have to go
through hiring again so if you do kind
of a semi internship with people like
Tony Hsieh does at Zappos actually he
gives a month the people on the job and
he pays them two thousand dollars to
quit within the first month if it's not
for them because it's a very unorthodox
hiring culture yeah so I do at least a
week of of job shadowing with people to
let them see do you really want to work
with me is this something that you want
to do and if you if you can do that by
all means that's that's the only
literally that's the only way that I've
found that you can honestly know if it's
going to be a fit
all right oh yes hi so this is kind of
extension for the earlier question
around if you're in a team that where
the leadership isn't really working I
wondered if you had any thoughts ran
teams where there are perhaps more than
one person who has very strong views
about direction and kind of almost two
leaders who wants pull teams in
different directions because there isn't
enough sort of resource to go around yes
so when that happens more frequently
than it should and that also if it if an
alpha leader doesn't rise quickly then
it pulls teams apart because it's not
fun working when you've got battling
heads and you end up losing your best
people because they don't want to deal
with that and they don't have to deal
with that because there's better places
to be so when you have that and people
don't if it doesn't get settled quickly
by somebody that by either one of those
two people or somebody above them then
then my recommendation to everyone
that's ever been in that is to get out
bad it's really bad really bad hi yes
and he talked a lot about being a
conductor in finding your orchestra I'm
about to be dropped as a conductor into
an orchestra where I don't know what
instruments they're play what a fuel
level they are and I wanted to get any
tips or advice yes that's actually the
position I am most usually in because I
go in as an interim CTO quite a bit and
my main tip is you are going to have to
win their trust immediately so before
even learning their skills you'll have
to win their trust and then you get to
learn more about them
and who here has had that happen to them
before do you grieve that that's the
thing that you have to do that yeah yeah
it's so win their trust and then take
the time to to learn more about them but
if you don't do that
day one then you'll you'll never get the
chance again so let's say that you have
a good company with a good culture
everything is working very fine but
realize that even if you have plan that
won't change the direction and that
culture may not work well and so you
wanting to create other people with a
different culture how you prevent
cultural clashes oh so I've been
involved in in culture changes in
companies and usually what happens is
it's a person that's coming in and
they're actively going to change the
culture like on purpose because the one
that was work was there was not working
and they need to change it and when this
happens you will lose people and that's
okay
expect to lose a lot of people because
the people that were following the old
culture are not people that you want so
like you're going to lose people and
great because now you can clean house
get people that will follow your new
culture and you're going to hire for the
new culture because the people that were
there were hired for the old culture not
the new ones so that's and but you're
going to get a lot of friction in the
time in-between and the only way to
handle it is to just stay the course and
know that you're doing the thing that
needs to get done
all right any more we got we have time
for one more question
anyone but all right
so you talked about the process of
setting values for an organization I've
been through that a couple of times and
a few different jobs and to be candid we
were kind of a bit cynical about it it
kind of felt like a corporate
box-ticking sort of exercise how can you
effectively set value so that people buy
into it and it feels worthwhile well
again I think that you approach it as a
corporate box-ticking exercise then
they're not going to buy into it if you
actually bring the whole company in
allow them to be part of it and then do
it in such a way that they are
actionable that you are living them and
do things like in my company how like we
have the playlist we're living it every
day like I mean I I know that everything
I do is built by rocketeers like I mean
that that's the thing like we live our
values and it's it's a mantra for our
company and the companies like Southwest
Airlines in the United States where like
everything is loved by Southwest because
their values are loved so I mean you
know the companies that are living their
values and the companies that aren't so
if it's just words on a wall then you
didn't do it right you just pick the box
but it's it's a valuable exercise if you
follow through with it just like
anything that you do if you're not
following through if you're not
consistent if you don't follow up then
there's no point still thank you
all right well close well I wanted to
thank everybody for coming if you have
