enterprise REST API design about api's
and specifically you mentioned
lightweight api's what do you mean by
designing a lightweight API oh it's but
lightweight API is actually using the
minimal tools to reach something that
you that you are what you want really
and it was a lightweight process and i
would like to its tools lightweight
tooling what I meant by lightweight but
of course lightweight the result also is
going to be lightweight the API and
light with API for me is also just
providing the minimal things and so not
no other engineering don't bloat your
API used unnecessary things and the only
thing you have to do is actually keep
the doors open to evolution you have to
to a stretcher for example your your LS
in a way that you can ads afterwards
resources in your whistles tree if you
have a tree like API and it is also
having your model your type definition
your chosen types opens to to be to be
extended up to words it's not implement
real is directly the whole thing's all
the use cases that you could imagine
just focus on what you up to do now and
keep the doors open is it it's very
particular challenged with api's when
you're moving towards a micro service
architecture because you have more
points of communication between the
different services yes of course when
you when you transform an application
that is monolithic into microservices
your application could have
transactional aspects so when you
distribute your article a application we
usually don't have anymore a
transactional context where everything
happens so in this situation you have to
design the api's in a way that it has a
protocol but the sequence of things that
happen between the micro services
is done in a in a way that is actually
that but does not really simulate the
transactional aspects but that resembles
in to achieve a sequence of operation
and have at the end something that is
consistent is right what's the key
takeaway from your talk what do you hope
that people have learned so the talk was
about tuning for for API design and I've
shown quite some some some examples of
our AP is and for me it's more about
ruling that we have in many open-source
projects around in the in the area of
recipe is and you have to pick them to
choose the ones that fits the needs
again the simple ones minimal one that
fulfill your needs and you can combine
them together to have something
interesting and this is actually the the
projects that we that we open source
recently epic Anna that does that just a
combination of simple tools to provide
something meaningful on lightweight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
