with Manuel and Claudio and you're from
last minute calm when you're giving you
talks especially me
can you tell me a bit about you took
absolutely so the talk is busy our
journey for one year to basically get to
on premises cluster for kubernetes quite
a big challenge because we were coming
from use of technical depths in terms of
the infrastructure and platform but we
wanted to push forward being
bleeding-edge and basically moving from
visual machines and difficulties and
challenges on managing them for 100 of
micro-services msb getting to the
bleeding edge which was containers
docker kubernetes and did we get all the
benefits of it what do you think the
benefits of using containers are virtual
machine ok those are impressing so that
container are more flexible a container
is an in terms of development process is
a multiple thing that can move through
environments then we can have the same
environment is the same here yer between
environments that the developers can
build a software and then move this
software with all the things that run
outside the software in a different
environment like staging or QA or
production with the exactly the same
behavior then there is no difference the
although the patch management the
security management is quite simple
because every deploy can keep all the
upgrades if there is a pipeline that can
support this and also the kind of
scalability of the pods are very fast is
the only matter of a number in the
yellow file or in a
in the common line again scale pod the
mean service from 10 to 100 in a in a
shot I think from a software engineering
perspective a software development
workflow is also trying to raise the
confidence of our development teams
essentially your shipping mutable image
or what your software is doing across
different environments really fast so I
think it's also a matter of decoupling
what is the externalized configuration
that change between the different
vitamins and being able basically if you
have the continent of having the same
piece of software that is going for that
QA until production so it's a it is
trying to push faster more reliably and
more frequently which was something we
couldn't do in the past because when we
were using the vector machines basically
less standard less guidance the genus
environment and that basically say means
that every single the same product or
software engineering application was
essentially different one from another
so diminishing returns in terms of
producing waste less confidence when the
point while single technology immutable
images and we know what about is the
infrastructure Gregg on deployment
because he's basically OMA genes between
all the environments we have and did you
find the e Hartke with any unexpected
advantages as well she made the change
was being bleeding-edge to be get a
performance privilege yes I think so
because essentially what we experienced
it is that we were looking forward with
but we didn't think it could work so
well but mixing kubernetes with docker
images basically the end result was that
the architecture was so stable that I
think is almost 9 months then 10 months
now that didn't touch anything on our
infrastructure and that's really the
property of self-healing it is clear
there so we have the number of incidents
from
hardware perspective bad Ahmadi nobody
from the business part notice because
because from migration of the parts the
action additional old other services
covered and behind the scene and that I
think is way more that we expected now I
think also that using digital
technologies is pushing everybody from
my culture and mentality perspective
towards new results because it open ups
new opportunity and want to take them so
you start considering things you've
never done in the past just because the
opportunity and the features are there I
just need to grab them victim so you're
always had the cultural shift than in
your development team to people thinking
oh now we change containers why don't we
try this
listen exactly I think that applies also
for yesterday's yeah of course
prices kubernetes andhaka able really
able to decouple the service that are
provided to the other then we have the
freedom to change hardware to change
operating system montina the same
behavior then the service are not touch
it we encounter some problems with the
operating system then we change the
operating system and nothing happens on
banana side nothing happens on
deployment side no disruption service or
other things and it's a kind of magic
really it's fantastic yeah I think
another unexpected benefit is probably
shielding our engineering steam from
what we is happening the undersea
completely transparent they continue the
work stream they give a business video
product online while under the would be
a working in terms of mixing things
trying new things to implement new
features we under seen and the basically
get delivered almost seamlessly
okay so they get to use it without
Konami looks like almost amazing to
thinking you learnt
it's a difficult to read the hard part
so when we started we never thought that
we could have so many unexpected issues
so the journey has not been so smooth
probably because we were leading edge
from one perspective probably because
when you start scaling in production
what you see that you have to start
fetching the natives or working around
any glitches you might have it's not
easy
no it's not related and a lot of
connects better behavior things that are
very different at pod is not the butyl
machine polishes life in operating
system
both speaking getting it to the kernel
then there are the other that are
strange for also that came from the the
classic guitar machine behavior or
conserve behavior things like we use and
drinks as a English and I think so ok
what service proxy with super power um
we encountered some boxing this software
create problem set is a absolutely
unexpected we sought the death of course
we worked so this and so but if I oh my
gosh what happened we try to test and
orgs down was that the first time
Francis actually is it really expected
now we are learning the this behavior we
are learning how to understand the the
problems after all before it depends but
no need
we are doing a lot of things it's a
bumpy ride
so to summarize property you are you
have to understand that you're going to
face it
yes moreover if you are have a lot of
constraints like we did so not being
able to embrace immediacy the public
clouds that is a problem because we had
a huge data center we cannot base create
the site from one moment to the other to
basically disinvest completely and the
cost was really high so to create even
an average cloud you need to start with
an on-premises cluster and that has a
lot of constraint erm so how you do
things and even how you tackle technical
depth as you cannot essentially block
the roadmap of the product or the
business because we have been asked
business doesn't like it so local stuff
thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
