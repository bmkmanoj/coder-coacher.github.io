welcoming today folks
it's a I've been coming today about
excitedly reviewers now so it's it's
quite a privilege to be on this side of
the podium for the first time just as a
quick question I could hand off with
anyone's actually heard of CERN before
okay great most of you that means I
brought the right talk then that's good
okay so well for those are the few of
you who don't know what CERN is sarin is
the world's largest particle physics
research laboratory situated in the
heart of Europe near the city of Geneva
Switzerland but in fact this talk starts
right at the beginning of time back when
all first began when the whole universe
was in a hot dense state where nearly 14
billion years ago expansion started wait
isn't that a Big Bang Theory well
actually it is an excellent show but not
this one but it took me quite some time
to realize that this wasn't actually a
documentary if you've met my family
you'll understand why but no what I want
to tell you actually is a little bit
about CERN from the other side sarin is
an organization tell you a few things
were in CERN probably that you don't
already know as I said CERN is located
near the city of Geneva in Switzerland
this is the the main campus of CERN
there's around 12 to 15 thousand people
who are working here all the time so
unsurprisingly it's a little bit like a
small town we've got our own restaurants
of course there's three of them on-site
in fact quite a lot of the physics
discoveries actually take place not in
the particle detectors but actually
sitting discussing around of it lunch in
the lunchroom but not only that we
actually also run the biggest hotel in
the area 450 rooms on the local site and
another 150 rooms just off-site and
nearby friends we've our own medical
service we've got our own fire brigades
we've got our own ambulance service in
fact as well run by the in conjunction
with our local hospitals of course is a
research organization we have a huge
library as well but even we have our own
on-site store sixteen thousand eight
are available for distribution within
our on-site story in fact we even have
our own kindergarten for the local
staffs to keep their kids my kids were
into that kindergarten as well it's
truly a unique place our internal
transport service moves a hundred and
eighty thousand parcels everything
ranging from postage all the way up to
parts of the acceleration detector
around the site every single year we are
one of a handful of places in Europe
with our own 400 kilovolt electrical
insulation with a capacity of 200
megawatts and as an organization and
literally spans the border between
France and Switzerland we have our own
international border one of unique in
the world which is barrack guarded by a
private company if I'd even if gardener
who cuts the grass has to worry about
the international transfer to waste as
he has to dispose of the grass clippings
it's truly an unusual organization
unique in the world and from the mundane
to the highly complex Saren is a place
of extremes
we have civil engineering project
building structures underground
structures the size of cathedrals and at
the same time these huge devices are
used to study phenomena at the
microscopic and subatomic scale Saren
was a European organization it was one
of Europe's first joint ventures created
over 60 years ago now as just after the
Second World War and the vision was to
put countries scientists together to
work together to try to understand the
universe better and at the same time
share the information freely with the
rest of the world today there's almost
someone from almost every continent of
the world working on Saran's various
activities incited because of the
widespread community of over 12,000
scientists the CERN scientists Tim
berners-lee and Robert ko invented the
world wide web it's hard to imagine the
world today without the web but when I
first arrived at Saren back in the early
90s the world wide web was just being
developed Robert Tim berners-lee was
working on his first web browser on his
next wake workstation and acai Tamir is
a friend of mine and Nicola
and she was working another tool that I
was helping her with which was called
the line mode browser this is a time
when most people access to computer
systems through terminal servers using
vt100 terminals and this was what the
web looked like then this this was long
before the days of course with
underlined hyperlinks and it's right if
you wanted to navigate using a new
variable the time you typed in the
number at the bottom of the screen or to
browse to the next page okay the world
has come a long way since and and
certainly this answer of many in the
innovations from from special techniques
where we using compact and particle
accelerators for a nuclear medicine to
special medical imaging technologies
which was developed using the detective
technologies actually developed at CERN
and even mundane things you might see
such as high precision welding there are
40,000 leak-tight joints when we were
constructing the LHC and we had to
develop new techniques in order to do
the welding in order to make sure that
this all works correctly this is a
photograph actually from 1975 long
before I arrived at CERN and in the
guy's hands here it's a track bulb maybe
not all that unusual these days but
probably what more interestingly is this
one here this is actually a capacitive
touchscreen a technology invented it's
CERN and there's no ubiquitous part of
practically every single mobile phone I
couldn't resist this photograph actually
this is from the early 1970s as well
this was at the control room for the
super proton synchrotron I couldn't
resist for the the lovely yellow color
scheme with the yellow under lights from
the 1970s and this this defied this
console all those are built long before
I arrived it was actually still in place
when I arrived in the early 90s and I
remember my first my first boss he was
explaining to me that the software team
had actually developed an application
that would put a little sailing ship on
one of the screens when the last one
side they're using a programming
language long since forgotten called
noddle and they say the little boat
would then sail across each of the
screens one by one much they no ends of
the operators were actually trying to
get their job done
it's Aaron's job although we're very
proud of all of these innovations sarin
isn't there
to do applied research the kind of
research you would do in industry which
you can make great innovations but you
can't meet the great leaps of
understanding without fundamental
physics reason without fundamental
research and that's what goes on in CERN
to paraphrase one of the early Director
General's of CERN
there is no amount of Applied Research
that you can do in a candle which would
lead you to developing a light bulb or
even an LED so that's what's Aaron's
doing sarin is understanding how the
universe works a more basic level
fundamental research training at the
basic laws of nature and to do that we
need to look a little bit of history so
back in the early 17th century we had
Joanna's Kepler he had basically modeled
the the planets and understood how they
were orbiting the Sun and come up with
formulas which accurately described the
motion of the planets around at the same
time Isaac Newton who would famously
discovered gravity had also created
formulas which could measure and
describe the motion of objects and it
was around about this time that a
student Max Planck was speaking to his
professor and asking for advice on what
he should study next and at that time
the understanding was that physics was
basically done there was nothing left to
discover basically crossing the T's
dotting the eyes but we'd pretty much
modelled the universe and we knew pretty
much exactly how things worked and so
physics was really noted interesting so
a subject for such a talented student as
Max Planck but then a few years later
there was a famous Liefeld experiment by
Albert Michelson and Edward Morley what
they were trying to do is at the time
the current series of of how light
propagated through the universe there
was a substance of called
ether which permeated the universe and
light travel through it so what did the
advice was an experiment which they were
using the fact as the earth orbited the
Sun you would come into a headwind of
ether and so you'd actually noticed that
the speed of light would change so
they've conducted experiments and of
course discovered that the speed of
light is the same in all directions all
the time and in fact that discovery
ultimately led to Einstein's theory of
special relativity
ten years later GT Thompson discovered
the electron and that ultimately led to
the discovery of the atomic nucleus and
round up at the same time fortunately
after ignoring the advice of his
professors Max Planck's study blackbody
radiation and that ultimately led to the
understanding of quantum mechanic ones
of physics today current theories can
only occur around with 5% of the visible
universe
quite different from Micra when blacks
Planck was a student the best to
understand the universe who s way to do
it to go back in time to try to
understand how it all began with
satellites and telescopes cosmologists
and astrophysicist made great strides in
this area but there's a limit around
380,000 a thousand years after the Big
Bang just around a bit here the universe
before then was too hot and light simply
couldn't escape he say to me the
universe was opaque but there's another
way you can try to recreate the
conditions they existed shortly after
the Big Bang and to do that you need
particle accelerators and the LHC is the
largest and most powerful particle
accelerator that exists in the world and
we can get closer to the beginning of
time than anyone else to a millionth of
a millionth of a second so what do I
mean by particle accelerators well if we
explain I think it's probably the best
with an illustration by playing a little
game I like to call angry apples so here
we have a particle accelerator the two
particles in this case are two apples
and what we're going to do is do an
experiment to see what happens when we
accelerate them and collide them
together ok let's start up the
accelerator and bring it up to level one
it want a level one collision if we
weren't ready no okay I think this is
probably one of the most least exciting
experiments I've ever done in my life
you basically roll into each other in
stopped I think if we want to see a
little bit more interesting physics
we're going to have to reset and
increase the energy up to level two
okay I'm sure this would be much more
interesting let's go okay so we've got a
bruised eyeful a little bit of a
collision but really not that much
interesting going on here so I really
think if we want to do something a bit
more interesting we're gonna have to
reset and push the energy up even higher
okay this is a level three collision
this is going to be good go okay
so we've turned apples into apple fury
not the most interesting experiment we
could do and I think all of you will
understand that all these all these
levels of the collisions are basically
things that you would experience in
everyday life ideally not too much level
three but these are fairly typical
things nothing unusual is happened but
that's not what we do at CERN and the
particle accelerators we have it CERN we
put enough energy incredibly high levels
of energy into the particles and then
something quite different happens let's
have a look and see what happens then so
let's push a energy right up to the very
maximum everyone already go woah oh okay
so we started off with two apples and
that we basically ended up with the
content of a fruit bowl oh wow look
we've even got a cue berry these are it
up it's already deconstructed back into
a three black Barrett three blueberries
oh well so what's going on here
well in fact all this happening is the
application of probably one of the most
well known physics formula in the world
e equals MC squared a simple equation
that saves so much
he of course on one side is energy and
on the other side we have M for mass and
C squared okay C squared C is the
constant the speed of light or 300,000
kilometers a second when you square it
it becomes a big number but what this
equations exactly telling is is if you
get out energy into a small enough space
you can actually create matter you can
create something from energy there is an
equivalence between the two of them the
problem is that C is such a big number
you need an incredibly high amount of
energy in order to create any amount of
mass
and it's CERN we have an incredible
amount of energy squeezed into a proton
that's why we don't have a large Apfel
Collider at CERN and of course we have a
Large Hadron Collider anarchy is protons
because you need to squeeze the energy
into tiny amount of space and apples are
just too big fields accelerate so we put
a huge amount of energy into a single
proton 7 tera electron volts I'm sure
this is a skill that's very familiar to
all of you no me neither
so I guess it's about the energy of us
of a cruise ship going through the ocean
actually no it's not as much as that I
hope a racing car no it's not even as
much as that how about a guy in a bike
no it's not that either
in fact 7 TeV corresponds to buddy ever
I've read your energy of a well-fed
mosquito the only difference is we take
all of that energy and squeeze it into a
single proton now your typical mosquito
has a hundred six still Yin protons in
it 10 to the power 23 and we squeeze all
of that into a single proton that's the
incredible levels of energy that we're
talking about so how do we do it well we
use particle accelerators and it all
starts with the bottle of hydrogen you
probably already know where the hydrogen
is fatally a proton and an electron
circling around about it so the first
thing we do of course is to get rid of
the electron and we do that in a device
with a supersize Rui name called a Joule
plasmatron proton source so we rip off
the electron and the protons travel into
the first accelerator that we have this
is the linear accelerator the linic and
the proton to enter one end and through
different charge plates we actually push
and cool the protons as they go through
the machine within 45 meters they're
already traveling at a hundred thousand
kilometers a second one-third of the
speed of light it would be impractical
now for them to carry on a straight-line
so the first thing we do is we gather
them together into a small accelerator
ring called the the proton synchrotron
booster where the protons are gathered
into bunches and then pushed into the
first and whatever oldest accelerators
the proton synchrotron
this is a circular accelerator 600
meters in diameter within 1.2 seconds
the protons are accelerated to 99% of
the speed of light but at that point
this is our first gear we can go no
faster so we have to transfer it into a
NICs largest accelerator this super
proton synchrotron we're not very good
with names at CERN within the super also
in synchronous is 7 kilometers in
diameter now it takes around 3 seconds
to get to 99.99 eight percent of the
speed of light at that point we can't go
any faster any more so we go to the next
larger accelerator the Large Hadron
Collider there the particles are sent in
opposite directions around 27 kilometer
ring and after 20 minutes with full
acceleration they reach the maximum of
energy of 7 TeV or in other words
99.999999 1% of the speed of light at
which point we patch them together
inside the tunnel this is what it looks
like this is a long string the blue
objects you see here are the dipole
magnets which actually keep the
particles in line
these are electromagnets running in
superconducting temperatures the field
strength within the magnets is their own
named Tesla or about 200,000 times that
of the Earth's magnetic field to do that
we passed 12,000 amps through the cables
in fact the main etic field is so strong
that it actually exerts a bending force
on the magnets itself over around 400
tons per meter that's a bit the wave of
a Boeing 747 so they have to be
incredibly strong in order to make sure
the protons don't hit anything is the
goo around the inside of the pipes are
actually evacuated a very high vacuum
ten to the minus thirteen atmospheres or
about one-tenth the surface of the moon
and to keep everything running we have
to keep it at cryogenic temperatures
minus 271 degrees Celsius actually a
degree colder than you find in outer
space as many of our physicists say
sarin it really is the coolest place in
the world to work and the whole thing is
held in a tunnel underground about 150
meters underground these large
installations
see here these are the actual facilities
where the detectors are housed Cathedral
side constructions actually built
underground the whole thing as you can
see sits under the French countryside
near the city of Geneva in the
background there you can actually see
that's mom law in fact and my house is
so roundabout here actually where I live
so the whole thing basically sits in the
French countryside underground this
enormous installation inside the protons
are going around 11,000 times a second
roundish 27 kilometer racetrack
they're gathered into bunches there's a
bit 3,000 bunches and each of the
bunches container about 100 billion
protons they go around the ring and at a
certain point we squeeze them together
so the bunches are actually the diameter
is one cheese goes down to about
one-third that of a human here before we
line them up and I actually hit them in
to end with inside the particle detector
the detector itself is exactly a large
3d camera and it takes all of the traces
of all the particles that come out there
around 600 million collisions a second
the raw data rate from single detector
is around 2 petabytes a second this is
way too much data to handle of course
and if I were the experiments they're
looking for it's actually quite rare as
each bunch crosses 600 billion 600
million collisions per second as each
bunch crosses there's only usually
around about 19 actual head-on
collisions so most of the data we can
throw away we only actually keep a bit
one-in-a-million of these actual
Tracey's the rest of them are actually
discarded very early on using specialist
hardware just for a sense of in sense of
scale this is a photograph of one of the
real detectors this is Atlas down at the
bottom here is a person to give you an
idea of a sense of scale this is one of
the four large experiments in CERN
Atlas was probably one of the most well
known the other three are Alice CMS and
LHC be it was Atlas and CMS
were the two detectors which announced
the discovery of the Higgs boson back in
2012
together the four to the four
experiments produce the raw data rate of
around 10 and a half gigabits a second
which we've got to store and prove
yes in our data center located in the
center of the CERN site on site we've
got around 166 thousand processor cores
and 150 petabytes of disk that's around
sixty thousand individual drives and in
the basement we've got another 240
petabytes of tape operated by tape
robots and we expect the store around 50
petabytes of data every single year one
hundred sixty six thousand prototypes of
course might well sound a lot but it's
nowhere near enough to process the data
that we want and in fact that's why we
created the LHC computing grid a legacy
computing grid this is CERN at the
center here is the Fayette Lea a network
of computers all joined together with
high-speed links there's a central core
which is their what we call the tier 0
site that's Aaron and then I would say
there is a further 11 data center spread
across the planet where we send a copy
of all of the data to them beyond there
there's the tier 2 sites really actual
data processing takes place and in your
data centers located in physics
institutes and universities across the
planet
the LHC computing grid effectively
builds a planetary size supercomputer in
order to do all of this data Bruce I
think there's around 2 million compute
jobs running at any one time on the LHC
computing grid so operates such a device
of course takes a lot of technology this
is a photograph from the inside of the
LHC control room on the wall at the back
here you can see all these six displays
using Tamala to be used to monitor the
operations of the Machine and the
consoles around here are actually used
by the operators to actually drive and
control the machine interestingly Java's
actually played a key role at CERN since
the very beginning and if I most of the
screen you see here are actually running
Java applications but Java has been at
CERN since it's very beginning this
brings back memories
good old Windows 95 and just through
then
windows 95 in the web this is what it
looked back in 1995 and it was our end
of it this time in fact that Saren
started looking at Java Java wasn't
really available in many platforms and
effects the first real platform well he
did anything with Java was good old Suns
hot Java browser as a browser it brought
some kind of interactivity that really
people had never seen before 3d graphics
nearly and and as basically the kind of
had an opportunity there that we thought
we felt was going to drive something
really quite amazing for us soon the
Java becames more Ryabkov days it was
entering applications like Netscape
Navigator good old tumbling jerk here
and that was around about this time that
I started developing the first Java
applications and in fact the first one I
wrote it was actually a single sign-on
application this was at the time when
HTTP was seen by our server guys is a
bit of a risk because it might introduce
too much load on the servers so we had
to actually build the application there
around using insecure connections and so
this was my first GDK 1.0 application
where I was doing encryption algorithms
lots of bit shifting and manipulations
long before the libraries ever existed
to actually do this kind of encryption
yourself and what tool did I use well
visual C++ of course but it was clear
the Microsoft and Sun had different
ambitions for the java language and the
student party company and we switch to
another ide
the well known visual cafe starting off
his beginners there moving on those two
professionals and then also in these
experts were at least as far as the job
the product titles were described after
visual kathy was no longer working on
her windows NT servers we had to switch
the new tool we picked JDeveloper I'm
not seeing it was the best choice I've
ever made but one of the big advantages
of this tool was every time it started
up it reminded me that with productivity
comes choice so we choose clips
and then moved on to ID as well and
these days in fact most of the
developers were using IntelliJ what are
we doing with it well from the group
that I'm responsible for we're running
actually this errands business function
so all of the administration of the
organization is operating on Java our
workflow system and business process the
engineering system is all bit and built
on Java our decision support system data
warehousing all of this based on
pentacle is all based on Java as well
and if I had all the project management
tools that we developed actually
building construction or freights
all these multi-million dollar projects
were actually built using Java
technology as well but beyond that we
actually run the machines using Java as
well this is a screenshot from the from
one of the consoles which is actually
the control panel for the accelerating
cavities superconducting radiofrequency
carry cavities which actually accelerate
the photons within the LHC this is a
beam diagnostic screen made in Java as
well this is actually showing the
profile of a single bunch of protons
within the LHC there's a convention
within the control room
that's the red beam goes clockwise and
the blue beam goes anti-clockwise here
is an end view of a beam again written
as a java application and it's quite
nice because also shows you this is
actually a profile of all of the bunches
in the LHC of all of the protons and
there's not just actually operating
machine as well we also have further
slow controls which actually control all
the very so slow functionality within
the air within the accelerator complex
as well this particular synoptic chart
is actually monitoring the airflow of
all the ventilation system within the
LHC there's around 120 thousand sensors
all over the LHC complex itself all
bringing data to this particular
application around a hundred million
data points a day and the operators
themselves could pose the synoptic
charts themselves from a pallet of
information which is available to them
on the side and as well as that from the
same tool they've got around a thousand
different control channels that they can
use to actually operate the different
pumps and switches and valves and
actually to operate the LHC slow control
system I would say discern the Atlas
collaboration we're using Java 3d to
model and visualise the Atlas detector
along with the particle tracks with
inside it
and further afield again Imperial
College in London together with the Blue
Marble data from NASA actually made it a
visualization tool to visualize the LHC
computing grid and all the jobs which
are actually traveling back and forward
across this worldwide computing grid in
fact it was in 2008 just before the end
of the very last the Java one or freeze
by Sun Microsystems that sarin was
actually very honored to receive the
jukes Choice Award for the use of Java
across all of the different control
systems and all the different areas that
we have Java at CERN one of the things I
did want to highlight an application
which are completely happy vote is the
public outreach application this tool
actually embeds the essence of CERN as
an orphan laboratory you're welcome to
come and see it come and have a look
this tool actually helps has organized
all the 120,000 visitors that we have
coming to the organization every single
year those are in 4200 visits that were
organized just last year alone and you
are welcome to come there are two
permanent exhibitions open all the time
and at the same time if you say no via
the website you can actually sign up for
a tour a guided tour as well and more
importantly they're all free I've only
just scratched the surface of sarin here
of course there's things like the
antimatter factory which are late to
talk about for a second or two this is
quite near the second restaurant and is
the is the largest concentration of
antimatter in the known universe we're
actually creating antimatter in a
regular basis in order to study in more
detail trying to understand why in fact
there's the early universe why matter to
the preference over antimatter we've got
the salty experiment which is creating a
radioactive isotopes for nuclear
medicine the cloud experiment which is
actually using detector technology to
understand how a cosmic rays are
affecting the planet's climate and the
cloud formation and of course we have
the EMS detector which is actually a
particle detector building constructed
at CERN which is no part of the
international space station and it
operated from a control room in CERN
itself as an organisation CERN is a
unique place with world leading
physicists
like Richard Hyneman Steven Hawkings
giving lectures at CERN the world wide
web was first announced there and did I
mentioned earlier in 2012's the Higgs
boson the particle responsible for
giving bodies mass was actually
identified and discovered and ultimately
announced at CERN personally I think the
Higgs boson was very important to me
because for a long time I was pretty
sure that my master was mainly
responsible for drinking too much beer
anything too much pizza but as I
understand that in fact all it is I
interact more strongly with the Higgs
field
I did give this explanation to my wife
but she wasn't quite so convinced sarin
is really a place of extremes enormous
engineering feats Cathedral size
detector structures bill underground to
study the most minut phenomenon
subatomic particles and at the heart of
it it's computing computing is
everywhere at CERN from the data centers
from the control systems from the
accelerator complex themselves there are
there are teams of IT professionals
working at CERN
Seren at its core is infrastructure
providing all the facilities to do
physics there are IT engineers creating
data pushing data around the planet
monitoring the systems developing new
software in fact even most of the
physician of right software admitted lie
which sometimes we wouldn't it's an open
lab please come and see if you might
recognize some of the people in some of
these photographs but these these are
examples of the open day that we had in
CERN where we had people coming to see
actually go down and look at the
accelerator complex you're welcome to
come at any time you should come in
anytime it's free to visit and actually
very interestingly in 2019 the Large
Hadron Collider will be actually shut
down for a major upgrade and during that
time you have the opportunity to
actually physically go down and see the
detector complex yourself go into the
tunnel and actually look at the detector
and see how all operates and so when
coincide was that meteor shut down we're
actually running again two major events
in 2019
first of all we would be very happy to
run another Vox
it's earned it was very successful last
time and I think it would be really nice
to do it all over again that would be in
the spring of 2019 and in then later on
in the autumn there will be a full open
day the last time we did an open day at
CERN we had nearly a hundred thousand
visitors in a single weekend we expected
to have even more this time so you're
very welcome to join us again in 2019
unless you want to course come before
and visit any of the organizers it's the
earlier in this presentation I have just
scratched the surface in fact it may be
a little odd for a British person than a
Jew breaks it to be talking so highly of
a European institution but I think this
is somewhere that all of us can be proud
of there have been discoveries made at
CERN which has literally changed the
lives of probably everyone in this room
and we continue to make more and more
discoveries it truly is a remarkable
place that I think is a highlight and
European technology and European science
and the thing is something where
everyone should be justly proud off so
on that note I relate to thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
