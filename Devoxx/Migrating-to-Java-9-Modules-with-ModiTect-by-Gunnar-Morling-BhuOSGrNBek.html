and welcome to my talk about migrating
to Java 9 modules using multi TechEd
I hope you enjoyed the conference so far
I appreciate it very much did you shop
here during a lunch break there's really
great effort I've worked as a software
engineer at red head and luckily I got
accepted with some other trucks at
devoxx this year so the project I'm
working on mostly these days is DBZ I'm
a tool for change data capturing I'm
doing I'm going to do a session about
this tonight at 5:50 so you are very
hardly invited to that I worked as the
spec lead for being edition 2.0 so we
did a new revision of the bean relation
spec there will be a quickie about that
one tomorrow noon and finally I'm
working on math struct which is a code
generator for beam to beam mappings it's
a side project of mine and there will be
another quickie also tomorrow tomorrow
noon but now enough is the
advertisements let's talk a bit about
Mali Tecton I also should mention it's a
side project of mine it's not a fish
already project so what is it about the
idea is to provide you with some tooling
which helps you with a creating the
module descriptors for the Java 9 module
system and B with helping you with
creating modular runtime images as they
are introduced in Java 9 and so I can I
cannot give you the full introduction to
the Java 9 module system I hope or
assume if you are here you know what it
is about but let's just take a quick
look at this module descriptor and well
does is it defines the module and some
metadata so it defines for instance all
the required modules and we already can
think about maybe we could automate this
to some degree because it kind of
resembles the dependencies which very
likely have expressed for instance in
our maven pom on our cradle build file
so we might try and derive those require
requires clauses from the dependencies
of our build tool and then another part
here is the exports clauses so they
describe the public API of our module so
we'll just see what are the publicly
available types and right now you have
to specify all the packages which are
exposed
one by one you don't have any support
for wild cards or something like that so
again this might be something which we
could do a bit better perhaps and
speaking a bit about this modular
runtime images so I think they are one
of the most interesting additions in
Java 9 and what they let you do is you
can create an image let's say directory
which contains your application your
dependencies and the Java modules the
modules of the JDK which you are using
and this gives you a self-contained
image of your application and its
dependencies and I will show you a bit
how this can be done or created using
multi tact and one important thing to
keep in mind is for creating such a
modular runtime image you cannot use the
automatic modules which you may have
heard about so you only can use
explicitly created modules and in this
at this point in time of course it's a
problem we don't have modules for many
of our dependencies the Mollet Act will
help you build with it and with that let
me go to the Eclipse project I've
created so this is first the first thing
I'm going to show is based on hibernate
validator so this is the reference
implementation for bean validation 2.0
and now we would like to create a module
descriptor for hyvent validator so I
have this project in my eye the ear and
the first thing I can do is I configure
this maybe imply can so there's the MOU
detect maven plugin I get it from maven
central and I call this add module info
goal here and that first of nervous I
can just give the module descriptor in
line in the pom here so this is the same
contents you would otherwise write in
the module - info the Java source file
now you might wonder ok what's the
advantage of doing this here in the pump
and instead of giving it an extra source
file and the reason is the advantages
this also works on Java se8 so you can
keep your built-in Java SE 8 and still
produce a modular jar and this might be
interesting for you if your library also
let's say and you would like to create a
module but for some reason you would
like to keep your build your own built
on Java SE 8 for the time being so this
could could be done
but still it's quite robust for instance
we have all those export clauses here so
let me remove this I have all the
experts here I have all the requires
clauses which essentially kind of match
the dependencies of Hamlet validator
and I have those uses and provides
clauses here which deal with his
services which this Chara uses so let me
remove this and let me show you an
alternative way to do to achieve the
same and here are the ideas that mana
text will create let's call it a
candidate descriptor and then this
configuration is applied to it to refine
and amend this generator descriptor and
I will run you through it but first let
me start to build the course this laptop
isn't super fast so I will just build it
in the background and now let me explain
you a bit what's going on here so first
of all I need module name so of course I
need ed and then those requires clauses
they just are rules which amend the
automatically discovered dependencies so
the tool will go there it will analyze
the classes of your of your your classes
it will find the dependencies you use
based on the dependencies given your pom
file and then those rules will be
applied in order to for instance add
some of those modifiers so in case of
the JBoss dot logging that annotations
dependency I happen to know this is
something which isn't needed at runtime
it's an optional feature so I'm adding
this static modifier here or in the case
of the java dot relation module so
that's the public bean validation api
this also should be exposed to the user
of Tahiry and 12 later modules so it
must be a transitive dependency or yet
transitive dependency so I'm adding the
transitive modifier here and all the
other dependencies which have been
determined automatically they should
just be added as is that's expressed
using this asterisk operator then in
terms of the exported packages again
it's a set of rules which are processed
from top to bottom and all the packages
in this module are processed against
those rules and as soon as one of the
routes matches no further rules will be
processed so this here means the
when a date for internal util logging
package this should be a qualified
expert to the for cables logging module
which we need for some technical reasons
then all packages which have the
internal in their name they should not
be exported so I'm expressing this using
the exclamation mark exclamation mark
operator I'm saying everything which is
in internal it should not be part of the
public API of course and finally all
other packages which match then the star
of asterisk operator they should be part
of the public API and based on that a
module descriptor will be generated for
me we can take a look at it now and
there's this new described module flag
for the jar command so I can take a look
now at the generated or ID module the
build module and its descriptor and well
it's no surprise it resembles the one
which I had been given before explicitly
right but with much less configuration
so I'm just getting all the exported
packages here remember I just had to
specify a bit of configuration for this
and I'm also getting the requires
clauses and so on and with a small
amount of configuration all right so
that's creating descriptors now let me
talk a bit about creating those modular
item images and for that I have an
example I've prepared an example and
this is using undertow which is the web
server in the JBoss application server
wildfly and i would like to create a
modular runtime image which contains
undertow and which just produces a hello
world and for it I'm having here this
simple main class just launched this the
undertow server and it just returns an
HTTP or a Creole parameter back to the
caller that's it and let's see how we
can create a modular image with that and
again I'm using the Mota tech maven
plug-in here and what I'm doing now is I
need to add the script worse for all the
dependencies so remember at this point
neither undertone nor any of its
dependencies have the explicit module
descriptor but I would need them or I
need them for this to be used in a
modular runtime image so we have to edit
and I'm doing this using again this
maven plug-in here and now I specify all
those dependencies which I would like to
add
I give some configuration for module
descriptor here so let's say this
logging module is have it should have
optional static dependencies to the
actually logging bagans because we don't
want to have all of them in there or
let's go to the undertow module here I
just define a module name and otherwise
I'm fine
and then there's this other goal called
create runtime image and this is used to
produce the actual image and this one
will add all those modules which we have
been creating it will create a launcher
which we will see in a bit and then
there are some options for compression
stripping debugging symbols and so on so
let me run this and so what to take what
it does now is it takes all those
dependencies which I had configured
their copies them to a staging directory
adds the module descriptors based on the
configuration we have given in the pom
file and then it produces the move your
runtime image from that so it's using
this compression flag so that that's why
it's taking a bit longer but it should
be there so first of all let me let me
run it so there's a modular runtime
image can have a launcher which is
actually it's just a simple shell comma
a shell script or batch script I can run
it and let me go here and let me just
call it so you see it's actually doing
something so it just returns
hello dev ox because I use dev access to
clear parameters apparently undertow is
working that's cool let me stop it let's
take a look at the size of this and so
this has been created the image has been
created under target J link image and
it's just 29 megabytes so that's not so
bad I would say for including undertow
all its dependencies and all the JDK
modules we need and let's take a look
what's in the module and for this there
is this list modules option there now
and I see all the images sorry all the
modules which are contained in this
image and this is kind of what I would
expect so there's my chrome example
that's my own module there's an auto
some Java modules and our dependencies
one thing strikes out if you look close
in this is Java dot sequa so you might
wonder hey why's there Java sequence a
web service or
webserver of why do we have secret in
there and the reason being is this I
took a look at unattended sources and I
figured okay there's a specific hemlock
appender which uses JDBC to amid log
files so there is they have this
undertow logger interface here and this
has a dependency to zzzquil exception
and this explains why the Java
top-secret module is pulled in here but
if I don't use the stray busy lock
appender well then I just don't need
this module right so what I can do is so
I send a pull request to undertow and to
get rid of this or to make it truly
optional and I can change to that
version now so I have a locally patched
version with this change here and I can
now amend the module descriptor for the
for the undertow module a bit so I'm
hearing I'm here I'm now saying okay
please add the static modifier to the
Java sequel dependence of this undertow
module and now if I run it again the
resulting image should be a bit smaller
and I'm making this point just to
explain a bit as how we're with some
small code changes we actually can even
improve the size of this stuff so let's
take a look now and I'm sorry and now
it's just 25 megabytes instead of 29
right and so this is I think really a
good thing for having in mind it's a
full-blown web server and all the Java
modules in there that's it in terms of a
demo so what is it about multitec is a 2
which aids you with defining module
descriptors and runtime images as you
have seen and the idea is really not to
fully generate a descriptor because this
doesn't make sense we cannot know which
should be a public API but instead it
just helps you is automating some of
these steps right so we can analyze the
dependencies we can help you with those
patterns for exports and make this a bit
easier and if for you for instance add
now a new public package well this will
automatically when you
we build the stuff it will add this to
the generator descriptor right otherwise
it might be quite easy for you to form
get to edit this new public packet some
things I would like to add
there could be support for
cross-platform build so currently a such
a runtime image it will be specific to
the platform which you have been using
to build to create this module there is
some sort of cross-platform support in
the Jhelum tool but this could be made
more easy for you to abuse and finally
there could be an idea for what could be
called hollow runtime images being
meaning we could create a runtime image
which just contains your dependencies
and the JDK modules but not your actual
application itself the reason being this
stuff changes much less frequently so
you would have a rather stable image
which you don't have to rebuild very
often and then you just would add on top
of this your explicit module with your
application this for instance might be
very nice if you think about docker
containers and they're layered file
systems and with that I'm done there are
some resources so it's on all on github
it's all open source if you would like
to contribute I would be very happy and
there's one minute left for questions
thank you any questions if not then I
would say thank you for being here and
enjoy the rest of the conference
thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
