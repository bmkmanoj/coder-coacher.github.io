my name is Helen Biel I'm here from
range of all I'm a DevOps ologist I made
up my own job title which means I study
DevOps I would it do all day long
quick question for a star who is in the
last session about the Phoenix project
story a few of you good there's a little
bit of crossover so I'll try not to make
it too repetitive I was just out the
back listening to Brides it's very very
interesting but I'm going to talk to you
about the develop super patent so few
more questions we start I'm going to
seem the most viewed developers since
this is a developer conference anyone
here from ops and I love computers you
then someone not very sure anyone got
DevOps in their job title couple of you
anyone working in a DevOps team
excellent so bit of a mix ok so I'm
sorry about this slide I just literally
just noticed right now they've got a bit
mashed up on it's kind of translation to
this format so the funny little bit for
years that I've got bit moved around so
um some of you may be familiar with this
and you just heard some of these names
and the people that were in the last
presentation you heard some of these
names I would think it's quite fun to
talk about where DevOps come from so
it's quite a big buzzword these days and
often people don't know about its
provenance and so this guy here Belgian
guy Patrick Tabar really is the the
person responsible for this whole thing
and he went to a conference in Toronto
this guy Andrew Schaefer had put a talk
in or a session he wanted to talk about
agile system administration and though
he turned up
apart from Patrick even Andrew didn't
turn up because he thought it's going to
be really unpopular they really started
Patrick thinking and he was like I
really think there's a problem here and
that needs to be resolved so he started
chatting to people about it online and
everyone was very encouraging I mean
eventually Patrick got round to kind of
committing to setting up a conference
about it and that was called DevOps days
and who's been to a devil stays in the
audience they run worldwide close no one
devil static a surprisingly the run
worldwide now we've had several in
London and the anniversary of gain climb
happened last year so five years ago and
this whole DevOps thing started as
Patrick started a Twitter hashtag on
double stays so it kind of came from
things happen after that
many of you probably have heard about
the flicker thing that happened at
velocity where a guy from Devon a guy
threw up stood up on stage and talked
about how they were doing ten
deployments day people like wow oh it's
like really big news back then of course
people are Amazon are doing like one
every 12 seconds and stuff now but that
was big news then time and on you'll see
some technologies popping through you
will come back and talk to us about
technologies probably in a bit you'll
see the big analysts say Gartner and
Forrester getting involved in some of
the really big vendors having a go at
this basis now so the IBM's and CAS I'm
also kind of putting DevOps offerings
out there and in the previous session we
were very much talking up Singh's
project book who has read the Phoenix
project quite a few of you great I mean
if anyone wants to know about DevOps
that's really where we recommend you
start it is really easy read as the
other chap said because it's written
like a novel so you're in a story these
characters it's really engaging that was
written by Jean Kim and George Stafford
and Kevin bear last year in October Jean
also produced a DevOps handbook written
by Patrick the guy responsible for the
whole movement and a couple of other
guys Jeff and John that will talk about
quite a lot more in a few minutes
particularly John arranged for one of
the challenges we've had in our six
years of helping people do develop stuff
is helping people make cultural change
we're all technologists so actually
doing things like building a tool chain
might be quite challenging but it's not
as hard for our self-tanners making a
movement or moving the needle in culture
understanding what our behaviors look
like what our habits look like the
things that are ingrained into the
organizations that we work with another
really common use case that we've seen
is and I've actually started almost
thinking that DevOps should be called
this IT because actually I'm seeing more
and more conflict between the business
and IT particular and people are trying
to move along an agile transformation
and the business people are really not
getting involved not committing to
full-time product owners things like
that so they're seeing lots of people
doing stuff like having product owners
by proxy which actually bas which is an
ideal quite a colony's case anyway we
were seeing lots of this and so we took
the Phoenix project and with our Dutch
partner Gaming works who have many many
years experience writing this
simulations we translated the Phoenix
project into a game so twelve of you can
come into a room and you'll each play a
roll out of the game
outside out book so you could be Sara
how to retell operations you could be
John the CISO you could be Bill the
game's leader plays the CIO role and the
game runs very like the book so it
starts with the press release talking
about parts Unlimited
I'm talking about the revenue goals and
the share prices and then we run four
rounds and it's a card based simulations
so that people in the room has to figure
out what projects they're doing and what
cards and features and actions and
things need to be put on the work tables
and then at the end of each of the four
rounds we gather up the cards and we
score the team based on the revenue and
share price goals that we'd set at the
start so it's really fun really
interactive a great way of trying to
break down that biz ID barrier so I
heard Brad use a term I use a lot as
well probably would talk about quite a
lot DevOps has really decide like a firm
definition when we're really pushed to
say something we'll say it's about
making better sell for faster and more
safely I do really like this definition
though this is a March thoughts is also
published this book is also published by
the same press IT revolution that
publishes Phoenix project and the
devil's hand books basically Jean Kim's
press it's anyone going to the DevOps
Enterprise summit in the start of June
no okay it's genes event
mark will be speaking there he just
spoke at secon a few weeks ago so I
really like this definition for Mark's
book about business value because it
talks about a value delivery Factory and
that's what we're really trying to
create in IT these days it's like we're
no longer the people that are running an
MRP system and a bit of email in the
dungeon digitization means that we
should be leading every organization
that we work with I see doesn't it no
longer aligns with the business it
doesn't integrate with the business IT
should be the business one of our very
good customers Hiscox and we're very
close to difficult so quite famous in
don't was world and again they'll be
speaking it does their CEO sit up and
said we are no longer in insurance
business we are a technology company and
that's where most organizations we work
with are trying to get to they realize
how much the world we live in is driven
by the internet IOT smart devices all of
these things
I'm solutions a minute ago about DevOps
in its this kind of resist
to definition so you're all developers
I'm sure you're all very familiar with
the agile manifesto which we'll talk
about in a minute obviously very public
document we can all refer to any of
those week and see what we're doing when
we do agile nothing exists in the same
way for DevOps and it's the people that
kind of invented it and the global
market is kind of agreed not to try and
pin it down in that way so what I'm
trying to say in this slide is this kind
of this balance because we're kind of
letting DevOps free to become what it
needs to be and not pinning it down on
the other hand if you're trying to have
a sensible conversation with your
colleague or someone that's got some
budget about what you're doing when
you're doing DevOps and what that means
and why it's important and why it's
going to be a benefit to the business we
do kind of need some stakes in the
ground we do kind of need to make some
statements about what it actually is
that we're doing and why we're doing it
this is quite a useful I call it in
elevator acronyms so John Willis and the
John I mentioned is one of the
co-authors of the DevOps handbook
originated this acronym quite a few
years ago now and I'm going to come
across it before
Kam's so one hand at the back just
really useful someone going what is this
DevOps thing all about you think this
can it's the cultural to nation
measurement sharing so if you may have
crossed come across comms as well and
you'll see why in a minute I've left out
the L and I'll explain a little bit more
about that so that's kind of where we
were and I was out in in Munich in
December at DevOps con and I've seen the
presentation I did quite a few times
last year in apologist we've lost a
little bit of the word here again in the
reformatting as I've moved the slide but
that word there says Salah Chrissy has
anybody in the audience come across
Halak recei to date a couple of you so
basically an agile organizational
management system last year did quite a
few presentations on the correlations
between holacracy and DevOps for started
at the devil's Enterprise summary last
June with another of our customers leggo
came over from Denmark to help me with
it and we talked about things like
self-organizing teams distributing
Authority getting feedback loops or in
holography speak surfacing tensions and
these things like continuous funding all
these things that holacracy likes and
oops aims for as well so I was out at
Def Con doing this presentation I'm also
quite well-known for a phrase that I
stolen of a great friend of mine Jane
Gro who runs the ITSM Academy and the
DevOps Institute in the United States
called the harmonious polygamous
marriage that is DevOps and the people
are in that harmonious polygamous
marriage our agile ITSM and lean so
we've been talking about these kind of
four things for quite a while and John
Willis and the guy responsible for cams
came up to me and said you've been
talking about these things and how they
are all these kind of methodologies that
are evolving and converging and making
the thing that is DevOps you know you'll
find people that develops its agile on
steroids you know it's this it's that he
said I've got this thing I've been
talking about I calling it three-legged
stool and the three-legged stool for
John is the learning organization the
safety culture and the Theory of
Constraints
so we had this conversation and now I
find myself here today this is probably
the fourth or fifth time I've talked on
this subject so far this years is
emerging super patent so this idea that
these many strands are building if you
like the handbook and the best practices
and philosophies are underpinning what
we do where we do devil's and so a lot
of the things like I don't mention on
this slide we might not be able to see
it that clearly but there is a watermark
on it the watermarks actually some of
our two pound coins it's not all of our
two pound coins so you might want have
one in your pocket or any wallet
some of them say standing on the
shoulders of giants around them this was
originally came from the Greek when a
guy put a servant on his shoulders he
could see further and then it was it was
used by Newton and then but most
famously used by Oasis as a as their
album name he doesn't own if you
remember that you want to be old enough
there is a story behind that because
apparently no was quite drunk when he
came up with the name so if you take a
closer look at birth album cover you'll
see it's actually standing on the
shoulder of giants which of course is a
little bit grammatically incorrect
because that should be shoulders
anyway I digress let's talk a bit more
about agile and I expect I know all the
answers going to be to this one who in
the room
practice agile
nearly everyone I thought he was going
to be absolutely everyone but nearly
everyone I'm feel familiar with this the
agile manifesto lots of organizations
did things in waterful manner for very
long time lots of organizations still do
it's very painful for a lot of people as
you know there's lots of problems that
you'll be aware of customers ask for
things you give it to the month later
they've changed their mind or you didn't
fully understand what it was in the
first place because they hadn't
communicated it very well or you hadn't
collaborated very well on it things
happen like testing phases are enormous
and always get squashed because
everything else is over running it's
very painful doing mortal so there's
lots of reasons that people want to do
our jar we don't meet all that many
people that are doing it that well
still there's lots of improvements to be
made
it's definitely sort of things like
we've got scrum very much leading the
market under weather people who have
ever tried things like the SDM and some
of the earlier versions of it but scrum
doesn't suit everyone in its standard
format anyway so we've spent quite a lot
of time with people working on how to
just adjust things you know when
Sprint's can start when it's going to
end do you need a review do you need a
respect retrospective as well can you
afford full-time scrum masters can you
spread them across different teams all
of these questions that we have to
answer them we're trying to manage agile
in our own unique environments and so
this gave me the idea of putting the
super pattern into matrix I love nature
matrices if you ever get the pleasure of
working with me you'll find that I've
got tons of them and we do a lot of
assessments with people I find them
really useful to kind of visualize where
people are and what to do to move up
scales everyone has different like
unique places that they are in a matrix
and sometimes it's really confusing
because someone's like oh I'm a bit at
level one and also a bit at level three
so they do need to be moderated and
customized but they at least give us a
starting point so here I have my comms
matrix for agile so things I think agile
has a very developed see from a cultural
perspective are this idea of making
everything customer centric so I mean
DevOps quite while we talked about kind
of outside in so really looking for
the customers perspective and that's
what we try and do all the time when we
talk about what a devops culture looks
like we want things at a very high trust
very low friction again agile is all
about creating that sort of environment
again this idea of motivating
individuals so kind of like the thought
of IT people sometimes is a bit bit of a
conglomerate mass and you know we'll
have incidents and we'll have war rooms
and we'll have post mortems and these
are some of my least favorite word's in
iti think they're all really unhealthy
and the Semyon movement is linked to
DevOps some people refer to it as human
ops or hug ops anyone come across those
terms but anyway a movement to kind of
reclaim us as individuals and say
actually we don't have to have a crappy
time at work we should not have to have
release weekend so we all have to sit by
and wait for everything to go wrong and
we should be able to do things like
release like breathing so it should be
something we do so frequently and it's
so low risk that it just happens we
don't have to do it every month or two
two great scare for everybody so that's
really where we're trying to get to and
this idea of behavior it being adjusted
as an output of reflection this is very
much about feedback loops and we talked
about three ways and second one in
particular in a few minutes I'm the
first principle the agile manifesto
central you know is the continuous
delivery of value now this doesn't just
necessarily mean from an automation
perspective that is how most people that
I work with interpret it there is a
process element to this as well but
again it's that value focus that we
really like we're really into
measurement in DevOps as you saw and we
do this quite well in our jar if you're
doing things like sprint planned and
everybody doing sprint burned ants
not everyone's put their hands up ya
know everyone does it and it's a really
important way of us helping avoid having
the business tell us things I adore
means missed deadlines we need to help
them understand the cadence and
velocities that we're working out on
what we're delivering and then sharing
so this is a really important part this
is what everything we do in our Jolla is
about is about collaborating effectively
there's actually the statement about
preferring face-to-face interaction
that's very important as well
and this idea of the team reflecting
together so again that's another
feedback loop another part the second
way so I particularly like this agile
principle it kind of crosses over into
lean actually so lean lean would go into
it a bit more detail but lean is all
about removing waste so it's making a
thing as simple as possible
I mentioned Hiscox already but just a
little note on them their main devops
project that they've won several awards
for was called The DaVinci project and
they called it the DaVinci project
because da Vinci said that simplicity is
the ultimate sophistication so this idea
of removing all this noise and all this
waste of stuff that really so it's
looking a little bit more about look see
I gave you a couple of clues about that
the minute there is some on this slide
pack there is a link to bloggers wrote
last year on it again this reflecting
back to the talk I did with Lego so just
to kind of summarize what I was saying a
minute ago this is an agile
organizational management system and
what it's trying to do is distribute
authority so anyone read the state of
DevOps reports from puppet in here okay
so they're really good resource as well
and there's the survey for this year's
is live at the moment so it should be
out in a couple of months nearly all of
them refer to something called the
westrom model of organizational maturity
everybody come across that Westerns
organizational model so kind of talks
about moving from sort of command and
control in organization structures to
behave to bureaucratic structures to
what they call generative so basically
trying to give people more autonomy so
if we go back to that thing I was saying
about human ops and hug ops and how to
make people happy at work there's a
really good TED talk by a guy called Dan
pink and it's about how to motivate
people at work and particularly people
that work in the kind of industry that
we do so it's very high knowledge and
the work that we deliver is very complex
you know we're not just folding boxes
and we're doing very long-term
and complex projects and actually just
giving us cash rewards or external or
extrinsic rewards like that isn't very
effective
laughs what's really effective is to
create environments where we feel
autonomy mastery and purpose and that
gives us lots of Incirlik rewards which
make us very happy and make us very
productive and make us want to stay and
actually staying in the same job is very
important because one of the big costs
for organizations is the turnover of
staff having to replace staff having the
onboard staff all the disruption that
goes with that so your employees will be
will be happy if you're happy
does get us into an interesting
conversation financially with people so
if we try and say to people if you do
DevOps you're going to make your people
happy 10% happier which means they're
going to be 5% more productive and then
that means X million on your bottom line
and that kind of conversation doesn't
really work but we'll talk more about
the kind of benefit statements people
are looking for ran DevOps later and so
yeah we've got this idea of giving
people autonomy and what we're basically
saying those we're giving kind of people
more authority to do their job
my favorite example of this which isn't
actually a tech example is actually
water stones so water stones were nearly
bust when they were part of HMV they got
bought by a Russian billionaire who
fortunately thought books or a bit
cooler than football clubs so that was
good and then he gave CEO role to a guy
called James don't
and giant James dawn runs a number of
book shops in London anybody been to
them yeah he basically graduated from
Cambridge or Oxford or somewhere and was
going to be like a financial trader and
his wife told him that it wasn't she
wasn't that keen on the idea she opened
a book shop instead and it was quite a
unique proposition that he had she made
it more by geography so you'd go in and
there'd be like an Australian section
that'd be Australian cookbooks and
travel books and novels of Australians
and poetry of Australians and it's been
quite a popular little bookstore I think
mostella 15 in London but the stock
market was a bit stirred when the
Russian billionaire decided to give
James the CEO role of waterstones but
he's been incredibly successful and
really the key to his success was that
he stopped telling all of the stores
what to put on the shelves and what to
put in Windows which was a very great
thing to do as well because quite a bit
as the waterstones income was from
charging publishers premium prices to
have those spaces but their books on
what he did does he told the people in
the store
he wanted them to get to know the local
market and accordingly stocked shelves
and sell directly to them on
recommendation and on the conversations
they were having so became these
fantastic sensors or this amazing
feedback loop so that's really the kind
of thing that hallux is trying to do so
it's trying to get us in your case for
developers much closer to that feedback
loop with your customers I know from the
developers I talked to that you're
really proud of the work that you do and
you really want to know that it's well
received and you would really like to be
back and to make improvements and really
in DevOps we're trying to get there so
if you hear things and people are
talking about DevOps say ridiculous
things like oh just give the develop as
a pager a you can last 17 pages for many
decades and be that's really not what
this is about it's not about punishing
developers to throwing code over the
water ops and expecting them support it
it's about getting ops more involved in
the process earlier and having some
inputs into your product backlog and
having some conversations with you about
when you might want to release something
and what that's going to look like and
the kind of gates you need to go through
I degress slightly automation the guys
that actually came up with look fear or
ledger at all a July practitioners
themselves from a software development
perspective so there are a lot of
similarities and they've used things
like github quite extensively in the way
that they deliver Hurlock Rafi as well
and they have a specific tool called
glass frog it's called glass frog
because the idea of lock receives
instead of having that hierarchy that
classic hierarchy when you go into glass
frog in you try and represent your
organization it actually looks like an
organism with organs and cells it's a
very cellular kind of circle
representation so you don't get without
person's higher than that person that
one's more superior than that person you
get but there are a lot of in
dependencies across the whole
organization so yes this idea of
measurement everyone's a sensor couple
things I really love that locally as
well it doesn't do any sales targets it
doesn't have any budget so has this idea
of continuous funding and continuous
fundings of really keeping in the agile
space and most organizations still
budget annually
there's a 12-month cycle ways from two
or three months sitting down and telling
people what you think you might want to
spend in the next 12 months does that
make any sense when we're trying to
deliver things into experience doesn't
to me so last year when I was does a guy
called John smart from Barclays was
talking and he said he made a statement
on stage summit like I've gone from five
percent fifty percent of my strategic
change projects to agile in the last
year and I said that's brilliant how are
you funding them he said uh we've moved
to a roll in quarterly waves of funding
so he'd taken that first steps instead
of doing an EI Castillo setting a budget
in October it could be spent like the
following February I mean the year
following Fabrice so 14 months later so
if we're talking about changing
requirements things do change it's far
too long a time anyone doing continuous
funding in the room rolling quarterly
wave f1 rolling quarters way of everyone
else on annual funding still yeah a few
nods it's painful and then lots of it
you know share sharing and her locks
here again to snatch your bed photos
everything about Loxley is about doing
peer review everyone in the room have at
least one change approval board that
they need to go through to get a change
yeah anyone have no cabs all peer review
that's quite a high count in this room
you're lucky guys because we only have
one of our customers that can do which
is Lego but that shows that you have
very high trust built into organization
so great work so this cut this and I
first learned about Hoxie I read a book
called reinventing organizations by
Frederick Lally and that's what's like
me on my holography part and this comes
from the book so change becomes no
longer a relevant topic because it's
just something that's always happening
so it's not like are we going to make a
change just that everyone knows the
change that's changing that's change is
this normal it's like breathing like I
said earlier making a release process
like breathing
itís an probably not a favorite topic
because most people in the room any ITIL
practitioners here because she cover
everything don't you yeah
oh so ITIL got yourself a really bad
name wasn't really little it was partly
at school but they had this bright idea
of writing this really comprehensive
book of telling you like every way you
could do everything and everyone kind of
took the book went right let's do it
that way and it was not meant to be much
more customized than that but it became
very unpopular and Isis M kind of
replaced there I feel also got bought by
AXA lost the part capped it's all quite
complicated but but generally what we're
trying to do when we do ITSM is the more
safely part so we're trying to put some
governance around and process around the
ways that we do things like incident
management problem management asset
management change management all the
management's that operations need to do
so the people have expectations and and
they know what to do and also if your
onboarding new staff for example you
want them to be able to figure out quite
quickly what to do if something happens
but we're really doing away with ITSM
and these days and we're talking about
something called ASM so ASM is agile
service management so what we've been
doing is we've been taking the IT
operations teams in the companies that
we work with and teaching them basically
scrum basically how to design ITIL ITSM
process is using sprint methodologies so
making that change happen a lot more
quickly making it more frequent as well
and this has gone down quite well we're
still working out with organizations
where the model shifts completely
because another thing you can do which I
kind of referred to earlier is you can
embed ops into your product team so into
agile teams I did a piece of work very
early on it ranged for what I was trying
to understand if there was sort of a
standardised ratio between Devon ops in
organizations and it turns out that just
isn't it gets really complicated because
some people outsource development some
people outsource ops some people
outsource testing there's just a huge
variation but it makes it difficult for
us to mate like a standard
recommendations people like who the best
way to do DevOps is to put an ops person
every agile team because that people
just doesn't work like the Maps doesn't
works a lot of organizations we have to
find clever ways of doing it and this is
one this is one by teaching the ops
people how you're working when you're
doing agile and how
line up how to use a product backlog you
know here can start contributing to your
product backlogs potentially as well
with their NF ours you know it's a big
moments we hear a lot oh they don't I'll
never get mine far then you know the
other big one oh god they expect Lee
still release and I haven't heard
anything about it well if they're
involved in the Sprint they'll know
that's coming through and they'll
probably understand the need for doing
things like clouds or automated
environment provisioning or automate
deployment in a way that you can have a
more of a handle on it and Link it to
your continuous delivery pipeline and
more ambassador waves so yeah this is a
we have course in fact we have two
courses and for this one is the agile
service manager which is the ops
equivalent the scrum master and the
other is agile process owner which is
the operational equivalent of product
owner and this is from the course you
know if your requirements changing then
your support capabilities need to be
changing fast as well so culturally and
what we're trying to do is get this just
enough governance so you know about just
enough this time we're trying to get
just enough governance so we're trying
to rip out processes that have got
really heavy and bureaucratic and are
really annoying for everybody and make
of thing light-touch whilst protecting
you if you're in a highly regulated
industry so I just take an example we
work with them a smaller company that we
work with called bond according ham who
are actually actuaries has struggled to
say this actuarial accountants basically
do pensions what to kids say and they
introduced something called a release
checklist and it was introduced to help
with their ISO and help with their
regulation only problem was it created a
massive bottleneck and we've kind of
realized it was actually a bit more of a
symptom rather than a disease itself and
the disease that was showing us was
actually that ops were integrating that
well into dev they weren't controlling
their product backlog they weren't doing
things like the definition is done very
effectively they weren't finding user
stories very well they weren't doing
sprint reducer weren't in streamers
retrospectives know lots of things that
were contributing and to the fact that
they felt that they needed this very
clunky release checklist now they're
bringing everyone together I'm in a room
which we did a couple of weeks ago in a
workshop we actually made some
really good headway to tackling those
underlying parts that needed to change
in order to remove that thing automation
loads of service desk tools out there
some more popular than others to anyone
use snow or service now in the audience
remedy JIRA Service Desk yes look not a
lot of hands going on so I'm suspecting
that some of you may not know that much
about the services tools are being used
I heard Brad I think mention JIRA or
Atlassian at least earlier on Alaskan
have three JIRA products JIRA software
JIRA core and JIRA Service Desk through
service tests with a relatively new
edition family to recognize that lots
and lots of people were using JIRA to
manage their services they may as well
provide a platform specifically built
with that it's really really powerful
because you can get something on your
support desk and send it straight into
your it has a same ticket number as it
goes into your developer JIRA so you get
a full loop you get full visibility and
it really helps the communications
between the support desk and developers
you know that thing I said the stupid
thing about Luke is the developer so
pager that's how it should look that you
know support of getting the call and
having a conversation that's traceable
with the developers about it
I'm wheel of s fillets and when we're
doing service management so you know how
long we going to respond by how long we
need a fix it by never going to
guarantee that right but all of those
kind of things and then ASM really does
differ from ITSM and ITIL because what
we're trying to do is promote that
cross-pollination between your two teams
so we're trying to train the IT ops
people to learn the language that you're
using when you do agile every day so you
have a common vocabulary so talk about
lean for a minute touched on the DevOps
handbook earlier on we were really
pleased when this came out because we've
been using this lean tool called value
stream mapping for quite a while to help
people on the DevOps journey so normally
when people come to us and say we want
to do DevOps but we're not sure how how
do we start we'll say we'll start with
an assessment because we love metrics so
we need to baseline your current state
and from that we can start to articulate
your future state and from that we can
develop a roadmap which will give you
the key constraints or key things you
need to tackle
to move forward and move up the maturity
layers of some of my favorite matrices
so we're very delighted when Delta
Sandberg came out and it had a lot of
focus on valley streams as anyone in the
room done value stream mapping one I
think so I'm going to come we're not
going to come under this I'll cover it
here and all of the lean stuff came out
of Toyota I'm Sabine Explorer jet book
was written not as a sequel but kind of
a rewrite of a bit by a guy called le
jar Goldratt who wrote a book called the
goal this is all linked to what we learn
at Toyota about lean manufacturing and
just in time and all of these kind of
things value stream mapping is different
from process mapping people get them
quite confused sometimes though stream
mapping is like a very high-level
looking at the past it takes from one of
your products or services from the
moment of conception all the way through
to the customer receipt of it whereas
the process has lots of little processes
so when we do value stream mapping what
we're really looking at is the handoffs
between processes so if I give you an
example of one we did at MasterCard so
MasterCard were and part of their
payments unit were ring fencing one of
the banks so as you probably know as a
result of the credit crunch all the
banks had to ring-fence their investment
and retail banks had to separate them as
part of the basically to protect us if
there was another one and then and all
of the money was tied up in trading I
meant that your money would be safe and
we value stream maps this thing for them
and it involves getting a load of people
in a room that don't often get in a room
together and probably never thought
about the end-to-end thing and spending
a couple of days looking at the current
state in a couple of days on the future
state and we looked this thing we
discovered it at taking them 364 days to
deliver this project and when we look to
it more and we realize that there were
eight calves involved at the front end
and there was no automated environment
positioning and that they tried to
deliver the main bit of software in it
on a very waterful manner manner when we
ripped it apart and took out those
things we got that down to 89 days
sounds quite sound astounding 364 to 89
but in fact when we look at waste and
processing in this way that
not an unusual proportional saving I'm
sorry love lean and when you read the
Phoenix project you'll probably remember
the bit when bill gets everyone in a
room and they put all the post-its up on
the walls
that's quite reflective of Kanban which
you use in Kanban in the room quite
about third 1/2 of you yeah so you know
there's loads of long conversations we
can have about Kanban and scrum boards
and wit limits and all of these things
that kind of differentiate and work for
different people and not for other
people but one of the things bill was
doing when he got everyone in that room
he was trying to understand the amount
of technical debt that the organization
had and the amount of rework that was
going on in the organization as anyone
in the room work for an organization
where you actually record the amount of
rework that you're working on or
unplanned work now it's quite rare but
it's a really won one over there it's a
really powerful metric and particularly
if you feel that you're in environment
where you do have a lot of technical
debt which is stopping you deliver the
innovation because you'll need a reason
to throttle the change a little bit to
give yourself a chance to tackle the
technical debt the other thing that
people find it really hard to justify to
this people is building some automation
so we can't take two weeks out to build
a pepper to write an automated test so I
just need you to be testing you're like
yeah but once I've written that
automated test it's going to take that
test 10 minutes to run instead of 4
hours but it's quite hard sometimes to
have those conversations leans all about
all of that kind of stuff so again we've
got this huge focus on the customer with
lean which is very much what DevOps is
all about automation as I just said we
want to get rid of errors we want to get
rid of duplication want to get rid of
rework and things like automated
employee more people who look using lots
of scripts or we work with lots of very
large organizations where they have very
large outsource teams to their size and
they do things like give the SI 140 page
manual on how to install wires or
Worth's application server which goes
from nearly every time as that person
leaves through the pages so these kind
of manual errors for things that we're
really trying to get rid of when we go
lean from
Automation spective I mention Kanban
there again we mentioned Swinburne down
already anything like that that can help
us measure velocity to help us expose
the waste and measure improvements
pretty useful really big thing in DevOps
is about celebrating success as well as
another reason why the measurements are
really important to us because how do we
know if we're doing well and as we've
got a goal that we can measure against
that's a bit of a worry I think I might
just press the wrong button
whew so it's a little more on the
metrics so I mentioned rework a couple
of times then one of the big things that
we use when we're doing very simple
thing is this concepts a percentage
complete and accurate so one of the
things we work on when we do value
stream map is trying to understand as
the work goes downstream whether it's
received by the next manufacturing unit
if you like the next person in the
delivery chain how much grit is right
and then the other things that we're
really using is about kind of elapsed
time I'm an actual working time there's
kind of three key metrics that we use
that allow us to uncover this waste
so--but by the learning organization yes
chat Peaks ends quite quite famous in
this space and you're reading that I'm
sure I was read that and feel just a
little bit nausea so I feel like it's a
bit a bit too utopic and considering I
spent the vast majority of my time
helping people identify future states
and ways to get to them I still feel
that this one is like way off for a lot
of people who work with I'm everyone
familiar with Google twenty percent in
the room so few hands up and the idea is
that you should get 20% of your time
spend on learning basically so you could
call it every Friday whatever is most
organizations that we work with don't
have that luxury most of them are a too
busy firefighting technical debt be too
busy trying to get all the innovations
really the business is asking for and
see might be thinking about trying to do
some extra learning but just not
managing to get it in around those other
things but this is what we should be
aiming for versus a smokes if it's a
little bit utopic for my tastes
so most immense people's product quite a
lot I mentioned the three ways this is
how we present or represent the three
ways so first one is about flow so very
much a lean thing certain a natural
thing second ways about feedback loops
it's very much about kind of measurement
and getting responses from the customer
so in agile that's about you know doing
your your showcasing and your demos on
your sprint reviews getting was about
early feedback and then the last one is
about experimentation and learning
that's the most difficult one for people
to get to so again to put learning
organization into this matrix a learning
organization is trying to do this again
so we've seen this already with lucre
see I'm and with that jar this idea of
decentralizing the role of leadership so
really trying to give power that's the
people if you like that's not to 2zf
raise but I'm certainly in IT
organizations we have a very high
proportion of talent and in quite a few
organizations we see a lot of that
talent wasted as people don't properly
harness it because they try and tell
everybody what to do rather than
allowing people to bring some of their
own creativity party and then we've got
an idea of cultural debt with learning
organizations as well say every day that
we don't learn we're building cultural
debt into our organization basically
because we're putting ourselves behind a
competition that are probably getting
better so every time that we firefight
we're costing ourselves more money just
than the time of fire fighting with
costing ourselves our future in terms of
getting better so it's really important
to try and get to a place where we can
have learning as part of what we do on a
daily basis
I left measurement blanks like she
couldn't find much so I'm always looking
for feedback and always trying to
continually improve myself so if anybody
thinks all that should go in there
please do let me know or any other
feedbacks very welcome as well and then
the sharing thing I like this idea of
exposing personal mental patterns I
think I think something we're not very
good at doing an IT it sounds a bit
foreign to me but I'm just sound like
quite good idea kind of helping us
understand the way that our brains work
and and the way that we can share ideas
from that and moving on to the safety
culture so this is the newest one this
is relatively new this is too noble in
case none of you can recognize this in
the
thing that really caused us to become a
kind of phrase that people use and a
thing that people are trying to document
and in structure and you see things like
this this isn't one of my favorite
material models is too simple it's not
matrix you see things like this you know
people are trying to understand what
does it means to come safer so for most
organizations we work within IT that
means particularly things like gtp our
GDP are coming along as anything easy
caught the the malware thing that
happens at Debenhams a week or so ago
and they lost thirty six thousand
customer details over six weeks I think
the malware the running so if that had
happened next year when gdpr had come in
I think we worked out the other day I've
got a very clear sunlight works at
Akamai who specialized in security it's
going to cost some sort like half a
billion or so million in fines because
of the things that went on so you know
there's a huge amount of regulatory risk
huge amount fine risks around privacy
data and that sort of thing and so so we
want things to be safe we've got all
this cyber security stuff so yesterday
was in Belfast I was talking at most
conference about what is a dev circuits
engineer and a lot of times you're
chatting about security for a couple of
days and the scary thing for people to
do to us and the fact we're being
attacked all the time what can we do
about it and this is really where we
have to be so you remember the third way
we were talking about which was about
experimentation and learning we talked
to people a lot about failure and when
we do our assessments one of the
questions about two of the questions we
asked is we asked one how'd you feel
about failure and the other one that we
asked is do you feel like you're
constantly dancing around the edge of
failure and people are quite mixed on
those questions failure is often seen as
a bad thing Tiki if you work in a
organization set by fear but in DevOps
we like to embrace failure but only
they've got it in this presentation but
yes I had some slides from a recently
opened Museum of failure in Sweden which
features some very interesting products
some of which should be very familiar
with like Google glasses
some you'll be less familiar with
probably like the beasts lasagna
flavored toothpaste so people come up
with these wild and wacky ideas of
products and things to try and Lego
again actually have an annual award for
the most failed IT project and it's
intended to recognize that people are
trying to be innovative so in devops we
want you to be innovative we don't want
you to be afraid of failure but we also
have to protect you from causing a
catastrophic failure that could cost
your business its livelihood all Lots
fancy we have these sayings that you
probably familiar with I'll say so fast
they'll often sell smarts we have ways
in which in DevOps we want to build
resilience into your systems and
recoverability into systems that protect
you when you're experimenting everyone
had a chaos monkey somet fix chaos
monkey yeah loads of things that we can
do to keep on testing your systems to
build facility resilience in this is
from the devil's handbook we use this as
part of our standard course material
lectures for devil foundation course I
have met really hardly any organizations
that cover all of this yeah and actually
the one that I see most people slipping
up on it about the security libraries
and the security scanning tools which is
what we were talking about yesterday so
the ability to do things like either
have a security tool that's built quite
seamlessly into the IDs so when you pull
an artifacts out of your artifact
repository whether it's Nexus or
artifact or whatever it is you can get a
little pop-up saying actually that
version of structure is a bit dodgy
would you like to download this one
instead or you don't want it to
interrupt you in your IDE you can break
it at CI or CD and get an alert at that
point heard about some great stuff
yesterday called rasp real time
application security
common poppy was that basically sitting
in your JVM so I'm protecting you live
in your JVM from sequel injections and
stuff it's very first out of its very
cool so I'm going to try and hurry up
because I know that I have got one more
time one of our partners sana types who
do some tools and they make Nexus
actually Maiden they did a dev site cup
survey just a couple of months ago and
they found this which is about basically
when people are automating security and
what we'd like to see is all of this
coming left and actually
if you took a little difficult for
ignore the throughout the process one of
that and if you did like a blue line
you'll see there's a kind of lien there
and then if you do a purple line you'll
see that it is the overall line is
shifting left hopefully that little
dance made sense to everyone but what we
in an ideal world where we're seeing all
of this coming earlier so the idea of
the Deaf Cyclops engineer is that like
DevOps isn't one person's job it's
everyone's job security as well so what
we'd like to see is developers being a
being helped by security to understand
more about what it means to build
security into their applications more
collaboration security the worst frankly
in the IT world and if we work with some
customers where they don't even report
into IT when they very clearly should
but really the worst are collaborating
the very risk of us are very good at
putting up barriers so anyone from
security the room of just realize I've
got in a bit of a rant oh good I don't
offended anyone
so yeah they very often sit in their
ivory towers and they're quite like
unhelpful because they just want to make
sure that their bum is covered should
anything go wrong so to finish off on
this matrix
I'm safety culture about cultures core
culture in the name so that the give
away there but we need to build safety
in into these highly experimental
environments that one lane for so MCT
are classic measurement we use there and
accountability being key so through
constraints very last one very much part
of the goal that I mentioned earlier the
idea of food constraints is very much
for our manufacturing it is out of the
toilet thing again so if you imagine a
manufacturing pipeline and there's this
idea that if you make an improvement
that's not a constraint it's just an
illusion so if you imagine workflow
you're basically either creating more
work going up to another bottleneck who
you're creating a vacuum under the
actual bottleneck we use it as a tool
when we're trying to prioritize things
on a on earth for example and
improvement roadmap trying to define a
surface the highest priority constraints
this one just gives you like a feel for
how long these things have been going on
in terms of like how long people have
been trying to codify them if you like
or have been talking
about them and documenting them so agile
hi remember the name of ski resort soft
a bird like Snowbird or something the
ski resort in Utah where they came up
with the agile manifesto anyway in sort
of the early 1990s looks very new ITSM
started with our government here in the
UK have said and brought back for us now
the oldest by far is lean coming out of
Toyota new issue owning organization
much near safety safety culture and then
we've got the gold they've got the gold
rep book sir I put a little clave up
there because I thought it's quite nice
isn't it we've got some coming out of
America and some coming out the UK and
some coming out of Japan and some coming
out of Russia it's quite quite nice to
see that kind of global element to this
again is kind of my first to kind of go
at trying to go right which is which of
the three ways this one really concerned
about so sister little matrix that says
this one looks like that so Pixar you
can see that I've thought here we
learning organization not really about
slow but very much about experimentation
learning just might be useful to see you
if you're having these conversations
with people so just to finish off I'm
DevOps is all about change change is
quite hard to do even though it's
actually happening all the time these
are the reasons why we think everyone
wants it so if y'all feel about anyone
change one's like yeah let's change
let's improve ask people if they want to
change sigh oh no I'm actually fine
thank you very much I'll just go here
ask this one who wants leader everyone
runs off it's very scary being a change
leader most of our kind of initial touch
points into organizations or people that
have the the courage motivation the
enthusiasm the stupidity whatever you
want to call it - what a leader change
program Brad talked about this would not
actually there's but you talked about
the Iron Triangle that we've always
talked about in IT so this idea that you
can't have thing that's something that's
very low cost and high quality at high
speed we're always going to have to
compromise one of those three things
quality to speed and time
sorry quality speed and cost I was
having a conversation with someone on
LinkedIn and it got a bit out of hand
and we kind of invented this thing
called the Golden Square a base it's
it's saying that we DevOps the idea is
that we can deliver things at low cost
at high speed at high quality we've got
this for
as I mentioned of the human ox elements
so they customer delight or the employee
delight part of it so to summarize what
we're trying to do is trying to do
ideation to realization what we're
trying to do is just shrink that spring
when we're doing DevOps we're trying to
take as much waste at the process
automate as much as we can take as much
friction out just get you delivering
value to your customers as quickly as
possible through a continuous release
life cycle so that's me with one minutes
ago I am here for questions if you've
got any hopefully you don't all look -
muffled hello yeah you make things like
safe yeah what's your rate what's your
take on it so how these things can work
in a massive organization could me hear
this okay
know who needs okay so the question with
this Jensen was interested in our
opinions on how agile can scale
particularly frameworks like safe I'm
not an agile consultants myself I have
many I work with I kind of do the whole
umbrella don't sing what I hear from my
customers and our consultants is that
there's quite a lot of divided opinion
about things like safe it can work well
like scrum when it's executed well and
customized according to the organization
people like Lego use it quite
extensively and I think I mean it is
hard to an organization isn't it if
you've got tens of product teams and you
and they might be working across
different lines the one product to be
separated all the time on the other hand
it seems very difficult to get hundreds
of people in a room for a few days to to
kind of do this kind of things that
safes asking us today so short answer
mixed and challenging but a conversation
we'd be very happy to continue with you
if you wanted to to get some more
details anyone else
with any questions is it coffee break
time yeah cool thanks very much for
listening guy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
