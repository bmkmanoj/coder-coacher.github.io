we're at Davos CK and I'm here talking
to Ian from Oracle about Morgan is about
ethics and data science because you're
going to talk about data science but
interestingly you do love work with the
ethics committee so machine learning is
becoming obvious is the hot topic and
everybody is talking about you learning
in AI oh but what about the data what
should we be thinking about as
developers when we're designing apps or
systems that take this data should we be
looking at whether or not we have
permission to use the data example you
know it's very good question thanks cuz
it's yeah and the truth is but that
there is no there's no question really
the ethical use of data in the industry
right now but we sometimes talk about
use cases in the front front find the
right balance between the value to
consumers and the value to the customer
and working in the value corridor it's
too far to one extreme then and it's not
going to make any money to fight the
other three millions exploitations so
and interesting working with Oxford the
traditional barriers to entrance the
gills that prevented us from doing these
things don't exist anymore so if we were
to talk about things around cloning
which option things be a similar sort of
taking team learning you know cloning
dinosaurs this is a great idea cloning
stem cells maybe it's better challenge
of course with this is that those
barriers to entrance in terms of the
skills and equipping coexist in a the
software's out there skills are out
there so it very much that comes down to
just random vector back be ethically use
cases of for machine learning AI and
cognitive services in general so where's
the value corridor right where just feel
like they're not too creepy all those
kind of things these weekly
conversations to have there is no easy
answer but never sits an exciting area
to be in by now do you think that we
eventually will get to a place where we
need some kind of regulation well this
is that this is the interesting point
and the octave university feeds into the
into the government on this the
challenge is that's whether
Challenge is that whether regulation
exists or not the technologies out there
in the first place you know my previous
CEO Satya Nadella over at Microsoft used
to talk about the democratization of AI
and Larry Ellison's long talked about
you know the use of every technology
eventually fire for good and bad and it
could be argued there's no discussion of
responsibility from from the software
companies but the reality is that
stuff's out there and open-source anyway
and it's pretty much impossible to stop
that so it really comes down to the
individual use case is really about
finding the right uses but there are
some really super ones as well so you
know when I was at Microsoft there's a
great example of the hololens has being
used to bye-bye-bye developer
he's been adding blind to the age of 12
and he's going to Holland and it'll do
things like profile noises in front of
him so he's coming out the tube there's
a skateboarder coming down on some
cobbles it profiles what's what's
happening there it uses some of the
emotion recognition algorithms there so
when people are talking to him he can
engage what they're saying and they're
really good that safer the other side of
that coin would be you know if you've
got cameras watching you in Sainsbury's
and you're frowning a banana that's not
such a cool use of this technology you
know we're doing some stuff in China
around smoke detection on on an
algorithm so it looks for sort of you
know the pixelation of smoke as a fire
prevention exercise
there's about about finding the right
uses and you really and Emmas a nice
place manic belly storing data that you
shouldn't have as well if you're if
you're doing picked pixels detection on
smoke
are you also recording small walks to a
room and clocking that clearly
absolutely they're one of our
applications we've had or that we've
come across is the idea that you can
recognize a person and from their gait
and where they walk there's six
attributes all of that and they're
almost as unique as a fingerprint which
means that you don't necessarily
recognize effect for one of the
questions that the committee talk about
is what if you're able to identify
somebody as a diabetes person by their
way they are what what are the ethical
implications of what you do with that
data even one should be not so
that's for people who are much cleverer
than these soul but we just look at the
technology where anyway it's really
interesting and it's very questions you
know when we work with those companies
this is front and center so it's good
time to you to practice talking a lot
about data science expecting to you
another you can hear about data
scientist and about having you got into
it and and you showed about the
democratization of machine learning and
AI so what is it data scientist well
that's a very good question actually
identify this doesn't really exist as a
single person there's a great
consultancy called mango in the UK who
are data scientists I used to go to sort
of mathematician and statistician before
I joined Oracle Microsoft and before we
grew beards and for ourselves there's a
scientist for that felt like the sweet
spot for this the modeling side of
things where these go to a profiling
exercise where you you enter a bunch of
questions and then it and it comes with
a profile of what type of a scientist
you are and actually it's a polyglot
kind of personality so yet part of it
stats and modeling but another part is
data wrangling coding visualization
communication and actually we never you
know that the person who's all these
things doesn't exist yeah and why that's
interesting is because the danger of
data science becomes massively esoteric
so people like me can get very excited
about writing vine Rises and so I get
learning doing pandas on Jupiter and
people and 5% the room will know what
you're talking about and care and then
rest them will be wondering what the
hell you are talking about whereas
actually the reality is that there's
many different entry points to becoming
a data scientist and we want this to be
much more inclusive we want the the role
of data such to be inclusive and open up
to more and more people and it and the
opportunities but what you can do with
data for data fication to be it is
hugely exciting point in time we all
recognize that and there's some great
books like you know Hama Deus out there
from the Evo Harare that talk to what
we're doing but actually we want to make
this inclusive and not just go for the
pretty esoteric view superb anyway
that's our thing about data science so
that's a challenge yeah really
very good Eastlake is doing make sense</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
