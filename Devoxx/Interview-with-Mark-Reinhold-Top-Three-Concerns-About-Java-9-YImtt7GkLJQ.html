we're here at demo TK and I was Matt
Klein hold of Oracle who needs no
introduction really hello hello so we're
going to talk about your favorite
subject sailing no I don't know I don't
think we could work that in Boca and
maybe it's more time and crazy a machine
for and but I'm afraid me rescue by John
9 okay
and so people watching will know if they
read up on Java 9 and they follow
mailing lists and Tricia theory that
they're benefiting is going on at the
moment with concerns about modulation
yes and I thought it would be good to
ask you about these concerns because you
mentioned in the director K keynote
about top 10 some sense so would you be
happy to discuss maybe the top three
there seem to be many misconceptions out
in the world about what Java 9 is what
the jigsaw model system is how it's
going to impact people and as you said
in the keynote I have the I have a
source of 10 I should have a much longer
list but I chopped it down to 10 for the
keynote and let me see if I can do the
top 3 here so one of the top
misconceptions is for some reason people
think that maven does not work on drop
and I that's not true maven works fine
on Java it had I seen it has some three
zero zero the more recent version works
better and actually has support for for
some of the model system features there
have been problems in some of the
plugins I know there's still some at
least one minor problem in the Surefire
plugin but maven works if you've heard
that it doesn't that might be just a you
know some some kind of consequence of
the fact that there's been some
controversy around a feature of the
module system about which some of the
maven committers were were concerned but
that has nothing to do with maven
working today that has to do with how
maven can work in the future we've since
resolved that concern by the way but
maven works fine
Robert Schulte Apache you know charity
the Apache maven pmc says it works it
works fine so you don't need to worry it
work
so that's that's number one
the number two misconception I've heard
is that oh my oh I can't use Java nine
because my favorite library or framework
or tool doesn't work on Java nine well
that might be true but there's actually
a good chance and a better chance over
the near term that whatever you care
about will work on Java nine there's
been a lot of really adoption by the
maintainer zuv key libraries and
frameworks and tools they've shown up on
the open JDK jigsaw dev list they asked
questions those of us are working on and
give them advice and help them work
through issues sometimes the things they
have to work through our fairly
straightforward
unfortunately there have been a couple
of popular software systems that have
really deep issues but most of the time
it's not that hard and so I have a list
I showed in the keynote of popular
things that already already work just
fine on Java 9 as we say you know not
not just not just maven but ant you know
ant works a test ngj unit they work all
the IDS work at least to be if you get
there with their latest dev release in
some cases slightly older releases you
know spring a spring core framework
works spring boot works hibernate
validator works because this whole list
of things that have already been I've
been validated that they do work or
minor changes have been made to enable
them to work so they're they're starting
to be a good wave of motion making the
changes needed to work online so the
things you depend on you know will be
there hopefully in short order the third
misconception amongst amongst the tenner
clinic is that a lot of people seem to
be under the impression that I can't use
Java 9 until I convert all of my code to
modules and wait for all the libraries
and frameworks that I use to convert to
modules and until then I have to stay on
a that's not true so Java 9 has the
class path it's still there it works
great the class path I don't think will
ever go away right it's been a
fundamental part of
for over 20 years yes models offer an
alternative that we think is better but
you don't have to use them and many
existing software systems there might
never be a reason to go modifies an
existing body of code because it can be
a lot of work for not enough benefit and
that's ok too so those are the top three
make it do it makes us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
