session on coupling for Java programmers
my name is Venkat Subramanyam well talk
bit about Cartland we'll look at some
examples see some of the motivations for
using the language so what it appeared
to me was that they took Java and they
decided to add all the good features you
could find into the java language and
when they got it done they just called
it Kotlin and so Catalan is actually a
pretty powerful language and as I
started looking at Kotlin and playing
with it
time and again I cart got reminded about
various features that are really
powerful and things I like in other
languages I program in about twelve
different languages and so I'm naturally
drawn towards languages key strengths
and features and I can relate to a lot
of different features in different
languages that really shine well in the
case of Cartland well Kotlin is a
statically typed language which which
really is saying to us that we can get a
lot of quick compile time feedback but
the Carton compiler also is pretty
powerful in terms of the feedback it
provides as we are writing code and of
course Cartland compiles down to java
that should be no surprise as in java
bytecode but it also compiles down to
JavaScript if you really want to look at
javascript one of the things I really
like about
Kotlin is that it's really fluent it's
elegant it feels right when you write
the code in terms of the syntax and the
way that it cohesively comes together
it's it's elegant like I said it brings
one of the things that really excites me
is it really brings wonderful features
from a lot of different languages like I
said I programming about 12 different
languages and often time I'll enjoy a
certain feature in a language but it
wouldn't have other features which I
liked from other languages it's kind of
like a dream come true in a way you can
think about carton like a trait where
you bring a lot of different things
together and then it becomes a melting
pot for you to be able to use that so
let's talk about how we can actually use
this in the language well as you can see
I don't use any slides but if you want
to download the code examples I'm going
to show you here you're most welcome to
download them from my website on the
Downloads link you can download it
anytime you want to so let's talk about
compiling Cartland and playing with it
and what I'm gonna do here is start with
a fairly simple example I'm gonna just
edit a file called Katie Katie being the
extension for Cartland so I'm gonna just
start with a little file called sample
Katie and and I'm not gonna put any
ceremony here but I'm gonna compile it
so a little bit of ceremony is required
so I'm gonna start with a main function
as would be traditional in Java
applications I'm gonna say this is args
over here and I'm gonna create an array
of string let's say and in this case all
I'm gonna do is simply print line let's
go ahead and say hello but let's make
use of the arguments that is given to us
so I'll say Arg square brackets 0 so
that's the little code I'm gonna write
well you probably noticed already one
wonderful feature here or the lack
thereof I don't have to put semicolon I
can't tell you how happy my little
pinkie is already so I don't have to put
that stupid semicolon every time I turn
so I've written that little part but how
do we compile this code and how do I use
it
well that's where the car-cling compiler
comes in and there are a couple of
different ways to do things so here is a
cartoon C which is the cartoon compiler
I'm gonna compile this file called
sample Katie well one of the things you
can actually do which I really like is
you can include the runtime by including
the runtime you don't have to really
provide the classpath to Cartland it
gets bundled into it which really
reduces the burden on us to deploy this
and use it so all I'm gonna do here is
just simply compile it and produce the
sample jar file and once I do I can run
this like Java generally I can say
clients path right here and then say
sampled our jar and I'll provide the
name of the file in this case this is
going to be sample dart sample Katie and
then let's go ahead and say world here
because we want to say hello world to
begin with so that's our Carling program
running through java that was fairly
easy well if you don't want to do this
you can also do one more thing which is
to simply compile cortland without the
runtime and then when you run it through
java you would have to specific where
Catalan is located or simply you can use
Cartland without the C and then just run
it like that as well like you would in
other languages other than Java so those
are a couple of different options but
one of my favorites really when it comes
to languages is I really want to play
with languages as directly as possible
and so I'm a huge fan of repple
and Carlene also comes up with a fairly
decent repple that you can use I'm gonna
get rid of the files I just created so
at this point all I'm gonna do is simply
say Cartland in this case just see and
that becomes the repple that we can
start right off the bat so I can just
run the code right here and experiment
with that and so that is right there
Carlene telling us print line hello and
are high and we can play with it just
like that but again I'm a person of low
ceremony I want to do the minimum I can
and start interacting with the language
so I'm a really big fan of writing
scripts where possible so I'm going to
create a file called sample kts where
the S stands for it's a script and not a
full-blown class we're gonna write so I
want to really create a script and play
with it right here so as you can see in
this case we're gonna simply go ahead
and type that code and say you know
hello there without any other ceremonies
we can just go ahead and run this so
what I'm gonna do here is simply say a
Cartland C again this time but I'll type
in a scrip and provide the script file
so that we can't directly run it as a
script as well so you don't have to
really compile and play with all of
those things so there are some of the
beautiful options you want to compile it
be traditional to create a bytecode and
then put it away you can do that you can
play with the repple if you want to or
you can just write it as a script and
play it as a script as well that becomes
really easy so for most part that's what
I'm gonna do here just run it as a
script and play with it as we go along
so now that we have done that let's talk
a little bit about some of the real nice
interesting features what I mentioned
already that semicolon is optional so
you don't have to really use it one of
the things that I really like about
Cortland is a sensible warnings so if
you are trying to use a variable but you
haven't really used it properly or if an
initialize the variable properly you'll
constantly get some warnings which can
be really you know useful to prevent
errors from the get-go but like I
mentioned cotton is a statically typed
language but one of the things that it's
important to keep in mind is when it
comes to the word static typing I used
to be really angry about static typing
in the past and the reason is usually
static typing meant you type a lot with
your fingers that was not a really good
thing to do
well when good type inference you
the language do the inference for you
rather than you having to really type
all the detail so in this case I'm gonna
say let's say greet over here and let's
say this is our type string and then I'm
going to say hello right there and I
want to just go ahead and bring the
greet variable value right now let's
quickly take a look at what we just did
well this is an example of how you
define types in Cartland now you
probably really look at this and say
gosh this is like Scala or you could say
this is like typescript this is like
well many different languages actually
do this and this is quite different from
what we do in Java in Java you normally
say that type over here for example if
you're doing Java you would say a string
and then greet well languages like
Cartland emphasize that the name of a
variable is more important than the type
of the variable so as a result they put
the name first and the type after would
that kind of emphasis so as a result in
here you specify the name of the
variable followed by the type this is
how you specify the type anytime you
specify it but the good news is the type
is actually optional you don't have to
really provide the type make no mistake
this is not dynamic typing it knows what
the type is at compile time and it knows
you deal with it properly so if you were
to call a method on this you'll get an
error saying string does not have it so
if you want to take a look at what class
we are dealing with we can quickly query
this and find out it's none other than
the Java dot length dot string that we
are actually using in this case so
that's an example of type inference my
recommendation is make use of type
different inference as much as you can
and and of course if you're writing a
public-facing interface it's a good idea
to specify type information if you're
writing a local variable for example I
would say just don't bother saying the
type let the in front kick in and we can
use that fairly nicely but then going
forward you already saw me use the word
called valve a minute ago let's explore
that for a minute if I said Val let's
say you know let's say number is equal
to 4 and I want to print the value of
number I can do that readily with a
- friends kicking in right there but on
the other hand if I said number is equal
to just four again you will notice I get
a compilation error because Val means
it's immutable I cannot assign it to the
left-hand side of an expression or
assignment so as a result I cannot
modify the variable it's an immutable
variable but having said that Catalan
also has yet another keyword and this
keyword is called var which is also
known as the key word of shame
so if you're gonna use this keyword you
have to hang your head low and don't
make eye contact with the fellow
developers so the point really is we're
creating a mutable variable which is
okay in a limited situation but not too
broadly but this really is a way to
really examine the code and say where am
I using Val compared to var maybe and I
can find out very quickly but in this
case as you can see I can modify the
variables and then of course if I modify
the variable I get a new value assigned
to it that's perfectly fine but on the
other hand what happens if I try to put
a string into this well of course in
this case you can see I get an error
type mismatch because this was inferred
to be an integer of course and as a
result you cannot assign some other type
to it so that type safety still kicks in
fairly well as we can see one of the
things you can do is a nice little
string manipulations and string
templates if you used to grow we the
syntax here is pretty much very similar
to groovy in this context so as you can
see some of these are kind of like in
language like typescript and Scala
then there are some features which are
kind of like in groovy so in the case of
a multi-line string there are quite a
few interesting things you can do for
example suppose I had a name let's say
is equal to let's say Bob over here and
I want to really print out hello Bob I
could say hello for example and then
simply put the name right here and as a
result you can see that it says hello
Bob
you don't have to have the ceremony of
the curly braces but I would encourage
you to put that in if you have some
other expressions then of course you
want to put a Curly's around it to say
what is the boundary of that expression
itself on the same note you can also
define water called multi-line strings
you don't have to
the pain of saying plus plus plus and
keep adding things so you can very
readily create multiline strings without
really putting too much effort into it
so to create a multi-line string very
simply what you can do is it's it's
really fairly low ceremony for example
you can say message is equal to and just
put three triple quotes right here and
then start writing whatever string you
want to say for example this is a
message and we'll just put a little next
line over here and say let's say written
on and then we could say and sent it to
well you could also have in this case
variable names are as well and then you
can put more stuff into it so in this
case of course I have a little name as a
variable so we'll go ahead and say name
equal to Bob again well if we go ahead
and print the message you can see that
the message is going to be the string we
created but of course we got little
indentation going for us what if I don't
want that indentation well if you don't
want the intonation you can put a little
vertical bar this feature is very
similar to what Scala provides you put a
vertical bar and then you can come down
here and say you can say trim margin and
then you can simply ask it to trim the
margin that you have in there but you
say wait a minute what if I don't want
the margin to be a vertical bar well you
can customize that by providing the
character you're gonna use for the
vertical bar so in this case of course
you can see you can provide an argument
but if you really wanted to you could
also provide a different argument if
that is the you know symbol you're using
to indicate that it's the start of this
obviously in this case you would go back
and use the till D to indicate that
that's actually the one that you're
using as a margin separator so that's an
example of creating a multi-line string
but one other thing that really catches
my attention is when languages treat
things in a nice little way well one of
the things we have learned over time is
think about the word expression versus
the word statement I tried doing this
say the word statement and see how grim
it feels like life was taken away on the
other hand say the word expression you
immediately start smiling don't you it
feels light well that's why I like
expressions more than statements the
reason I really don't like statements is
by definition
statements introduced mutability how
evil they are so you cannot do anything
with the statement other than costing
mutability and the more statements we
have in a language the more we force
upon mutability honest but expressions
on the other hand do not force
mutability they actually returned
results back to us so the more the
merrier expressions that's better in a
purely functional language there are no
statements there are only expressions in
a purely functional language but of
course we are programming with a hybrid
language so it's a mixture of statements
and expressions we normally have
together but when it comes to
expressions the more we have is better
like I said so here is an example let's
say we have age equals to 17 now I can
say I can vote equals I can say if age
is greater than 17 I can simply say
please odhh vote over here and then I
can say else well we could say not so
fast so you can see in this case I have
a little expression but this is not a
statement if becomes an expression as a
result whatever the if is returning can
be assigned to a variable very easily so
in this case of course if I were to
print out the value of can't vote you
can see that in the says it's it's not
so fast which is the value that comes
from the else part right here similar to
if I try and catch is also an expression
so whatever you do as a last statement
within a tripe block becomes an
expression of the try itself so that
becomes easier to remove the ceremony
and also prevents unnecessary mutability
and garbage variables in the code as
well so in general the code becomes a
little bit more concise the more
expressions we have and Catalan is
leading towards in the right direction
in in that sense let's talk about
functions though
oh well functions how do we create
functions well you know we all program
about maybe 8 to 12 hours a day so
cartoon wants us to remember to have
some fun along the way that's why they
call it fun so every time you want to
create a function you call it fun well
that's exactly what Lang gives us as
well so you are normally used fun to
define functions in these languages like
Erlang and Cartland so what you do in
this case is you say fun and then you
could say greet over here and
going to specify your name let's say it
was string and then I'll specify your
message let's say in this case also a
string and then we will go ahead and
just print out a result out of this well
before we go through this let's put
equals right now and we will say in this
case message over here and then a dollar
name well notice what I just did here I
wrote a function called greet greet
takes name and message as arguments I
specify the type of the arguments but I
put equals the equals is a fairly
limited capability in Cartland but the
equal says please do type inference for
me and figure out what the return type
of this function is like I said this is
very limited capability so this one Lee
works for very small function usually a
single line function this works really
well if it's a little bit more
complicated you would have to do a
little bit more work for this but in
this case I can go ahead and call the
greet method and I can say over here for
example J in common let's go ahead and
say hello and you can see that in this
case we are calling the greet which is
returning the hello Jane and we are
printing the result out of it so this is
an example of using type inference while
we are writing a method itself but you
can also specify the type if you really
wanted to
so you could say : string as you can see
here and then you would put a curly
right after that and then you can
implement the method you want to
implement right in here so for example
in this case I'm gonna say a dollar
message let's say and then dollar name
and in this of course I'll call greet
one more time and we will just pass
through this function an object of Jane
for the first parameter and let's say
hello for the second one and this time
we wrote it as a separate method but in
this case it's returning the string
isn't it so it tells us we are supposed
to return some result from this right
there the type checking kind of came and
said you need to return some value so
I'm going to put a return statement
right now and then return that
particular value from that particular
call well in this case of course I'm
going to go back and print the result at
this time and you can see that it is
going to print the result of that
particular call but what if it want to
write a void method I'm not interested
in returning any result from it well in
that case of course let's go ahead and
move the print line again over here
and of course for this one I'm gonna
make this a void method if you want to
really make it a void method you could
type unit but I would just leave it out
why bother about the ceremony and you
can just write it as a void method just
like that not bothering about the unit
but unit is just the representation the
void in Bangui like Scala and in
Cartland so right there's a function we
wrote pretty nicely well so we wrote a
function we looked at the return type
inference we talked about specifying the
return type we talked about the
returning a void method as well but here
comes a charm I'm a big fan of default
arguments I'm used to default arguments
from languages like C++ and typescript
and all the way to Scala well why do we
care about default arguments people will
tell you the fault arguments are really
nice because you don't have to send an
extra argument I don't buy that that's
not the reason I like default arguments
the reason I like default arguments is
it's a nice way to evolve an API so if I
already have a function with let's say
two arguments but I realize I want to
add a third argument by making it a
default it becomes a nice way to
transition existing code can still work
at the same time I can add new
properties and parameters to this
function very easily that's one of the
reasons I really like default arguments
so in this case I'm gonna provide a
default argument let's say in here I'm
gonna call greet and pass Jerry to this
but I'm not sending the second argument
as you can see now when I run this code
it will fail obviously because I need to
pass an extra argument but I'm gonna
give a default value to this so I'm
gonna say equal to hi right there so we
are providing a second argument to this
function as you can see in this example
so given the second argument I don't
have to really pass an argument for the
second argument it just simply takes a
high but one of the other things you
will notice in here is this is again a
feature available in modern JavaScript
in es6 you have default arguments but in
es6 default arguments can refer to other
arguments other parameters in your
function Cartland provides that
capability also so I can come in here
for example and knowing that
is already ahead of this I can say named
art length for example over here and as
a result when I run it it actually
doesn't say hi Jerry
it says hi 5 Jerry so I can do that as
well by combining the steering is very
happy as you can see so we can just put
these arguments and use the parameters
earlier in the parameter list as well so
again this is a feature I've seen in
JavaScript you can do this in Catalan as
well pretty nicely so you can use
default arguments can tie these do this
but going a little forward one of the
things that gets really hairy is when
your arguments become in order to please
large when you have multiple arguments
it can become really painful so what you
can do instead of working with it this
way is you can simply call greed but you
can say name is equal to in this case
we'll say a sarah for a minute and then
we can also specify the argument value
message is equal to and they don't have
to be in the same order obviously and I
can say howdy for example and pass it
and so you can start giving these values
as named arguments as well but of course
you can also mix them together if you
really want to do so you can pretty much
we write this as greed but you can then
send Sarah right here and then you can
also say name equals to you know hello
for example and so you can also have
positional arguments followed by of
course you can also provide the values
for the other arguments too and in this
case of course we are sending the
message so if you have multiple
arguments you can choose to send some
positionally as long as you keep the
order and send others using the names
also so it gives you all these
combination of flexibilities some of you
may recognize those capabilities from
groovy as well so Cartland brings that
really nicely in here with with the
fairly good type checking so that's
basically about named arguments and how
you can use them in here and you can mix
them together one of the other things of
course is we really want to use nice a
variable number of arguments so in this
case I'm gonna create a max over here
we'll call it as numbers if you will and
this is going to be a type integer
however I'm gonna save our args on this
so for args
me to pass multiple arguments to this
particular function so in this case what
am I going to do I'm not a leverage type
inference for a minute and another thing
I'm gonna do here is to simply say
number start reduce and I'm gonna take a
max value and the element given to me
and I'm going to simply return if max is
greater than an element simply return
max otherwise return element for me so
that becomes a nice little cute little
function for getting the max and I'm
using the reduced function here to get
the data out of this and return to it
well this is a lambda expression so I'm
gonna put a little curly on this so
lambdas can appear as a curly outside or
within a parenthesis if you want to put
it but the curly is always required in
Cartland so if you're gonna write a
lambda it always requires the curly so
you could wrap another parenthesis
around this which is kind of wasteful so
what I can do now is I can call the max
function
oh maybe let's with 1 and 2 to get us
the result of 2 in this particular case
but I can also call print line max this
time and I can say 8 let's say 7 3 9 and
4 and I can get that value out also as a
value of 9 but what if I really have an
array already with me so let's say in
this case I have values equals let's say
int array off and in this case let's say
4 5 and you know let's say 20 3 &amp;amp; 2 well
I want to pass this over to max and and
get the response for these values but
its course in this case if I say values
right here what's going to happen in
this case is we get an error type
mismatch because it cannot pass through
this obviously an int array when of our
Arg is expected so what am I going to do
to fix this well the beauty of this is
the spread operator which we can use
very nicely or some languages call it as
explode operator well in fact we can
just not only use that we can combine it
with other operations also so in this
case I say 1 2 3 for example and then
I'm going to explore our spread values
and then I'm gonna say let's say again I
know 9 + &amp;amp; 2 well now of course when I
run it the values contains the biggest
value in this collection so as a result
it brings back 23 so I can combine these
together so you can have a combination
of discrete values
and you can spread or explode you were
value also and then combine things
together so that becomes really nice to
start programming we're not spending
over time on ceremonies it just becomes
natural once we learn some of these
syntax available to us all right so
let's talk a bit about the traditional
four loops but that again becomes a
little bit easier to work with in the
language how about writing a little for
loop to play with this so I'm gonna say
4x is going to come from 1 to 10 and
then in this case I'm gonna simply print
the value of x keep in mind in this case
it includes the value x over here this
is something I've learned in Ruby and I
really like this syntax but
unfortunately in Ruby if you want to
include a value and don't want include a
value you put two dots and three dots
and that is called cruelty right because
a programmer is gonna like look at this
and say is the two dots or three darts
and as I'm getting older that's not
really helping me well so Carlin said
you know what we're gonna just use the
two darts to give you a range but if you
really don't want to include the value
we'll just make it a little easy for you
so we're gonna say it for you know X or
in one until ten well that doesn't
include the value 10 as you can see so
if you don't want to include if it's not
inclusive then use until if it's
inclusive then you can use the two darts
to get to it what about stepping through
some values in the collection well if we
want to step through the values in the
collection you can say step two for
example and then of course you can just
skip some values and go through it you
can also do a step down if you want to
do so in this case for example you can
say 10 and then you could say for
instance down to oh let's say 1 and we
can go from 10 all the way down to 1 and
we can do that and of course you're
thinking what if I really want to skip
values doing it now I say step and
obviously the confusion is is a 2r minus
2 well okay it's actually 2 if you do a
minus you can accomplish an error so you
can skip values as you drop down as well
you're just positively decrementing in
that direction of decrementing so that's
an example of very nice elegant loops as
well that you could use
of course you can also iterate over a
values also very easily so for example
let's say we have a collection of names
on our hand so I'm gonna say Val names
is equal to let's go ahead and say in
this case list off and we'll call it as
Tom let's say and a couple of different
values over Jerry and one more maybe
we'll just include a spike so I want to
iterate through these values so we can
simply say for name in names and then we
can start iterating through the name and
print the value out very easily as we go
through this well that's great but what
if I really want the index value given
to us in this in this case well we can
also get the index value can say index
and then we can say named art indices
and then we can get the value the index
value through it so we can start putting
counts on it as well but of course in
this case because we have these string
expressions we can use we can take the
index value and then if we chose to we
can also say names square bracket let's
say the index and get the value art of
the collection as well in this case that
get of course so we can get the value of
the index also fairly easily and process
that if we really want to do so again
very elegant and cohesive and fluent
syntax for four so whether you choose a
functional style of programming or
whether you choose the imperative style
of programming you got it covered so you
can enjoy the fluency in both cases
fairly well and and and that's what
Carleen does I do have to mention that
Kotlin does have a few rough edges there
are a few times I would get annoyed with
it because when I'm trying to write the
code if I deviate slightly from the
syntax I would not get an error but it
would give me a in return a lambda
expression at times which is not what
quite I was expecting so there are a few
rough edges and hopefully over time that
will get really a streamlined and and
taken care so but one thing I really
enjoy so one of the things I I do is I'm
a big fan of beauty in languages that's
what I spend my nights on there playing
with different beautiful things on
languages and and so I was right over
very clearly about maybe a two years ago
I had in front of me a ruby code and
they say Ruby is elegant and beautiful
too
to critics and readers but as looking at
the Ruby code and in front of me was an
if statement which was about ten lines
of code and and you never can go to bed
when you have an ugly code in front of
you and I sat there and I was taught at
googling started reading started
searching and then I came to I said to
myself there's got to be a better way to
do this right and then eventually I
stumbled on this beautiful class and
Ruby called the when class and I just
dearly loved it and I was so thrilled to
see when actually in Kotlin as well so
when is actually a very beautiful
pattern matching syntax it can remove a
lot of ceremony in your code and I think
I've done it fairly elegantly here as
well let's take a look at one example
here so I want to create a function
called process but it's going to take an
input I don't know what the type of the
input is so you can say the type is any
in this case and then I'm going to say
over here when and I'm going to put the
input on it and put a wind block around
it now I'm gonna go ahead and call this
process over here
and I'm going to when I call the process
I'm gonna send a value of one so I'm
gonna put a 1 right here and I'm gonna
simply print you a got 1 and in this
example as you can see when I call the
process it simply said you got 1 so I
can certainly do that I can call so
called process and I can send a 7 I can
call process and I can send let's say a
8 but I want to know that if it's one of
these two values so I can come in here
and say 7 comma 8 and then of course
this says you got a 7 or 8 so we can
start putting these little combination
of values very nicely but what if I
really want to press end let's say a
value of 16 well I can come down here
and say in and well to 6
well 19 I can simply say over here I can
print them 18 so I can do that as well
to check the range of values pretty
nicely so if your value that you're
looking for is supposed to be within a
range of values of a collection you can
just put that into the if it's in the
collection also fairly easily you can do
else and you can say you know in this
case whatever that you gave me and of
course if you send me something that I
don't
Stan Ward it is I'm just simply going to
say whatever so in this case let's say
string builder and you can see that in
this case it simply is going to bounce
back with a whatever well you can start
putting these different combinations but
one of the other things you can do here
also is you can check for types if you
really want to do so you can say is a
string and then of course I can print
over here you you got let's say you
guard and then we'll just print out the
string we have in this case input well
let's kind of give this a try so we'll
go ahead and call process but we'll send
to it let's say the string hello but you
can see that in this case because it's a
type string it says you got hello well
but on the other hand here comes a charm
if I go up here and say you'll put dart
length I get a compilation error because
length is not a valid method on any so I
cannot use in dart length however the
language again avoids ceremony when you
step into right here where the cursor is
you already have proven that input is a
string so it doesn't punish you it
doesn't ask you to pay at all you can
simply come here and say input dot
length and be done with it that's a
really beautiful auto casting as a
result you're not wasting your time
doing stupid casting the language is
intelligent you programmed with the
language like it's an adult right that's
one of the things I really like about it
rather than treating it like a child and
you have to keep saying now that you
transformed it are you gonna cast it you
don't have to do that that kind of you
know things remove the ceremony again
from the code and make it very fluent
and convenient so there's a really nice
automatic casting similarly if you had a
done if a statement to check if it
something is now automatically it will
cast over for that as well well moving a
little forward from here we also have a
null type which is really pretty cool no
types are going to tell us whether a
value could be null or not for example
if I have a nickname over here and I
want to take a name and return a
nickname for this person and I'm gonna
say a string over here but in this case
I'm gonna say if name is equal to oh
let's say in this case a Robert I'm
to return in this example let's say a
Bob but what about if there is a no
nickname I'm going to simply return an
empty string for now so if I print out a
nickname over here and pass Robert over
here you can see that in this case I'm
going to get back the result of Bob but
what if I print name and send a nickname
thankfully vinkor doesn't have a
nickname well in this case of course it
doesn't really return anything but I
really want to say that don't even
bother giving a nickname for rank it so
what do I do I'm gonna return a blunt
null but we know that null is not very
pleasant well as a result the code
refuses to compile saying don't you dare
do that you cannot return null anywhere
you want to well this is one of the
things from C sharp C sharp has nullable
types and we can make use of that here
in Cartland very elegantly so if you
really think that you are going to
return on null then put a little
question after the type that becomes a
nullable type and as a result you can
return null values now similarly when
you receive a data you can receive a
nullable type as well from the call and
then you can perform a check on the null
but there are some really elegant syntax
for checking as well so what you can do
is if you have a nullable type on your
hand whatever the variable name is we'll
call it name you can put a question
colon like this and this will be the
part for if the value exists and then
you can also put a little you know
question : for the part where the value
does not exist so you can write the
syntax very elegantly to process that as
well and again you will enjoy the auto
casting I mentioned earlier once you go
through the check you can then readily
use the type as a regular type not as a
nullable type that becomes really really
powerful
well what about creating functional
style code well we can definitely create
lambdas and play with them in here as
much as in any other language so for
example I'm gonna create a little lambda
right here called double this lambda is
gonna take an argument let's say element
E because I'm trying threading the
standalone I do have to specify the type
char kind of like in Java so in this
case I'm gonna return it e times 2 that
becomes my little lambda expression I'm
creating now I can say list off and
let's say 1 2 3 a few different values I
want to work with
so what I can do in this case is I can
then take this and say filter and to
this I can say give an element element
mark two is equal to zero I can get the
elements which are in this case of
course the even numbers then I can
perform a map operation and I can just
pass their double over to this and then
finally a for each method and if you
remember Java has a method called peek
well here they have a method called you
know each where you can say are each and
then you can just peek into the variable
as well so you can have a combination of
these methods that are available to you
well in this case of course I want to
print this value out so how am I going
to print it well I can say give an
element I want to print the element so
I'm gonna take all the even numbers
double the even numbers and print them
or if you don't want to really give a
silly name to it you can simply say
print align it and it is a legitimate
variable like in groovy that you can use
for lambdas as well so you don't have to
really give a name if it's single
variable you can just use the it carton
also has a D structuring of lambda
parameters as well so if you are
receiving multiple parameters you can
easily set them into different values
much more easily let's talk a little bit
about extension methods this is
something I really enjoyed in c-sharp
and you have beautiful extension methods
here too so for example I'm gonna say
value function called shout and I want
to create this function whose name is
shout well in this case we'll come back
to this in just a minute
but I want to go ahead and take a string
so I'm gonna say greet is equal to hello
but I want to call greet dart shout
let's say but we know that shout does
not exist on the object so as a result
I'll get a compilation error right now
so it doesn't know what shout is but I
go back over here and say well this is
on the string class so string dart shout
and then I'm going to simply take this
one and say well let's make it easier
we'll just simply return to uppercase
and ask you to return with the type
inferencing and such so now when I run
this code you can see it is going to
convert it to uppercase and give it to
us be very careful though while this is
a very convenient feature you need to
remember that this is not literally
adding it to the class this is more of a
compiler gimmick so what the compiler
does says
time it sees the word greed darts out
Italy wires the call site right here so
as a result if you have an overloaded
method that would not work properly so
in other words extraction methods cannot
be overloaded it is simply just for you
to conveniently call into it so there
are certain limitations you have to be
fairly comfortable with when you use
this let's talk quickly about classes a
little bit and see what we can do what
classes are final when you begin to
create them classes can have properties
these are very much like your c-sharp
properties you don't have to define
fields they automatically get defined
for you which is really nice so you can
focus on the fields rather than focus on
the properties rather than writing
fields but what if I really want to do
something with the field period you
cannot define fields in Cartland however
you can't refer to them you don't define
them but you refer to them and you can
refer to them using a name called field
and of course you can also set the
setters as private as well let's take a
quick look at an example so class car
over here and I'm going to define a
property called
year of registration and then I'm going
to say in this case is equal to 2010 but
this appears like a variable field but
it's actually a property how do I create
an object right now car equals to car
there's no new keyword in Kotlin so um
so there's a there's really a
parentheses to really invoke it so you
can treat classes like they are
functions if you will to create objects
of this now I want to print out right
here card art year of registration and
you can see that in this case we are
pulling in the property but of course if
you want to do some checking you can
certainly do this so you can say sect
value which is going to be a function
I'm gonna create right here and what am
I going to do within the function I'm
gonna say if the value is greater than
2017 I'm gonna say throw run time
exception and in this case I'm gonna
specify not in the future right so you
can specify a little exception otherwise
what am I going to do field is equal to
the value that you provided for me so we
can start setting things very easily
by these kinds of functions and you can
write a setter for that but on the other
hand if I tried to modify this and say
well let's do this before we print it
out so car dot year of registration is
2016 and you can see that in this case
it does not prevent me from changing but
if I try to set it 2019 I get an
exception on it because I can't really
change it so you can write setters for
it and notice this is called field you
don't really get access to the direct
field again very similar to what c-sharp
does but Carly I think does it a little
bit more elegantly by using this thing
called field where a c-sharp requires a
actual name at the point so that's
really nice over here you can also write
it getter similarly so if I want to
really bind this to yet another field I
can write another getter for this and
get that field through this particular
variable so that works out really nicely
but keep in mind one thing though that
when you create classes classes are
final to begin with
you cannot inherit from them so you have
to open them if you want to inherit what
about static methods though so I'm gonna
say object this is very much if you know
Scala you're in home here with this so
object util and I'm gonna define a
function called get let's say number of
course over here and this number of
course is going to return to us let's
say in this case because I'm going to
just return the value let's just return
a value of four let's say well I can
call the util over here and call the get
number of course method right directly
here that's a static method on this
particular class but if I'm creating an
object what do I do well in this case
I'm going to say class car right here
but there's going to be defined as a car
a class so this is a class as we can see
we can write a function within here for
example I'll save fun fun drive let's
say and the drive function is an
instance method as we would know so I'm
going to simply say driving well this
clearly requires an object to be used so
I can say car equals to car and create
an object in this case of course I can
call the car drive very easily but what
if I want a static method on this class
well in this case of course if I want a
static method on the class I can simply
say card art you know some kind of a
static method you know the kind for
example
well but the kind doesn't exist on the
car right now how do i define a static
method if I wanted to find a static
method once again I'm gonna come in here
and say companion and then this becomes
an object and then within the companion
object you can provide your kind method
so fun and then there's going to be kind
and let's just go ahead and print out in
this case a kind called so um you can
see how that becomes available as a
companion object on the class you can
also provide a name for your companion
class also if it's a car kind for
example what is the difference not
nothing at this moment but if you want
to get an access to this car kind how do
you do this well if you want to get
access to it you can say for example you
know let's call this as ref is equal to
well card art and I can say companion
over here and that's a way for you to
get access to the companion of that
particular car but on the other hand if
I were to go here and call this as a car
kind in this case then no longer can you
call it as a companion you would have to
call it as a car kind if you give it a
really you know specific name so there
are different ways to get access to this
particular companion object as well and
you can use it and and one real detail
if you want to really use your object as
a data object maybe all you're doing is
just pass data around not very much
behavior you can say data class and then
that just becomes an immutable class you
can make a copy of it provides a few
free methods like to string you can also
access properties directly or using
something called component and and get
access to it also and finally about
inheritance I quickly want to say that
you have to open classes before you can
inherit it but I want to talk about two
very interesting features before we are
done in the next six minutes so I want
to show you a little bit about laziness
so laziness is a pretty phenomenal
feature I really like it so to
understand this let's say we have a
method called compute the method compute
takes a value integer and all I'm going
to do with this method is simply return
that integer so I'll just return back
the given value and let's say but what
I'm going to do here is that I'm going
to simply print out let's say
this is going to say over here are
called well you know one thing very
clearly if I were to say X is equal to
four and if I say if X is greater than
five and if I say compute of let's say
four is greater than seven I want to go
ahead and print out let's say result
well you know one thing very well when I
run this code it is not going to print
the result
well that's great but what is it going
to do though it's not also going to call
the compute method after all because the
compute method is short-circuited which
is nice
absolutely however if I take this one
here and say Kemp over here and if I say
Val temp is equal to that so such a sad
thing it calls the compute method
because it doesn't know that you don't
need the value of compute so well you
can do something really elegant here you
can say Val temp by lazy and then you
can use a level of indirection here and
say that I want to postpone calling that
until a later time so as a result now
you can see it never actually called the
compute method however if this becomes a
forty-four clearly X is greater than
five and when you run the code now you
can see the computers called but not
otherwise so you can do laziness very
nicely well in a similar way this is
just a specialized syntax of full-blown
delegates that is available in Cartland
a delegate simply contains a get value
and a set value property doesn't have to
implement any interfaces and it will
just delegate with the call and it can
do beautiful meta programming with it
talking about meta programming I want to
show you too elegant features which are
pretty darn cool the first thing I want
to show you here is let's say we have a
class called pizza now in this case the
class Pizza has a method of function
called spread and I'm going to write an
item which is a string let's say well in
this case when I write this method I
just simply want to call here and say oh
well let's go ahead and say spread and
then we'll just say item well I want to
call this method after all so I'll say
pizza is equal to pizza new pizza and
once I create an object of the pizza
ours a pizza Dart
spread and let's say cheese I know this
is a bad example to use right before
lunch
so when I run this code you can see it
called it but you may say but wait a
minute wouldn't it be so cool if we can
do this so let's go ahead and try that
sadly that doesn't work but we can fix
it by saying this is an infix operation
and we can get some beautiful elegant
syntax with it so all you have to do is
in fix a single parameter arguments can
be used for it so we can start creating
some elegant code with this kind of
syntax so the final example I'll show
you here used to apply this to do
something a little bit bigger what if we
can do something kind of like this what
if we say operate and then I'm going to
say it turns right and then it turns
left and then it runs fast wouldn't that
be cool to just write something like
this well let's see how we can do this
well func
appro function operate and the function
operate of course is going to take as an
argument a lambda expression because
remember this is just a lambda and how
do I say it's a lambda
I'd say func over here it's a lambda
which doesn't return anything we'll
start with this baby steps so operate is
going to be called with that so we'll
start with that and see what it's going
to do so in this case I'm gonna call the
operate and pass this to it it doesn't
have a clue what it is but don't worry
buddy we'll come to it so I'm gonna
create a class called robot and the
robot is gonna do all this work so let's
say we have a method called let's just
do the turns we're not worried about
this right now so what about turns let's
define a function well in fix function
called turns and let's say it's going to
take the variable in this case let's say
direction but I'm going to simply call
this and say old symphysis it turns and
then we'll print the direction out here
well let's do one more thing we'll just
define a value called
right and the right is going to be equal
to right and then we'll define a value
called left and this is going to be left
we'll see how this is going to end up so
now that I have the in fixed method and
the turn method I'm gonna come in here
and say this is going to take a robot as
an argument and then return back a unit
well okay so far so good we'll just
I didn't say called over here and see
what it's going to do at this point well
when I run this code operate let's make
sure this is correct so this is the
operate it does expect you to spell
correctly okay so that's the method
we're gonna use and what about the turns
right we'll come back to that in just a
minute so now that we have this code
running oh it's gonna call the called
method but I need to invoke this
particular method and have it run do
some work in order to do this I'm gonna
come in here and say func and then with
this function I'm gonna create our
object of robot so it's a robot is equal
to robot and I'll say robot well we'll
say with robot and I can perform this
function to run within that context this
is one way to do it
carton also gives you a way for you to
attach to this to a class also and you
can run with it and by doing this you
can say I want to run this code within
the context of robot and so as a result
I want to run that little code within
that environment of execution well what
this really amounts to is you can pass a
lambda expression and have that lambda
execute in this context let's quickly
take a look at the error that is giving
us no value passed as a parameter well
sure enough that's correct we'll just
pass the robot to it so now that we have
gotten to that point right here what can
we do next
well remember this robot is coming in
here and we know that it refers to a
special name which is the name of the
argument given to it and as a result
what we can do here is we can start
calling these kinds of methods what
about the right well the right becomes a
variable within this context of this
object and that should become available
right here as a dis start right and that
should have actually picked it up I'm
not sure why you didn't pick it up at
this moment so in this case it will run
in that context for now I'll put a
string but we can leave this a homework
or debug that so any one of this code of
course you can see that it is turning
right so you can get to this kind of
fluency very nicely by playing with the
language and passing lambdas around and
and and then as a result using some
infix notation you can gain quite a bit
of fluency in this code if you download
the code I provided you will see that
I'm able to call this without the string
itself and you will be able to use
so I can start creating quite an
interesting set of fluency as well and
with all this said I managed to create a
cover a very small part of the language
so but it's a really fun language it's a
lot of fun to play with it if you have
enjoyed other languages I'm sure you'll
enjoy Curtin as well if you want to
download the examples please download
from my website hope that was useful
