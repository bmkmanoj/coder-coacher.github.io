and it's my first time in Romania but to
meet - first time - yes and it was a fun
fact because I've been watching Romania
for more than 15 years from the other
side of the Danube River actually for
all my childhood was in one more small
Bulgarian city on the coast and I want
finally it's a good a good reason for me
to cross this border and be here in
Bucharest great pleasure you turkeys
amazing functional programming in Java
so it's a kind of but not exactly so
it's about actually only one single
class we're talking there's one class
called compatible future and everything
around it but in my talk I tried not to
focus on the API because there are many
good talks of explaining API itself but
also the way it should be used how it
should be used and what are actually the
triggers you to think about it think
about how to use it the way you can do
your job with this thing what is it
about infeasible future there and
inspired you to give a talk about it
well actually I'm starting working with
complete over future not working the
testing for the future even before Java
8 was even released so I've compiled it
myself you know work there but everybody
there was obsessed with streaming API
and seventy-fourth methods and so on and
I see ok but there is something which
not so much mentioned but it's it's
noise potential I'd say ok that's
something we should talk about because
it's a game changer complete game
changer and I've started you know
exploring it's uh I've heard several
good talks or from really good speakers
partner cabbage for example is really
good at this reactive stuff and he
inspired me not just to you
to sleep on its way and all my thoughts
have items' explained in this session
what is it about peaceful future that
makes it a game-changer
well first of all somehow in a very
intuitive way right multi-threaded
applications without even using the word
threaded side so you just upload your
work somewhere else it has to be done
there the results will be returned and
as they are returned you don't have to
care about this you just can
automatically send the signal to a
consumer of this result and once again
you just change all your flow all your
work the way you compute the results or
the way you get it from some other
resources and its really the Handy entry
source saving and once again you go
multi-threaded even without noticing
because you can go multi-threaded and
you can improve where it's by itself or
is it a tools that you use with other
parallel programming to do well aha
let's make it like this so parallel
programming is not trivial at its state
so if you use parallel programming so we
have to be ready for that not every task
can be done in parallel way and other
returns can be done good with
completable futures as well so you have
to choose the right task for this this
is also something that was something
mine session so if you have a very good
atomic tasks which can be let us say
exactly atomic so they run independently
from each other and this is a good way
you can just you know throw this work
away and three resources on your machine
and release the resources for something
else and it comes so soon so naturally I
would say that really allows you to make
more productive and efficient
code was just for a few language
constructions what classes actually
because it's just a class what's the
best to use become peaceful future well
in my personal case it was something
like actually beautiful about
completable future came on time I would
say because Java 7 for example did not
have this expression expressiveness
outside as it has now and Java is for
example with all of the merits and so on
method references for example and so for
join moon which is since underneath its
technology actually it's also a new
technology from Java 7 it was integrated
so some is made it possible and the
other thing that now the micro services
here is an every conference I guess yes
you cannot avoid this word and micro
service was a very good choice for that
because there you write a very if you
write a good you're at very good atomic
operation I would say functionality and
this atomic functionality can be made in
a sink this way and if you make a
synchronous way all the change from the
computation direct to the service since
the service themself now support
asynchronous entity so it's very natural
to do this and in my case it was exactly
this thing we did some micro services
which were totally i synchronous on from
top often even in my session I see that
we could we performed really great with
all this think we have some performance
improvements although there were not so
much you know tricycle but still several
pros and I can make difference as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
