Cineplex and uncertainty meal he's
giving a talk about seek urs and events
or thing with lagoon and so what is DQ I
stand for just remind me cigarette this
command curry responsibility segregation
and what it basically means is that you
separate the right side from the red
side so changing the data from reading
the data and what do you I'm how did
begin to hate that well seek us and
event sourcing is one of the underlying
principles for legume so it's the
framework itself is built in such a way
that it does well yeah you send commands
and you you also fire sending commands
you pull that data so it's really built
on top of this principle seek us and
conversely there is that abstracted away
from you in their framework that you can
just start using it you will see some
parts of it like you need to write your
own events and commands so you will see
it but what legume does it really
abstract the storing of the events and
handling all the consistency parts so
you don't need to take too much care
about that box and it describes itself
is an opinionated framework that's right
idea what does it mean by that I think
you can see it in the same census for
example a spring where you can with
really little boilerplate code you can
define for example your interfaces or
yes certain aspects so you don't need to
write a lot of code it so for example if
you give the interface certain types and
it will say okay this is a rest get
interface or a post things like that and
you get yourself
no not that's in production build some
test applications with it which you will
see in my presentation as well but I
think at least as my opinion it's in its
early stages so the I would like to see
it more proof before really starting
working with it in production if
anything any features in particular that
are coming up that you looking so lucky
not that I know if they just released
the nurse Carla api's so if you're a
scholar these are the photos are really
cool and even takes you less code to
write the same functionality other than
that from mature what did I key take
away from you took what I think is that
I want to present like an introduction
into legume and see and tell the day why
wife's built on top of seat us what
strengths are and also especially focus
on the red side so what the advantages
are and especially what you'll see in my
dog is I'm using instead of a no sequel
and using a sequel database and to see
the strength of D normalizing the data
into tables and anchoring on them so I
think also what we do in in real code
and it's a real strength and neck and
gain in that way a lot of performance
advantages thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
