diversity matter so you don't really
need to sell it to me but it's one of
those things that you think do you
really still need to justify talking
about it well I mean it's not just tell
Sofia it's yes that we both were working
like several years in IT and technology
and we actually think it could be nice
not to be talking again and again about
the same topic is there and we have been
living with it but we know a lot of
companies and men and women that you
could like to have more females more
like more diversity in their teams and
in the last decades we haven't been
improving that much so is a problem
probably we have to say it another
perspective or maybe it's a problem that
it's got to live with us I mean the
whole life yeah maybe it's not really
justifying it I don't think we have to
justify it to talk about it but maybe
it's more about problem solving so what
can we do to solve the issue not just to
talk about it um um I even think that
talking about it is for some people
getting a bit tiring already which is
contra productive so what we like to do
is we like to talk about what what can
we do to improve the situation actually
do and what can we do as an individual
or can we do as companies and what can
you expect from governments to improve
so yeah I think it's really constructive
precise as to give a talk about women in
tech and at first I was really grumpy so
you're asking me because I'm a woman and
I complained about it to one of my
friends he very wisely said ok if you
don't think how to women in tech is
constructive why is and it sounds like
you've given a really constructive talk
about these are the steps you can take
to improve yeah actually it's for us
it's not like mother saying eight your
fault it's our fault because yeah we
said it on the talk of him
there are a lot of time to say yeah it's
not a problem says the women they don't
like technique and IT and all the sub
say well I mean we cannot say because we
each other ourselves that actually there
are a lot that we can still do I mean
ass woman or I shall haps like some
complex let's say sometimes like these
unconscious biases what they happen and
there are still there and what we have
to try is like first of all do not
prepare to them with our yeah like the
kids or in our companies or with other
our female colleagues but as a company
itself is you can do a largest given
like equal opportunities so stuff I mean
with the thing is like a key point you
have to give equal opportunity to marry
I mean like men and women and yeah
government is another issue and I think
it's important to not just talk to men
what em what we think it's wrong it's
good getting going wrong but it's
important to talk to women and and tell
them that this and that isn't going well
and this is that is going well so um
it's not everything but not everything
is bad and I'm now we are no suffering
like oh my god i work in hiding for me
not at all I mean we like it I realize
it but there are fences you have to
improve under not every person is same
and maybe some of us we need more like
support from your company or her
colleagues yeah yeah well I think it is
I think it is very important because a
bit more inclusive workplace and more
diversity not just gender forever race
sexual orientation religion you do get
suffer products that offer everyone
rather than software products that are
designed for and by the people that make
them maybe subconsciously but in there's
an interesting study someone mentioned
to me that most medical trials
and drugs are actually tested on men
because they have more men that they're
dealing with the drug testing on them
they have women and I think it's similar
in suffern in a way that if you
organization is dominated by one group
of people if they're men are in the
women then you do tend to design things
subconsciously are for those for that
grew yeah actually there are also other
studies or they say that normally or two
people in a company day if you are
trying to find some new colleagues do
you look and consciously for people like
you yeah so if your man probably you say
I know I know I guys will it you let's
have meant an interview with them and
actually maybe it's one of the problems
I mean Deb didn't said I mean it's not
like they don't want to have women
around it's more like okay tomorrow yeah
they're not even aware and sometimes you
also see a we make the question also a
when was the last time that you've been
in a meeting with two women in the room
I think there was like one hand after me
after and I think it's the first thing
that I i think when i came into a
meeting room ok how many women sir
nobody ok only me that's weird i don't
get used to it I mean I don't know to be
willing to minority the whole time yeah
yeah I've seen similar experiences so
I'm and I don't think it's just a
software engineering and I am I think
the higher up you get like if you go to
project management or or higher up the
chain it's getting worse and worse it's
not just on the type of engineering
technical engineering so the guy I'm
dealing yeah do you think something like
him anonymous selection then would be
constructive so for something you to see
a CV without an heir mmm well I mean it
could work but actually to me it's kind
of fake something somehow I mean I like
that when I go to an interview
to me like person I mean it's not like I
have to behave like a man or i have to
have the same I mean like the same plans
the same I mean is I'm completely
different maybe and I don't like to be
in a company that doesn't mean I mean
like think about it i mean i have over
like way of thinking i need other
opportunities maybe or i mean it or like
yeah yeah i think if you do that it's
kind of a forced diversity and I'm not
sure if I want to work in a company who
who is forced to think about the
diversity that way because I'm as you
said what if I go to an interview and
they they see me and if they don't want
a woman on the team or something isn't
that a real interview after all yes it's
not smell it really want to hear ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
