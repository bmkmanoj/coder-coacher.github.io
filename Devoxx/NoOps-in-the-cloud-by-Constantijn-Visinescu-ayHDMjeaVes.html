this case no ops means that you'll see
you set up your dev ops team so well
that during your normal sprints you
don't need to spend any time on
operational work everything just works
meaning that the developers can do what
they want to do namely develop features
so this isn't going to be a tarp in an
example so I'm gonna start an example
like a java application who here has
ever built and run a maven java
application yeah most of you get so i'm
gonna for this example I'm going to take
a maven java application and i'm going
to be deploying it to production the
nathan java application is going to talk
to an SQL database i'm assuming most of
you have also done that before yep ok so
you might have heard in during the
conference and before there's this new
thing called docker so verra we also be
using that for example if you haven't
heard of docker think of it as a really
lightweight vm that allows you to insert
your operating system or your patches
and your application all in one so the
operations side just has to run it and
if you ever need a new version force for
like java on your server you can just
insert it into docker image yourself
which means you don't have to ask Ops
guys to do it for you those Dockers
things need to run somewhere the toolbar
gun I used to run them is called
kubernetes it's going to be a production
setup so that means we need we'll need
multiple instances and if we're going to
have multiple instances we need to need
a load balancer to talk to all of them
and in the end we're gonna use Jenkins
to string everything together so this is
the production infrastructure we're
going to be setting up there's going to
be a load balancer you have three
instances of your API running so even if
one precious you still have two left
database is replicated twofold so even
if one crash if you still have one left
and databases tend to crash a lot less
than the applications you write yourself
so two is enough so now we're going to
switch to the demo first of all we're
going to have a java application it's a
normal java application so i can also
that also means i can run it from my ID
so if i have it on localhost 8080 our
application in this case is a guestbook
application and it works just fine
locally but this is you as a developer
writing your code so most of you here
know how that works so now we're going
to want to deploy it so the total in
order to deploy it we're going to do a
maven build so this is amazing clean
package also should be fairly fairly
standard for everyone here this builds
me a yard one thing that's slightly
different from what at least what I used
to do a couple years ago is it a couple
years ago I was building a bar and I
needed to take that to a tomcat server
with my hopes guys and ask them to
deploy is and everything right now I'm
doing it slightly different because the
jar I made includes jetty so in order to
run the application all I need is a java
JRE no tomcat know anything else all i
need is a java JRE and i can run the
application i just built so I give it to
jar that's in my target directory that I
just built to act as a server and I give
it a config file let me to make sure
that this one is stopped because
otherwise we'll get a port conflict
and now it's up and running again over
here so all we need to do to run this is
a java GRE and that's key to making this
whole setup work because that means it's
really easy to deploy your app
everywhere no need to worry about Tom
cut version or anything because as
developer you all put it in your jar
file so the next step is to put that in
dokur so dr. is basically a lightweight
vm that you can hand over to another
system and tell tell them run this for
me so no more asking hope you guys to
update versions or anything let's see if
I can zoom this in no I can't much
better at a docker works with the
so-called docker file what it does it's
it starts with an image that has a JRE
in it says I'm the maintainer we work
from route what it does is call it
copies the artifact that maven just
built it copies it into the docker file
so it can run it it has the
configuration file and it tells it how
to run it and the port that it needs so
this is all you need all your you need
to write as a developer and now you can
build a docker file
so also let's for example say that you
know if a product owner and he wants a
new feature he likes the guestbook
rebuilt but right now the bar above here
is blue this is a local development
environment and he won't Lili would like
to have purple the application is also
already running in production right now
that's over here so we take our local
development environment we take our code
and over here we change the tool we
change the color of our toolbar this
isn't very interesting but now I should
be able to if I run it locally from my
ID again I should be able to see that at
least locally yep now my bar is purple
but now it works on my machine and it
might make me as a developer happy but
my product owner wants to have it in
production as soon as possible so over
here it's still blue so what we do right
now is we check it in to get
and we push it to master and we have a
Jenkins instance over here that's
listening to master so if we wait a
little bit it should pick it up by
itself and start building
there we go
so the way it's set up is that in my
source code repository also checked in a
Jenkins file that tells me how to build
it so it has a couple steps the first
one is check it out from get then create
some variable names that will need later
then the steps are made in clean packets
that's what you also saw me do locally
the next one is to take the docker take
the docker file we just had and create
the actual docker image from it that
image needs to gets pushed to my clock
to my kubernetes cluster so it can can
start deploying it later and then I tell
my cluster to actually deploy the image
we just built and now if we take a look
at the Jenkins over here yep it's all
done so now in production my title bar
is also purple I did this with zero
downtime during the day it's about a
quarter to two instead of three a.m. on
a saturday night and this is also
hmm this is also zero downtime so if I
go back to my slides what it just did it
took the first one it's that that had
the blue title bar it brought it down it
replaced it with a new one that had a
purple title bar and then it replaced
the second and the third ones so that at
any time there were at least two
instances left to share my production
traffic actually that might have been
one of the most boring them I was you've
seen during their folks here and
actually that was the whole point
because I let the hell if you set it up
right all of this takes is a push to
master and you've deployed with zero
downtime during the day and then you can
get back to developing which is what
most of us like to do
so that's really nice but who will make
will maintain all this code because
writing and writing code for a demo that
works on a on a conference is not all
that hard but keeping it up and running
for let's say years in production
without it falling over that's something
else so there's several components who
will maintain what well the java
application well if your developer sorry
but you still need to maintain your own
application no magic that's to fix that
there's the SQL database i'm using a
cloud provider so i can ask them to give
me an SQL database that's replicated and
i also give give it a maintenance window
so they make sure it gets patched and it
keeps running and i also they also make
the backups so I always get my two
images so as long as I don't break the
contents of the database myself it will
just keep on running and that's what we
pay our cloud providers for docker well
yeah all you need to do is have the
docker file and it will just build so
that's just fine the kubernetes cluster
the actually building those things in
deploying them can be a bit of a hassle
again that's why we have a cloud
provider in this case Google cloud and
you can just ask those guys give me a
kubernetes cluster with three nodes and
three minutes later you'll have a
cluster and again they keep it up and
running without you having to worry
about it and there's a load balancer in
front of that again we use a cloud
provider so we just tell them we want a
load balancer 2.8 our application and it
will keep running and the only thing is
our Jenkins box won't update itself but
the Jenkins box won't also won't be
exposed to the internet directly because
the last time I had my Jenkins exposed
to the internet directly I got an email
from my cloud provider at two a.m. in
the morning that it was used by Chinese
spammer so the Jenkins will be behind an
SSH tunnel so it won't be reachable from
the internet so if it's not up to date
with the latest patches that's not that
big of a deal
so now we have a really easy deploy to
production any questions nope oh yeah a
good question we use version databases
for that there's two tools in the Java
wrote that i know of that are really
good at that the one is fly away the
other one's called liquid base basically
what you do is you create SQL files with
create tables alter tables and other
scheme I migration and you number them
and you ship those with your application
and when it starts it checks it checks
which versions are applied on the
database and which ones it has so if it
went starting the application it sees
like migrations 12 12 or apply to the
database and in the code that you just
chipped there's two new migrations
namely 13 and 14 the tool is smart
enough to be like okay you already got
12 12 I'll just apply 13 and 14 for you
as soon as I deploy the application and
then i can continue starting the
application so that way all your
database migrations are also they're all
checked in to get and they're also all
replayable for local testing if you can
just throw away your database restart
the application and the application will
will rebuild the whole all your tables
from scratch and that way the database
migrations are also automated there's
okay now we're getting a bit bit more
technical but kubernetes over here it
has the tree up the three applications
but if I take a look under the hood
so what it does over here this is these
are other versions of the application i
deployed recently and you see that one
of them has three desired and three
current and also tree up and running but
the other ones are actually the old
versions of my application so if I want
if I want to roll back I can easily tell
it like a scale down the one that's
running now and scale the one back up
that is the one that I want any other
questions well if he a good question one
of the main reasons for that is that you
use the database migration script also
implies that no one touches the database
in any other way than making a database
migration script so first of all you
have an accept database and because no
one has ever touched the database schema
in there because you made a deal with
your team that no one touches that you
know that it's exactly the same on
except as production because the only
way for that code to get changed is
because through migration that you
checked in so you can be you can be
pretty sure that your migrations on
except they'll perform exactly the same
as production mmhmm yeah actually good
question now then you'll need hmm yeah
now I haven't encountered that one
before but in that case you'll need to
find some way to have a safe window to
deploy so in that case you probably
can't deploy at two in the afternoon for
those queries again if you also if
you're doing major database tree factors
that
basically aren't instant but take a
couple of our speakers you have a huge
database and you need to redo an index
or something then you might actually
want to do with that 3 a.m. on a
saturday just because you'll per your
service will probably be impacted or
maybe even have downtime all these
automation tools are no excuse to stop
using your brain so in this case if
you're doing scary things to your
database you probably know it and then
you need to take it into account no yeah
look at beds it's it's it's a bit of a
leaky abstraction in this case so again
use your brain yeah I think we're done
