you and take out a pack of smokes and
light up a cigarette right now you'd
probably think I'm crazy well for
starters you can really smoke in here
and second of course we all know how
dangerous and harmful smoking is but
these days it is common knowledge but
was it always like this
you see people didn't start smoking on a
massive scale
until after the first world war and it
was some years after the first automated
cigarette making machine was invented
and it took decades before scientists
and researchers started linking
increasing incidence of lung cancer with
smoking in 1990 in 1996 in 1963 the
Surgeon General of the United States
published a report on health and smoking
and the report stated clearly that
smoking is deadly and yet it had to take
many more decades before this knowledge
and this awareness became mainstream now
why am I telling you this
well I think we have a great example of
history repeating itself this time is
about sitting because you see for some
years now they've been scientists which
who are saying that sitting can actually
be just as harmful or even more than
smoking and so hello again my name is
Maddox Dewey and I've been a programmer
for more than 10 years now but this fact
not really important at the moment
because as you might have probably
guessed this talk won't be technical
instead I'm standing before you to tell
you how dangerous sitting can really be
so let's dive right into the first part
of the talk how sitting kills you in
2014 a book was published titled get up
the otter dr. James Levine is a
world-renowned expert on topics like
obesity sedentary behaviors
and negative effects of prolonged
sitting and this doctor is dead serious
when he says that sitting is the new
smoking and going back to smoking for a
bit so in the year 2000 researchers
wanted to illustrate to the public how
dangerous smoking really is and so they
came up with these numbers that one
cigarette smoke can cost a smoker
11 minutes of his or her life and taken
taking the whole lifespan it might mean
seven years lost now dr. Levine in his
book states that one hour of sitting can
actually cost us two hours of our lives
well when I read about this I was quite
shocked and so I did some simple math
similar to the the calculations that the
researchers did with smoking and making
some assumptions as to at what age we
usually start our careers how much time
we spend sitting etc etc I've arrived at
this rough estimate of 15 years lost due
to sitting given this assumption it is
quite shocking if it's true of course
but let's keep that number in mind as we
shall revisit it soon enough now you
might think that this whole concept this
idea that sitting can be actually
dangerous and harmful to us you know
might seem ridiculous to you because
after all sitting is a very natural
thing to us but let me ask you this
again was it always like this well now
if we just take a look at a wider
horizon here you'll see that our
ancestors and our cousins evolved for
millions of years as by pets this
creature is moving on two legs and what
was natural to us then of course upright
position and movement our bodies
actually evolved for movement of course
we did sit then but it wasn't known it
was more to take a rest after hours of
exploration hunting and a bit later
after hours of agricultural work now
what about our modern times so we can
say that around 60 or 70 years ago the
so called digital revolution started and
with it came the era of computers and
office work now it's been estimated that
not as long as in 1960s and 70s an
average worker had at least a moderate
amount of movement in his or her job so
an example here might be a person
working on a printing press or a
defector already or in a factory right
now currently it is being estimated that
more than 80% of workers actually sit on
their buttocks all day long and it's
getting worse and worse but the thing is
that it's not the jobs that are the only
problem here because let's take a look
an honest look at how our average daily
our daily life looks like so we get up
we sit down to have our breakfast we sit
down in a car on a on the bus or on a
tram while we commit to work then of
course we sit in front of our computers
but when we get back we sit in front of
our TVs when we go to a doctor what do
we usually do we look for a place to sit
down and currently it's being estimated
that on average during the day we spend
8 hours sleeping 13 hours sitting and
only 3 hours moving it is that bad so we
can try to think where this kind of a
lifestyle can lead us well in 2008 there
was this awesome animated movie
published wall-e if by any chance you
haven't watched it yet I highly
recommend it now in this movie we're
able to see a picture of society in
which people are so Abby
and the muscles are so deteriorated that
they can no longer move by themselves
now but by now you're probably wondering
what it is exactly about sitting that is
so dangerous and harmful to us well it
turns out that prolonged sitting
negatively affects both our bodies as
well as our minds let's start with the
body so in 2009 I believe there was an
article published titled sitting time
and mortality from all causes
Kaddi vascular disease and cancer this
article described a prospective study
which lasted for 12 years 12 years in
which researchers looked at the cohort
of 17,000 canadians
ages 18 to 19 and what they found is
that there is a statistically
significant correlation between how long
people sit during their average day and
their general mortality as well as the
mortality due to cardiovascular disease
which happens to be the number one cause
of death according to the list created
by the World Health Organization and the
numbers that you see here so it turns
out that during this study if a person
spent the majority of the day sitting
and let's be honest majority of most of
us here are in this group so these
people had 50% higher risk of dying
during this study but that is just an
example because studies like these have
been showing up for two or three decades
linking sedentary behaviors to a lot of
different diseases and health risks so
dr. Levine in his book even has
something that he calls an alphabet of
sitting related illnesses the list is
quite long and we won't going over all
of them I just wanted to point out a few
so naturally when we think about
prolonged sitting we might think you
know about back pain spine conditions
but that's just a start
because prolonged sitting has been
linked to problems with the blood
pressure
specifically hypertension colon cancer
diabetes type 2 diabetes and obesity you
can say a plague of our modern world has
also been linked to it
heart attack various musculoskeletal
disorders and the list goes on you know
but we are still not finished because
let's now think about what sitting can
do to our mental health and to our
brains so I believe it is also a common
knowledge that physical activity and
movement is actually good for our brains
right so it's been shown for example
than just taking a walk can actually
improve our cognitive functions and
creativity and they knew that even in
ancient times so Aristotle for example
he founded a school that was called a
peripatetic school because there was
this habit of walking back and forth
during lectures or doing some
philosophical or scientific disputes so
what happens when we sit down well for
starters we become grumpy
you probably know this phrase the grumpy
programmer or grumpy IT support guy this
might be one of the reasons that such a
phrase exists because when we sit down
we become sad we might even become angry
or depressed even and we definitely get
stressed out because the mere fact that
we are sitting causes our body to
produce more cortisol a stress hormone
and that's the reason that the majority
of us these days live in a constant
chronic stress and again dr. Levine
notices that one of the problems of our
modern world is that when we get
stressed out instead of just getting up
and going for a run we sit down and we
eat
so I hope that I was able to show you
that many of these so-called
civilization diseases can actually be
traced back to sedentary behavior
sedentary lifestyle and a prolonged
sitting now the natural question comes
to mind right is there anything that we
can do about it
in the answer is yes but before we get
to that I do have some bad news bad news
to those of you who might think that
these kind of problems don't concern you
because for example you already lead
these so-called
active life so in your leisure time you
run you do run you go to a gym you work
out regularly you play squash well the
problem is that it won't be enough even
if you do that for one hour every day it
just won't negate all those effects that
sitting causes and in order to find out
that it is actually the case let us go
back to this Canadian Fitness study that
I told you about already so what you see
here these numbers are so-called hazard
ratios so has a ratio is a term from
epidemiology and statistics which in
this context we can interpret as a
relative risk of dying depending on how
much time we spend sitting on average
and so for example the value of 1.5
means that there's a 50% higher risk of
dying and the dark at the bar the more
time the person spent sitting but what I
wanted to point out in this particular
slide is that researchers among other
things they split people into two groups
inactive and active that is those who
declared that they're physically active
in their leisure time they regularly
exercise or play some sports and if you
take a closer look at the absolute
values of hazard ratios
you will notice that the inactive group
has larger values but the problem is
that even in the active group the trend
is still there and so even if you do
lead an active life but you spent most
of your day sitting you still have 40%
higher chance or high risk of dying all
right that there's a second myth that I
wanted to do by now which is the
so-called economic chairs because
they're not they're also not the
solution to the problem the chair that
you see here Aaron has been designed and
being produced by the company Herman
Miller this chair is quite famous
because a lot of people say that it's
actually one of the most comfortable
chairs in the world and you might not
even realize that you already seen this
chair because Herman Miller seems to
like you know product placement
placement just as much as Apple does
with its MacBooks now the problem with
economic chairs is the day they weren't
really designed to be healthy they were
designed to be just comfortable and they
don't change the fact that we sit in
them and one of the major major problems
with sitting is that when we sit down in
our back our backs are supported our
core muscles our postural muscles they
simply shut down because normally they
have to stabilize our spine but when we
sit comfortably they just turn off and
we all know that muscles that are not
being used deteriorate with time now the
funny thing is that even Herman Miller
admits that there's an article that they
wrote and published in 2013 its title is
sit stand move and repeat and in this
article they write the road and try to
quote hear that the causal chain from
prolonged sitting to potential health
risk
risks exists even if a person sits in a
highly adjustable ergonomic chair so I
think you can you all agree that's
something zap you know because even a
chair manufacturer says things like
these okay but that actually brings us
closer to the actual solution which is
we simply have to move more but
throughout the whole day doing that just
in my leisure time is not enough we have
to do something about our workplaces now
you might think that our employers
should provide you know gems in our
offices and we should workout while at
work or something like that which
actually is not a bad idea in itself but
that is not something that I have in
mind currently so in order to understand
what I have in mind we have to go back
to our dr. Levine and talk a little bit
about this thing that he and other
researchers have been studying for quite
a while now
this thing is neat non-exercise activity
thermogenesis so what is this
thermogenesis thermogenesis is a set of
processes that produces heat within the
body in all warm-blooded animals and
that of course includes human and there
are basically three types of
thermogenesis one is so called
diet-induced which means that simply
after we have a meal our body starts
using generating and storing energy the
second type is exercise related of
course when we exercise we burn calories
now the third type is something that we
are interested now is the energy
expenditure due to any other activities
non exercise related these are the
things like simply walking with a dog
gardening doing the dishes even just
standing
so it is like when we take a look at the
chart of our metabolic rate it is you
know the long tail of it and dr. Levine
and others have shown that the number of
calories burned due to such trivial
activities can actually adapt to a
substantial amount and so in order to
further reinforce this idea of natural
spontaneous movement I wanted to talk
about this initiative called Blue Zones
project so a couple of years ago this
guy Dan Buettner together with National
Geographic and American National
Institute on Aging they set out to find
places on earth where people would live
significantly longer than the general
population and find out why that is and
and a few years back they managed to do
jazz that they found five such regions
for example Sardinia in Italy or Okinawa
Islands in Japan and so what they found
out is that there are nine common traits
these regions they call it power nine
and I won't again I won't be going over
all of them although I do recommend to
seek more information about this project
it's pretty cool and interesting what I
wanted to point out is what is at the
very top of the pyramid
which is this natural spontaneous
movement because you see Dan said that
he got to talk to a lot of these
centenarians that his people who got to
live to be 100 years old or even older
and there were like more than 200 of
them and he said that none of those
people actually declared that they would
do any sort of exercise at least not in
our sense of the word
instead physical activity and movement
was naturally woven into their daily
lives
so you see even though they didn't
exercise they got to live 10 years
longer than the rest of us on average
and if you remember the number at the
beginning of the presentation this rough
estimate of 15 years lost due to sitting
it seems that dr. Levine can actually be
on to something here
and so I do hope that I was able to show
the importance of this spontaneous
natural movement and that just doing
that in our leisure time just won't be
enough and so we have to do something
about our workplaces and the simplest
thing the simplest step that we can take
in the right direction is to simply
stand up because the mere act of
standing actually increases our
metabolic rate by about 30 percent our
blood flow blood circulation improves
when we stand we actually tend to you
know fidget more and all that actually
increases our need throughout the day
standing in a sense is also like a
gateway to other forms of movement and
one of what I wanted to stress here is
that this is our end goal actually
movement more movement throughout the
day but from this point forward we'll be
focusing on standing because this is the
very first step that we can take in this
direction in this right direction
and as you can see here and as you might
have probably guessed I am talking about
working in a standing position
you know height adjustable desks you
might have seen them you might have even
tried them but I would I would guess not
a lot of you work in a standing position
on the regular basis which I highly
highly recommend you to do so now but
the problem is that even if you wanted
to try this you might say that ok but my
employer doesn't provide such equipment
office for example so let me tell you a
story then so a while back I was working
for a company almost 100% of time
remotely and so I wanted to create a
nice workplace my home and because I
already knew about you know working the
standing position so I set out to find a
desk for myself but was quite
disappointed to find out that you know
these electrically adjustable desks they
cost a lot so so I kept searching and
what I eventually ended up doing
I bought the parts separately so I was
able to bring down the cost but it was
still quite expensive but after some
time I decided to change jobs and
imagine my disappointment when I had to
go back to the office because remote
work was not no longer an option for me
and they didn't have any such desks
fortunately I noticed that a couple of
colleagues are in an adjacent room they
somehow managed to work in a standing
position and their solution was so
simple yet so brilliant they had to copy
it and currently my workplace looks like
these so it is just an IKEA table hit
the shelf attached for the keyboard
right the cause of it its incomparable
to this electrically adjustable desk but
the funny thing is that I like this
solution even better than my desk at
home and I'll tell you why that is the
case so the problem with working in a
standing position is that you just won't
be able to do that all day long while
being productive and while maintaining
proper posture and that's actually not
something that researchers recommend you
don't have to stand all the time you
should be alternating positions between
sitting and standing and when you start
out with this you won't be able to stand
like for more than 10 or 15 minutes
until your legs start to hurt so you
just have to sit down but there's
but if you want you know if you need to
change the position of the desk and
adjusted heights every 20-30 minutes or
so it can be quite distracting you're
probably familiar with this state of
mind called flow or being in a zone
right it is this stay that you are so
productive and usually you have to work
on a somewhat challenging problem you
know but this state is great because you
know you don't notice anything that's
happening in the outside world you don't
notice the passive time but you are very
very productive but the problem with the
state is that it's very volatile you
know an innocent question from a
colleague might get you out of it and it
will take some time for you to get back
to it and that is the problem with
height adjustable desks but with the
IKEA do-it-yourself solution I actually
have you know two monitors one at the
top one on the bottom two keyboards in
one and wireless mouse so and so
alternating positions didn't take that
much time whatsoever and that allowed me
to you know to stay in this flow state
so I really do love this solution now if
you'd like to try building something
like that yourself with me just remind
you the parts so the IKEA table
this one's called Lac it's quite popular
I guess you know the Shelf board I
bought in a like home any home
improvement store shelf brackets a
couple of screws and you should be good
to go but what is important in all of
this regardless of the solution that you
choose for working in a standing
position you have to remember about a
couple of things one of them being that
you have to set the monitor at the
proper height so that the it's top edge
is aligned with your sight and the
keyboard should be placed so that when
you bend your arms they should be banned
at around ninety two hundred degrees and
the last but not least is that when you
are doing this kind of
Ryan's for IKEA do-it-yourself or when
you then later work in the extending
position you have to maintain proper
posture it's very important but what
does it mean actually to stand properly
what is the correct posture in order to
answer that let me turn to another book
which was really published in 2016 not
so long ago
the title is desk-bound and it's been
written by dr. Kelly Starrett
which is a Cross Fit trainer a physical
therapist who works with you know
world-class athletes weight lifters etc
and this is actually the book the book
that inspired me to actually dig deeper
into these topics and I I can't
recommend this book highly enough it was
a real eye-opener to me and there's a
lot of interesting things the doctors
direct writes about in this book and
unfortunately won't be able to go into
more detail what I wanted to focus is on
is that dr. start identified three major
problems with our modern world is so the
first one being that we simply have to
move more we have to move properly and
we have to regularly maintain our bodies
and the second point actually is related
to standing improper posture because a
proper starting position is very
important you know before you start
actually moving and so there's doctor
started spends a lot of time actually
describing what is what it means to
stand properly and instead of me telling
you about this I would like to ask you
to just stand for like two minutes and
we'll go over this bracing sequence
which is just a series of simple steps
that you know will position our body in
a healthy natural position so if you
could just please stand up for two
minutes let's do this together
alright so the first step is that we
place our feet and parallel to each
other pointing forward and we squeeze
our gluteal muscles notice our buttocks
right this causes our pelvis to actually
reset to its natural neutral position
and the other thing that we're trying to
do here is like screw our feet into the
ground outwards that causes an external
rotational force coming out of our hips
that stabilizes and positions our pelvis
even further in the second step in a
second we will take a deep breath and
ideally this should be you know through
our diaphragms and while we exhale we
will try to keep two things in mind so
one is to tighten our abdominal muscles
and the other is making sure that our
rib cage is positioned directly above
our hips okay so let's take deep breath
now and while exhaling just keep your
abdominal muscles tight and it doesn't
have to be a maximum force like 20% is
just enough in the next step we look at
their shoulders and anatomically
speaking we're doing a very similar
thing as we did with our legs we just
want to exert a rotational force in our
shoulders so let's rotate them so that
our palms point forward okay and then
the next step we pull our head back a
little so actually the end goal here is
to positioning in a straight vertical
line our ears our shoulders our hips
knees and ankles okay and now relax our
formals while maintaining this tightness
in buttocks and abdominal muscles and
that's it that is the natural healthy
position for a human body to you know to
to be standing in and so thank you yeah
you can sit down now if you want of
course after hearing so much about the
dangers of sitting like if any of you
like practice yoga it's very similar to
a sequence load to the head asana
position
it's very similar alright so that
concludes the second part of the talk in
the third part I would like to talk
about the topics these topics from a
different angle maybe from the wider
perspective because if you think about
it we we could have heard voices that
lack of movement like a physical
activity is bad for us for for a long
time now
like for example in 1996 there was
another report published by the Surgeon
General of the United States and it was
more than 30 years after the one about
smoking this one was about physical
activity and health and even then we
could read statements like these in this
report families need to waive physical
activity into their daily lives all that
health professionals should encourage
their patients to get out of their
chairs and this was more than 20 years
from now so tell me why does it seem
that we haven't yet done anything about
our workplaces why the hell do we keep
sitting in ourselves to death I can
think of a couple of reasons or excuses
if you will the first one being that's
just a lack of awareness the very same
problem as it was with smoking people
are just not well-informed enough
the second reason even if you are were
and would like to try for example this
working in the standing position you
could say that ok but my employer
doesn't provide such equipment but to
that I will say you can actually very
cheaply do a you know like a
do-it-yourself solution you can figure
it out
and also I worked for a company who had
a bunch of offices in one city and all
of those of his offices have been
equipped we were equipped with height
adjustable desks but guess how many
people worked in a standing position on
a regular
basses almost nobody so that's not all
that also not the problem not the main
problem at least and so I have this
hypothesis that there's a third issue at
play here which is simply the fear the
fear of being the weirdo and outsider
you know the fear of what others might
think of you you know someone looking at
you funny or smiling
well actually laughing at you so this is
of course just a hypothesis based on my
experience and you know talking to some
friends but I personally believe that
this is one of the major reasons that we
haven't done anything about our
workplaces yet and this is not a simple
problem to solve it would require some
kind of a cultural shift but
interestingly enough we could see how
such a shift could look like as far back
as 2007 because then the owner of the
company called Salo actually approached
dr. Levine he was a we could say he was
a fan of dr. Levine's work and so he
asked him if he could design an office
for his employees where where they could
test you know this whole neat thing to
provide you know to make it so that the
employees have more physical activity at
their workplaces and dr. Levine agreed
to do that and what followed was a two
years long experiment in which people
got to the ER to work in an environment
like these like this so not only
everyone had a height adjustable desks
at their disposal they even had
treadmills under their desks so you know
they could walk at a very slow pace
throughout the day they also had other
ideas like for example they put some
tape on the floor so they could have
walking meetings or you know if you
wanted to call someone you would just
walk around the office and the simple
ideas made it so that you know these
employees had a much more physically
active
during the day than an average office
worker
another thing that dr. Levine did is he
set up a you know hall laboratory there
in this office so he could now examine
the employees and measure the health
indicators like cholesterol levels
glucose levels etc etc and after two
years the results of this experiment no
you can say were phenomenal just take a
look at some of the benefits that they
were observed so people lost some weight
and even gained some muscle all of those
health indicators actually improved and
what was also important from the
perspective of the company employee
singing improve the productivity they
include they had increased creativity
even financial profits were improved but
this is not what means what strikes me
the most when I read read about this
experiment what struck me the most was
this increased happiness because
interesting thing happened not so long
after the experiment started people
started to have well people started to
become more active not only at work but
also their homes so suddenly had this
they had this energy to spend more time
with their families to play with their
kids and to pursue their goals and
dreams for which they didn't have energy
before they were simply happier and
don't you think this is something worth
fighting for
I deeply believe so and so that dr.
James Levine just take a look at this
quote from his book at a personal
workplace a national level a cheerless
Revolution a national uprising of human
movement will improve productivity and
generate revenue better health clean air
and enhanced happiness however the sad
thing about this is that
this experiment took place more than ten
years ago and apparently this kind of
ideas you know for modern workplaces are
being implemented in more and more
companies that these in the US but by no
means it is mainstream and so I think
that this revolution is just not
happening fast enough for my sake your
sake as well as sake of our children and
when I was thinking about this an idea
for a project popped into my head
this project has it has a name now and I
wanted to tell you about it it's called
stand it up
you see I think now actually I believe
that dr. Levine is right that we are at
the verge of a revolution that will
change our workplaces how we work I also
believe that in order to speed up this
revolution to kick-start it is to start
with our industry IT why do I think so
well I think all of you are aware of how
you know job market looks like currently
for in the IT industry especially for
programmers but not only for them you
know employers have a really hard time
finding experienced specialists and so
they're actually willing to do quite a
lot in order to attract talent and
retain it hence these no so-called
benefits but I do have an appeal to the
employers instead of providing us

consoles why don't you organize mini
gyms
instead of providing us free soda and
sweets why don't you you know finance
height adjustable desks or at least
reimburse us for our do-it-yourself
solution I would even go so far as to
say that we should work less of course
earning the same amount of money let's
say seven hours instead of eight what
about this one hour well we could use
this hour for things like simple
sticks stretching practicing yoga
ideally these activities would be spread
out throughout the day in order to you
know keep the neat levels high and yes
you heard me right I argue that we
should work less sit less move more and
the same amount of money or even more in
other words I say we should stand up for
ourselves because in the end this is our
health on the line here and let's be
honest here your employer doesn't care
about your health at least not in the
long term because the brutal truth is
that we are all expendable but there's a
bit of irony here because these
companies may not realize that they
might be losing out by not providing us
you know these let's call them benefits
which I think we should be you know
asking for or demanding even because
there's this opportunity cost that they
pay which is about not realizing the
full potential of the workforce as the
silo experiment demonstrated all right
so a few few more words about the
project itself so there are three main
goals for it so one is to simply raise
the awareness by doing simple things
like you know posting links to
interesting articles about this and such
but I think also and what is even more
important by talking about this and
sharing this idea directly by going to
meetups and conferences the very thing
that I'm doing right now the second goal
is to facilitate this cultural shift and
I believe in order to do that we have to
also reach out to the employers and
educate also them and you know so that
they can see that is actually a win-win
situation here and it doesn't have to be
expensive and the third thing you know
it's about uniting us by providing a
platform whether online or in real life
where we can meet discuss er our
experiences
and share our ideas you know for
bringing more activity into our
sedentary workplaces as we are nearing
the end of the presentation I wanted to
tell you why am I even doing all this
what is my motivation here so I've been
passionate about computers since I can
remember
I think I've been I was seven or eight
when I wrote my first program in basic
on a Commodore 64 and I think that even
then I knew what I wanted to become in
the future I wanted to become a
programmer and so I did become one and
with that came countless hours of coding
not only at my job but also after it
because for a geek like me there was
always you know a new shiny technology
or framework or an interesting side
project to develop and all of those
hours coding spent sitting of course
after that the fact that I was also a
smoker for many many years and if you
remember the estimate from the beginning
about years of life lost you to smoking
and sitting i wonder how is it that i'm
still standing here before you
but anyway over the 10 years or so of my
career i experienced these three times I
experienced let's call them breakdowns
nervous breakdown so episodes where I
was totally demotivated depressed even
and hopefully I was able to the got
myself out of this mostly due to the
help my close ones for which I'm very
grateful but the problem was that
shortly after I always reverted back to
the old behaviors you might have heard
that apparently it was Einstein who said
that the definition of insanity is doing
the same thing over and over again and
expecting different results so according
to this definition I was insane now see
the human body is a marvelous machine
marvelous because it can endure and
sustain ease and
years of abuse but it will break
eventually
and my body was giving me signals and
was telling me that I was doing
something wrong but I just didn't listen
well at least not until this last
breakdown which was really not so long
ago because I think that I finally
realized something you know if switch
flipped into my in mind in my head and I
finally realized that if I want to you
know keep doing what I love which is
coding and I want to keep my career path
then I have to take care of my body I
have to quit smoking I have to start
moving more and now I also believe that
it is equally important for me to quit
sitting to stand up alright so I told
you a story about myself but was it only
my story because when I think about it a
parable comes to mind you know about
this boiling frog so apparently when you
take a living frog and throw it into
boiling water the Frog will just jump
out of it but if you put it into coal in
a cold water and start to slowly heat it
up the Frog won't notice the steadily
increasing temperature and we'll just
get cooked to death so let me leave you
with a question that I think we should
be asking ourselves could it be that we
are all such frogs - thank you do you
have any questions yes
mm-hmm
mm-hmm all right so the question is you
know about the situation where you
actually try to stand and you feel
exhausted or tired from from standing so
I believe that you have to start slowly
and build up from there and you know
wait a bit until your body adapts
because as I mentioned before like when
you start start out you won't be able to
stand for an hour or two right let alone
two hours so I think that's that's why
it's important to be able to alternate
between positions as soon as you feel
that your legs hurt for example you just
switch to two sitting and all the time
this proportion will shift for me it
took like a month for example of doing
that and currently I work like 50 50 or
60 percent for standing forty percent
for for sitting so I don't know about
your particular case whether you try to
stand from the get-go for an ex for
extended periods of time
I would I would suggest to start slowly
and build it up and for me at least I
can even for my experience I felt more
energized after some time yes
yes so the question is can you actually
be keep being productive and be like
being focused yeah while standing just
as you are when sitting so not at first
but I was you know after reading these
books and research papers I was highly
motivated to try it and at first it was
actually a problem especially when it
comes to programming tasks like
answering emails or writing some
documentation that's that's fine but
programming actually was a problem at
first but I'd say after three weeks or a
month I can be as productive as when I'm
sitting and also you mentioned
meditation but keep in mind that when
you meditate you actually sit
differently yeah and actually you can
sit in a better way which is like on a
chair without the support if you sit
with your back straight or on the ball
gym gymnastics ball it is all about
activating your postural muscles it's
not that sitting comes with a different
problems like for example shortening
some some muscles like if you keep
constantly sitting in this position but
at least your postural muscles do work
mm-hmm
you mean yeah like a Japan seat yes
mm-hmm
yeah like a lotus position or the
crossed legs position mm-hmm
yeah thanks for pointing it out mm-hmm
there was a question back then
really
yes that's actually yeah very very good
catch
so what he's saying is about this
diagram yeah yeah so we have a 0.92 so
yeah actually standing is not a silver
bullet
you have to alternate it's not like you
have to switch standing all the time you
know but people who work while standing
all the time also have their their
problems right so you have to strike a
balance here this is very good
observation and an interesting fact
about getting thank you yes please
so dr. dr. start actually in this book
mention say like half sitting half lying
position like you know when you lean
back but he argues that it is it is not
so bad position for the spine and for
your body when it comes to the tension
for example but he wouldn't recommend
that for for work rather for rest
because you still your muscles are not
activated here so I would imagine that
this argument would stand that you're
still well you keep still
you're not moving that's one of the
problems because remember the end we
always to have more movement and also
you don't have to activate your postural
muscles but this position puts less
stress on your spine than sitting
upright okay yes that's it thank you
very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
