know like a Jedi like that box has
everyone got a bear who wants a bear got
a bear I have an alcoholic beverage if
some if someone if someone who if
someone could go and grab a whole bunch
of crates of beers and just put them
around here so if anyone wants another
beer they can have one that will be
awesome so welcome to the closing
keynote of DevOps Belgium you made it so
here doing the Java Council keno is
myself so I'm the maple I'm a developer
advocate for zero turn around and the
founder of the virtual jug hi I'm Martin
verburg some of you will know me as a
diabolical developer I run a small
company called J clarity I'm Tricia gee
I'm a Java one of my java champion
developer advocate I work for jetbrains
and do that really crappy ide first shot
fired food and we're sponsors to I won't
hear that Martin because IntelliJ is the
best theme that Eclipse has ever had and
I'm so happy to be here this year too
because I had to miss it last year
because I was giving birth at the time
which is why I have to wear the stupid
row because I had this for a whole year
and never wore it because I couldn't
come to any conferences that's a bitter
excuse and a dog ate your homework yeah
I know it's pretty good and I'm kind of
an odd on Emmanuel Ghana I'm appreciated
and sometimes ate it for the hibernate
stuff I guess but I'm also doing a
French podcast they Cascada so if you
sort of understand French there you go
one one guy one I say we don't want a
French person in the audience he
represents a yeah the tide is it that
appreciated it huh it was it though
tonight yeah oh who are they here today
so who hates hibernate listen for the
next people didn't hear the question
this is the man you want to lunch okay
so first of all the beers
sponsored by the virtual joke lots of
beers from the virtual job if you're not
a virtual jog member virtual joining
here yeah that's right don't start your
PA if you're not a virtual jog member
can you please go out and put your beer
back or go to virtual job calm and join
our amazing online community that there
are real beers normally their virtual
beers but today they're real so so first
of all we're going to start off this a
little bit differently to normal and
this is actually something that's very
very sad that happened recently a very
very good friend of the community passed
away very very recently Daniel de
Oliveira and for those of you who knew
him you'll know what a genuine man a
friend and an amazing person for the
java community he was and today during
this closing keynote we're going to
honor his life by giving him a standing
applause and in the in this kind of
happened in the UK and some of the some
of the sports venues and whereby
normally a standing a one-minute silence
is noticed for for so many passes away
in the UK we tend to do one minute's
applause which is more about the
celebration of someone's life and Daniel
dalla Vera was the kind of person who
has led such an amazing life that there
is so much to celebrate in his life so
we have a slide deck courtesy of Bruno
Souza from from from Brazil who's that
who's a good friend of Daniels and if I
could all you ask you to please stand
and join me in celebrating dine at
olivarez life thank you thank you very
much and for those of you who do have
any additional money that you have spare
we don't want Daniels legacy to go away
since he's left us so Daniel Oliveira
org is the website you can go to donate
some money helped you know provide a
longevity to his memory and also help
his his you know his wife Lucy who is in
obviously a very very tough place right
now so so yeah cheers to cheers are done
okay so Trish thanks for giving me to
follow up to that yes okay moving
swiftly on I'm devix 2016 is almost over
apparently I feel like I've only been
here three minutes what happened like
all the content has been and gone
already and any notes that you put in
our country because I don't have any
glasses on so at the end of this
conference we had all this great
material all these great speakers and
all this stuff that we've that we've
experienced what have we learnt from
this conference well there's been a big
theme around machine learning and robots
are going to just get us you know
anytime soon now but we've seen in the
keynote that they still have a little
bit of way to go so let's try and see if
we can do the reverse Turing test and
see if a human can pass as a robot and
see how that goes right stir so if you
guys who has at the opening keynote okay
yeah so this is what's on this is Alexa
and so the Amazon echo Alexa and this is
what's the name of the robot Peter
pepper so high
and i'm i'm lucas and i'm going to try
to make this one walk and ask him a
question hi okay hi hi okay hi what is
it hi what is devoxx devoxx what well
that's the point what is devoxx let me
ask my friend Watson devoxx what well
DevOps is a conference which is over 15
years old it started in Belgium and was
called Java plus it is now a global
conference in the u.s. in France in
Morocco in the UK in Poland so you got
the answer give Hawks conference yes yes
that is good for us big round of
applause hi okay let's make it a bit
more difficult so we're going to have
this robot talking to Alexa which is
going to talk to Watson so high what is
the next president of the United States
hi yeah okay what is that's the accident
you know the French accent it's training
what is the president of the United
States ok the sky United president state
United
now no yeah that makes sense right okay
so what do you think do we pass the
investor in tests or do we not do we
still have a little way to go again I
think Elon Musk and Bill Gates 7 you got
nothing to worry about we're okay i'm
going to take get rid of this robe you
Darth Trish oh my God look oracle Darth
Trish love it well suppose suppose to be
on this slide a time that's music let's
turn that music up how's our church oh
my god that lady mean one thing it must
mean that man reinhold is going to come
up on the stage
yeah just given up already everyone
asked a question no this is silly you go
mark hoppity chip will ask about you
sure so as is traditional every year we
haul some poor and expecting or maybe
slightly expecting her oracle employee
who yeah yeah we have a microphone now
he on every year we grab some poor
unsuspecting oracle employee who's
extremely close to java and we asked
them the deep and meaningful questions
the very difficult ones so i'm going to
start with the first question mark you
come from the California region would
that be correct so the the Republic of
California you hit a hare fest so it's
the the sixth largest economy in the
world is a seventh right now I hate
citrus just wait till Brad set Britain
kicks off yeah will be taken taken at
number six spot so we're going to ask
these question what's what's the best
vintage that has come out of the
California wine region and your humble
opinion marlena you sure you want to
start this tough this is a tough
interview it is a tough interview I'm
starting with you know easing into a non
Java related question ravanelli drakey
Dry Creek Zinfandel the best recent
vintage I just had some 2011 was
excellent fantastic it was supposed to
be a 2008 but it slipped three years
you're not going to come one next I can
see it in your eyes this is why we can't
have nice things Simon I know this is
moving on to the topic of Dukes or so
I've played it I've played a round of it
I think it's fantastic I've worked
through a book an early access book from
O'Reilly by Paul Becker if he's here in
the crowd and then whirs colleagues so
I've instantly seen seen the value of it
one of the concerns that myself and
colleagues and the london java community
have spoken about is kind of the fear
that framework and library authors in
particular will will lag in terms of
modernizing their popular frameworks and
libraries so that we can all take
advantage of the new capabilities is
there something that Oracle perhaps is
planning to do an educational front I
find your lack of theatre answer what
all it is this something I or we're a
quiver is worried about no I so partly
part of a whole whole design is driven
by the knowledge that not everybody's
going to migrate at once right if we
designed a module system like that it
would be stupid nobody would use it so
just as with generics you could migrate
your own code without having to wait for
libraries that you use to migrate the
generics the same is true with the model
system so there's this migration story
if you have an existing system button
jar files you can migrate from the top
down you can Michael my great from the
bottom up if you know when your when
your library suppliers migrate you can
take advantage of that but you don't in
most in many cases need to wait for them
so you know yeah there's a learning
curve here and we certainly don't it
don't expect everybody to adopt it right
away you've got to go learn some stuff
and understand the benefits to get
motivated to do it but no I wouldn't say
we're particularly worried you know it
will not be the case that it gets
adopted as quickly
say lambdas because the lambdas are kind
of a point feature you can you can
leverage leverage them really well in
the small you don't need to make a lot
of big changes models are a very
different kind of Beast yeah it's okay
if it takes a few years yes yuko system
to get there fair enough I'm going to
take a quick straw poll actually who
here in the audience has somehow
modularized at either through maven
modules osgi jboss modules or some other
similar homegrown system and you get a
raise our hands okay so i think the
incentive is already there which is a
good sign so thank you that's quite good
so on to the next question um actually
they could it going to make one white
one more point on that one go ahead is
another speaker at this conference today
made the assertion that at Jabba 9 and
later that you will pretty much have to
modularize your applications and your
code and I'm sorry that's not true if
you want to if you want to stay on the
classpath you can be a happy happy
camper for the next 20 years yes a java
supporting backwards compatibility for
20-odd years 20 more 29 long long past
me long pass my death so I had your over
11 as we might that's probably 10 10 so
I have here some plans which looks
suspiciously like the Death Star plans
but actually there's a ventilator shaft
there is that's dense value types I
think so a lot of Java developers died
to get this information a great cost to
the rebellion authority or that so we're
quite happy with what we've seen in the
future there's things like value types
is the aot coming into java 9 and being
in how its further on but there is one
concern we have we see the Builder
pattern being applied to a new core
library class called wall could you
comment on that is that named after dick
wall quite possibly yes hmm so yeah I
guess I have heard a bit about a certain
somebody somebody thinks that what we
need to make Java grade again so we're
going to be long run
that is what we're seeing but Jonathan
Segal great could make it great again
and if I may say so frankly the United
States is still great and does not need
to be made great again we just just
wanted to know who's going to pay for
these world-class you know sorry who's
going to pay for the world plan
implementation I'm sure you can
eventually find it in some you know some
jar file on maven central first code on
github operations and never nobody's way
to pay for it you know it's open source
it's free actually our Passover two da
fresh me I think you had some questions
about mentoring oh yes I don't have my
notes yeah I wanted to talk to I wanted
to ask you some questions around your
career I think we talked a bit about
them laughter I've got my resume right
oh great what are you job I kind of like
my job just check-in you hit heard of
here first um I keep confusing myself
it's the wine I mean beer salvisa
Belgian yes so what kind of made you
want to get into technology did you want
to what you just kind of accidentally
fall into this thing um Legos Lego
figures by your children League oh yes
of it well you know I bought my
daughter's daughter Legos but she's not
doing the same thing totally okay no I
lifelong fascination since being a kid
with building stuff you know and of
course when you're a kid well well when
your kid now you can do suffer Akane you
know when when I was a kid quite a while
ago you know computers were these large
things in data centers there there were
no pcs even the asana this was a while
ago see the gray hair um so you built
physical things and that's what I did
for a long time and that eventually
around about middle school got to start
playing with computers and it's like oh
this is this is Lego on steroids and
it's all virtual and I can you know it's
very plastic and you can kind of do
whatever you want to explore this whole
universe and that's how i got into
software did you find what i like
role models of people whose books you
read or people who like had opinions who
inspired you to come into it or was it
more just from the joy of building I i
would say at first it was it was more it
was more the joy of building as time
went on of course you know i developed
my own heroes i remember in high school
saving my allowance for a while and then
making a pilgrimage this is my family
and I lived outside of Philadelphia
making a pilgrimage on the train into
the city to the big bookstore and laying
down my money to buy volumes 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 of
canoes I'm carrying them home I was very
proud thanks very good and that's right
i still haven't read all the way through
all of them so the knowledge is going to
be in your brain at some point right for
a while falls out that's why I've got
all these books on my kindle because if
I carry my Kindle around the knowledge
will end up in my brain yeah that's how
it works right so Glos it was it is that
what this Jack just plugged straight in
this you're reading be on East rocks
books yeah so it so mark I hate to I
hate to pull the top Oracle engineer
leader off stage on a keynote but I
think it's that that seems to be what's
happened over the last couple of years
it's cool i'm used to it so we can we
give a big round of applause mark great
sport and and without mark and Brian and
his team and their teams java really
wouldn't be where they are today so big
thanks to them so let's hit a bit about
you we've introduced ourselves we've
talked to mark let's talk about which
java versions your guys are on let's
embarrass people who is using and look
mark is almost straining his neck to see
to see who's gonna be on which versions
who is using the latest and greatest
java 90 some people brave you are you
brave brave people who's using it in
production get out don't do that it's
called an early access build fear
reason who's using who's on Java 8 who
is not on Java right wow that's pretty
good all right let's name in shame who's
on Java 7 java 6 mm it's almost more on
sixth and seven are we done to the ones
yep no java 50 nobody no one due to
their this guy's got two hands up he's
really proud to be undone he's like he'd
got generic schnitzel you need yeah
whispers why why why go forward when
you've got you know it another one point
for less than 1.4 who's working in
defense you're gonna have to shout but
the 1.6 people I are you android
developers yeah everything sorry you
chose the dark side you get what you
deserve let's talk about who you are in
terms of where you're from and I know
Belgium is in Europe but specifically
Belgium let's have a cheer who's from
Belgium not that one too yeah exactly
who is from and be brave don't be
embarrassed who's from North America you
can stay you don't have to go back yeah
it's okay Belgium's a beautiful place we

step on you need to work on this year
yeah Australia oh that's right you know
baby I personally that you decided to
stay home from Africa stand up butter
that won't give battle round new job a
champion butter see a stiff arm some
work some work to do on Geo I'm fairly
certain the Stephan's planning like
devoxx everywhere everywhere deluxe moon
not just me I think it rocks Mars with
Elon Musk I'm on the run slightly it's
under NDA right now we mentioned we
touched a couple of political things
here brexit and North America whatever
is happening there but there's a reason
why this is happening do you know why
Breck's it happened I don't want to
offer anything who knows why breaks it
happened shout out Antonio is so much
annoyance it does in kearney and I need
to talk seriously to my British friends

things might happen in the future Wow
he is a bastard is he a prophet what
happened earlier this week tonight
American people are voting for either
Trump of Hillary so if I go and say
maybe vote for Trump you've done it
again last time you wore a hat as well
yeah but of them if I say vote for Trump

the opposite thing that they might go to
ilary maybe so if you really want
someone to blame not that I'm ya know

talk about speed dating that's what I'm
this one you can tell we're all
professionals here oh we need to be
professional you're you're remembering
the times when we used to sit in the pub
and I used to drink red wine and I used
to talk about my dating woes but let's
not talk about that we're going to drink
please sure we're doing crispy dating
we're so we're going to talk about we're
not going to match you up with a new
career some of you might be disappointed
about that and we are going to do like
two minute interviews with respected
people in the community or failing that
people we can find in the audience
that's more like and we were not going
to say who's who oh yes exactly point
out and we're going to do a few quick
questions like we did with Mark about
like how you got where you are today
we're going to assume that you're happy
with what you've got today so and yes
how many of these are going to do and do
well until we're done I guess yeah we
have 19 minutes left so until we see the
audience right slide slide Roscoe run
the audience and pick someone yes please
okay pick the random victim bad idea
where you are is guilty yo he's gonna be
on the front row he's got one row deck
oh yeah Simon yeah two minutes and over
time when the buzzer goes off so do you
right before i start i said i do need to
correct somebody on something was mark
yes it's not Legos Lego is a plural
tantum therefore it's like saying sheeps
and they go spot the grammar nazi i'm so
glad you did pair it's so nice having
english people on the stage only we
won't be allowed to travel here soon
because there'll be a wall around
England as well anyway what about brexit
no I'm how did you get started why are
you in technology well I mean technology
oh that was my dad yeah okay definitely
my dad who got me into it because he he
was into technology and so he bought our
first home computer which was a trs-80
anybody remember that oh good okay
excellent yeah 16 kilobytes of RAM it's
all the technology yes and did you start
programming it because you wanted to
program gates like most people or yes I
suppose I did yes yes you would have
been games but of course it didn't
really have graphics so it was more kind
of like adventure games you know text
type thing I love those ones go north
I've got no idea what you're talking
about because I hammer hit the door drop
hammer yeah exactly anybody can robot
yes actly technology hasn't come that
far really what we can put Watson behind
it down so you can say no I don't know
did you have any role models and like
kind of encourage you or like either one
on one or just people you kind of looked
up to an admired so much yeah actually I
suppose I suppose it would have been
like the sort of not right at the very
beginning but sort of as I started my
career it would have been the people at
build apps so like Dennis Ritchie ken
Thompson brian kernighan those those
people yeah did that evolve over time as
you kind of like learn more or do you
just kind of gather role models like you
know come on yeah yeah just to a
gathering along the way yes yeah so
James would have been james gosling but
i mean you know
another one I don't remember what the
other questions you asked favorite wine
from the English wine region and you've
got a top mark I mean really this is
yellow know your synth Amelia yeah any
other questions I had like five
questions what were they that wasn't one
thanks for that and your opinion was
working I'll save you I my opinion okay
yeah I just say one more thing actually
the ropes that you were wearing yeah not
so much Jedi more kind of like the
little Ewok yeah that's what that's what
we going for it there's a Krait someone
else someone else someone else big thank
you to Simon thank you right now working
for grammar calm there you go my friend
all right Wow whoa yeah there's lots of
right right i know it's quite cool
though because you can't see the
audience you can just kind of pretend
yeah okay it's like not intimidating at
all right because the thing is they're
all sat in those aren't is going
entertain me these are there this is
additional right yeah this is just so
that you can kind of like half of your
eyes following something while you drink
the better that's 20 seconds oh we
already saw how did you get started in
technology or why I was really young my
father actually a working selling
computers so he actually had a chance to
get a 286 back to the house and that's
all I started to play with computers
this question is basically like how old
are you right you did you know I keep it
quite I know it was basically I was
writing basic very cool and did you have
any role models as you're coming into
this or like any physical people Robin
like so so why start a I was in a grew
up in Taiwan and it was really just me
and the computer and there was nothing
else yeah and I had to read books like I
didn't know anyone I didn't really know
anyone that's in the technology field
back then and that you have to read
books really I don't remember anything i
read i just know i didn't even read
English at a time by
have to type all the letters in alphabet
right so so that's the first time I
learn how to type and I don't know who
actually wrote the book to be honest
yeah but whoever wrote a book in Chinese
was the person who I i'll be venga yeah
yeah yeah I have no idea maybe big cats
abilities dominium varied unbound yeah
did over time as you kind of your career
grew and you came to conferences and met
people and stuff did you kind of
accumulate role models like pokemon or
you know or am because I think a lot of
us our kind of self-taught or did you
just kind of like depend upon your own
um your own experiences stag or floor
MLB didn't because one first are they
there was no internet so I really had to
just read but then I think that I
somehow got into java I don't know what
before job I was pearl so I was doing a
lot of variety opera it's only that only
unsafe dynamically like yeah there we go
thanks very grand place right by the way
I don't know many years from now
somebody's going to say on stage you
know I started with minecraft think
about it'll be good Catherine don't you
worry cause I think there's like three
people out there yeah unless the lights
make it difficult to see anyone it's
fine okay okay i might have to change up
some of these questions now because now
everyone's heard the questions in
advance no it's fine don't worry ask the
hard questions then ask the hard
questions like where do you see yourself
in five years time I don't know like
where does Mark see himself in five
years time probably still trying to get
jigsaw out the door
I'm sorry brutal he's not even on stage
anyway moving swiftly on hello introduce
yourself please hello I'm Catherine
Beaumont I work for boxed excellent um
and so how did you get into technology
programming specifically I guess so my
older brother Ben he was doing those of
qbasic games pretty much the adventure
games like pick up the hammer go to a
goblin yeah and from it kind of grew
from there and then I didn't do anything
for about maybe 15 years do technology I
went to this kind of technology void was
like no I'm going to study maths and
kind of ignore everything and then I
needed a job as so often happens you
heard it here first mathematicians can't
find jobs and and actually I I try to be
a lawyer and then funding issues money
self-funding horrible it's not the fact
that you met some lawyers and decided no
you can with Oracle no cool thing Trish
is on a road is the winos are down oh
I'm so sorry it's because i miss devoxx
last year I've got like two lots of
jokes okay so you have in a lawyer but
you decided it's too expensive pretty
much I was working like three jobs at
one point I drivin in the Cure shop when
things are really bad and then a
restaurant leavings and then a chocolate
shop where if you drop to the chocolates
you couldn't sell them to the customers
oh did you put on a lot of weight I
would have done chocolate drop that
thank you mine and and then I thought
you know I really enjoyed ha we'll never
know
about that thank you very much I'm so
sorry Simon is going to become the most
unpopular MC on the play I am a little
bit so complete now I don't know it's
still paying yeah OCD people live with
it so I don't know if you guys know but
there is something called Java champions
and from the outside looks kind of a
sect so I know there is a few here so
please come on stage and we're going to
discuss about what you guys aren't even
doing come on stage jump Italian logon
KO lan coming out of the woodwork it's
almost like wow I'm getting a problem
the first stage is acceptance it's like
an a a meeting and also lesson by
Cassandra up on stage cassandra is the
job champion program coordinator and
she's amazing yeah totally where the
ladle with a little question is what is
a java champion for jello champion okay
no that's kind of self reference okay if
I well so I don't want to answer this
one because I've got the second mic for
anyone oh no someone who likes basically
bashing Oracle I guess not that's you
cook yeah someone that's involved with
the community that loves Java and wants
to make things a better place somebody
who just champions the Java and I'll
talk all good things bad things about it
and really passionately believe in it
it's someone who work daily Java and try
to improve it every day okay all right
someone who passionately cares about
Java wants to do right by it for the
whole world okay yeah we're good we're
going to do a actually we're going to
sampling because you guys are kind of
you know a lot but you're special case
because your microsoft MVP and a java
sumption what the heck
traitor it happens happen so we know we
know Java is better but how much better
if you do have the experience on both
sides so okay in fact I'm a MVP on Azure
because I helped at Microsoft to Butte
their java support on the azure platform
so that's why they gave me the time for
two so I'm all for java I'm just helping
other people that didn't like that much
java okay keep using it okay it's a
different world okay so what do java
champions do or supposed to do we spend
a lot of time emailing people yes and
moaning about things so mating each
other or emailing also the outside world
no in all seriousness though so in 2017
the java champions program is going to
engage in a year-long initiative every
week we're going to pick a different
topic to champion java and it might be
something long lines of submitting pull
requests from just about every java
champion into some random java an
unsuspecting java project all the way to
doing things like running gear box for
kids Java tutorials and they're in their
home towns and cities so if you would
like to get involved in actually instead
of talking about doing suffer Java
actually practically doing something for
java and then would love for you to come
and join us and start tapping some of
these issues we have in our ecosystem
well you've got something you specific
come on it's getting a slower for us but
it's getting ugly and or if you've got a
particular thing you want us to campaign
for that you think is really important
than do let us know because you know
more is like this 52 weeks next year I
think job has been a kind of a sharing
community very much from the get-go in a
very chaotic way I guess like like any
community so in some ways you're kind of
trying to keep the momentum pushing is
that how you see yourself for ya very
very much so I think so certainly in
terms of things like you know where java
ee stalls briefly i think java champions
community was one of many communities
who came together to help
that forwards that means another example
I think Java rate the the some of the
testing and efforts around Java right to
help get it out the door was partly done
by the Java tendons and then pushing it
out and helping out with the testing
effort in particular and would like to
see that the first thing we're actually
going to work on week one will be Java
nine testing so we're going to encourage
ourselves and everyone here and everyone
in the broader ecosystem to take Java
nine for a test run and give all the
feedbacks those poor unsuspecting Oracle
engineers and other engineers who are
working on OpenJDK and submit a million
bug reports yeah because every engineer
loves to have like a flood of bug
reports coming from users so this is
very important there is I think too few
people you know pounding on Java nine
and yeah it's sometimes a bit of rocky
situation but they listen to the input
and they go for it maybe one last well
what altered the one last question at
six okay go to me when I want to involve
Cassandra if we can get the mic to
Cassandra so she was trying to hurt I
saw her in the corner of my eye so
Cassandra if people want to know more
about what who the java champions are
how they can get involved towards java
champions help job champions get java
champions to help their communities
where will people where do people need
to go to get more information about java
community so the URL the exact URL is
escaping me but if you go to community
to oracle com and then search on java
champions we do have an external facing
space that will have you know we're
going to we are going to start doing a
weekly blog that kind of correlates all
the content that the Jaycees are doing
every week and then we're also going to
the various initiatives that come out
we're going to have information there as
well awesome thank you very much there
is actually also an official Twitter
account for the java champions is called
Java underscore champions because you
might have seen or this Java champion
all together that's not the right one
and a tenancy is different as created a
website where we reference the Java
champions and
ended jugs in the world so whenever when
you're somewhere you can have a look and
just see if you know the URL by art box
com it's all Vox com so there you can
find a map and you can see all the Java

Java events see and that tracks people
