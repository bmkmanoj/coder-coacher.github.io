so I have a nap Heidi jacket cool so
most what I do and most of my show in
this talk is motivation so I talked
about how people get motivated to hack
application and what they do so one of
the examples were a very knowing simple
by now which is hoping on go everyone's
playing pokemon go and some people
didn't want to play it the way it should
be played the premise of Pokemon go is
he walking around you catch Pikachu what
amuses found was that they didn't have
to work at old and they could still
catch Pikachu they managed to hack the
application and get a physical server
from now they build little arrows inside
the application where we can move around
without actually moving around so you
can move around the game without
actually moving around so obviously the
the motivation here was to try and catch
broken line but I also use a great
example which is a favorite of mine
which is here so someone managed to hack
an application to get free big how did
they do that so what they did was they
found out there was a lawyer of the
application but every single time they
went to a pub or the winter about in a
problem they would get a stamp on the
application okay they found out how the
stamping process works and everything
and how the application communicates the
service when the application
communicates the service they managed to
get hold or borders information and now
they could replicate it with that they
would get some on the application and
every five fam they would get a trivia
and they managed to get many many beers
with it the developer who actually had
disappeared so he's not being blogging
about being do anything so i think it's
just rincon via right now and so anybody
who wants to try and get themselves to
be there how do you go about okay and
how do you start looking at the
vulnerabilities in earth yeah I can kill
them you should start with your mat so
my being sense of myself doesn't feel
like get people to become hackers like i
am not a hacker myself
and I say this very clearly I'm not
asking myself what I was trying to do
was trying to learn how hard to think in
more heart disease actually hike
application I mobile developer and I
don't want people to break into my
application so my motivation was like I
want to see what they do and if I
learned that then I can maybe show some
other people how to do it so I'm not
trying to show people exactly how to
hack but I'm trying to show people how
can not be hot and the best way I found
to do it was going to my own
applications trying find vulnerabilities
there are many many websites there are
many things on the internet that showing
you how to find one religious and I also
run a website that shows you how to like
stop parking your own obligations so
it's really in order to increase your
Institute yeah it's basically hockey for
your own good so they want to say your
own benefit is you I don't want people
to feel like they're hacking because
they want to get something out of it
it's their Hawking their own application
so no one else yes the benefits of their
office ya ain't penetration yeah pretty
much yeah pretty much so I talked about
ways in which you can secure an
application I talked about raising age
we can steal information from
application and things you can do so
these information doesn't get felon what
are they kind of changes that issue
consider when you're looking to give you
act maybe like a clean my son durable
areas ah the most honorable Hines is
having key so was in your application
like authentication key for example to
those in your application that in
midlife for device yeah because this is
the this the biggest difference between
websites and mobile devices on websites
websites are running on a server mobile
applications they're running on the
device so it's in your hands everything
is there so if you know how to get
access to it then then you will if you
want to so storing T in application is
like the biggest nono ever so just try
not to throw in a case there are ways
you can go around it such as like
storing kids on a server sorry kids on
different places but don't have them
inside the application the other thing I
thought about it make sure your
chriskate a cold so if someone is to get
access to your toes and someone is to
compile your code they shouldn't be able
to just read it and this is one that
it's super common and most people say
when I tell them they go like I have
this is obvious and then you go look at
the code and it's not appreciated so
this is like a big one for me like just
make sure that your soul is not
vulnerable make sure that your cells is
unreadable it should be readable by
youth but not readable by anyone else
that they compiled your affirmation okay
so we've got never stuff of the keys on
your ass and make the obfuscated Yoko
yeah and the only other kind of major
point is so I always tell people Hawk
yourself trying hack itself Thursday
just try and break into your foes as
much as you can photography when you're
building something in when you're
thinking about secy you're thinking
about the happy path try not to think
about the happy path try to see yourself
in the shoes of a hacker and think about
what they would do and like I said there
are so many resources out there I show
you what hockey's can actually be so
packet oh please goodbye yeah if you're
buzzing it's great there is it that our
websites and it's lights out there
because I always fight and i'm testing
something that you don't always see a
completely you things in the way you
expect them to you how anyone do that
that's reason and someone always does it
oh yeah absolutely yeah so I think this
is um this is a great thing about like
quality assurance people liked having
key way inside the thing having to wait
working with you because as developers
we always tend to think about yeah this
is how it's going to work and it's so
great and no one's going to enter like a
weird symbol where there should be only
less is no one's going to do it expects
that people are going to do it and use
it as a great like sometimes they're not
going to do it maliciously sometimes
they will just do it so having my
quality assurance inside the thing is
very important to me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
