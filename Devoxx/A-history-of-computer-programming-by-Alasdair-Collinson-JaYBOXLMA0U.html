like to welcome to Fox Vienna I'm sure
we'll have a great conference
my name is Alistair Collinson and I'm
going to be talking about the history of
programming or rather a history of
programming there's a lot to lock look
at and I selected a few topics so that I
would like to present today there's a
lot I couldn't fit into this
presentation so please don't be mad if I
leave out your favorite programming
languages working sorry for that there
we go
okay so a few words about me as I said
my name is Alastair Collinson I'm a
software developer for Z anakata
technologies by the way we have an
office here in Vienna and we're hiring
so if you're looking for a job
check us out I own many nerdy t-shirts
and I like to look at computer history
this led me to this talk and I've
structured it in the following way so
first I'll go into what what we could
call ancient computing history the
beginnings of programming then we'll
look at some of the early computers and
programming languages what I call the
Golden Age of programming languages the
rise of modern programming languages and
finally the future I'm not going to talk
about drones but some other interesting
things okay the beginnings programming
has a longer history than many of you
may realize computer science of course
is a very young science and computer
science is linked to the history of
computers is linked to the history of
programming's
so what many people don't realize that
programming goes back way further than
computers that's why I'm starting with
this this is a loom a machine for
producing textiles it was originally
developed by a Frenchman called Basel
Bhushan in 1725 so that's nearly 300
years ago and the reason this is part of
the talk is that it's used punched cards
or perforated paper but basically the
same principle and these this perforated
paper told the loom what patterns to
weave into silk up to that point so
weaving silk with a loom had been a very
tedious process this made life much
easier now this loom was the very first
object of the kind it was improved upon
many times most notably by Monsieur
jacquard who built the jacquard loom
named after him a couple of years later
or actually early 19th century so quite
a few years later and that that machine
was fully automated this one here still
need people to operate it but the
jacquard loom was totally automatic and
controlled by punch cards in that case
not punched paper that's inspired this
or well what this would have been a part
of Charles Babbage an Englishman built
machines in the early to mid night yet
19th century and he had built a few
previous machines and those were for
calculating tables basically logarithmic
tables and such prior to that
logarithmic tables and similar tables
had been calculated manually so if you
made a mistake that mistake
would carry on and so you got many many
Erina stables automating that made life
much easier and made sure you didn't
have these errors he wanted to improve
on that idea however and he desired the
so called analytical engine now this was
during the Industrial Revolution so
every complex machine was called an
engine but really this is the first
first idea of a computer he first
designed it in 1837 if it had ever been
completed this would have been the first
during complete machine ever it wasn't
completed in great parts due to
financial problems but it's it had some
pretty big influence on the history and
the further development of programming
it used punch cards and it was certainly
inspired by the looms I just showed you
there's another story by women which it
was probably inspired and that has to do
with trains
so again Industrial Revolution trains
were pretty big the first steam
locomotives have been around for a while
and people bought their train tickets
got on the trains and train conductors
would punch their tickets now the story
at the time was that train conductors
had figured out a system to punch the
hole in the ticket in a particular place
and the place where the hole was punched
would encode some information about the
traveler thereby you couldn't just pass
on your ticket sir and use it twice
whether this story is true is unclear
but it's pretty probable that Babbage
had heard of the story and imagined you
could could encode all kinds of
information in punch cards so if this
ever had been built sir fully it would
have been programmed in a kind of
assembly language
it supported loops and conditional
branching it was based ten unlike many
machines to come after it another reason
that the analytical engine is important
is because it inspired someone else
namely Ada Lovelace now if you've ever
looked into the history of computing
you've probably stumbled upon the name
Ada Lovelace Ada Lovelace is said to be
the first program in the world
now Ada Lovelace was the daughter of
Lord Byron and she met Babbage was when
she was about 17 or 18 years old which
was in 1833 couple of years before he
built their analytical engine she had
been she had been taught mathematics and
she was really good at maths
so when Babbage gave a talk at a foreign
University which was transcribed in
French she took it upon herself to
translate those notes now she translated
them from French to English but she did
more than that she added notes and when
I say notes the notes were about three
times as long as the translated article
and the notes contained among other
things this this is a an algorithm which
she designs probably supported by
Babbage which would calculate Bernoulli
numbers so this is the first published
known algorithm designed for a computer
which is why she is referred to as the
first programmer she also did other
things she saw potential that Babbage
himself did not see in his machine she
saw that you could abstract much more
than just numbers you could use
computers for so much more her example
was music you could encode the notes of
the pitch of the length of a musical
notes in numbers and everything we are
doing
with computers today there isn't
directly calculating is based on this
idea that we can abstract information
and abstract processes and use them with
a computer by transferring them into
numbers and back she also dismissed so
what nowadays one would call AI saying
that computers only did what they were
told to by a human so she didn't get
everything right but pretty brilliant
woman now all of this led to the next
chapter which is early computers and
programming languages so 99 years after
Babbage Alan Turing described what he
called the automatic machine we nowadays
know as the Turing machine the Turing
machine is of course the basis for but
pretty much everything we have in
computing today and as everyone will
know who saw the 2014 film the imitation
game Alan Turing proceeded to actually
build a machine based on his ideas now
the machine he builds in that film is
commonly referred to as a bomba the one
he built there was the first of its kind
many others were built throughout the
Second World War by both the British and
the Americans and these bombers were
highly specialized machines intended to
crack the Enigma codes used by the
Germans to send messages to their troops
now as I said this was highly
specialized it was not a general-purpose
computer it was not really
reprogrammable but Turing did get to
test out some of the ideas he had had
with his automatic machine now sadly the
fact that this sir was built was kept
secret for Tekkit decades to come so it
didn't have much influence
side of those who are actually part of
the team's building those machines but
those people who work could have caused
cavion with their experience and build
some other machines which would become
very important later one machine that
certainly wasn't influenced by these was
this the Sousa Z 3 Conrad Sousa was a
German engineer so as such he certainly
did not know about secret serve British
computing programs and he built this
computer well the original this is a
replica around about 1941 and this was
the first general purpose computer that
was actually ever built
remember Babbage's analytical engine
would have been the first computer ever
built the first general-purpose computer
if it had been built but it was never
completed this was it was also fully
digital so it used a binary system
rather than Babbage's machine which had
used a decimal system it's supported
floating-point arithmetic it could
handle exceptions
it had loops and could do some very
limited parallel computing what it
couldn't do was conditional branching
Sousa wanted to implement conditional
branching but he never got the hang of
it with the z3 he was later to implement
it in the z4 but here he didn't manage
it nevertheless years later this machine
was actually proven to be theoretically
turing-complete through a pretty dirty
hack admittedly but in theory it would
be children complete this machine would
have been a programmed with machine code
and Sousa wasn't really happy with this
so he decided he'd design something else
and what he designed was plant cocoon
which could be considered the first
programming language
to ever exist though maybe what ada
lovelace rate wrote in those tables
could also qualify so this was developed
between 1942 and 1946 for originally the
Zeid for the follow-up machine though it
wasn't actually used in that wasn't
fully published until the 1980s part of
it were published and they showed some
promise they had stuff like variables
and assignments which when you
subroutines conditional statements which
as I said he couldn't implement in the
z3 but did manage to implement in the z4
it could iterate it had arrays it had
hierarchical record structures which in
a way could be seen as a precursor to
object-oriented programming and he could
also handle exceptions so this while it
wasn't fully published until many
decades later did inspire some other
people and one person inspired was
Hannes hotus Hauser is with
mathematician now who dis Hauser
designed his own language called super
plan the plant by the RIP way refers to
Sousa again because he had called it the
plant Cal cool and one program was a
so-called nation plan or calculation
plan so a plan was a program and super
plan was a language for writing plans
this was fully described in 1952 so a
couple of years later and it was
intended for more than just calculating
mathematical formulae it could do that
of course as we see here but it was
supposed to be able to do much more and
one reason why this was actually really
important is up there we see fewer fewer
being the German word for four of course
all this Howser came up with the idea of
what he
a few clothes a four cycle or what we
would nowadays call a four loop
this was the first time that was ever
described and he would also influence
later at languages directly that
included four loops jump over the ponds
and we have these these two gentlemen
and the machine behind them the edvac
the edvac was built in the US and it was
a pretty impressive machine it was built
actually a couple of years before Zuppa
plan was described between 1946 and 1949
and the reason this is relevant is
because one of these guys here is John
von Neumann Jonathan Lymon of course
well known to this day for the funnyman
architecture actually the way this came
about is that he wrote a paper called
the first draft of a description of the
edvac first draft of a report on the
edvac story and this got spread out
people worked with this draft and named
it the for Norman architecture he was
actually the one who came up with this
and the name has been contended but the
name stuck one of the first computers to
actually be directly inspired by this
paper was the Ed Zack we're back in
Britain now and this was built again a
couple of years later it was one of the
first stored program computers and
probably more relevant is probably one
of the first computers to have an
assembly language remember everything
before this had machine code and
theoretical languages which were never
implemented but this had assembly
language assembly language is of course
still relatively primitive compared to
what we use today most of the time and
there were some strides to improve that
so in 1949
this here was addressed it originally as
brief code later renamed short code it
was a quite simple programming language
but it was one of the first high-level
languages this was interpreted rather
than compiled and sir
that made it quite a lot slower than
what sir you wrote in machine code
actually about 50 50 times slower but it
did allow things like branching and it
did actually have a default library and
it could call functions from that
library things moved rather quickly from
here and soon a family of languages
called Auto codes were born
now this specifically is Glenys Auto
code probably the first ever compiled
language Auto code generally is the
description of what what nowadays you
would call a programming language or at
least a compiled programming language
this specific one it was the first it's
not that readable to be honest but it
was very interesting it had some pretty
interesting effects one further
interesting thing about it is it was
created for the Harvard sorry the
Manchester mark one which was a computer
and this computer used so called
Williams tubes for memory Williams tubes
are type of cathode ray tube which lose
their memory after tile so they have to
be refreshed the idea of having to
refresh memory lives to this day you
have to do it in DRAM and I'll show you
another example at the end where you
have to do this one last entry in this
early programming language and machine
section is zetton now zetton is it was a
row of computers built at the University
of Moscow
around about the late 70s early 80s and
the remarkable thing about zetton is
that this was a trinary computer or
ternary computer not binary or decimal
like everything that had come before it
so what you used here was not 1 &amp;amp; 0 but
rather + 1 0 and minus 1 that had a
pretty strong effect on how you
programmed it had yet how you had to
think about programming it was built for
a couple of years and used to mainly in
universities it within the UTS SR it
didn't really catch on sadly but I think
it has or had the potential for great
influence okay next part the golden age
I call this the golden age and this is
mainly the 1960s because four languages
emerged within this time which were to
shape every language that was to come
after them now one language which
doesn't actually belong to those four is
flow-matic flow-matic is still pretty
remarkable it was created by a woman
called Grace Hopper she had been part of
the US military and in that position had
worked with computers but it was all
still very very difficult for people who
didn't have a degree in mathematics or
physics or engineering there was no
computer science at that time so after
her time in the military in 1953 she
suggested this language which was based
on the English language and should be
accessible to everyone
especially business people government
officials etc and at first this offer or
this suggestion was declined it was
called unfeasible nevertheless in late
1953 work started on this
which the first compiler was available
in 1958 and complete in 1959 and this
had most influence on COBOL now COBOL
was extremely important is to this day
actually pretty important it was
inspired heavily by flow-matic and it
was originally designed in 1959 it was
supposed to like flow-matic be available
to all kinds of people who didn't have
an engineering or mathematics background
it was actually pretty heavily used in
business in finance in administrative
tasks in both industry and governments
COBOL is a pretty good example however
for designed by committee if you ever
need an example it's this it's so
overloaded as a language it's really
difficult to get a full grasp of the
language nevertheless due to the fact
that it was open to everyone by 1970
this was the most used programming
language in the world another pretty
widely used programming language from
that era is Fortran so Fortran first
compiler was published in 1957 and so
this was the first general-purpose
compiler and a first optimizing compiler
Fortran is an imperative language which
like COBOL lives to this day and it's a
to was sir it became pretty widespread
now this was used more in the scientific
area than COBOL and by 1963 there were
over 40 Fortran compilers of course what
you have to understand is that at that
time there was basically no code
compatibility but
machines so if you wanted to implement
something in Fortran or any other
language on your computer you had to
create a new compiler it was pretty
pretty popular at the time and it's
still going strong actually the next
release is planned for 2018 so work is
still happening here another language
you probably haven't heard of is the
information Pro processing language
version 5 or IP LV for short
now IPL was a language which was pretty
assembly like nevertheless it was very
powerful it was designed to be used for
AI programming it could use data as
programs and vice-versa and although
it's assembly like it could do things
like manipulate lists it's supported
recursion and functions as arguments
it's legacy include list processing
higher-order functions computation with
symbols was pretty new then and virtual
machines so if you think languages like
Java invented that no this was replaced
by and very inspired Lisp now Lisp came
in 1958 and again is a language that is
used to till today rather a family of
languages versions of Lisp that are in
use today include scheme or closure and
Lisp uses lists as its main datatype
Lisp
actually stands for list processor it
pioneered things like like the hobbit
collection again Java came way later
dynamic typing conditionals a self
hoisting JIT compiler so the language
the compiler was written
at some point in Lisp and it was a
just-in-time compiler so pretty new for
the time before that sir
compilers had mainly be written in
machine code or assembly languages last
entry on that list
Algol Algol was an imperative language
about still is which also came out in
1958 and it introduced many things among
others the for-loop
so remember hotus Hauser who designed
super plan he was member of the of the
group that designed Algol as was
Dijkstra by the way who would gain fame
for his his path searching algorithm and
of course his paper on how bad goto was
Al Gore contained go-to so it seems he
changed his mind some way along the line
Algol Auto introduced if statements both
with and without else it was criticized
for being highly complex and writing a
compiler for outlaw 60 which was the
next version after Algol 58 was
extremely difficult nevertheless it
became hugely influential mostly because
the ACM used it as its reference
language for most algorithmic
descriptions in the papers they
published so everyone who read or wrote
a paper published by ACM had to at least
be familiar with Algol syntax ok now
let's have a look at some modern
programming languages well with modern I
mean after 1960 but many of these will
be much more familiar to you than what
we saw previously and we'll start this
section with basic basic
again is really a kind of family of
programming languages but it was
designed in 1964 the first version will
start with basic and the idea here was
to create a as the name suggests simple
or basic language which anyone could
understand who spent some time with it
so in a way it had a similar idea as
COBOL had in being very universal but it
didn't go the route of having everything
English like though you do see quite a
few English like words in there basic
was really influential because it became
very very widespread with the rise of
micro computers or personal computers it
allowed people to program who had no
background in computer programming in
mathematics or anything like that simply
if they were able to afford a personal
computer of course that at the time was
more expensive relative to average
income venire is today but it was much
cheaper than what you had previously
with things like the edvac which were
absolutely not affordable for for the
layman it was available on computers
such as the IBM PC or the first Apple
Macintosh --is the first program written
by a then small company called micro
soft then with a dash in the middle was
a basic compiler or basic interpreter
actually now this wasn't without its
critiques
so again Dijkstra who had originally
supported go-to and later refuted it
said that anyone who had grown up using
a basic could never become a good
programmer because
their minds are mentally mutilated
beyond hope of regeneration pretty
strong words but then again people have
critiquing what came after them for
millennia so not surprising and of
course here again he was proved wrong
now we have quite a different entry a pl
a programming language APL is known as
the king of one-liners and you can see
why this up here this one line first
line being a comment is all the code you
need to calculate the next step in
Conway's Game of Life now it isn't
exactly easy to read and actually if you
want to write APL in many cases you'll
buy a specialized keyboard which which
contains these symbols you see here but
it was extremely powerful it needed very
little resources the main data type was
a multi-dimensional array which of
course makes it easy to implement
something like Conway's Game of Life
mostly it was interpreted and it was
very good for parallel computing
including massively parallel computing
because it was so lightweight and this
language influenced many many things
including spreadsheet applications and
functional programming and the maths
packages for so many languages a later
version of APL apo 2 is actually used to
this day and inspired languages such as
math lab or go now Simula now the first
version of simular was designed in 1962
implemented a couple of years later and
basically was a superset of Algol 60 and
it wasn't that interesting
the interesting part came when the
follow up version similar 67 was
designed and standardized in 1968
because this was the first ever
object-oriented programming language
it included objects and classes
inheritance sub classing virtual
procedures code routines it had a
garbage collector which of course it
stole from Lisp and Simula inspired
every object-oriented programming
language to come after it
something else that inspired many
languages to come after a bit but not
the object-oriented kind is if you see
what I mean or is women now is whim was
actually only ever a theoretical
language it was described in a paper
called the next 700 programming
languages and the idea behind it was
that it wanted to bias things towards
expressions rather than statements it
became extremely influential in the area
of functional programming so languages
like Haskell or and ml were inspired by
this this paper the language described
in the paper it did have however a few
things that you wouldn't necessarily
expect from a functional language
nowadays such as mutable variables and
assignments well nothing's perfect this
year is Cpl or the combines programming
language it was first published in 1963
and the idea behind it was that the
designers wanted to have a high-level
language to create low-level programs at
that time if you wanted to create a
low-level program such as the core of an
operating system or a driver or
something like that you had to use both
machine codes if you were really extreme
or more commonly assembly language the
designers of this language one
to change that it was much more complex
than alcohol 60 which is quite a feat
and it wanted to do everything really
wanted to do things like it contain
things like industrial industrial
process control or business data
processing and it just wanted to do too
much so a couple of years later in 1966
a simplified version called BCPL the
basic combines programming language was
was published and that's actually the
first learn language that a hello world
program was written in it also
introduced the brace programming
language syntax which we know today but
that too was too complex so it was
stripped down to a language called be
around about 1969 which was supposed to
fit in the memory of a mini computer and
it switched the syntax to a more Algol
like one so it kept the braces and that
as may some of you may realize was
followed by C the C programming language
is a direct descendant of Cpl it was
developed between 1969 and 1973 and it's
a general-purpose
imperative language it's allowed people
to to include machine code and machine
instructions and it was still for the
time very high level it's in many
aspects replaced assembler and has
influenced so much I doubt anyone here
has not done so at least something with
C or is familiar with C in some way and
still around today of course used for
operating systems and drivers and so on
what I mentioned just now was she was
done mainly
in assembly before this totally
different entry planner planner was
designed also in 1969 and implemented in
1971 and it's V or one of the first
logic programming languages personally I
don't see many languages that followed
it in this area but logic programming is
an interesting field that is heavily
used in AI research and this was
actually replaced by Prolog which is
also used to this day and it heavily
inspired Prolog it's I find it bit sad
that logic programming hasn't gotten as
big as some other versions as some other
concepts but then again functional
programming is on the rise now after it
was living a somewhat hidden existence
for many years so who knows maybe
logical programming is the next thing
and now Java now Vox days of course is
in a way a Java conference so I couldn't
leave it out and before I go into the
language this is a terrible example of
how to use Java the reason I use this
example is because it displays very many
features that were introduced over the
years and that weren't included in the
original version of Java now how Java
was born is that originally Sun
Microsystems wanted to have its own
language and the initial idea was to
extend C++ the working title for that
language was C plus plus plus plus minus
minus probably you're quite happy that
they him didn't stick but they soon
realized they didn't want to do that in
instead they created their own language
which was inspired heavily by C and C++
and also by another language called Mesa
which I'm not going to
go into and so they designed this
language which initially they called oke
named after the tree outside of James
goslings office but soon renamed to Java
Java was advertised and this is still
true to this day as a right ones run
everywhere language it compiles the
bytecode not the first language to do
that as we've seen um it sports a c or
c++ like syntax and originally the idea
was to run this on interactive
televisions or what nowadays we would
call smart tvs that didn't work out what
did work out was a cooperation with
Netscape Communications and what they
did is when Java was announced at the
same time Netscape announced that their
browser the Netscape Navigator would
support Java that you would be able to
run Java programs in Netscape Navigator
this I believe was one of the main
reasons why Java became so big it was
supported by Netscape which by 1996
Netscape Navigator was the biggest
browser out there this was the beginning
of the browser Wars things changed over
the next couple of years but it gave
Java a really big boost this came out in
1990 well the first alphas in 1995 the
final version in 1996 and interestingly
although it got its first boost through
better browser integration with Java 9
the browser plug-in will actually be
discontinued so that's the end of an era
we know you talk about programming for
browsers of course Java isn't nowadays
the first language to come to mind it
wasn't the first language included in a
browser either
so before Java was included there was a
language called a viola viola was
created in 1991
and as a language it wasn't in my
opinion that spectacular the syntax as
you can see looks like something like a
mixture of latex and see rather weird it
was inspired by a hyper card an
application for Apple computers only
which was basically hyper media but
locally a sort of local Internet the
internet was of course just starting out
and in 1992 when timber nolle introduced
or announced the world wide web the
creator of viola said hey I'd like to
write a browser and he did so he wrote
the first prototype in four days amazing
feat and this browser he wrote viola www
it was one of the first web browsers
around and it had things like we're
basically the precursor to frames also
supported a precursor to CSS and it had
included viola as a scripting language
so creators of websites could include
dynamic code which would modify the page
in the browser rather than on the server
this of course gave rise to JavaScript
which is around to do today this
javascript also came around about 1995
1996 the idea behind it was the Netscape
wanted to have a language to create
dynamic websites in their browser this
was initially before they cooperated
with some their initial plan was to
include scheme which as I said earlier
was a lisp in the browser but then the
cooperation with with Sun came along and
they decided okay
scrap that we want to create a language
which will complement Java it should
have a similar
syntax and some are bind to web together
the initial prototype was created in ten
days so can pretty quickly and many
people would say it shows but it shipped
with the first Netscape Navigator and
became pretty successful side note in
1996 so one year after they shipped the
Netscape Navigator they also shipped a
product called the Netscape Enterprise
Server which supported server-side
JavaScript take that nodejs
javascript was only supported initially
by Netscape Navigator Microsoft decided
hey that's a good idea
let's reverse engineer that and created
a script which in theory was the same
thing in practice anyone who tried to
write websites dynamic websites which
worked in Netscape and Internet Explorer
would disagree which led to websites
normally having labels stating best
viewed in Netscape or best viewed in
Internet Explorer these two languages
were synchronized over the next couple
of years and we got something called
Akuma scripts of which Java Script is
one implementation and Dre script is
another we're still not at the point
where there are a hundred percent equal
but we're pretty close nowadays also
important in this area is of called Ajax
now Ajax isn't something someone ever
invented but rather the industry decided
we have to move forward we want to we
want to load parts of the webpage with
JavaScript without having to reload the
whole page and Microsoft was one of the
pioneers in this as was Google or Flickr
or Amazon the term was coined in 2001
stands for asynchronous JavaScript and
XML though of course now
you don't have to use XML quite commonly
you use JSON instead but that has stuck
and it's pretty important nowadays okay
so that's that with the section about
modern programming languages let's have
a quick look at what's coming next and
basically I picked one topic I would
present here and that's quantum
computing when you think about of
quantum computing I'm sure a lot of you
think damn that's very complicated I
don't really want to care about it I
won't understand it anyway quantum
physics were about a year ago the
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau
was asked at a press conference jokingly
to explain what quantum computing is and
turned out he could of course this is a
very simple explanation and I highly
recommend you watch the video on YouTube
just search for Canadian Prime Minister
quantum computing or something like that
it'll show right up what this proves is
that while of course there's a lot of
complex stuff behind it the idea of
quantum computing isn't actually that
difficult to understand and people who
aren't experts in the field such as
politicians can still get a grasp of it
and this was made at a press conference
where he was announcing that any physics
departments would get pretty big funding
for researching quantum computing of
course it's not just universities doing
that and actually nowadays everyone can
try out quantum computing through the
IBM quantum experience so IBM built a
quantum computer and this comic quantum
computer is available through the cloud
to everyone who wants to try it out the
quantum computer they built has five
cubits so it's still very limited of
course but you
can already do pretty amazing things
with it what you see here is a
screenshot of the score editor the
quantum score editor which looks a bit
like musical lines musical notes
it's a drag-and-drop editor for
graphical programming graphical
programming of course being a subject
I've totally skipped over in this talk
alternatively there is an assembly like
language called croisé on which you can
use now one reason IBM is making this
available to everyone is they want
people to play around with it they want
to find out what people do with it and
how you can work with quantum computing
most effectively of course they're not
the only ones thinking about that and as
things repeated themselves by the way
the qubits here like the Williams tubes
and DRAM have to be refreshed regularly
as things repeat themselves of course
here too we see things that we've seen
before and of course there are people
writing a lisp for quantum computers
thank you for listening
