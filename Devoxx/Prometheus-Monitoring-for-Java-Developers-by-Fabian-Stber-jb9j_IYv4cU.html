welcome my name is Fabian I am a
software developer working for a console
in Munich Germany and within the next 30
minutes I'm going to give you an
introduction to Prometheus the
monitoring tool so I am myself I'm not a
Prometheus core developer so I'm more a
fan showing you my favorite tool here
and for this talk I didn't prepare any
slides because I think the best way to
show you prometheus is just to get it up
and running and play with it and so you
see what it's all about and for the few
words of introduction I have before we
start the demos I just created some text
files but I I don't have these fancy
editor extensions that when cut hair so
it skip it and start with the demo
pretty quickly right so the the talk is
divided into two parts first to say
general Prometheus overview I assume
that most of you maybe haven't tried
Prometheus or don't really know what it
is exactly or how it differs from other
monitoring tools so I've given you a
general introduction of all the tools
involved so that you know what
Prometheus is all about and once we know
that I give you an outlook on how you
would instrument your own java
applications so that they can provide
metrics for Prometheus so let's get
started the a few bullet points before
we start the demo Prometheus is an open
source monitoring tools started at
SoundCloud by X Googlers so these people
used to work at Google started working
at SoundCloud and found that there is no
decent open source tool that they could
use to monitor the infrastructure the
way they used to do it at Google so they
took their whole ideas they got from
Google and started their own open source
monitoring project which became
Prometheus at its core the Prometheus
server itself is basically just a time
series database so what's a time series
database it's a database storing
floating-point numbers it's doors
sequences of 64-bit floating-point
numbers together with the
stems when these numbers were measured
apart from the time series database
promises also provides a powerful query
language that you can use to evaluate
the data in the time series database
right and this is not the typical
monitoring approach so but this is the
the basic functionality of the
Prometheus server and everything else
you would expect from an actual
monitoring solution like a dashboard
like alerting like exporters providing
metrics about operating systems and
stuff all these things are external
modules there are external programs
developed independently of the actual
Prometheus server and this modular
approach resonates really well with the
open-source community so there is there
is a large number of github projects a
lot of people involved implementing
exporters and there's a lot of things
going on right last bullet point here
before we start with the demo so the
general approach towards monitoring that
Prometheus takes is a white box approach
so in monitoring you can distinguish
between black box monitoring and white
box monitoring and black box monitoring
means that the application you monitor
doesn't really know it's being monitored
so basically you send an HTTP request
and if you get 200 okay you say okay
application up and running that's fine
and this is how typical traditional
natchez checks work and Prometheus I
mean of course you can do this with
promises but the intention of Prometheus
is another approach the intention is
that the application should provide
metrics about what's going on inside the
application so that's why I show you in
the second part how you would do this in
Java the more parameters can learn about
what's going on in an application the
more benefit you can have from
evaluating the data with the query
language and so on like data could be
how often are my endpoints called how
long did the requests take if I'm using
a database how often do I call it how
long does it take if I maintain any
business objects how many of them do I
have and so the more data you provide to
Prometheus the more benefit you would
gain from that right
so but let's go to the demo part i
download it basically just the targa
gzip files from the github release pages
so there's nothing prepared or so it so
everything I do now you can do on any
Linux system it's just downloading these
things and the first thing you need to
just start with Prometheus obviously you
need some metrics you need something to
monitor and the easiest way to get some
metrics to start with is using something
called the node exporter I will extract
it here
whoop go to this directory so the North
node exporter is basically a simple tool
providing or it's not simple in that
sense but it's easy to start it it's a
tool providing metrics about Linux
operating systems so it provides metrics
about hard disk usage Network CPU all
these kind of things so it basically
takes all the information from the proc
file system and actually in this Linux
proc file system you find quite some
sophisticated metrics about what's going
on with your operating system and the
node exporter makes all this available
to Prometheus and when you download it
you see that it's basically just a
single executable that's because it is
written in go like most of the
Prometheus tools and like promises
server itself also and go just compiles
to a single executable so you don't need
any runtime or interpreter or anything
you just download it for your
architecture and start it and once you
have started it you can use your web
browser to just show what it exposes so
it opened a port
9100 and if I go there whoop I see some
Prometheus metrics so that's how they
looked at like if you open them with a
web browser I can for example search for
Network for example so what I see here
is the number of bytes I received on my
network device eth0
is 2345 so at least in this virtual
machine that I'm using for the demo
right now right this text format is one
representation of promises metrics and
there's also a protocol buffers based
format so if the
the server talks with an exporter they
might use protocol buffers to have a bit
more efficient communication but that's
basically the the basic information so
more or less key value pairs for the
time series database right so now as we
have some metrics we can go ahead and
start the actual Prometheus server whoop
I got it downloaded here already so
let's unzip prometheus go to this
directory and again it's it's just a
simple single single executable called
prometheus but before we started we need
somehow some way to tell it what to
monitor like we want to tell it that we
have our node exporter running on
localhost port
9100 and permissive should monitor this
and the easiest way to do this in some
simplest scenario is to just statically
configure it in a configuration file
Prometheus comes with an example
configuration file which is this year
and down here it has a section promises
also provides metrics about itself so
you can use a Prometheus server to
monitor the Prometheus server itself and
it's pre-configured here in this example
so what we can do is we can just copy
this down here give it another name say
we want to monitor the node exporter and
we go here and say node exporters
running on 9100 so that's the kind of
configuration that you need when you see
this you might think that this doesn't
really scale for real-world applications
so if you have a large number of
exporters a large number of components
of your systems you cannot just
statically configure all the endpoints
and especially if you have dynamic
environments scaling up scaling down
this becomes kind of impossible and this
is actually not the whole story so
Prometheus is pretty good with service
discovery Prometheus integrates a lot of
different service discovery mechanisms
you can choose from you can for example
use DNS service discovery is the donate
domain name system based it integrates
really well with kubernetes so if you
have kubernetes running it can use cuban
ettus directly to disk
your services it also has some more like
hands-on approaches like dynamically
monitoring configuration directories
where you just during the runtime drop
some files and they will be read so
there's a lot of options that you have
so just because I edit this text file
here in the in the demo it doesn't mean
that this is some limitation of promises
but it's a good way to do things when
you just want to get it up and running
and get started right so let's start the
Prometheus server and it opens port
1990s so let's go to localhost for 1990
and you get this here as I said promises
doesn't really come with a built in
dashboard that you would use for
monitoring however once you start from
easiest we want to have some way to just
figure out if everything is the way it's
supposed to be you want some kind of
debugging UI where you can just check if
everything works and this is the
debugging UI that's included in
Prometheus you can do things like
clicking on configuration and you see
the configuration file that was loaded
you can check if that's the same that we
just edit it you can click on targets
you see the targets being monitored we
see here it's our node exporter on
pirate port 9100 it's the Prometheus
server itself on port 9090 both are up
and running so that's nice and you have
this here which is a UI where you can
try Prometheus queries so what we can do
here we can add a enter a query like for
example the network so it also has this
nice auto completion if you don't know
exactly how your metric is called you
will find it like we can for example
query the network receive bytes and we
will be see here let's zoom in a bit
that again on device eth0
we have whoop that many bytes received
right this is so the most simple kind of
Prometheus query that you can do you
also see it see that originally there
was only one label the device and when
Prometheus ingested to stay
it added some other labels telling us
there it got this metric from so if you
have multiple instances of note exporter
you can see here where it comes from so
what we can do now is we can play with
the query language a bit so for example
if you are not interested in all metrics
for receive bytes but only in metrics
for device et it's zero you can do it
like this you say device equals it's
zero hope so you get only one result
right and basically what we see here
it's a bit if i zoom in it doesn't
really know so what you see here on the
right this number is basically just the
latest value from the database and
sometimes you're not only interested in
the latest value but you might be
interested on the development of this
value over time so what you can do is
you can specify a time interval here
like five minutes and whoops now you get
all values that were ingested within the
last five minutes together with the
timestamp and they were ingested apart
from these basic operators Prometheus
has functions there is just to show you
an example there is an a function called
Wright which takes such a time interval
as parameter so I called right here give
this as parameter and this rate function
calculates the per second average within
this time interval so I now know per
second in average I received 44 bytes on
my device it's 0 when I look in the at
the time window of the last 5 minutes so
that's the kind of queries you can build
the Prometheus query language is
actually pretty powerful so you can
easily make a whole talk just showing
you all the features but fortunately
it's pretty well documented so if you
are interested in all the capabilities
that it has just go to premises dot IO
and documentation and clearing and then
you see a whole list of all the
functions that are available and the
list of all the operators that are
available can of course relate different
metrics to each other like divide them
by each other to have some ratios or sum
them up so you can do all kinds of
things so it's a pretty powerful
language right and what
you can also do here in this demo like
debugging interface you can always click
on graph and see some graphical
representation of how this value
developed developed over time so but in
order to have a full like monitoring
setup of course we need a real like
dashboard and basically the dashboard
that's like most often used together
with Prometheus these days is graph fana
so I can just extract graph on ax go to
this directory and start it so it's
again graph on a server it's called so
it's again just a single executable also
written and go na starts up opens port
3000 for us I hope some do them to them
now I know it's there so if I go to a
local host port 3000 I see a brand new
graph on a user interface right I can
look in here with my default username
and default password that graph Ana has
and the first thing I would do now to
create a dashboard for my Prometheus
monitoring server is to configure a data
source so you click on data sources say
a data source and the reason is graph
Ana is not a tool that was specifically
developed for Prometheus graph Anna
actually has been around for a while
before it even had fermitas support it
supports all kinds of backends like
cloud watch elasticsearch influx VB so
you see with them all here so it's more
a generic dashboarding tool right so in
order to use it with Prometheus you need
to just configure that we want to have
from mythos as a data source give it a
name for example this and say like where
the Prometheus server is reachable local
host port 1990 so everything green that
is nice and once you have configured the
data source graph anna gives us an
example dashboard to get started with we
can import this here and see some
typical
Griffen a dashboard so this dashboard
basically visualizes the metrics that
graph fauna that Prometheus monitors
about itself because every Prometheus
server typically monitors itself no
thanks
because every primitive server typically
monitors itself so we can assume that
more or less these self monitoring
metrics are always available so that's a
good like starting point to have some
example dashboard right and we see these
single stat metrics like my observers up
for 6 minutes now we see some
information about the local storage in
the time series database or some graphs
here showing us how long it took to
query the endpoints that we are
monitoring and all stuff like that right
and if we want to go ahead now and start
our own dashboard we can just like it's
pretty easier so you click everything
with the UI here and once you're done
you can also export it in JSON format
and pass it to your colleagues or
something or create a backup so it can
say dashboard new and they get an empty
dashboard and then I can start adding
things like for example a graph and now
I need to define a query that should be
visualized and of course this one uses
the same query language here that we
have in our debugging UI because it just
sends the query over to Prometheus so
you can basically I could copy and paste
it you can basically put any Prometheus
clear view here and once you've done it
now I get a graph let's zoom in a bit
visualizing the per second average of
number of bytes going through my network
device eth0 like so that's how things
typically work right let's go back so
that's the promises overview one thing I
left out is alerting because it's a bit
more complex to show because you need
some destination where the alert should
go to and but basically alerting works
like this you configure your alert in
promises I think I have an example also
here so you configure alerting like this
you say I have an alert and then you say
you can use any kind of promises query
like I don't know where I got this
example from but you say if the result
of this query here now if the result of
this query here has a value of greater
than one for at least a minute then I
want to trigger an alert so this is the
kind of configurations that you do you
can use any kind of query that
Prometheus offers to define these things
and once the alerts are triggered
Prometheus doesn't do anything that them
from it is just hands them over to the
alert manager and the alert manager is a
tool that does things like routing the
alerts to its destination like you can
have different routes say one alert is
not so important it just goes to an
email one alert is very important it
goes to a patriot service for example
you can have silencing saying like if
this alert happens and it repeats itself
then I'm only interested in the first
instance and for the next three hours
when the same alert comes repeatedly it
should be silenced and all these things
are configured in the external alert
Manager application so the Prometheus
server itself can really focus on its
time series database and query language
functionality right good so that's the
promises all of you I hope you all got
some idea how things work and now in the
last part I'm one would like to show you
how you would instrument your own java
application to provide metrics for
Prometheus so basically I mean having
information about your operating system
hard disk and network and everything is
nice but to get really the most value
out of Prometheus you should like
provide some metrics about what's going
on in your application because then you
can use the query language and relate
this to other things and then you can
really gain insights into your
application that are not really possible
with traditional blackbox monitoring
tools I have a small travel application
here so the
the very simplest rests are this
application that I could find is this
here it's a spring boot hello world
example so basically it says if the
browser goes to this URL we respond with
a string hello world so and now let's
instrument this application so what kind
of metrics could we provide for this of
course we could provide a counter
telling us how often this endpoint is
called and then using functions like
rate we can calculate how often it's per
second and all these things right we
could also do some other metrics like we
could measure the time how long it takes
and provide some statistics about the
duration of these calls but for having a
simple example it's it's good to just
start with a counter so if you want to
add a promises counter to this kind of
application there are basically two ways
to do that the first and recommended way
is to use the Prometheus client library
for Java so promises provides a client
library for all kinds of operating air
for all kinds of programming languages
and including Java of course and if you
control the source code and are free to
add a new maiden dependency the best
thing you can do is just at this
official Prometheus client library as a
mailing dependency and use it directly
so that's the the main approach so to
say however sometimes that may not be
possible maybe because you already have
some other metrics framework in your
application or maybe you don't even
control the source code and even in that
cases it might be possible that you can
monitor your application with Prometheus
because there are a lot of projects that
build riches from some monitoring tool
to Prometheus for example if I have
spring boot here I might already use
spring boot actuators for measuring
metrics and there is actually a spring
boot actuator to Prometheus bridge so I
can just add a new end point here for
this bridge and then all my spring boot
actuator metrics will automatically also
be available for the promisee server if
you have more a standards Java
yiii application you maybe have trail
mix beans for monitoring your stuff and
there is AJ mix exporter you can start
it as an external application or as a
Java agent it attaches to your existing
M beans and provides in from metrics
that it gathers from this M beans to
Prometheus in order to do that you don't
even need to control the source code of
your application it's just a it acts
like a regular Java agent or J mix
client right so these are the two big
examples spring and Java EE but also if
you have some smaller third-party
application like for example drop wizard
does a drop user to Prometheus bridge
and there are others so there is a lot
of projects in in this area right but
let's just go ahead and show you the
Prometheus client library for now so if
I add a counter with this library here
it looks like this so basically I say I
want to have a counter give it a name
that will be visible to Prometheus give
it a help message and called register
which registers discounters with the
global aesthetic variable that's called
the Prometheus registry it's just some
variable defined in the library and you
can access it access it from everywhere
and then whenever my endpoint is called
here I just say increment so the counter
counts the number of times this endpoint
was accessed and the second thing I need
is I need some endpoint for promises so
promises can fetch these metrics so I
created an endpoint here called
Prometheus metrics so what I do is I use
this default registry which is the
global variable that comes with the
library where all my metrics are
registered and then I use a text format
writer that also comes with the library
and just write all the metrics to the
output stream for the client so let's
try and run this maven clean package and
just
char so let's see it should should
compile now I didn't even change the
code so okay looks good
so now spring boot is coming up yes so
if I go now to lope call house port 8080
I see my hello world application let's
reload it once more so what no we should
have accessed it two times and now if I
go to this metrics endpoint ah cool
I see the na hello here I see the the
metric like my request so don't count
'red just with a value of two so that's
the thing that we have added all right I
have actually some some more examples
here for misses for Java developers so
for spring boot actuator J mix and drop
visitors but they they don't know if it
makes sense like I have four minutes
left so to go through them all so just
want to tell you I mean this thing that
I showed you is kind of the recommended
approach and easiest approach and if you
cannot do this and have some kind of
other metrics library just look into
these things they are all similarly easy
to use right so let's wrap wrap up this
was an introduction to Prometheus so I
had my focus a bit on like how you get
things up and running and I hope you all
got the impression that it's not so hard
to get started with it and I really can
encourage you like installed some
Prometheus server try it out provide
some metrics because you don't need to
invest much time and you can just start
playing with it however like even if I
just wrote the very simple things here
don't assume that Prometheus is just a
toy tool it's really a sophisticated
tool being used in really large
environments of course it sound thought
itself but also digitalocean are using
it for monitoring their infrastructure
so you really it's a really powerful and
very efficient to
so thank you very much we have about
three minutes left now for questions is
there any yeah however the question was
how about monitoring JVM and I think as
the JVM does not directly provide any
Prometheus metrics yeah yet I would say
that using jmx what's the best option
yeah yeah one bar if you can scrape
block files that's a pretty nice
Christmas because I actually wrote a log
file scraper for prometheus so there are
two projects one is my little toy but
one other one is quite M tail which is
by Google which is a lot more
sophisticated so I have more like a
smaller and easier one and so yeah you
can't do that so you can basically I
mean the main thing you want to do is to
count log lines matching some pattern so
you want to know how often does this
exception appear in my lock so that's
the most easy thing but you can also
extract like numbers appearing in your
log files and stuff like that so that's
easily possible so one more over there
is it possible to push metrics no it
isn't that's basically so if you Pierre
talks by the like founders of the
Prometheus project they often describe
this push versus pull as a kind of
religious debate because there are
people who believe that everything with
push is better and other people believe
everything with pull is better and they
describe Prometheus as a tool that lives
in the Church of pull so it's actually
so the opposite would be elasticsearch
like where you just push all your log
lines into an elastic search cluster and
that basically means that all your like
applications need to know where the
monitoring server is so they can push
the log fights there paresis goes the
other way around
so Prometheus needs some service
discovery but the actual services don't
need to know where the promises server
is running so it's a kind of decision
and the decision with prometheus is that
they just do
pull so that's the way it operates okay
so thank you very much have a nice
