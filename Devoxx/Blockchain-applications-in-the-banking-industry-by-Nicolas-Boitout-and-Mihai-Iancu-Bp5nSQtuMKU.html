cetacean this Telugu desperate day
Google but actually we are different
suspicion is the very large group Thank
You group and we are an entity that
Westgate Apaches yay I'm an innovation
manager via ITV show manager ultimate
assassin who is a developer so most of
us are not block chaining spell I'm
going to data mining and machine
learning applications and Mihai is an
expert in that department and wrong
effects fix production on the FX market
like a lot of us we are still hit toward
adjust and we think that the offensive
application in the banking industry
regarding is technology and we're gonna
showcase
I mean to example to that you'll know
analyze because trust less nodes that
allowed to have a system that completely
avoided the banking system so that's
very interesting for that I start a new
Ice III arena where we can apply
blockchain technology into banking
industry the first one is the one we
gonna discuss actually is when we don't
have trust between counterparties and it
is the case in terms of trade finance
imagine that you are an exporter of oil
we need to ship this oil to
from Houston us to chunga English in
China there are plenty of paperwork to
do with the shipping with the customs
with between the suppliers between the
bands that we provide the funding and so
on so it's a lot of paperwork and people
these people do not necessarily know
each other so there is an interesting
use case here for the blockchain and in
the example that we will we will show
you it's also the case when you talk
about traceability of the within the
food supply chain you know when you have
a farmer somewhere that produce some and
it will be routed by a transporter and
then we will have some supermarket and
yin and Yan user which is the one who is
the consumer so it's interesting also to
apply to country technology together so
this is the first example where I still
hear your news case or blockchain
technology the second news cases of
international payment international
transfer this is where the affects
plants why because so far we have we
have systems which are national systems
we have the Romanian system and owned by
National Bank of Romania we have the
European system Interbike sort of many
of you like that system which are
completely okay so sending money from
one system to the other
is a bit complex is this and quite
expensive if you go through monograms
you go through so we have some energy
technology which
quite interesting Francis report is one
of them as it working is purely an area
where we have progress to be made and
now you know where we can apply on
changing country the third case is I
think it's the most fascinating please I
used to be a smoker so I find it very
interesting that we can raise money
through the blockchain thanks to a ICO
insurance right so it's the kind of
replacement of the IPO in issued a bit
of rain when the children go to the
public markets to raise some expected
name so that's a very interesting domain
and I'm planning to do some work
specifically in the near future
okay so 300 international payment let's
say trade trade finals we could
summarize it that's food supply chain or
traceability and the third one is I see
I skewers I think one of the most
interesting so before showing you the
talk on which we are working in our
spectrum so we let's let's really see
the principle that lets say in terms of
cryptography in terms of changing the
blocks so that we create a battery the
first thing that we need to understand
this PRC there with that so I'm going to
be very quick you have a message we can
hash it and generate the digest this
message digest which is a one-way
message and we see which is a one-way
procedure we cannot go back okay that's
the difference with encryption so what's
the benefit of that it's easy to compute
- for you it's physical to generate the
message that has the same even ash mean
that we can avoid collision of message
it's in physical 25 message without
changing - so meaning that if I change
anything in my initial message the hash
result will be completely different
two different messages with the same a
sh so this point is position so in the
original md5 and go our hash algorithm
it was shown that this last point was a
wiki that's why I went to the shaft ugly
why go with sha-1 chapter five six size
512 s we have a snippet of the coding
linked up that that's very easy so
ashiness
remember it's one-way oppression why
encryption is a to progression using the
key secret key we can encrypt the
message to decrypt a message so actually
the ash will be used for what it will be
used by the sender between the sender
and the receiver to assure the content
is the integrity of the message meaning
that when I receive a message whether
it's pretty low open I can ash very
quickly this message and verify that
actually - when I receive with the
initial message is the same if this is
the same it means that the Mississippi
is exactly the right one okay so now
let's assume that we combine it with a
quitter key i'm not to keep a private or
public key listed just see breaking if i
do that i can ensure more on top of that
the integrity of the message and
detoxification
meaning that I can identify tend to find
that actually the sender is the right
one so I can verify the message and at
the same time verify that the
one given Center is the right to one who
sentiments message and this will allow
us to digitally sign our message meaning
that let's assume the form in case
police encrypt the data to message Hamas
December she takes the hash of this data
this will be related and this person
sign the data this with a private
signing key and send it through the
network to Bob who can create a shot in
fifty data and verify the integrity of
the message and he can verify using a
public key that actually do miss what is
the message okay so here we have the
difference between encryption and
digital signature the encryption used
the public key and great why use the
private piece right to decrypt the
message but in digital signature which
we is going to be used in the blockchain
technology what's that thing is that we
use the private key to sign the research
and use the public key to verify so the
receiver is using the public key while
the private issue is by the sender okay
so this will not be verified that
actually I say
the message we can't appreciate the
message the signature somos we know that
let's look at how we can now create a
data structure that we call the
blockchain
so this blockchain is based on to
section a block is based on the section
where we have the transaction meter and
then when we have the block in heaven
with some let's explain formation let's
stop by that we have to block number the
creation date at the previous block -
okay all this information will be
cockaded concatenated with the
transaction details with a hash and this
will generate a hash that is that can be
changed and this will be the block hash
so the question now is how to embed to
join all the subsequent block block
within the protein so the next time is
very easy as we use the previous block -
either in the next block we if one
transaction and one block has been
modified between you and in fact all the
subsequent blocks within the block shape
okay okay so that's a very simple so now
in this example that I show you
there was only one transaction within
the block now let's see how we can have
beautiful transaction so in the original
Bitcoin blockchain we have every block
mind
attendance roughly on average we have
1,000 section include okay so how would
we enter that you can do that sex to the
back country so let's assume that 86 I
put me up for transaction within within
a block we ask each of them and then
they're wise will generate a second hash
okay and we see that mean that is
cascading tree between the leaf no the
very bottom with each transaction and
then we generate some some some hash
like that
Tildy ash route which will be on top
that we will included with the proc
number the creation date it is about
actually concatenated with everything
into the hash function in generate a new
block - once again this block - cannot
be modified without the other node to
not see okay so you see that they denied
surprise and you have to use the price
of the key so I say that's that stuff to
be very interesting that was for the
macro tree so now that we have more data
in place the one of the PE and probably
deserve a little bit on the bed price
the proof of work so the work is the for
me so we'll generated the number that is
arbitrarily complex
okay so the point is the for me let's
assume that we add to our block either
the nonce which is a number let's say
random member and we will use this
random number and we add these numbers
in all this information that we
concatenate and insert into a structure
so that we want to find a girl ash block
- that we start by factors that's our
constraint it's completely arbitrary and
it's going to be very difficult to find
there is no way that would force meaning
that we need a lot of computing power
and in time to generate a number that at
some point completely randomly
we'll start by five zeros as you see in
the last examples so if we take this
example is only for transactions and
certain so let's assume that we start
with having no constraint on how did the
- number we'll stop those zero zero and
then once you wrote to zero three zero
four zero to five zeros if you look at
the times the last time that we need to
generate this number
it's absolutely exponential so in cell
phones your is immediate and when we
have already five we have to constraint
that we need five zeros on our number
this is we need eight minutes in order
to find
number three - we thought that we
satisfy this constraint and joint that
time during the lead-up to the
transaction okay so at each point in
time the note the minders has become
them they do two things they verify do
the proof of work and instead of chain a
new block within the blockchain and at
the same time they verified that they
own copy of the blockchain match with
what's available in interior in the
system okay so what's going to happen in
this case is that we can have at some
point in time you see that CNT will
collide because at some point one node
regulate the transaction because of the
lessons in the system without astral
also another node and the minor that we
proposed this operation is of the block
so we have C and D and for some reason
see with the minute and it will be
enjoyed by a lot of miners and stop
adding new block on top of C so we have
E and you see if we go on like that
you see that so we can have cannot block
that becomes like often we call them
stay block in each community what's
happening with them is that actually
they are not inserted that kind of lost
so two alternative in this case the
original because no change in the first
block chain as we know it this block the
information that are within this block
the transaction details we see that we
have two claims they are range injecting
so in that we have a lot of loss loss
they need to be rejected injected in the
setup we use in our example what's
happening is that they are somehow we
injected meaning that we don't need they
are not waste they are being reinstated
in the blockchain to my exactly the
details but it means that we can go much
faster in terms of validating
transaction with this principle
blockchain thanks
by convention almost 10 minutes to
validate the block for the which is I
would first present how I implemented
the PM deployment on my data set up I
have dr. demian blockchain meter which
is the copy of the blockchain stored
locally on my Azure virtual machines it
has several several tools that accuses
storage account of a recent law bans
have different machines that are either
miner dogs or the actual place where the
plot change spot in the main code you
can see in my deployments
I have several details to access my
material employment this is separate
from the worldwide behavior network as
you can see it's only product to the
people that are locked in with the
wallet
the - to my 0 r pc so this is basically
the address of my I have it's okay
using the back of my wallet plug in on
my browser I can run several
transactions from my local for now local
proof of work application
this is food safe I have to get from
several details of locations I have a
contract address which is actually the
address
well my smart contract is stored in the
Aegean blockchain
okay and these are several details of
their locations location ID location the
secret which is private information
which only people that know the
passwords can see you will see right
away I created first new contract route
okay because this is the web interface
where we can generate and send a
transaction with a smart contract on so
the smart contract actually is a project
using validity for the smart contract
definition in the Athenian project so
that's the language in which you write
this market export gvm you can see here
this is the project which I will show
you later
okay this is the food safe application
in my conduct I have the food safe
passport it has a contract to say which
you can consider as a class in the usual
programming see shuttle for example and
have a stroke called a location which
has several information name location
previous location ID the time stamp
which it was fitted and the secret which
only people with the best read can see
here I have a method to add a new
location using the smart to the all the
information will be stored in my head
either
I have the application in which I'll use
which I will use to get the information
of that smart contact and displayed in
my weather okay this is basically the
class for my location decision here I
have the JavaScript for communicating
with no change in voting so here is a
library that can communicate with the
meta mask wallet I have installed on my
Chrome application this is the food safe
stores which basically is the code of
the contract which will be run on the
virtual machine on which I will send it
you will see right away and I have
several justly methods to create a new
contact and the relocation and get the
occasion stored at the specific contact
address okay so this is the basic
application is really really simple
before I created the new contract
okay I'm create a new contract which
Java through JavaScript it calls the
gate contact address method in the
solidity class I showed you earlier and
it opens up on metamath notification
telling me that I have to send some gas
which is a unit of measure for
transactions in the ATM network it's
different than ETA ETA consent you can
proceed you can use the transaction fee
and know you can actually okay with you
use gas in order to compute the
transactions and store them in the
project that's what I know
okay so I have to spend this amount of
gas for this transaction it's set in the
code of the application it's I accept
the transaction and wait for a few
seconds in order for my transaction to
be mine so what's the things that create
a transaction with the smart contract
comedy it's going to be validated by the
the planning mode that we define on my
regenerate regenerate this possible
check will not be in the blocks will be
somewhere in the blockchain that we
dedicated at rest so we are waiting for
doing that so I got a plan with the
address of the smart contract that I
just deployed and using this address I
can add the information in the okay
cooked I'll show you already the code I
have it's it's really basic I have a
location ID which I said I have a
location name I can set for example in a
secret location of the original provider
which gives me whatever objective
province okay and the passphrase with
which I will encrypt the secret we first
created blockchain okay I think the new
location means running as much contact
this is another transaction obvious for
a confirmation from my wallet the mecha
has buggy okay yes so why do we need
this a secret password actually it's
something that we added on top of lesson
the usual usual setup for this a
transaction we want that so we expect
along the supply chain that people will
share some information but this
information they don't want it to be
shared
everyone that would be the case if you
don't have
encrypt the data and share the best race
so what we want is that they are let us
say that the artists are sensitive data
companies crystal pennies data they know
business data they will be shared as a
pairwise so with few people's within the
within the food supply chain but not
with the other so the leader of
providing evil is illustrated here I can
use the contact address that I created
and posted my location with earlier to
get the current location I can get the
current location and anyone who is
connected to my lithium deployment would
when I showed you earlier you can use
the TMI Christian quotes you know okay
has access to the plot convey
information that haven't encrypted using
the passphrase before saving it in the
blockchain so I got the correct location
information and I can only see the
secret that I've defined using the
pastor's I defined earlier and then I'll
give the actual location of the provider
so basically you can use this set up to
stop puppet information into the
blockchain which is publicly visible to
anyone who is connected if they know the
contract address will take permission
restored and you can use authentication
like this which is pretty simple to give
access to private information only to
people that have the need to see the
information this is the simple smarten
back usage in this case
yeah no it wasn't like that because
guess the gas price is calculated by the
amount of information you sent to the
blockchain so that's first no the idea
is that at first when I created the
contract it was much bigger because I
sent the whole contract code to the
Athenian deployment on Maya's welcome
so you can see here what I defined the
JavaScript at first I have create
contract which sends the full zip code
defied earlier defender here which is
basically all the code of the smart
contract
I sent the smart contract code to the
ATM department which is much bigger much
bigger amount of information sent to the
project and then when I used to add the
new location I just added the the
information I completed myself in the
fields its location ID location name
that is much less information this much
less computation needed to store the
information I don't know exactly how to
calculated its capital on the complexity
of the information that's sent so of
course I send a big smart contract with
all the code to the protein and the
second time I sent
some intergenerational good is constant
you don't pay for a unique spa
it's only when we we need to store some
new data are some new the tutor third
year the spot contractor computation
that you can stop using here are some
context is basically code that you write
you can make different computations with
information you provided as I showed you
earlier the definition of it is similar
to a class but you have properties and
here I have a mapping which is like the
dictionary wires for different occasions
it's really
not exactly not not whoever I know you
can compile it locally using the desktop
PC which is a testing platform so
desktop PC is as I would have a local
eating a banana it provides me 10
addresses 10 accounts and you can
compile the code locally and you'll
receive almost based on your compilation
but I don't know about the body version
because if you block chain test
environment we couldn't test contract
space taxi
so when I first started working in this
and used to have a much less complex of
application and ran it on my test I
proceeded web which is a local say
deployment of Tyria when you completed
with the dialysis it provides and it
won't be stored in a bigger environment
as I have the solution implemented by
Association about the Crusades
application
actually we had a real use case when I
mentioned earlier that we have an
exporter sending some oil from
institutional collection so really this
case involving if I'm just whereas
associated general ing and I was a
commodity trader that is that was the
need to send ships on oil from Houston
to Sunday so we had this use case
slightly different because a lot of
paperwork that we have a copy here
integrated within a blockchain set up
that's a good question I would say yes
we recommend that because the
communities that progress will be made
material but as far as understand there
are a lot of support let's say I cannot
be that exists
let's mention two of them so developed
by the consortium of banks or even
single bank there is caught up and I
seek when we go we remember to talk so
called iced coffee tea brought by our
sweetie consortium of bank and still
they are located in
and I think they want to migrate these
trade finance business using the
blockchain - no we don't need it because
actually it's really like a concept of
private and we go to that it's really
that the private option where all the
the benefits of this concept of a
blockchain are somehow mitigated they
stipulate the blockchain but I'm a bit
skeptical
so the second the second implementation
of let's say I'm surprised blockchain is
poor it's developed by a US investment
bank or GP Morgan and I think it's very
close to that they can modify it a bit
so that you can endure the level of
security of private - no no I'm talking
about
no no it's that's no that's different
I'm talking about the blockchain tests
performed developed by JP Morgan in
order to encasement the one we will
discuss now so we have a in order to
apply these technologies I think trade
finance would be the one that we did
mention because it has a real impact on
the business
in the paperwork it's a very dated
system and
the watch it had provided a lot in terms
of trade families when we shipped stuff
from one area to the other and they need
to get the funding they need to go
through custom they need to talk with
the authority of the different harbours
and so on so it makes a lot of sense for
a blockchain setup to orchestrate on
that the use case we're gonna talk about
now is I think a bit less in terms of
functional functional application it's a
bit less strong I will show you in the
first situation always have in mind is
that the regulator will never never
accept that transaction vector like the
one we are talking about to be a
register on a big project so it has to
be in the private blockchain which is we
say it's the same that is between closed
door and there is that you well that
means somewhere except do you know to
join the blockchain but yes but it's
already something that is different I
mean the purist will say the private
bloodshed is going to be a blockchain
because we need to trust the nodes from
scratch so why do we need work and so on
so the the blockchain features get
downgraded you know in a way and we end
up with something that is purely a
distributed ledger constraint and the
second second constant is that actually
yeah it's really between when we talk
about international transfer that we
have a lot of the existing system is a
bit dated because if you think about
let's assume like bison stores some
Facebook stock
it's good to find out maybe okay a few
years go back mystified nicely okay so I
buy some of the Facebook stocks now and
we buy it on the exchange this big
change as a clearing house where that in
some regions where the settlement of the
oppression when I buy an a receiver with
the other words and it's quite efficient
and I doubt that we have a blockchain
application here the blockchain
application is really when we have a
kind of informal market a kind of
network of Bank and so this is we have a
lot of use case we have a lot of friends
who contract that trades like on a daily
trade network but it's completely
decentralized so it takes east already
and we have a lot of and one of them is
the FX market a fixed market is when I
could go and downstairs and buy some you
all know you would come in some your
anus for something this operation is
called an FX it's similar to be
international transferred to do if you
are living in Canada or successful
developer and you send back to Romania
some Canadians around you will do an
international transfer it's a bit
different the FX operation implies that
we exchange at the same times from
Europe the system drama it's not a
one-way its to Russia and because of
it's a two-way aggression it generates
what we call a settlement receive the
settlement which risk means that at some
point that they sense of Europe expect
some drive from my counterpart but they
will never come so I sent a euro in okay
so we need to mitigate this risk and
this is where we can maybe use case or
this chain that we need so maybe just
because it's fun next time I do you
expect so this is international transfer
as it is in the past you probably know
about Swift it's probably something that
you're feeling when you need to send
someone a role in costume help
so obviously it's a very dated system so
let's see what we do meet from a
Romanian so we are the same thing so you
can have a euro account
yeah from my account I will send some
money to my int accountant so they need
to have the bank account themselves open
somewhere within your area so that they
can say - this is what we call
correspondent bank okay
please send this money to the bank of my
people to move a semi it's complex so
this is where the sweet pitch the winter
swift message and it's very dated they
exist it was implemented I think in the
beginning of the 1980s and it's very
slow very expensive it requires four of
the parties to enter a basic transfer
okay so we have monogram we are also
system now but still this one is in 30
minute so one see so when we have like
zero payment which is an FX impression
when we have two of them I said
but they expect some delay okay so I
said that we have a settlement risk and
this is precisely what about to meander
and we have a system implemented
worldwide that's one of the very rare
case of unity between the band is that
we have a bank called CLS that is a
construction bank located in the u.s.
that's very important because it means
that the the US regulated as an eye on
every FX operation in the graph every
month and they act as a kind of tea
party meaning that when the bank ok team
let's say New York with respect to my
committee did not decide to your
operation didn't set off the effective
kind of cash delivery the cashiers table
- experimental system shows villas mean
that the money will go through this Bank
in New York so there is a set up okay
and the ladies it's kind of addiction
it's a bit expensive for every million
of dollars sent because between five to
eight dollar 20 under suppression which
is kind of expensive for back
so it's kind of expensive system but
still very efficient because we remove
the risk that one of the counterparty
without pay
apply the contract which they subscribe
okay so we have to constraint that we
want to integrate in our existing power
supply so that we make it interesting
for the effect settlement so the first
thing when we talk about with effects
traders and guys who are really do
business the first thing they want to
know is okay the guys were let's say
Verde the guys that city when they can
can they see what which operation and
ending every day
so the first Indian big change them
would say yes they can connect and see
you the transaction that you you end up
during the day so the answer is no I
don't mother okay don't want to stop by
so so the data was this actual feature
metadata is the passphrase the secrecy
needed only the people who is within the
institution with access with this pass
phrase could really see the data so that
this data are not available to everyone
that would be knowledge no I'm
knowledgeable enough in
the position the more the bent not want
to share the position that they have
during the day no one they prefer to pay
instead of sharing the same function so
we would be necessarily in the private
watching because I mentioned that we
know from the regulator and the second
thing is that we need secrecy meaning
that only went to bed doing aggression
they want the issue you only want to see
the aggression not the others so we have
few elements we see the contract we see
the transaction that should be hidden
from the rest of the news from the rest
of the blockchain and you know to have
the banks okay
another point I was a constraint so
because private blockchain secrecy must
be ensured and and the last but not the
least point is that okay now we want to
avoid this see let's see this is the
kind of notary
it's coming look at the oppression
coming from both side and say okay I
received the money from both side we can
enter the transaction I can effectively
route back to the the and the receiver
the money that they expect and it's only
when they actually see that they will
they will transfer they make the final
transfer so how can we undo that using
smart contractor it's more like a real
open question because at this stage we
are working on that if you get caught so
convention is one of the alternative
rock change setup that is being
developed by a consortium of banks so
far in Kota what they are even okay so
kind of Master of the order that would
people
the CLS it would say okay I find that it
was a Chan and I don't know payment and
quality of the load would be here
that would be like light note they
wouldn't mind they would invite a
transaction they would be here than dead
the integrity of the project this case
is very limited for me we think that we
started with an ambitious blockchain set
up and we end up having same as before
meaning of an Italian masterhood that
entered the valuation of disposition and
the payment without the other node to be
involved so as I said we are thinking
about how can we have our smart
contractors not attract that we design
once they are hosted in the blockchain
they will enter the payment so we know
for sure that when the stock contract
has been created it means that the money
from the sender was available but so one
part of the contract can be validated I
can say okay we send some euro to movies
okay nice one who knows we spend and
integrate this transaction in the
blockchain then we know for sure that we
have the money and this the contract
will be executed the problem is that we
don't know if the also for the party as
send the contract or similar contracts
and the okay sent to the other
counterpart some garage so we need to
find a way to make this interaction
between the dish for our contract so
that they check each other that okay
they have similar but me more details
and they will be indicated so that's one
way to endure that the other way of
thinking this problem is to say okay
maybe we have we could use the small
contractors
school supplies this group we need that
if you that has a a puppy once again a
kind of the day that would be created by
the one of the smart contract the
interest my contract and will
orchestrate the transfer that would be
possible to be done kind of self
contract that that would effectively
enter the payment before anyone okay so
that's where we stand right now but also
we have that we think that we have
actually proven use case we have proven
case that actually we can enter payment
that involve typically place something
and we want to remove them to do that at
the same time so that we can be sure
that when I send some money to someone
is send me some offenses he sending back
some dollar the same time and this is
computer story this is building we
cannot avoid the execution of this
experimentation
of cryptocurrency not necessarily the
blockchain officials the guys who are
mainstream with ties and power
they say you don't believe in transit
but we believe in the underlying
technology the blockchain has something
to say force and in the g20 nice people
they say is that the g20 could finance
ministers software bankers and what they
say is that in the natural is that it
doesn't raise a systemic risk
force so they
so once again I say that the functional
effective application is to use case
when FX is small we do it here and
because because we do a lot of FX so
it's nice for us to see about it just
and get used to the technology but most
likely it's difficult to to replace a
system the CLS system as I described I
think of already 140 banks at the end of
transaction payment they made us to be
point if you come to the Swift website
and the case on CLS they already are
testing well budget yes I don't know if
it just announcement or is it something
for real but they are working again
in general technology that we need that
to sha-256 can be so that would be a
probability to is far beyond the
blockchain it's all everything that is
supposed to be secure secure one of the
interesting but it's good bit to be
beyond the purity is that I should
actually if you look at the locations of
the - these days you have a bit of
miners in Iceland but they are all of
the guys they are in China so from this
point of us if you think about the
federal shore industry which is
completely dominated by the US and ok so
maybe some some countries will have a
strategic interest to develop the
watching after all we don't trust China
but maybe even trust this authorized
blockchain
Chinese Chinese might include I see that
okay
in our case you see this yes if you do
an operation between let's say any
country with some country which are
blacklisted by the West you decide to
send them some de la la we go at some
points through the CLS back to New York
so it's means that even if you are let's
say located in Romania and you know
transactional blacklisted company
countries it means that if we go through
CLS New York and in this case you fall
into the u.s. globe because at some
point you went to the u.s. connection so
I suspect that some countries would have
an interest for that because if we need
that these privacy absolute dominance of
the US on this part of the business
could be no surprise for companies that
enter Direct Debit oppression within the
eurozone so I think it's very very
efficient and once again I simply the
national system are very efficient so
far so the interest of using abruption
is really between national payment
systems between they say the romanians
system and the euros so by the way there
is a talk between banks socialization is
being involved there are few European
banks that join together to do something
that people will trade which is a
project to help small companies sending
money abroad and make it expensive
so CS isn't necessarily in between so if
you want to send something out or not
three time but let's say Netflix of
questions
ego specialist so Onix that if you
understood well is to find a way to have
smash contract communicate with each
other and interact with each other or
create the kind of tea party a new spot
contract that would act as a distant
horizon as an ESCO meaning as a as an
Italian that would for this specific
trade validate that the two centers have
the money and get ready to send to send
it so that we remove the settle matters
mr. connection it will be baby - this is
an address after I create the contact
address I can run it by calling it and I
think in this case information I get
from there with which I can save the
information to send this information
the other
yeah what we do is that we we eat from I
can stand building as much as a to what
they were smart contact function I have
defined uses this
thanks everyone
we can always work on this mission</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
