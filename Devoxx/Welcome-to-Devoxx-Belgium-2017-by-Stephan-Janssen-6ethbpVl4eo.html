to start so tomorrow evening at 8 in
this room we will be showing this movie
it's 2 hours and 43 minutes so it's a
long movie so make sure you have eaten
before we start I don't know if you
actually noticed it but we had this
cartoon this year with our ox the robots
and there were some quotes on each
cartoon and these quotes actually came
from Blade Runner the first movie
basically so that was fun
so welcome everybody welcome to the 16th
edition whoo
16th that's that's scary I mean that
reminds me we're all getting older which
is great that's that's fine but what is
also scary is that the more you do this
the more people actually discovered
ethics and the more people who actually
want to attend devoxx
and so we we're again really sold out
already in August that this has never
happened before so the conference was
sold out in August so that means we
really need to make sure that we
actually align the registrations with
the CFP because if we are sold out and
we haven't yet committed or approved all
the talks or rejected all the talks then
that means that the rejected speakers
can't actually register any more so it
becomes an interesting dynamic which is
a positive problem to have but
nevertheless you do need to manage it
but thank you for that
we even had companies last week who
wanted to still be a sponsor just to get
tickets sorry you know we really can't
get any more people in this venue we
actually have 42 sponsors supporting
devoxx and it's also thanks to them that
we can do all of these nice things that
we can have a lower entrance fee you
know it's about 150 euros per day we
were able to do more fancy things like
streaming everything etc so 42 and and
from the bottom of my heart I need to
really thank our platinum sponsors
ardian jetbrains pivotal and ing make
sure you visit them at the booths
downstairs
I mean JetBrains is one of my favorites
of course because I use their tools on a
daily basis and we've got lots of
there's gold sponsors like Oracle IBM
Google Vaadin Google is also here doing
some code labs in the exhibit in the
hallway so make sure you check them out
and and so on so there's there's quite a
lot of companies even Java magazine we
have a very healthy relationship with
where we are able to actually put some
advertisements but I'll probably stop
doing that because we shouldn't be
advertising dev Fox anymore otherwise
we're gonna get sold out even sooner but
anyway thank you to all those sponsors
and maybe we can just give them a big
round of applause for being here so
sponsors is one dynamic of the equation
the other required the other parameter
which is really really important is our
awesome team I know they're not all on
this picture we will have another group
picture tomorrow evening before the
closing keynote but this team is amazing
I mean they're part of the program team
of course but they're also volunteering
the whole week to do the registration to
set up tables to get water for speakers
etc and without them there would not be
a devoxx I mean they're doing an amazing
job and if you see them in this blue
hoodie just say hello or say you know
thank you whatever they will definitely
appreciate that but again a big round of
applause for our team of devils thank
you very much so another dynamic is the
golden tickets so what happens for
people who do not know we actually send
out a golden ticket for the first 500
people who register and paid their
tickets right so the first people who
actually paid for their tickets get an
invite which is called golden ticket and
they get full access to the call for
call for papers so we got up around
eight hundred and seventy eight
proposals which is a new record actually
for us and they get full access and Nick
and Ray talks and there are some
actually very motivated people including
Anna Maria I don't know if she's in the
room here but she is also part of the
Fox days team in Bucharest she actually
spent a whole Sunday from early in the
morning till an evening to rate all the
talks and she was she works for IBM
she's very for all she
really checks everything and she
actually review but is it 794 proposals
and there are quite a few other ones as
you can you can read them on the slide
here so the first six people the people
who went beyond 500 can actually go to
the reception and get also a speaker
gifts which is this hoodie
I know Helmut already got his is nice
red one there is so thank you for your
support because that also gives us an
extra dimension from the community point
of view of what you want to see from a
content but also from a speaker's point
of view and we take this very very
seriously I mean we have our own team
promote or evaluating talks and then
this is another dimension on the view
and say like well if we don't know if we
want to have mark Renault or Brian we
look at the community votes and then
that one is often wonder ok Willie we'll
have them both that's fine so thank you
for that now another one which is a
really important one for me
without the next person our conference
Queen Christine she's over there she's
always very very nervous
and a bit shy but I want to thank you
from the bottom of my heart thank you
for you know your support
anyway I always get emotional cool
so and the other one is the speakers and
without the speakers there's no
conference we have about two hundred and
twenty one I think it's two hundred and
twenty because I ruined Gupta had to
actually pull out for personal reasons
but we have two hundred and twenty
speakers which is already a conference
on its own so without them you know they
wouldn't have there would not be a deaf
Fox of course so again thank you thank
you very much for that a message to the
speakers if you go into the CFP you will
be able to see the ratings real-time so
people can rate on your session so you
will not only see ratings but people can
give feedback on on your content and
that's that's also message to the
devotions if you don't like a talk let
the speaker know you can rate one or two
but let them know what they can improve
in cetera that's very very valuable for
speakers so get engaged and speakers
make sure you go to the CFP and check
out the ratings and the feedback so
thank you speakers for again helping out
and if you did not get your speaker
gifts yet just go to the reception and
you will get your furry hat all right
another one are the top companies I've
started doing this last year and started
looking at the statistics and it's
sometimes really blows my mind
we have kwinter are there any people
here from quint or of course
well welcome I mean you guys are the top
company at devoxx Belgium because you're
here which I think 82 or 83 developers
which is awesome I think you guys are
from the Netherlands yep so they're from
the Netherlands another one is ing also
very pleasant in Belgium of course and
baulkham another company from the
Netherlands with 43 people so awesome
thank you for your support and you see
it on the other slides we have on the
other companies which they have their
own average about with 20 to 25
attendees so that's that's really scary
when we see that registration from one
company which that many attendees it's
Wow so I hope they don't grow more
because you know maybe we need to top it
up and say like only 20 per company or
so I don't know
but thank you for your support I really
appreciate that so another one and this
is for me the second most important
slides Keep Calm we have a lot of people
again as I promised last year I allowed
200 people less during the conference
days I said that last year and I
actually executed on that but we still
have a lot of people here so you will be
standing in queues there will be queues
at the catering etc just be calm
everything is recorded be professional
and just stand in the line right and it
is what it is right so I seriously we
got mails from people begging for
tickets and so on and it breaks my heart
if we have to reject them so we really
maxed it out and one thing to anticipate
what I did as an improvement is that I
reduced the conference talks from one
hour to 50 minutes so that way it gives
us as an attendee 20 minutes to go to go
from one room to the other so hopefully
that will make you a bit more relaxed
you don't have to rush from one room etc
and of course everything is recorded so
just from a practical point of view we
did some enhancements as well so during
the lunch if you want to get your
sandwiches so there now at the top of
the exhibition floor try to respect the
flow so that that hopefully will help
get the people of faster through the
queue and somebody recommended last year
that we should detach the soup from the
sandwiches from the queue perspective so
we did this and so that way hopefully
you will have just two separate queues
if you want to get one or the other and
if people have not yet collected their
welcome back or their nice t-shirt
that's you can see it on the right at
the bar that's where our team will be
also handing out the t-shirts and we
have a coffee mug as well now if there
is a roomful for example the one with
fan cuts which is next or after this
keynote i've already anticipated that we
have an overflow room for him only today
but we also have youtube so a new thing
that we've done this week is everything
is live streamed so if you go on to
youtube and we've got a one gigabit line
going out so you
be able to actually watch talks if
you're in a less interesting talk you
could actually watch it on your portable
the negative talk next door
try it out could happen or you want to
see two great talks at the same time I
think that's the better angle right we
got almost 40,000 subscribers yesterday
we had between 10 and 60 people watching
it live and of course the thing is all
the talks are available the next day on
demand so you will not miss anything so
but try it out because from the one
gigabit we only actually got to 300
megabits so we still got like 702 burned
and I paid for it so you might as well
use it right so let's see if we can
break it talking about YouTube and do
need to give a shout-out to Martin and
Martin has broken all the records he did
a talk last year on tensorflow he did
the university talk and a conference
talk his university talk guts I think
it's probably now at 300,000 views
that's like amazing so congratulation
Martin and I know you're still here and
I'm not sure if you're in the room but
congratulations I mean he just reached I
mean he normally like venkat gets around
120 130 thousand views but he definitely
broke the records and he did some very
guerrilla interesting tactics of course
he uses his university talk to promote
tensorflow on other websites etc if you
haven't seen this yet watch it they
worked on a full team because the
pressure was hard to actually you know
do better than this this year so they
worked with a full team at Google to
make an awesome University talk or deep
dive talk I should say which the he
presented on Monday so if you're into
this stuff make sure you watch the
follow up alright so let's take a step
back and have a bit of a 10,000 feet
view of dev Fox in 2017 we've been
really busy actually this year and I
want to share some statistics from the
dev ox family so in 2017 I've just
written the J hipster application where
I'm actually getting all the CFP
information from all the different
divorces and that it gave me this this
type of statistics
so we did six delphox events this year
well not really correct because it's
five next week it's Devil's Morocco so
once the Fox marker has happened we've
done six which I'll be attending as a
tourist looking forward to the Sun in
Casablanca but if we then actually
combine that we've actually had 1,024
presentations in one year I'm really
happy it's a power of two results I like
that and we had almost well we had 825
speakers which is like amazing that
that's you know that's a lot of
presentations and they all get recorded
so that's that's awesome and of course
if you have those statistics then you
can see actually who has spoken at all
different deaf oxes but also we share
internally the ratings so if you rate we
can actually see who did well or not or
it should be blacklist the speaker or
whatever no that definitely happens but
we also get the statistics of who has
actually spoken at all the Deaf foxes
and we actually have two of them we got
ma tribal and Josh Leung and Matt's
actually did 17 presentations including
next weeks of course and Josh did 13
presentations and there are our deaf fox
2017 champions so congratulations Matt
and Josh I'm not sure if you're in the
room but Congrats and as you know we
have also a Fox today's events so these
are smaller smaller events often they're
one day and they often have the ambition
to turn it into a deaf Fox and we
actually had 12 of these this year and
we did an amazing Fox days I was really
honored to actually be part of the Fox
days CERN which was really awesome
the idea was or the agreement was that
hey interested in doing a fox days CERN
but only if we can go underground and
see the collide around all of that and
derick which is one of our keynote
speakers he was able to arrange it and I
really appreciate that
we've had a really wonderful time and
hopefully we'll be able to do that again
I think in two years time probably so
yeah if you want to go to a local events
linked to the Deaf Fox family make sure
you check out those and we've even added
another one for next year
which is Melbourne so Melbourne they've
got an awesome team there as well we
often work with the Java user group
because they want to use the brand it
actually helped them to get speakers and
sponsors and it can then organically
grow in hopefully a beautiful event so
congratulations to all involved here and
so if you look at that the the slide
which I'm most in most proud of is this
one that means that we actually welcomed
in 2017 16,000 developers 16,000
developers went to these what is it now
18 events which is like wow that's a lot
of people so you know we're sharing the
knowledge and we're really having lots
of fun doing this and for me it's like I
don't organize all those right because
it's a franchise model these are other
user groups doing it themselves so I can
go as a tourist to all these events and
do prospection of good speakers or
topics that I would like to see in
Belgium so I'm just having a blast you
know I'm Jeff just have the best job out
there this is really cool
so anyway mark of course my partner in
crime is well mark hazel is also Co
helping or helping me with the fox days
I mean we both run this as a side job
basically so wrapping up another thing I
wanted to share is tomorrow evening
before the movie so the movie is at 8:00
we do have a closing keynote at 7:00 in
room 5 which is the room on the opposite
from roommate and it's buried under Sun
I'm really looking forward to this to
this closing keynote it was actually
based on a tweet from hardy Hardy from
jetbrains he he tweeted a wired article
and I read the article I just blew my
mind it's about the rise of the
weaponized AI pro propaganda machine
but this was like even before the whole
Trump and Russia thing right because now
we're starting to see what what really
what this can do and she's gonna do a
talk on this she's very knowledgeable
and really excited to have her so make
sure you wanna make sure you attend that
one so it's 7 o'clock in room 5 tomorrow
evening alright and then the last one
which is my second to last slide I need
to do a shout out to light bands the
company I mean I've been using Scala now
for two years because the see if
P is written in Scala so I've started to
appreciate them quite a lot but they
they have been supporting us in an
amazing way they've sponsored the
speaker reception yesterday evening they
are sponsoring the movie tomorrow with
all the popcorn they're sponsoring the
this evening we have a meet-and-greet
where we have french fries and bears so
they're also sponsoring that so I do
want to have a quick shout out to Marcus
and I know Marcus you've got a small
message to say you want to come on stage
here then let me give you the mic so you
can say our wippen friends of devoxx
since ever we might not be able to book
be gold or platinum sponsor but we're
very happy to drop in and actually bring
some fun to the show actually Daniel I
do have something else for you because
I'm you know that I'm a fan of devoxx
for kids since like ever so it started
to be a nice tradition to give you a
little gift for all the work you're
doing with all the kids
and I just want to make sure that you
guys are able to buy some new kids for
whatever fancy actions you are going to
do next year with the devils for kids
crowd so thanks thanks a lot I would
like to take this opportunity also to
thanks all the people all the teams
worldwide and all the people that are
supporting us like like band and Stefan
of course and everybody else for doing
this amazing sharing of our passions to
the children's and show them that they
can also become Wizards of the
tomorrow's thank you thank you again
I didn't include that slide but every
weekend there are two three four ten
folks for kids events taking place every
weekends somewhere in the world it's
it's unbelievable and I don't know the
statistics but we are way beyond ten
thousand children on a yearly basis
probably already yeah it's it's crazy
it's it just blows our minds and so just
keep on doing that Daniel you're doing a
great job there and of course the rune
gupta is helping us in America and I
know butter from devoxx Morocco is doing
an amazing job with the Fox for kids I
mean they've taken like donkeys
whit's backpacks and t-shirts going into
isolated villages and then actually
doing technology with these children it
go like hell I mean that's like I only
got respect for that so it's amazing so
that's my last slide enjoyed the 16th
edition be calm be professional suck up
all the information and if you miss a
talk watch it live or watch it
