audience here so I'm sterling green I'm
an engineer Gradle and we maintain the
Gradle build tool so has anyone here
actually use Gradle at all use it in
anger okay sit so as engineer we get to
work on some really cool things so one
of things I worked on last year
something we call composite builds so
I'm going to tell you about some things
about it so what is the project other
things of all projects come across or
have to make this decision of are we a
multi repo organization are we a mono
refill organization and that has to do
with you know do we want to make it
really simple to build everything
together so we know everything works
together or do we want to get better
performance by people only having to
work on a couple things at a time or you
want the convenience of being able to
refactor some public API and it change
everything in your company you kind of
have this this dichotomy where you can't
you can't have both right so your is the
difference between I have dependencies
that are external dependencies or I have
dependencies that our project
dependencies with external dependencies
you're kind of saying okay I'm getting
that you're getting that version or i'm
using snapshots and then who knows where
which version of things i'm using or i'm
using a project dependency and then I
get you know when I open up intellij or
clips then I get in a huge multi-project
build I'll get all those projects even
if I don't care about them so composite
builds is basically a way of breaking
down that difference of trying to make
it so you can have your cake and eat it
too if you can think of it as was a
composite build you're taking multiple
independent Gradle build and your kind
of sticking them together and what that
lets you do is it lets you have
a bill that's independent and has only
external dependencies and you know it
doesn't have any project dependent or
doesn't use project dependencies and
then when you put it together with
another build that produces those
external dependencies they get glued
together as if they were all one big
project so that looks like is in your
file you can actually say include this
other build from another place and at
lets you have local experimentation so
you can if you're using some external
projects or external library you can
just add it into your project mess with
it and then what if I put it back out
when when the upstream updates again or
if you want to do like I said they see
what do something where I want to change
a public API across the whole company I
can bring all those in for that one time
thing and then once i'm done i can chat
it all again and go back to just a few
projects i actually work on this also
works for plug-in development so if
you've done Gradle plug-in development
where you usually have a project that
you want to try your plug-in in there's
all sorts a little hacks and stuff you
can get do that with but a lot of times
it comes down to you doing a build
publishing it to a maven local and then
consuming it and having to remember oh
yeah you know update update maven locals
I can get it in my local build so I can
try it out but with a composite build
you can have the plugin project you can
have your sample project and you can
glue them together and use them out
right so I'm just going to go jump right
into showing you some things with it so
I have some example projects here I
switchback something so i have in this
tiny tiny tot you cannot read i have a
sample project and it uses some external
external dependencies this number
utilities and string utilities and let's
say i found a bug in those in one of
those utilities and i'd like to go and
fix it
so I could I could say oh you know to do
that I'm going to have to say okay we'll
make number utilities will actually make
that now a project dependency and i'll
i'll come up some name for that and then
and do it that way or maybe that's too
much trouble what i could do is i can
make it I can make it a snapshot
dependency and I could go down here and
i say i'm only using j center but i can
also say okay I'm gonna start using
maven local I could do that and know how
to I know how to build and published it
may even local and consume it that way
but I don't want doing that i don't i
don't actually change my build file at
all i just want to take my existing
project i want to take the other my
external dependencies i'm using and i
want to make changes to it i just want
to I just want to use it so i have i've
already got a copy of the external
dependencies here this is my utilities
number utilities and string utilities
and i can do is i can just say great
hole symbol include builds my utils and
i said this earlier so it's already
gonna be upstate but you can see that
it's doing compilation for this my
utility sales if i did this and it's
also it's also building my my local
projects down here and if i run it i can
actually see the bug as a example
changed I can actually
the answer is so in my example I'm
supposed to be printing out like 19 + 23
18 + 23 42 I already fixed this because
I did this earlier so let's put a bug in
it so you can actually see so I have I
have the other project and I'm going to
make it so that this actually doesn't
work so so I've changed I changed the
third party prop the third party code I
haven't modified my build scripts at all
I'm just saying hey this is other build
include when you're building mine also
build also look at this other build as
I've broken that code and now I actually
see that 19 x 19 plus 23 is some big
number which is not right and if I go
back and I fix it again it'll go back to
being correct so you know this is a givi
idea of I can take taking my existing I
can take an existing build I can take
another existing build I can jam them
together and I can very easily see
changes from either one but let's say I
don't you know I don't want to
necessarily have to remember to always
type include build to me I think this
work like if I'm doing this in CI or
something I don't want to have to like
set this up sale include this other
build over here if it exists so I can
actually do is in my settings file so
this is my application I can actually
say include build and give it the path
to my utils and now if I take this off
run again it does the same thing so
everything's working everything looks
right and I can go in I could do the
same thing I can break it and make it
correct again we see the same thing good
to get the wrong the wrong answer now
when I run it so now I can
I could check it in like this I guess I
hey here's my my utilities this other
build I need to include when you're
building my my app but if you think
about like CI and maybe see I doesn't
check things out you don't check out all
the projects at the same time you can
also make this dynamic because the
settings I Gradle file is just groovy
code like any any other build file they
can do something like only if my utils
exists do I want to include this build
all right so I have my I have my regular
build and if there is a my utils at some
of the location included and then do the
substitutions automatically for me
that's pretty neat if I look at this in
I get clips or intelligent questions
sure so the question is what in this
break my CI build so because this is
groovy code you can say hey only only do
include build if the other project
actually exists so on CI if it doesn't
exist and it won't it won't include that
build and because the build because my
application is using external
dependencies the idea that they would
switch back to using the external
dependencies yeah so sad yet so if I
were to look at this in eclipse or
IntelliJ which all do if we don't we're
out of time there's supposed to be like
an hour long thing moving the rush
through yeah so if you look at this in
eclipse or IntelliJ you would look like
just like any other project like if it
was like a one big bill you've been
seeing really different about it so
another another kind of way of doing
this is let's say that I have instead of
just I having one app I have one
application and I want to include some
other things I want to actually on CI I
have this big multi multi repo
organization then I want to I want to
get feedback earlier than when a new
version of a particular library gets
released I want to know that you know
every day I'm going to do a nightly
build that pulls everything together so
what I can actually do is is using using
using something like hard to see I can
have like a mono repo of composite to
find that all it does is say go and find
all of the bills or in a particular
directory and include them all inside
one build so I don't actually have to be
inside like a application build I can
just make an ad hoc like just this build
all it does is build other builds
without what you do is like if you have
two projects that only integrate when
another version gets released I said of
you finding out a month later when it
release comes out you find out the next
day when when you do this full composite
building so let me go through and show
you what i think is like the cooler
example for me is actually using using
this for plug-in developments so I have
a little consumer build and it's using
our kind of standard example of a
greeting task and what I would like to
do is develop this plug-in and I don't
want to have to publish my plugin to
maven local I don't want to have to deal
with getting it to a repository
somewhere I just want to make changes to
plug in and make changes and then see
the changes in that bill immediately so
if i go to my plugin example
and I go to consumer so this build has a
great ol has a greet and run this from
earlier so i have this the bill that
runs a groove that runs greet our
greeting injustice hello mate and you
can see the same thing here where it
builds the greed of reading plugin
before is executed my task and all that
all it is is that i have a build script
dependency on on my greeting plugin you
can see over here and normally that
would just come from your artifactory or
nexus or some external dependency and i
also have the plugin source and I can
come in here and I can change the change
the best it's like so so saying hello I
can say hey yeah and without publishing
anything without having to worry about
you that I can just run my build again
and I see now it says hey I'm 8 it says
hello and that's like kind of the cool
thing about developing plugins now is
that you're not worried about that exam
what's what's going in your local repo
what's did you remember did you forget
all that stuff so another another
example you know I'll give you some time
at the end of this if I can I get to it
to ask more questions but another way of
using this is let's say that you decided
early on that you wanted to be a monitor
repo company and now you decide don't
know you know we want to actually now
that we have 100 years and because we
have this really structured structured
organization in our repository that
these ten people only ever work on these
two things and
and that's where the thing that we
actually want to take it and we want to
take our mono repo and we want to take
it and split it up into multiple repos
but we don't want to do that as like a
big bang we don't want just like shut
down the company for a week while
somebody goes through and and runs all
to get branch filters you know if I'll
get a filter branches to put the
repository up so what you do is is with
a composite build you can go ahead and
start defining defining what those
little pockets will be what those little
roofings will be and make them all
separate project separate builds and
then you can combine them all back
together as a mono repo so day to day
the the mono repo is what everybody's
still using but if you're in the know if
you have been working towards splitting
it up then you can also just work on
just those little sections so I have the
same kind of example here of the app and
the and the number utils string utils
and it looks very similar of being able
to take my taken my project and I've
divided up already into pieces and I say
oh I've got this number utils module
aggressed ring utils module and I just
plop a settings I Gradle into each one
of them and says okay this is this is
the one project this is my other my
other project and then I'm at the at the
root level I'm doing the blue code to
make them all into one big on a repo
still so that's pretty cool the output
looks basically the same c5's up like I
did a little fun
yeah it looks very similar of it does a
build it does build for these separate
projects that they are actually separate
completely separate builds yeah so let
me quickly go through a couple more
things in the slides so there's a longer
demonstration of what I kind of the same
thing that just showed you from IntelliJ
and they actually go through a more
detail about the actual IntelliJ
integration you can also do all this
stuff through eclipse through build ship
so we maintain the build ship
implementation for the Calypso's the
Gradle integration with the clips so it
does these same things and so this was
always some limitation so you currently
from the command line you can't target
tasks are from included builds so in my
example where I had my app and I had
some third-party libraries i was using
if that third-party library had some
special tasks i really wanted to run I
can't run I can't there's no command
line way of saying in that other build
go run that task or workarounds and
things that you can do in terms of
defining the same task again so you can
call it but but you basically can't call
it there's also the ways that we figure
out what the substitute between an
external dependency and a project
dependency is pretty fixed so it's based
on the group in the name of your project
it's not based on if you're doing have
special publications where the name of
your publication doesn't match the name
of your project then the substitution
doesn't work right now we also don't
execute the other builds in parallel so
if you have a bunch of included builds
we don't have a single task graph across
all the bills to built excuse them in
parallel continuous build that's the
command line flag where you can say you
know build a thing but predict
continuous build
doesn't work with composite build so we
don't see the changes made in the
composite builds through continuous
builds it's like this stuff like never
want to use this now because i'll just
have broken good it's really good it
really is good this is like not a big
deal most of these things and we're
doing more work on this this year so
another thing you can't do is nessa
composites so nesta composites are where
you have a bill that includes another
build and then you want to include both
include that one as well you can only go
one level right now there's also some of
the things where if you wanted to have
if you want to include another build and
say it only works with Gradle 11 and
your builds working with Gradle 3 4 135
RC was out yesterday please give it a
try but if you wanted to import that
build and only worked on an older
version right now they all have to share
the same version so whichever whichever
build is kind of the outermost build a
subversion of Gradle that we use and
it's also no support for build scans so
build scans are a like build analysis
tool that cradles working on Radel the
company is working on and it gives you
insights into like a timeline view the
pendency discs all that kind of cool
stuff right now they don't support
pulling out build information from
composite bills but that's just sort of
a work they need to get to so those are
all the slides there's some more
information go and get at greater com if
you would like to ask me some questions
I have apparently another 10 minutes I
can be happy to try to answer some
questions and I also try to go through
and do a little demo with link towards
IntelliJ actually import the project and
see you sit in there so any questions
good bad
how's angel transient if it's also a
good question so it handles transient
transient dependencies just like it with
normal dependencies so it's not you
don't have to just have you know the
first level dependency gets substituted
if any dependency along along the graph
could be substituted we will substitute
it so if you if you know it's like one
is an external dependency and another
one is a project dependency we can or it
could be substituted we will put it in
there okay all right so i will go back
to the one example i had at the very
beginning and i'll actually generate the
IntelliJ config fort was it cold
alright so this is the the bill where I
had a basic app and I added to the
settings file and include for my
utilities for the settings and for the
string and number utilities and now if I
actually open that in IntelliJ sure
which side for the prefer so this is
just generating the IntelliJ
configuration and this is for for the
things that fought settings gradual DAT
file settings not Gradle file so here I
have I'm just saying include this other
bills that's got my utils from the
current directory and we open this up
you see my wonderful organization here
so yeah so my app and my utils to show
up as regular regular old modules and
IntelliJ which you cannot see and I'm
going to make bigger and if I were to go
in here and and remove this and run
again would actually be broken because I
don't have a local copy of those
dependencies but i refresh this and now
goes back to only may be showing my
youtube / I have to remove the other
things away okay
so goes back to just I removed the
composite now I'm back to just my one my
one project which has one source file
because so it's so so good and if I go
back to doing this again with include
build my utils from the command line
again and take a look at IntelliJ I've
got back back to having all three
alright here's our questions and what i
can do is i can actually I'll tweet out
a link to this is this video which has a
longer demonstration of it all so i'm a
tard file kemberly surprise was
available so i only got that last year I
sure I think it's something like connect
I want to say it's something like
composite builds and IntelliJ or
something like that so yeah composite
builds with Gradle and IntelliJ you'll
see very similar slides
yeah thank you okay anything else I'll
be around to answering other cup of
grated questions you have not
specifically about to seal a good thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
