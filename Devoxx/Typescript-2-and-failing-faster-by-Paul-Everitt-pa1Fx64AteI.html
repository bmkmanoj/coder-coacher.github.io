script to and failing fast as my first
devoxx first java conference so i wanted
to what am I talked to get accepted so I
thought I got to put something pithy and
clever in the talked I'll something that
connotes success and so the word failing
came straight to mind and this is a talk
about failing fast with JavaScript with
typescript trying to change your
front-end tooling to give you faster
feedback on teens and stuff like that
I'm Paul Levin I'm a developer advocate
at jetbrains I work on pycharm and
webstorm i do not work on java if you
have any java questions I'm not the
person for you and I thought it's kind
of clever that I'm a Python guy my
background is for using Python in 1993
for WWE mm long time ago and since then
I've stayed in the Python world of
JavaScript world and I just think it's
kind of funny that for a talk on
bringing typing to JavaScript at a Java
conference they're getting a Python guy
to give that talk it's just pretty funny
I guess they wanted a world expert and
all of those people were unavailable
this Hulk will be magnificently boring
if there aren't any questions I think
I'm already too loud so even if if you
get to fake it or if you want to ask
like what's for lunch tomorrow please
ask some kinds of questions keep us all
awake we just had lunch I ate two
cookies I admit they were good and so
we're all going to be dragging a little
bit and so I will start the kick off
with who has ever used typescript oh I
got a different question who can see me
over this podium all right Thank You
DevOps for giving me the mini-me version
of the podium but for those of you that
have used typescript how many of you
have used typescript without angular all
right what did you if I can ask what did
you use it with
mm-hmm okay yep in fact i'll get i'll
mention i'll come back to that and just
saying what did you use typescript with
okay let me ask both of you a question
on that was it a positive experience all
right I have to admit this is a beginner
oriented talk so if you're looking for
deep typing can I say then
you're got the wrong Python guy for that
mr. instead I'm going to try and give a
little bit different flavor of a talk
and the point of the talk is about
failing fast javascript is dynamic yeah
we could do hello world in like point 7
characters whoo Java you can't do that
javascript is dynamic boobs you have no
idea how you screwed up until many years
down the line so the emergence of
Microsoft's typescript partially because
of the deal with angular and with Google
to replace 80 script is a very clever
one it's still JavaScript it's just a
small little superset you can use none
of it in the beginning kind of the
Taipings will get in their way a little
bit and you can gradually use a little
bit more and buy into more of the
kool-aid and with this as you do this
the typescript compiler will let you
will tell you you've made a big mistake
instead of having to guess later or I'm
sure all of you javascript developers
have one hundred percent unit test
coverage on all of your web applications
but still and then this compiler idea of
typing and failing faster combines with
tools like webstorm from us and Visual
Studio code and some other tools to give
you a visual feedback to say that you
screwed up and what does this get for
you when you're programming in the large
like Java applications might be or the
stays larger JavaScript applications
such as angular there's you just trying
to get stuff done and then there's that
framework which you love which might be
changing at a very rapid rate the
contract between you and it if that
contract is hope for the best you're in
trouble typescript can help improve that
come to that contract kind of the same
thing for a team of developers where the
smart gals are creating the high-value
stuff and the junior guys are consuming
it that contract between the two if it's
expressed in like docstrings that might
not be enough to keep up with the pace
of change and then finally this is the
one that I joked about having Paul
Simers it's a joke it's kind of not that
funny there's code that i right and I go
back and I'm like looking around like
that guy's an idiot oh that was me the
future me really doesn't like the
current me and so the current me tries
to give some self defense for the future
me by trying to express more intent in
the code typescript lets you say that's
a number not a string it lets you say
many other kind of decisions baked them
into something that's enforced rather
than just a convention so for this talk
we're going to talk a little bit about
typescript just as es6 raise your hand
if you've heard of es6 briefly the
JavaScript language is actually changing
again and they found a way to change it
in a way that doesn't require browsers
to stay up to date all the time through
something called trance piling so es6
ECMO script fix is a flavor of
JavaScript turned into year based yes
2015 2016 2017 which includes a lot of
innovations and typescript even if you
don't buy into the typing you're going
to get that es6 stuff and the JavaScript
or the typescript compiler acts as an
ESX transfer
so the old browsers can still use it
then I'm going to show typescript typing
but I'm going to do it outside of
angular I have to admit in the program
it says this is an angular talk on the
way here the angular language service a
recent innovation to allow to Ling to
turn over the work of parsing and
handling angular typescript kinds of
constructs caused me a lot of problems
so I dialed back the angular part it's
like the last third and then so we
finish in the end with failing faster
and angular showing how angular is a big
typescript project and then the web
storm project managers are swiping and
then as a consumer of this big big
angular typescript project i can write
typescript and know the changes they've
made and whether i'm out of date any
questions on what the hell is typescript
before we begin any comments about any
of the points made so far raise your
hand if you were a tight script God okay
someone's lying someone's going to ask
me a question I don't know the answer to
so in this first phase we're just going
to do some preparation work on es6 in
typescript it includes some of these
features from uf6 es2015 etc we're going
to show these features of inaction we're
going to show them in node we're not
going to have a browser around at all
we're going to sit in web store i'm
going to click a little button that's
going to run some stuff and show some
outfit i decided to reinforce this idea
of producer-consumer whether the
producer is angular in the consumers you
or the producer is a senior developer in
your junior developer or the producer is
the current you and the consumers the
future you I want to show this in action
in a very visual way and so I'm going to
be the consumer in test-driven
development I've got to run under mocha
and consume some typescript stuff so you
can see a little bit about that contract
in action more specifically I can click
a little button in webstorm it will run
things automatically in that so cute but
I'm trying to convince myself that there
is an actual teaching point on this so
the very first thing we're going to do
is show this environment TDD this surely
doesn't have that much to do with with
typescript so over in webstorm i'm going
to have the code that i will eventually
start riding on the left i'm going to
have my tests over here on the right and
i'm going to just say expect one to one
i'll say equal deep all right and so
it's running and i'm going to run the
tests test suite it's going to run side
by side and then i'm going to click this
guy so that it runs automatically so
that as I tight every two seconds it
will rerun everything and pass or fail
so this is the kind of environment for
the presentation that i'm on code will
be i'll do some coding here but later
i'll lose a code over and import it and
we will gradually build up some tests
yes I did
ah good play Trish is that better you
acting I've got 1600 pixels so I can
make it bigger let's go with 20 all
right but that doesn't make this all
that kind of noise down there anyway
okay on to the next one let's do a
little bit more from es6 AKA es2015
let's do bars and this new thing called
a cost so i could say something like for
d equal one and then expect d to equal
one and the test runs fine on that
except webstorm is telling me this thing
in a font that is pretty small VAR use
instead of letter kant's what does that
mean well in java script VAR has had a
long and sordid history about lexical
scoping rules and things like that and
so es6 akes 2015 came up with two new
keywords to replace VAR const which is
used when the value won't be the
primitive value won't be reassigned and
something else called let so i'm going
to go to the bar i'm going to ask
webstorm to help me here a little bit
and i'm going to verte this to const my
warning goes away and my code still
works fine if i were to try and say d
equals to not only with my test fail but
the typescript compiler is actually
going to warn me with a reasonably
helpful error message dude can't
reassign a Const I think that would be a
better error message than this so we
will not reassign that cost alright so
we solve our and cons what about this
other guy called let i'll do another
example fails again same error message
so what i want instead is a let and the
word let as a keyword of
years in all kinds of places including
an angular templates get my test passing
again and try to change your code away
from VAR Caesar consular let most of the
time you can use a Const to try and use
a constant yeah call at any time when
you know I'm saying something that is
incorrect you stick that hand up and you
tell me all right nicely I've got a
fragile ego onto another thing from es6
AKA es2015 and friends by the way these
things are actually implemented in
modern evergreen browsers when you start
thinking about life after IE six seven
or eight a lot of these things are
available without transpiring in class
is one of them so I'm going to create an
es6 class and then i'm going to write a
test to see if it exists it'll be a
pretty simple class it does nothing and
then i'm going to let the equals new
record and expect d2
okay so I create I used the new keyword
which we've seen in JavaScript forever
and ever but those are four built-in
kinds of objects or the object kind of
thing that has the constructor it not
something that looks like a class sure
this is lexical sugar maybe around
underlying prototype type behavior but
for us for all intents and purposes from
a typescript perspective it behaves like
what we would expect from odd object
orientation in actual class classes have
much more than just a couple of
squirrelly brackets so let's put a class
property on let's write a test let's
make the tests fail and scratch our head
why did that test fail and then use web
storms debugger to set a breakpoint at
the place of the failure and take a look
around so I can go in here and I could
say title equals acne and I can say the
title sue equal hack name so that works
but let's say it was actually oh I'm
sorry I thought it was named and i wrote
a test that said name well the
typescript compiler gives me some help
it's already done its job of failing
faster web store more Visual Studio code
will put a squiggly line and if you open
up this tool panel the typescript tool
panel you'll see all of the compiler
warnings across your entire project so
what is what the hell did I do wrong i'm
going to set a breakpoint here and i'm
going to go to I'll go to the yeah and
run the debugger and actually no because
it's not compiling as typescript at all
so let's just say it wasn't the value
that I thought it was I thought it was
going to be that value
and then I can stop in the context and I
can do all those badass visual debugger
things that you would expect I can set
watches I could step into co step over
code step into my library code multiple
breakpoints breakpoint conditions watch
expressions blah blah blah blah blah all
right i'll get you passing again good so
we have a class which is a bold new
thing already from the future of
javascript in time script and we've got
a class property let's take one more
step so that i can get over to working
on code instead of doing everything in
the test let's do an import raise your
hand if you have done an import in
javascript with any technology
whatsoever require j/s or anything like
that not too many kind of hard to
imagine something calling itself an
actual programming language that was
created with no semantics for importing
code from one module to another the
people behind the TC 49 committees at
the name of it 73 tricky the atmos crypt
committee that is behind all these
standards is sorting through all this it
has been an incredible journey for them
trying to both preserve some level
backward compatibility with no Jazz's
import system and then also work in this
web model where you sent off a request
to import something maybe it comes back
maybe it doesn't maybe comes back after
the other thing that imported it blah
blah blah so we have some technologies
including typescript which will let us
do imports now I'm going to move my
class over to a separate file import it
and do my tests
this guy taken out in order to make this
symbol visible from the outside after
you export it in some fashion you can
export several symbols or one as the
default I'm just doing this symbol not
as the default so now I've got something
over here which is broken directory no
longer exists because I haven't imported
it i'll have my tool do the import for
me and now i pass again and so I've
taken a nice little step into modern web
development I can have multiple files
they're not stitched together in HTML
script tags they actually semantically
lexically can be pointed at each other i
can break things by renaming if you did
this with script tags take you awhile to
note that you made a mistake here okay
so that's my imports again the whole
idea failing faster as soon as I put
that X in front of directory my tool
told me that I was screwed or my test
told me that was screw but my tool
definitely told me that I was screwed
linting I will just kind of wave over
this one a little bit not go through all
these steps we all expect to have
lenders the world JavaScript has had
linters over the years typescript also
has lenders this field actually has
gotten very interesting in the last
couple of years with es lent TS lint
shipping different packages you can
install to buy into standards from
different people so I'm going to go back
to here and run you again thank you got
out of sync yep and if I did NPM install
as a development dependency TS lint
which I've already done then in my tool
I can go to the configuration panel to
enable it I'm going to enable
yes let's here's its module I'm going to
tell it to look for a configuration file
that has all the rules for my linting
let's take a look at that guy and for
example let's say I change my mind
double is the new single then my
everywhere in my code I'm going to get a
warning from the tool telling me exactly
what that error was and then there are
many different ways I can override it
just for this line just for this file or
I can go back and as God intended put it
back to single just out of curiosity for
JavaScript who uses single quotes the
good guy who uses double close yeah no
one's going to raise their hand now till
you really Brendan Brendan come on come
okay yeah that's your reminder for when
you're in JSON right all right before
switching over to the typescript part
that is the non typescript typescript
that's es6 with the typescript compiler
any questions on es6 stuff imports
classes any comments to add to what I've
said yes let allows block scoping yes
and that winds up solving many problems
that JavaScript developers have jumped
through their butts trying to fix over
the years yep oh I should point out this
thing right here is probably weird
looking for JavaScript developers that's
called an arrow function it's an
anonymous inline function whose lexical
rules and all of that it's not just
syntactically way more convenient it
actually behaves more correctly in the
scope that it's in hey let's do some
types good first thing let's put some
typing into my constructor past
and in an argument for the title to the
constructor so I've got a class over
here I'll have a constructor so let me
start a constructor I'm going to put in
a title and black skirt tells me I
failed I know I failed by default things
are public but i'll go ahead and be more
specific so i need to put in acne OOP
OOP area Oh uppercase all right super
good identifier title yes so I need to
get rid of that because I'd already had
a feel for that so all my code works
again i'm passing in an argument and i'm
saying that this is public if i were to
say that this was private then I would
have a typescript compiler error shown
to me in my UI because a typescript has
public private and protected as
different rules for things you can put
on fields so you put that back to
actually I will use the handy dandy so
we're starting to get into a little bit
of typescript typescript has a concept
of public private and protected next
thing is like for example I can say d
title equals 42 that works even though
it was a I'll leave it 42 and leads a
test message even though I passed in
Acme i reassigned it acne is a string 42
is an integer typescript that can
complain why didn't it complain because
I've done any typing yet so what i will
do is I'll put typing information on
here and say this is a string and now i
will get an error the consumer of my
code was made very painfully aware of my
intent because I put a tight constraint
on that value that kind of thing helps
in large code bases it helps when you're
consuming a framework and in fact when I
am going to all these that later get my
test passing again let me go ahead and
put another value in I'll say and in
this case this isn't something that i am
defining in the string i'm defining it
on the class and saying whenever you
have something called code it's going to
be a number so i can after the fact say
decode equals 42 and that works because
by default its public but if after the
fact i said string 42 then the compiler
would be mad at me because that is not
what it's allowed to be let's take a
look at this private thing I'm
reassigning code the actor the field
code from outside of the class from the
consumer is peeking into the instance
and jamming a value on if I say that
this is private then this is going to be
a compiler error because private means
this can only be reassigned inside the
class this one succeeds but this one
fails in my test pass again because this
is inside the class there's one other
thing called protected this is really
only useful in inheritance hierarchies
any questions so far on typing any
points to add yes up here I don't caught
is not something that's interesting I
don't think you can in order to indicate
that it's read-only immutable I should
be immutable I don't think you can I
think const is more of a lexical scoping
thing I think that do you know if
typescript yeah cough do you know if
typescript has a way to encode in the
type information that something is
immutable okay it's not the same right
static is the things that never behaves
exactly the same as I think it does ok
onward what if we have not just a single
value but a list the value so in this
example we're going to add another
method it's going to return a list of
employees and we want to get some type
information on that we're going to add a
test to test the length we want to show
producer consumer again having to test
have some self defense against the code
that it's testing so for example this
employees it's going to return Paul so
I'm going to come over here instead of
making another test I will just say
clones equals deed list employees I get
all the completion and expect the
employees got length to equal free so my
test pass but I'm not really getting too
much value from typing on this
I'm not really saying what is the return
value of this and then I can't really
use that over here for any kind of help
so let's add type information about the
return value and this is going to be a
bunch of strings so the type is string
and then you put this afterwards to say
that it's a sequence of strings that put
them in place I did let you let's see if
this can sniff out the return type so
that isn't exactly what I want I'll go
back to string and then over here is
self-defense between the test and the
code that it's testing let's do the same
thing so i will say a list of strings so
that if Paulie boy future Paul comes
along and changes this to a bunch of
numbers and i'll just say nine ten then
this code is fine but the test fails
sure the test actually the test would
pass if I put one more thing in there
because there's three but I'm not
getting back the thing I expected I
would have to change this to a number so
this is self-defense between the code
being tested and the code that's you are
the code that's being produced in the
code that's using it let me go back to
string
alright next thing I want to do is a
method to add ppl lowercase string is I
don't believe that aight aight script
type it's something else that was found
in the autocomplete I don't think you
can say Kenya
okay I didn't know you could do
lowercase you can do lowercase I've
never see the examples of that anywhere
i'm going to add have a method to add a
new employee to the lift and then for
the ad i'm going to show putting a type
information on the function argument the
method argument so add employee i'm
going to pass in an employee and i'm
going to say i need to add to the list
of employees so i'm going to take this
move it to the constructor which is
going to lead to a type failure and i'm
going to ask you to create that for me
but i'll actually make it string like
that and so this dot employees and now i
want to push on to that the past in
employee at this point i want to test it
i want to add another employee and it
just gave me some some help it told me
the argument and it currently says any
because on having type information on
the return value is void so I'm going to
say Joe but i want to add the type
information i want to say let's be clear
about this you can't Pat you can maybe
try and pass me a number and in some
ways that will work but it's really
violating the list of strings so instead
i want to make well i'll put that back
as a failure mode I want to make it
clear that you need to pass in a string
and so this the typescript failure the
compiler now fails automatically I have
to go back to Joe
if i wanted to be very clear about the
return value tight script can infer that
i didn't return anything so it knows
it's void i can specify it explicitly on
to something a little bit more fun bags
the data let's say that employees it
just a string an employee is a number in
a string something all of us feel deeply
about our employees ship so for example
instead of just adding Joe I need to say
ID of five and name of Joe and maybe
Department sales I've got a failure
because it's no longer a string well how
can I represent something that is
multiple values I'm going to make an
interface to define my bag of data
and so now I can say actually they're
passing in this interface called
employees a bag of data it's an object
with some values in it that conforms to
this interface now this is failing
because instead of a list of strings it
now needs to be a list of employees and
then these need to get changed to see I
got autocomplete now that I've got an
interface and this is no longer return
value of strain list of strings it's a
list of employees all this code is now
good and my test needs to change it
needs to be my tool was able to look and
find the symbol that I created called
employee hit enter it generates the
import for me and I should be it i
believe two employees now now that
worked out pretty well we enforced an
interfacing code we have tests we can
say this bag of data has a certain
structure but what if not everybody is
in a department maybe Joe when he's
first hired you know we haven't decided
what to do with them yet Jill is in an
apartment but Joe isn't I can solve that
with by putting a question mark and so
now the interface will be considered
valid weather department is there or
isn't there that is the tiny step into
four hundred pounds of type theory that
I don't understand there's lots and lots
especially with typescript two lots and
lots of ways to model the shape of your
classes and data and interfaces and
contracts and things like that I want to
make sure we have enough time to get
into the angular stuff so I
going to skip oh well I'll just show one
thing let's say that I have in my tests
or somewhere else in my code just a
free-standing variable called department
I can rename this to division in all the
cases in the interface usage are renamed
but not that freestanding variable
because thi scrip understands code
rather than lexical strings and things
like that and you can do find usages and
extract and other things on the the
structure of the typescript where's the
angular that was in the title we're
going to do a few things a quick tour a
component take a look at how typescript
is put to work we'll start with the
first thing a quick tour I'm in a
typescript project I'm going to fire
this puppy up and I'm going to go over
to my browser once it gets transpired
takes a little bit of time the first
time it fires up after that it's the
trans pilings faster and I've got an
application with one route in it I can
generate a new component and my tool
makes this easy for me I can make a new
component I'll call it directory and it
will put out a bunch of code on disk for
the new components on a wire this into
the interface and sort take a look at
some of the typescript part of it so I'm
going to go to the component I'm sorry
the module which has the various routes
in it right now there's only one route
and I want to add another route to go to
that component i just added notice that
I can autocomplete on things in this bag
of data it's a sequence of not class
instances just of objects I'll show why
we can do this
second so this is directory component
autocomplete directory component it
generates the import for me and I can in
the template and now I have two routes
let's take a look at how tonic script
helped us on this we're going to pick
part several things on this if i look at
this router module dot full route it's
passed an argument is passed in this
case a single argument a list of objects
how did typescript know and how do my
tool know what were the key the
properties for those objects i'm going
to jump to that function definition and
it's a static method on the module and
it has an argument called routes that
conforms to this definition when i jump
to that ralphs is a sequence of route
objects and this is what it looks like
this is how my tool knows this is how
the compiler knows that if i said path x
that's a failure because that's not
allowed in this object why is it not
allowed because it is not one of these
fields in this interface in the old days
of angular 1 you just be screwed you put
something in there maybe it would work
maybe it wouldn't work maybe last year
at work but this year doesn't work maybe
the thing you read on Stack Overflow was
right at one point but is no longer
right in the world of angular 2 with
typescript we can enforce all these
decisions and as angular changes from
version to version they ship new type
information to let you know what is and
is it possible before i go on yeah
coffee you have anything you want to add
to that part about typescript and
angular
so I will open up my package.json and
show it there's these weird dependencies
at angular something this was a move
from the old ways of installing type
information where first you had to get a
dot d dot d tests and then typing it
well these are the types for the non
angular projects the but it contained
doesn't isn't that the NPM package that
contains the type definitions for right
right right yeah yeah yeah sorry there
yeah right there's not this two-step
thing where you manage your types
separate from the code right yeah I
skipped over the low dash example where
I was going to show a non typescript
project where the types are not in the
project because it's not in typescript
all right so I also showed that the
changes are loaded automatically but
that's not that important for for this
in in routing we showed about looking at
the interface that's behind all of this
one of the things I could do is take
this guy and extract it into its own
variable as a Const now my route
information is up here and I could put a
type information on that called routes
so that i could think a little more
clearly about my routes
could even take each one of these
segments and put them down in the
directory with the component that it
goes with again this is self-defense
against changes in angular or in
components that you create is the API
the shape of the API or the data changes
then you will be warned you'll be told
exactly what the problem is another
thing kind of will it's not necessarily
typescript it comes from the ECMO script
committees you can get another
transpiler is decorators so for example
this component decorator it has the
ettes eine in front it is something that
wraps the thing after it so this class
becomes a component because of this
decorator which then can be configured
with the argument passed into it in
angular 1 we didn't have typescript we
didn't have decorators necessarily so
this was all done by convention by
having a argument list that you pass it
had to have magical names that might get
blown up when you minify dependency
injection this is a really cool place to
apply the benefits that we get from
typescript in angular applications it's
like the sea of components out there and
services that you're pulling into a view
or component in using to do an HTTP
request lookup routing information talk
to a database whatever and pulling those
things in in the old days was hard
because you had these magical names now
it's a lot easier because of type
information when you use typescript with
with angular so for example in my home
page component let's say I want to
display the current route so in the
constructor I can say
rounds yeah activated rel and at this
point I've told angular to go find an
instance of the component act of class
activated route pass it into my
constructor with the name of route and I
might then want to say what is the path
and show it in the template this thought
route path equals route dot and I'm like
when I don't know what this stuff is how
about the route config yeah that that's
getting warmer what path yeah that's
what it is except I need to put a type
information on that so that's a string
and I can now in my template say the
route path reload and on my home page it
shows the route path again dependency
injection it went and found a component
of that class passed it in under this
name on to the let's see one of the last
things i want to show about angular is a
tour typescript and angular abstract
classes this is an abstract class called
on a net which is part of angular's
lifecycle methods the creation of a
component is done in stages and you can
put things coat hooks in four different
stages what the hell is on a net well it
just means your class has to have an NG
on a net method if you do not have an NG
on init method then the compiler will
complain to you very specifically in
Gion in it is missing no kind of hope
you find out when you've reloaded your
browser tells you exactly what the error
is so in the world of angular lifecycle
management that assignment is actually
better done later on in the
let's see yep that takes it so I moved
it from the constructor to the life
cycle paths with actually which actually
helps in testing I want to test this
component I don't want it to do 50
things during construction I might want
to construct it with a bunch of mocks
and then testings part by part in fact
the better way to do this and angular is
to extract this into a different method
I'm missing something okay i will stop
on the angular part at this because I'm
a little bit over I was going to show
doing the interface bag of data in the
angular side as well angular has
something on top of typescript called
the language service which gives even
more information that's specific to
angular I have a little bit of trouble
on that so i'm not going to show it best
word of any presentation in conclusion
typescript lets you have some
self-defense against the frameworks you
use against your co-workers and even
against yourself to formalize the
contracts and always fail fast any final
questions come to the jet brain smooth
if you have any questions or Corrections
thank you for showing up
