so I okay I'm going to stay here I have
a tendency to walk around the stage and
I realized that um none of you can see
me when I walk around all the way so
let's remain here my name is Miriam and
today we're going to be talking about
whatever happens when everything else
has failed when you've done your best
but the website is still slow what can
you do so my name is Miriam Jesse and as
you can probably hear I am a bit French
quite a bit actually I'm also half
Hungarian so this is pretty much a
license to drink a lot and be very very
vocal about how angry I am thankfully
I'm hoping that we'll do this just fine
and have a laugh together so you can
find me at at Miriam JCA on Twitter if
you have a few questions I have a
tendency to answer quite fast unless
it's somebody asking me to actually redo
their entire marketing strategy in 140
characters it's not happening so let's
get started actually no I'm sorry I lied
really today is International Women's
Rights Day March 8th yeah I'm pretty
excited about that and the only thing I
found a bit sad when I showed up here I
love the team from Fox de Zurich and I
feel so privileged to be here talking to
people but I noticed that there's only
three of us ladies out of you know more
than 30 speakers so I'm not a data
scientist but that's like closer to 8%
than anything and I know for a fact
because I have friends in Zurich that it
doesn't really represent the developer
community here so I wanted to take a few
minutes and a few slides of your time to
talk about this and not in the manner
that you usually see which is diversity
we should be better society is failing
we already all know all this like I get
it what I wanted to ask the public is
hey next year or maybe you know in a
week or a month for your next Meetup how
about you encourage some women to pitch
why because most of us don't feel
comfortable enough to pitch we always
think that somebody has a better
idea or a better thing to say which
isn't true but it's still in our heads
so if you could encourage a few ladies
that you know go for it
it'd be nice and you can also mentor
them and tell them hey I completely
 up my first talk here's what you
should avoid that really helps - it
would have helped me for example if
somebody had told me that PowerPoint has
this weird mode where it will decide to
push all the slides at once without
giving you any control so no matter what
you say the slides are going to go
faster and faster and faster until you
lose your mind and somebody in the room
raises their hands and goes well you
know this is a developer conference and
you should know technology a bit better
which personally I thought was hilarious
because by our point as a technology for
me is a concept so you know I learned
next time Google slides my slides can be
offline my computer can die I can steal
someone else's computer and still good
that's my stuff you can also give
visibility to your colleagues very often
I see this when I go to work women will
do something and it's great and
everybody in the team knows that they've
done it but the boss never hears about
it
so it kind of sucks if you can take a
few minutes to go actually we did this
together and was pretty awesome great
and the last point is listen I'm very
bad at listening I love talking but I
still make an effort why because these
past two days I was in Luxembourg giving
a workshop and we got around to
discussing like a workshop on technical
SEO it had nothing to do with diversity
and we got to talking about the fact
that sometimes I'll walk into a room and
I have men walk out I have men tell me
that hey you're really really funny I
like you in the office but we're you and
I are not gonna be able to work together
because like y'all III can't
and then I'm confusing like you mean
marketers because I get it I mean I also
hate my own kind and I go no no no no no
women go oh this is gonna be bad
so I explained a few stories you know
around the coffee machine to some of the
people I was working with and they went
no no no no this isn't true anyway
please trust me like no III can't think
of that so I turned around to
another lady on my hey let me stop you
right here do you have you a few
anecdotes something that happened to you
at work and then the guy that was with
me you realize that actually it's a real
thing it's the thing that happens so
that's those are the few tips I can give
you to celebrate this kind of day but
beyond that if my clicker will work I
made an effort it took me an entire 15
minutes to make this five minutes to
actually find all the images and 15
minutes the rest of the 15 minutes so
ten minutes to figure out these
wonderful effects
let's enjoy them together not really but
that's as far as I go in terms of design
you see a few ladies on the screen I
just picked them not randomly but there
are people that I deeply respect and
that I would be excited to see at Vox
days so you have Marissa who's amazing
and she's in Dublin so it's not really
that far
I mean Fox Days came to get me from
Canada so I'm thinking doubling is
pretty good
you have Pauline who's in Amsterdam I'm
sure she can bring you amazing gifts
from there if you negotiate with her and
she also has very very good opinions as
you can see her Twitter bio is what
convinced me to get started talking to
her
you have Stephanie Stephanie is very
unusual in the sense that she's an
amazing developer but she also does LED
designs
yes this is Stephanie's work and if you
want an umbrella a dress a plushie that
happens to be LED equipped she's the
person you need to talk to or if you
want her to do a talk about what she
does as a side hustle it's also great
you have Gabby who's actually all the
way in New Jersey but she used to be in
England she does a lot of data
engineering and Google just snapped her
up to be developers advocate so I'm
pretty sure Google will pay for her
plane ticket you have Katie that I also
met in Germany she's somewhere in
Manchester doing amazing things with a
guitar in code you have Simone oh that I
actually haven't met but um we're secret
Twitter pals and she gives great advice
you have Stephanie and she's not even a
dev but she used to be and she's an
amazing UX designer actually the talk
that I'm doing you can find a video
of her doing a much much less angry
version of this and it has much much
more scientific insights so you can
leave that room thinking okay I'm gonna
be smart with Stephanie call her up
she'll be happy to come
you also have Jemma and she's pretty
kick-ass too but you know what let's
talk about Zurich Zurich is not my
hometown I don't know Zurich very very
well but I do know a few ladies that are
in the front row and if they want to
show up after the talk or during the
talk they can do so if not just poke
them there in the front row you know
where they are and it's not you can go
via Twitter and ask
Madalena if she has opinions or she can
help you get started or get in touch
with some wonderful developers who also
happen to be diverse and I asked her I'm
not just recommending something and
they're not doing it
so these are a few names that have
popped up for Zurich Wow oh this one is
a cheat I added that one because she was
supposed to be here today and she helps
Vox days quite a lot if you want machine
learning she's your lady oh and she
disappeared and came back again so we
have quite a few names why am i doing
this on Twitter well because if these
ladies don't want to use their first and
last name publicly I don't want to give
their LinkedIn or their personal website
this is an easy way to reach them and
you can reach out to them there's quite
a few more that I would like to talk to
you about but I either haven't gotten
their approval or they're only on
LinkedIn or via email so I want to
respect their privacy but if we've been
able to put these slides together in you
know a few minutes I'm pretty sure an
email from you guys would only take a
few seconds and then they'll know that
you actually do want to have their
opinion and have more visibility but
that's not our topic so our topic is
what do you do when everything else has
been done and your website still feels
slow and when I say feel slow
I'm not saying that it's you know
theoretically slow or you measured it
and it's actually still okay I mean
feels slow you've gotten complaints or
you know this and you're stuck you're
stuck because this is out of the realm
of what you can operate on so I have a
few tips all of them will be Depeche
Mode songs because I don't know why but
these guys seems seem to be perfect for
performance so it's a question of time
yeah but what kind of time that's a bit
of an issue I do believe the clicker has
died I rest in peace no I do believe my
computer has frozen oh this is amazing
okay I should learn to deal with
technology a bit better I would like to
let you know that we as humans have
achieved something incredible we have
won the fight against goldfish we beat
them by an entire second yep
our attention span is now one full
second shorter on average than a
goldfish do you realize what this means
for you it means that you're actually
fighting a fight you almost can't win we
have zero patience
we can't even handle a website loading
nowadays so what do you do well you
consider what time really means since
you can't impact my attention span that
much time is an illusion okay so if
punch line said it maybe have some truth
to it let's look into that you have two
types of times and I know you know this
because you've gone through school
you've gone through visiting grandma
you've gone through bureaucracy you know
that objective time the time that's on
your watch is not necessarily the time
that's in your head personally if you
let me get lost on YouTube like the deep
YouTube the random YouTube I can spend
hours and it will feel like a blank and
then if you ask me to debug someone's
code for SEO purposes sometimes it's
super fun and sometimes it's angular and
feels really bad for me so that's how
your brain perceives time it's a
different notion so I'm telling you that
this is an illusion
but at the same time we have an issue
remember when currency what you paid for
used to be money now time is the new
currency attention is a new currency I
am NOT giving my time away for free
I have had to suffer through on Twitter
multiple social media influence or
platforms I have algorithms that detect
people that are potentially great
ambassadors for your brand new startup
or brand and the problem is that most of
my friends are either developers or
they're doing dev up stuff our data
engineering so all the jokes that I make
are a super nerdy and B use all the
proper keywords for me to be identified
as an influencer for um JavaScript
frameworks and DevOps
and data engineering and I don't do any
of that stuff so I get random pitches
via my direct messages from people that
identified me asking me to take time out
of my day for free to do something no no
no no no no no I'm not giving you that
currency away so I asked to be unlisted
with a few angry threats because I do
that well and my time is now mine again
this year I decided that my time is so
much more my time that I kicked out half
of the blogs on my RSS feed reader I
decided to mute a few people because I
don't want my time to leak away that
much so I don't think I'm the only one
and that's a problem because it doesn't
matter how fast your website is if it
doesn't feel fast for the user we leave
not only are you making me waste my time
but you're making me waste my currency
my value so that's why good design and
I'm not a designer by any means I'm just
a very angry user today is about saving
time so yes it's an illusion and you're
gonna try to catch it up so I did this
wonderful graph as you can see I said I
wasn't a designer of at least it's
purple this is how we perceive time as
human
so what does it mean well within 0.1 to
0.25
is the time we usually spend to respond
with as humans so let's say if I were to
talk to you and you took a second to
answer I'd be fine I mean it's
Illustrated most of us scream give me
just a second
that's the point and then the optimal
user flow goes you know a bit beyond
that time all the way up to about five
seconds I think it feels fine I'm going
through the flow this is okay I'm
confident and then at ten seconds you
actually lost me you completely lost me
like that's the maximum attention span
that you can get out of a user while you
load your stuff so this is problematic
especially if you work in the banking
industry with legacy systems where for
me to apply for a credit card I have to
wait a good 28 seconds and yes I
measured because it was on my cell phone
and I was eating sushi so I was
sufficiently distracted to put up with
it I still didn't apply for the card but
you know it's kind of a challenge and I
realized that yeah it really takes a
meal for me to pay that much attention
to you if you take that mug but there's
also other issues that we can talk about
and this time perception it's not only
about perception for your loading time
but if you happen to be offline or if I
happen to be in a train like last night
with incredibly crappy service my
connection is going in and out I saw a
wonderful job it was amazing it was I
think marketing manager for unity in
Montreal perfect the problem is I wasn't
perfect for me he was perfect for
someone else that I wanted to send the
job to so I kept clicking and clicking
and clicking and it's not loading and
it's not showing me the loading bar and
nothing is happening in LinkedIn and
then a full minute later when I finally
catch service again it tells me
congratulations you have applied for the
job successfully oh I think this is the
first time I'm going to actually have to
apologize to a recruiter and say my bad
I'm a bad crappy
servus happened and here we are today
but there's this other candidate you
should talk to so you don't want that
happening to you either do you let's see
how we can fix that so how do you
improve the perception well first of all
you can't make it objectively faster
think the darn thing load faster and if
you tell me you've tried everything I'm
not gonna go through the list of things
that you should have done I'm gonna
trust you I'm just going to say that as
a marketer I have three separate load
time reports in my tools that can show
me which pages are taking forever
I know user timings I can see by page I
can see by conversion rate I can see all
of this I can see where you are making
me leak money so don't think we're not
informed we're aware we just don't know
we don't necessarily have the tools to
ask you to debug specific things time
indicators are a well well tested
tradition of telling people please hang
on it's happening and as you can tell if
most of you have dealt with Microsoft
computers in the past we are incredibly
patient in front of that blue screen
that tells you hey oh oh my okay yes
okay well let me get back so when he
tells you know hey it please don't turn
off your computer that's the first thing
I want to do first of all and second I
actually don't trust your Microsoft
because your time indicators suck I know
you lie this is bad this is bad because
hey I'm not distracted enough and as you
can tell my personal distractions happen
to be sushi there as well
I don't know what yours are but they
should figure it out and the second
point is if you're gonna lie and tell me
what wait time there's no wait time
which is a great way to handle it you
better but make me believe your lie
otherwise it's not gonna work keep me
distracted so what is this thing this
thing is not necessarily a brand new
tool but a relatively new to I think
yeah it's a few weeks old Google decided
to show you literally that there's a
link in my slides you'll be able to use
this tool if you have an e-commerce
website you can literally put in your
domain I tested it your current speed I
lied
your current monthly visitors average I
also lied and your average order value
you conversion rate and then you can
play around with the number of seconds
minimum speed current speed and see how
much money you're leaving on the table
by being slow and what I mean by being
slow is this tool is really really
really concrete
it measures load times in store in terms
of objective time but my firm belief is
that if you can make me wait in an
enjoyable manner you're still gonna get
that money so second tip world in my
eyes still a Depeche Mode song I'm
telling you these guys have an entire
discography for UX things that impact
our time perception are easy to separate
the first thing is the task type how
hard is it okay so let's take an example
how hard is a task of reading a 3,000
word blog post hypothetically it's not
if I give you my full attention if I
have a small child clinging to my leg
while my chicken is burning and my
husband is looking for his pants
maybe that task is going to be
incredibly hard for me and I'm gonna
know this and I'm gonna say I'm gonna do
this later later meaning never I mean I
never did apply for that credit card
because when I called to get a human on
the phone it took me 22 minutes instead
of 28 seconds but still then we move on
to our prior experience do I know this
do I have an easy way to estimate what
this will entail how long you will take
how good it will be for example there is
a marketer that publishes a lot of long
blog posts and how hard is the task I
know it's going to take me forever to
read this thing but also it's very hard
because he keeps having pop-ups
everywhere in hello bars and promotions
and I can't handle it
so my prior experience is do I know this
oh yeah I know it's gonna be annoying
and then my current state of mind am i
happy personally I I do get angry but I
get hangry years so it's this thing
where you're hungry and you're angry
the same time hands sushi again so my
state of mind will impact the load time
perception that I have so this kind of
sucks for you because from a technical
standpoint you've done everything right
and I'm still complaining you can't win
so what can we do well you can start by
creating a memorable user experience
okay great so how do we get started what
you see here was very difficult for me
to capture in four movements it's
actually an animated gif of it I do
believe it's the tiniest cutest little
lemur I've ever seen taking pictures
look giving a side eye okay so I'm
mesmerized I keep watching this and if
you do check out the website it's called
gratis ography and this is where most of
my pictures are coming from they are
free to use so this is pretty great and
they do this thing because it's an
entire website of images loading so
basically developers nightmare they have
these little lemurs and I'm excited to
see them every time even though I'm
looking for the pictures huh I have to
keep reminding myself that and this is
what it's all about
create a memorable experience for your
user so what does this entail for you as
a team well you could get sassy what is
your brand about what is your company
about how about you have fun with your
users how about you go a bit out of the
norm
remember how we try to make 4 or 4 pages
kind of fun do the same thing the lemur
is perfect for me but if you're a bit
more corporate I know that there's a few
example of corporations doing that very
well if they're tied to the heirs for
example a bird moving is kind of fun
it's distracting and it's not the same
type of sad bar or blue screen that
Microsoft gives but what else can you do
well first things first
in case of a doubt you always have
Martin split the person who introduced
me and I like to stuff him in every
single one of my presentations because
it's the perfect stock photography
I mean if it's perfect you can start by
moving it transitions and animations can
help greatly you know why because if I
feel past
and stuck in front of a screen I am
going to get angry my perceived
time is going to be much harder so if
you make animate things I'm no longer
passive I'm engaged that works
keep it smooth okay use your browser
browser to animate things in a fluid
manner because if it's not fluid then
you're shooting yourself in the second
foot why because I'm watching your
animation not work well so then your
load time distraction is having a low
time issue we can't win and the last
thing is simplicity is key so keep it
simple this is not Disneyland I'm
telling you about all these fun little
lemurs and all the things that you can
do I agree but I have also had clients
who are in insurance and send me and
this is true the Disney World website
and tell me I want to do something like
this it's not your place you can be a
little sassy you can't be Disney because
if you're Disney I'm not trusting you to
take care of my health or my house I'm
trusting you to entertain my kids for a
day the other thing is ask yourself one
very very very important question should
you make the user wait or should you
reassure them that things are going well
if I am buying a thousand dollar plane
ticket take your time
like don't double charge me I'm fine
I'll wait just let me know it's going
well let me know I'm not gonna have a
timeout so it really depends load time
depends some users in some cases are
willing to wait because it reassures
them we know certain processes do take
time okay so my patience towards my bank
for example is going to be a bit greater
than my patience for when Twitter
doesn't load stuff it's a bit different
ask yourself that you don't need to be
an expert you will quickly know
depending on what your industry is and
then we have a frog relaxing in the
bathtub why well because a it's
available MB because speed is perceived
as faster by relaxed users remember my
metaphor of the
kid stuck to my leg the chicken Burnie I
have no kids by the way just cacti oh
and the husband looking for his pants
I'm not relaxed things are not going
well why isn't this loading what's
happening is the internet broken again
oh no it's the website Oh what am I
gonna do
I'm sure you've done that before and
then somebody tells you well actually
it's already loaded and you're like huh
okay well this one time it worked so
even if you've done your job well and it
actually did load I still managed to be
angry because I'm not relaxed and unless
you offer me psychotherapy or you're
there calming me and soothing me you
can't have an impact on that but you
have to keep this in mind are you
dealing with angry users because for
example if I'm trying to file my taxes
like everybody else at that same moment
and nothing works of course I'm gonna be
angry but you know this so you can plan
for it if you know that I'm relaxed you
know you have a few more liberties but
raise that up do ask people okay you
want me to optimize your load time but
what's the state of mind of people using
this what can I do
tip number two number three lie to me so
this sounds a bit this dishonest but if
you've objectively done your job
correctly or if you've done your talk to
your best ability because we all have to
deal with someone else's code sometimes
or we all have to deal with it you know
multi-million dollar Akamai contract
that undoes any other efforts you've
made to optimize your performance well
all you have left is lies but they
better be good one of my favorite quotes
in the world is gone is by Winston
Churchill tact is the ability to tell
someone to go to hell in such a way that
they look forward to the trip let's do
this with performance let's do this with
load times make it enjoyable make those
10 seconds that shouldn't be enjoyable
well please not 10 seconds but still so
as you can tell I'm not a designer you
can see the background on this but keep
in mind that if you're going to lose
use time indicators and loading bars the
more revolutions an activity indicator
has the faster loading time will feel
and I find this very interesting because
for example this thing I could watch it
for hours I can't help it and I showed
it to my husband he's like oh I hate
these things they're disgusting and then
I realized he just hated the colors but
the revolutions were actually working
I'm like I showed him this versus
another indicator I'm like which one is
faster he's like well the ugly one I'm
like okay good to know
thank you it's still remaining here but
there's another thing if you accelerate
your progress bar at the end it will
give me a sense that things are loading
faster like I mean the tractor is going
faster right I mean personally I've been
watching this at least 30 times I'm like
coal tractor go go go you can make it as
getting faster you're gonna do it you're
gonna do it I'm watching it as well with
you okay okay yeah yeah we're almost
done we're like I know the end and every
time I'm disappointed once the same for
you guys when you're creating a loading
bar your process should speed up at the
end for me it's a bit similar to
something in medicine doctors know that
patients have a tendency to remember the
most painful times and then they hang on
to that so it kind of sucks because then
they get afraid and the whole operation
could have been benign but they remember
that one high point same thing here the
high point is I finally made it
Microsoft and then I'm stuck at 92% and
it feels like I've been stuck at 92% for
five years this is problematic so lie to
me tell me it's going faster tell me I'm
in the last line this is gonna be
awesome I'm almost ready to have it and
please don't leave me hanging I'm not
gonna make you watch this again but if
you want to it's available in the slides
but there's another thing hey we all lie
we all tell ourselves lies you know why
because it makes it easier so if you
look at things
on the left gosh darn it Facebook is not
loading again I don't know what these
guys are doing it's supposed to be easy
and on the right is why did I buy an
Apple product again they want me to
upgrade my phone again and that's why
they made it obsolete no actually it's
the same situation it's just different
perceptions so you test that next time
let's see if you can you know implicitly
blame someone else I'm not saying it's
fair I'm saying it's gonna work and it's
gonna keep the user trust tip number
four everything counts yeah it's still
Depeche Mode for some of you that don't
know this band because either you were
born in the 2000s or we have different
musical tastes it's pretty fun like I
dare you try your next talk to use one
of their song titles as each of your tip
titles it works it's pretty magic so you
have to bring interactions into play I
keep talking about this but I didn't
really spell it out if your users can
interact with things that they can see
while it's still loading or even if it's
loaded already they will remember that
your website is faster is it true well
objectively no and you know that but you
know perception is perception and that's
what you're playing on at this point
because objective went out the window
quite a few cycles ago and this is one
of my favorite interactions ever so
these are custom quotes for slack's
loading screen you can actually
determine these quotes I mean the slack
team has some pretty fun quotes by
themselves but as you can see we have
our own as well so my friend Lauren
started doing this and I decided this
was going to be hilarious and I realized
that nobody noticed I put in my own
because nobody complained yet but my
favorite one that harkens back to
women's women's rights day is the fourth
one the one that
how the room probably doesn't
understand and the other half being
French Swiss does a woman without a man
is like a fish without a bicycle it's
got nothing to do with it that's the
main point so if you want to have fun
and if you're giving your users the
opportunity to have fun with your
loading time because you know things do
have to load like we can't buy that
bypass this give them an opportunity to
engage to interact and that will go a
mile this makes a huge difference every
time I open this specific slack I'm
actually excited compared to the other
ones that cause me anxiety and then
there's another point I know all of you
have played this game right did someone
never ever click on this oh my god three
of you okay a I want your internet
provider and B you need to get a sense
of whimsy that spacebar is begging for
you to click it and you will see you
will waste a lot of time until the
internet comes back why well because
Chrome decided oh maybe you're not using
Chrome that's also another possibility
in that way I'm not going to force you
to use it but you can play this game
while you're offline I know a distracted
and it's great because sometimes you're
in between two busses in somewhere in
eastern Asia and that's all you've got
everything else is either moost
or completely wet and you're still
waiting for your bus so this can be a
lifesaver and this buys a lot of
goodwill your users will be happy to use
your product so this brings me to
something else I do not know what
transportation really feels like day to
day here but let me give you a bit of an
idea in my town I think about two years
ago they decided to implement some
network in the Metro sadly not my side
of town so for the last four stops until
my house and I do live in the center of
town I know like off into the boonies
this gives you an idea of what I'm
dealing with I don't catch anything
I started loading stuff and I'm stuck by
myself
at best at worst I'm stuck with someone
staring at me and asking me if I dyed my
hair color to cosplay something that I
have never heard about so this makes for
a very uncomfortable time so if you
think of your users and your load times
beyond load times just simply load times
but if your user is stuck offline hi
we're having fun if you want to join no
oh okay so this is a link to resources
that you can use it's a wonderful github
that has a Bible of things you can do to
make it easier for things to load
offline why because I don't care if I'm
offline half of the time I haven't even
noticed I've gone past that stop you
know the point of no return in terms of
network and somehow it's not your fault
but it is because I perceive it to be
because I want it to be because I am
stuck so if you make things a bit easier
for me offline or if you preload a few
things it makes a world of difference
and if you want to know how much of a
world of difference it makes for me it's
about fifteen dollars why well I didn't
get Spotify Google music not that I'm
sold to Google
it's just that Spotify has a tendency to
cache
roughly one and a half songs at best
Google will cache a lot more so when I'm
stuck in that metro I at least have
music I'm paying for that thank you for
thinking about it hi we're also having
fun join us please
so we're talking about how you can make
people feel much better when they're all
flying and we're gonna move on and I
know you're expecting a few more tips
but there's just one slight thing I have
to show you before and I'm hoping that
it works okay no-oh-oh for those of you
that didn't see it okay okay get ready
I'm so crappy at games okay hold on hold
on hold on
I warned you but we agree this was fun
so hold on I'm not really hoping then
this works okay remember how I was
talking to you about offline tada
this was not planned huh okay great
am i good huh I like their little
loading thing okay no wait yes
do I have any sound there's an amazing
sound effect and I'm so glad that it's
done locally but oh yes offline first
sing-sing so the reality is you have to
know your public because plot-twist this
wasn't the Star Wars intro you expected
truly I mean I'm liking the music and
there's no Star Wars but it's a great
book I absolutely love it
the thing about this is you have the
ability to make people wait for things
it's okay there's no shame in that
you just have to know your audience and
I clearly knew not my audience because
someone was able to do the soundtrack I
showed this to someone else and they
looked at me and went this is so boring
and slow no no no no you don't
understand I actually used this service
when I want to apologize to a developer
I go into slack I just paste this thing
in since this you github they're like
okay this is gonna be okay and then they
open it and they're thrilled because of
like oh you apologize to me for messing
up my code and it's awesome yeah well
you have to know your audience it
doesn't cost you anything to be a bit
creative and one more tip never let me
down again still a song still so very
true
78% of customers feel negative emotions
as a result of slow and unreliable
websites and it's to the point where I
agree with someone that told me only 78
percent it's true that's true there's
websites
I will not shop on because the
experience is so insanely slow I mean
it's so slow that I'm not even adding
things in the cart I'm hoping to see
what you sell okay
or or
you could be government website and I'm
just hoping I end up on the right PDF
but I don't even know what it is because
you're forcing me to download it for two
hours I don't know why so be very very
careful the way you work impacts
people's modes it really does I mean now
I'm filled with anxiety because I'm
really really hoping that recruiter
doesn't call me back
and I'm not the only one except that
some people are a bit more vocal so what
I find amazing if you look on the top
Facebook slow to load that's a query I
typed in because I'm the type of person
who loves Google autocomplete like my
favorite thing is why do goats leave it
at that and have hours of fun watching
the replies and the autocomplete but
Facebook is slow to load and you can see
that people are are trying to debug
their own problems like Facebook is slow
to load on iPhone oh oh no way way way
it's not no no it's not Facebook it's
just the comments can you please give me
a fix for the comments actually no it's
just my iPad no it's Firefox it's images
it's Chrome it's photos people genuinely
want to fix this stuff instead of you
like they don't want to wait they want a
quick fix and then if you look at the
bottom it says load times and then I was
wondering who's the angriest about load
times and I found my answer it's video
game players I mean I really really
enjoy the fact that the first one for
World of Warcraft they managed to stay
polite I don't know if it's because
they're automatically censored or if
they made an effort but it's kind of
amazing like I never seen crap right in
this way see Star therapy okay and they
are very very very angry I mean you've
got to be kidding me with the load times
page two like there's a second page to
this and Google determined that it was
actually the best one out of the bunch
I'm pretty sure they were more so also
it's like blaming Chevy for making a
truck that doesn't fit if somebody
understands the context of that please
let me know so you have to keep in mind
you really really impact users emotions
so if you play so much on their emotions
play on them positively with the tips
we've been given you really can make a
difference be creative think outside the
box as they say although I hate that the
entire concept stay true to your company
straight to stay true to what you're
doing your product and users will be on
board with you you can also load dummy
content so if users are able to interact
with your website they they are much
happier because they come to expect
immediate responses to their actions
remember my clicking four or five times
on LinkedIn I was expecting a feedback
and I got none until they told me
congratulations and that was not the
feedback I wanted so you have about 0.1
second remember my beautiful purple and
pink graph you have point one second to
make that happen
that's almost magic but you're not magic
Louis so let's stay pragmatic what can
you do one of the best examples for me
is Pinterest because they kind of went
the extra mile with the dummy content as
you can see the dummy content the colors
are kind of close but that's their thing
I mean this is a company that is able to
really understand what images are about
at least they're very advanced with
google lens as well like those are the
two ones that I saw be quite good at
this so they're matching the colors so
as a user I'm interacting with the
content and I'm already wondering hey
that light blue what is it gonna be oh
it's a beach actually that kind of makes
sense oh wait this is a beautiful beach
maybe it's time to go on vacation when
is summer again I don't have to wait for
summer it's cold enough I can go see my
mind went on the trip already
so this is something they can quickly do
or you can go to lemur wrapped that's
also another option and then there is
one last thing that I want to talk about
and I'm not even going to give you a fix
I'm sorry because I think that if it has
its own Wikipedia page it should be
fixed by the community have you ever
heard of felt no I know you've lived it
when you load something it's a flash on
of unstyled content and the problem with
that is I know you're trying to load the
website objectively like I'm a rational
human being I'm
the content is being loaded I see
something shows up but it either looks
like notepad had improper relations with
my browser or it looks like you've been
hacked in my mind I don't trust you I
mean this content is crap it doesn't
look anything like the experience I'm
used to so I'm kind of freaked out for
half a second and if I'm freaked out my
default is anger or anxiety and then the
website loads but I can't quite
dissipate the emotion you've instilled
in me so this sucks
this really sucks as a user and I'm not
going to vocalize this because most
users well they're not devs they're not
gonna go hey that's unstyled content
that I'm seeing like that text sucks
that guy should have them bla bla bla
bla bla or that girl should have done
bla bla bla bla bla and even as a user
if I understand I end up calling
customer support because I really want
to help out
I mean I've ended up in situations where
I will tell someone hey do you know how
databases work I can't merge them but
you can't add them both and you you've
just kicked me out of my own account
because you did a merge and they're like
ma'am no you don't understand how this
works I'm like oh no no I do I really do
and you should improve your user
experience so even if I call with the
knowledge it's never gonna reach you
guys so it sucks so what can you do to
fix this well it depends on your
situation it depends on let's say the
CMS type that you use it depends on the
fonts that you use if they're custom or
not just you know what look into it
please and that brings me to the end I
just wanted to say thank you first for
the two ladies or actually 23 years that
I listed thank you for the three ladies
I have in front that supported me today
and Martin that introduced me and if you
want Google slides because you're lazy
and want to work offline they're here
and if you want those insane photographs
they're available at gratis ography and
you can check out the Lemur thank you
very much for your time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
