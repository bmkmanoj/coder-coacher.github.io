computers are coming I'll be taking
questions at the end of the talk so if
anything comes up try to remember it so
Who am I
my name's Alistair Collinson I'm a
software developer for xenical
technologies and blah blah blah you
don't really care about any of that to
you there's really not much you have to
know about me but one thing you really
do have to know is I'm a nerd in fact
I'm so much of a nerd that my colleagues
call me a nerd one of the main
contenders is sitting over there and the
colleagues the call me and our you know
other computer scientists and
mathematicians and physicists now
personally I'm not a physicist not in
any stretch of the word yet I'm here
today to talk about quantum computers
the thing is we are getting to a point
where you don't have to be a physicist
anymore being a nerd is quite sufficient
to start working with quantum computers
and that's what we're going to do today
so first of all what is a quantum
computer two parts to the term let's
start with the easier one what's a
computer well this is a computer rather
older than what most of you are probably
used to but this is a replica of the
tusers III arguably one of the first
computers out there it was certainly the
first digital programmable electronic
computer and the digital or binary part
of that is really important because
basically mostly everything that came
after it was binary now when we say
binary normally we think about zeros and
ones but that's not really correct if
you get to the base of it is it
basically all we need is two distinct
values and for what we care that could
be a no green circle and a red triangle
just have to be distinct now
computers that we use in our everyday
life and work are based on transistors
much smaller than the ones depicted here
but same principle the principle being
that depending on the input of the
transistor gets it either let's the
current go through or it doesn't and
this is great for many many problems you
can solve so much with this attempt I
mean just look at what we've managed
over the last few decades but it's not
perfect for everything and I'm going to
give you an example for something that's
that it's not so great at with something
that you as people who are visiting a
talk on quantum computing in the
afternoon you're probably nerds
so charts are you well you may be
familiar with it nature so nature is
really difficult nature is non-binary
what do I mean with that well we're in
this image do we have forests let's just
look at a small part of it here this
part that's certainly forest right and
this part certainly isn't forest but
what about this area here I mean there
are certainly trees there but most of it
is grassland so where do we draw the
line and that question where do we draw
the line means that we have to make a
decision we have to decide so many trees
per I don't know square kilometer
whatever means it's a forest and
anything beneath that means it isn't and
that's an arbitrary line we are drawing
we are artificially making it binary and
that's where the second part of the term
quantum computing comes in quantum
mechanics quantum mechanics was first
caught up by my Nikolas Bohr and vanna
Heisenberg in the 1920s and they worked
together Heisenberg being Bohr's
assistant for quite a while in
in Copenhagen they came up with the
basics of quantum mechanics and what
became known as the Copenhagen
interpretation of quantum mechanics I
don't want to go too deeply into the
material not least because as I said I'm
not a physicist so I'll go with an
example the example is let's imagine we
have an atom this is a radioactive atom
we don't care about the whole atom that
we only care about the nucleus okay I
said this is radioactive what does that
mean that means that at some point it
will decay which means part of the
nucleus splits off and this particle
alpha particle in this case is emitted
so assuming you start out with a full
nucleus after time you measure the state
of that nucleus and there's two possible
situations that you could get you
couldn't measure that's nothing changed
at all or maybe a decade and according
to the Copenhagen interpretation of
quantum mechanics you can have both of
those states at the same time they
overlap that is until you measure and
then it decides I want to be very clear
here measurement does not necessarily
mean human intervention measurement is
anything that depends on the state so
we're not adding consciousness to
physics here but nevertheless it is
rather weird to think something could be
in two states at the same time and we're
not the first people to think that in
fact one great minds we also thought
that was this guy here Ivan Schrodinger
and Schrodinger came up with a thought
experiment which showed just how absurd
this mo this notion was the experiment
you well quite a few of you have
probably heard about it it's
Schrodinger's cat so let's go through
roading as cat experiment just very
briefly we have our cats and we could
put the cat into a box
now also in this box of your other items
namely some radioactive mass now this
mass was chosen very specifically so
that within an hour if you measure after
an hour the chance that you wouldn't
measure any decay at all is fifty-fifty
okay so we have that mass what else we
have a flask with cyanide gas cyanide
gas is of course rather poisonous so
it's better if that gas stayed in the
flask and last but not least we have a
Geiger counter with an attached to
hammer so what happens if the Geiger
counter were to detect any radiation
dead cat okay so according to what we
did just now if you measure after one
hour there are two states which you
could measure one in which the the
radioactive material has not decayed so
everything's fine and one with the dead
cat and if you believe in the Copenhagen
interpretation you get both of those
states you get them at the same time
they're overlapping
so our cat is dead and alive so what
what's dead and alive at the same time
bigger wasn't thinking of zombie cats in
this case instead he came up with a
another interpretation of quantum
mechanics because he did think that
quantum mechanics was correct just the
way people were thinking about it was
nonsense what he came up with became
known as the many worlds theory and this
states that you take everything there is
the world the galaxy the universe I
couldn't find a picture of the universe
but let's take the galaxy here and in
that galaxy you have among other things
your cat now when
such a radioactive event happens so a
situation in which the radioactive
material may or may not decay or at
least that would be what your
measurement would show rather than
getting that weird zombie cat here what
happens instead is this the universe
copies itself with everything exactly
the same except for the result of that
quantum event and everything that
followed from it so here you have two
universes one with a live cat one with a
dead cat and of course this can happen
again giving you four cats and again you
get a picture now one thing you might
notice in this image here is we have
rather many dead cats and that's a
problem for any cat lovers of course and
it's also due to the fact that biology
just works that way and if you have a
cat a dead cat and add more cyanide you
won't get a live cat biology just
doesn't work that way
luckily qubits are not cats
and qubits are what are important to us
in quantum computing so now we're
bringing the two topics together what is
a qubit a qubit is the analog of a
regular bit you know those things with
distinct States two distinct states in
our regular computers and qubits do can
have the value 0 which would look a bit
like this in the representation I've
chosen here that's called a Blas fear by
the way so a vector pointing straight up
or it could be one which is a vector
pointing straight down so so far so good
but it can also be somewhere else on
this sphere so suddenly we have so many
more values of a
that could be present at any time and
actually this vector here is a
combination of zero and one side now if
you find the maths you're confusing
because you know zeros at the top ones
at the bottom and you add them up and
you end somewhere else this is a
three-dimensional representation of
four-dimensional vector space math gets
weird if the math confuses you just
ignore it we don't need it for this talk
now like with any binary computer or
generally binary electronics we can use
certain gates to modify our our qubits
so the first one I want to talk about is
the Hadamard gate if we have our qubit
in this case in in zero state and we
apply the Hadamard gate it imagines that
there's further axis between the X and V
Z axes and then spins our vector around
that axis if you were to measure the
value of the qubit in this state you
would get 0 &amp;amp; 1 with equal probability
so you would get 0 one time you measure
and one via another time you measure
this is what's called quantum
superposition and it's going to be
really really important later on so try
to remember that not everything is quite
as exciting though I mean you do get for
example the power Li X gates which
assuming again the same starting
position at 0 if you apply that it just
takes the x axis and spins our vector
around there which basically makes this
a kind of not gate around the x-axis
that's comparatively simple to imagine
it gets exciting when you combine this X
gate with a condition and that's
called the conditional knot or the
cenote now this is a two qubits quantum
gate and let's imagine that the this
gate here is our measurement gate our
control gate so the idea is if that is
at zero and we apply the C naught gate
then nothing happens to the second gate
which we'll call the target if it's at
one our control gates at one we apply
the C naught then we'll get the effect
we got with the ex gate so far so good
but what happens in this case what
happens if our control gates is in
superposition and what happens is
basically this suddenly we have two
arrows there and it's maybe a bit easier
to imagine if what we write or what we
show is this here so basically we have
the control gate and the target gates
locked together they're entangled this
is the situation we had with
Schrodinger's cat and the radioactive
isotope earlier they're either both zero
or they're both one you don't get any
states where they're mixed up any other
way this is called quantum entanglement
this is the other huge concept the
quantum computing drinks to the table
now it doesn't actually look like this
in fact it's closer to this because we
haven't measured at any point the the
control gate isn't measured in the sense
of us looking or you know any other
physical process requiring it that isn't
quantum in nature itself so we do have
an overlapping state we do have
superposition in both qubits now
okay so that's very theoretical we'll
get to some actual applications very
soon just to finish this part I have
shown you the Hadamard and the C not
gates I've shown you one of the three
power gates the ex gates the Y and Zed
gates are pretty much the same they just
spin around different axes I didn't show
you the identity gate which is extremely
boring because it simply does nothing I
didn't show you any phase gates which
are much more exciting but too
complicated for this kind of talk and
there are many many others you could
imagine but why do you want this kind of
stuff in the first place what are the
use cases for you know that kind of
logic which seems rather abstract and
weird well there's quite a lot you can
do with it in theory at least
so one thing you probably heard about if
you've heard anything about quantum
computing is it can potentially break
encryptions but it can also be used in
what most people would consider more
constructive ways for example it can
help construct cars design cars it can
be used to simulate molecules for
chemical and medical research it can be
used in AI potentially and have huge
effects there it could be used for
weather predictions or financial fraud
analysis or nASA uses it for engineering
they have a very very early quantum
computer in use right now I don't think
they have it in productive use yeah
right now it's still in the
experimentation oil phase but it's going
to get there and to go with a trend it
can break Bitcoin so if you're invested
bitcoins you should probably get rid of
them before you know quantum computing
hit the big market now quantum computers
are great for many many subjects but
they're not strictly better than our
binary computers for example for simple
arithmetic ticks
quantum computers suck they'll give you
answers that may be correct with a
certain probability so that's not what
you want quantum computers can make a
lot of things faster but they won't
replace regular computers they'll add to
them basically it's always a case of
choosing the right tool for the job okay
going back to what we had earlier if you
have a flask of cyanide and you want to
break it if you have a hammer that's a
great solution no break the cyanide with
a how not a good idea in general but
that's a good solution to fulfill your
objective if however you have a cat and
try to break the flask with a cat it's
gonna get weird so better not try that
finding problems that can be solved with
quantum computers easily is a big task
that we'll be facing in the next years
and decades people have been working on
it for quite a while at least since the
1980s but there's still a lot more work
to do and most of the work that's been
done so far is rather theoretical and
academic we need real-life computer
scientists programmers people who work
in the field to to work on this topic
basically we need you to join the cause
why should you do it though well here's
a very nice quote by ven cats
basically he says if you want to learn
something try to learn something that's
just totally different from what you've
known so far it'll help you immensely
and believe me quantum computing is
different from any kind of programming
you've done so far and you can actually
start programming a quantum computer
right now
after this talk no during the talk well
you could but I'd recommend you don't
and I'm going to show you two ways that
you can actually do that so the first
way is via the IBM quantum experience
IBM offers a quantum computer in a cloud
so to speak
and they've built several quantum
computers by now the quantum computer is
in here now what you see here is not the
actual quantum computer that's a
cryostat a kind of huge freezer the
quantum computer itself looks a bit like
this this is actually a seven cubed
quantum computer which IBM built and it
the way the this particular quantum
computer works and quite a few others
though there are other technologies
available is via superconductors so it
has to be cooled to close to absolute
zero will actually see later the kind of
temperatures they reach they don't reach
absolute zero because as far as I know
nobody's been able to manage that yet
but they get pretty close so I said this
is in the cloud basically the easiest
way to get started with it is via their
website and you can log in so that they
have great you see it under the
beginners guide they have great
information if you register and login
you'll see something like this this is
the composure view up here we see
information on the state of the qubits
they're offering for us so you can write
code and run it on their quantum
computers I want to emphasize that again
and here a bit of information on the
state of the two qubits you can choose
from in this case they do have for their
partners a 20 qubit computer available
as well by the way it's not limited to
five cubits like these two examples show
and this here is the most important part
this is the actual composure part named
so of course because you know it reminds
you of musical notes
and what you write in there is called a
quantum score as you can see at the
bottom it lists the quantum scores that
I've produced and haven't deleted also
on the side you see the various gates
that you can use and you'll recognize a
few of those from what I've shown you
earlier now let's build a kind of
quantum hello world program with this
and the hello world program is what
we've already seen Schrodinger's cat so
what do we need we need our radioactive
material we need our Geiger counter with
the attached hammer we need the cyanide
and we already have the cat there and
all of those have to be linked up or
entangled so if we build this in the
quantum experience it would look
something like this
so the radioactive material here is a
qubit to which we have applied the
Hadamard gate we've put it into quantum
superposition so it's in both States at
the same time that kind of stuff we link
another qubit which represents the
Geiger counter to that via a C naught
gate and to that we link another qubit
which represents the cyanide add another
qubit to that switche represents the
life of the cat and looking into the box
is represented by this pink icon that
here the measurement gate actually let's
not just measure the life of the cat but
let's measure all of those qubits there
so we can get some some interesting
information more detailed information
and if we run this algorithm on the
quantum computer the results will look
something like this so what do we have
here how do you interpret this this here
is the case where everything's fine
the radioactive material did not decay
the cat's alive no one has the worry and
this occurred in about 30% of the cases
this here's the
case where the radioactive material
decayed the cat is dead always lost but
we do have a lot in the middle here and
that what you see here those are
mistakes the quantum computer is still
an early prototype and quantum error
correction is a huge issue right now all
in all we got 60% of the results in
areas that seemed reasonable and round
about 40% that was errors so that's a
huge margin there there's a lot of work
to do but it's being done I'll show you
an example of a chip later that
apparently at least has a much lower
error rate so things are getting better
and they're moving fast ok so this is
the first Oh one thing I should mention
this was purely graphical there is a way
to use the quantum computer or the
quantum computers IBM is offering via a
programming interface they offer
something called QIS kits which among
other things offers you Python Python
interface to send code to that computer
I'm not going to go into any detail
about that but if you're interested you
can the second project I want to show
you is the Microsoft quantum development
kit this came out about half a year ago
and this is much closer to what we know
as code from our everyday life as
developers now since this is Microsoft
they initially released it for Windows
of course and while preparing this talk
I thought I would have to tell you well
if you don't have Windows available
tough luck and then about two and a half
weeks ago they tweeted out yay it's
available for Mac OS and Linux as well
now so time to party
have a look at the very same algorithm
we programmed on the quantum experience
in the language Microsoft is offering
called cue sharp so this is a really
really simple program we have here first
of all most of this is blurred out on
purpose what's important right now are
these four lines that aren't blurred out
first of all we put our qubits into
superposition via the Hadamard gate so
this is our radioactive isotope then we
link it to the Geiger counter we link
that to the cyanide and we lang link
that to the cat so four lines of code
and we've built basically our experiment
everything around it is not kind of
boilerplate really but we'll go through
it nevertheless most of it at least what
we have here is we need some variable
that tells us what the current state is
what so the value is we should return
now this as you can see is just a
regular variable it's a mutable variable
most things in queue shop are immutable
you have to specifically state that you
want to be able to change the value of
something here we look into the box we
check has the cat survived or not and
assign that value to our our variable
and then we return it like we would with
any other function is our cat alive or
not and a bit more boilerplates first of
all we have to tell it that we want to
use for qubits for this experiment this
is a bit like a Malakand see we have to
reserve our qubits and then we have to
what we don't have to but I chose to
give them helpful names because in qubit
0 through qubit 4 that's not that easy
to understand as soon as your program
gets even a little bit larger so let's
give them names these as you see are not
noted as mutable so those are immutable
in the sense that the references I
immutable the qubits themselves are
mutable that's why we have to set them
back to zero at the beginning we don't
know what we got initially we want to
make sure that right at the beginning we
start with a known state so zero is our
best bet
which is by the way something that the
quantum experience did automatically for
us we didn't have to do that manually
and after we've finished we have to make
sure it's cleaned up again this is a
requirement by the language we have to
clean up behind ourselves and that's
basically it this is our cue sharp coat
and cue sharp implies that it may be
related to some other languages it is in
fact a darknet language and so you can
use it throughout the dotnet platform
which means here we'll call it from
c-sharp code so first of all let's
create a quantum simulator
unlike IBM Microsoft is not offering an
actual quantum computer that you can use
they're offering a simulator that makes
development locally much faster because
with the quantum experience you have to
send them your code wait until it's your
turn and then you'll get your results
back here you just run it locally then
we run our experiment we just call our
Schrodinger's cat code and then we check
the result and give outputs depending on
that result and that's it we've written
a quantum algorithm which you can run
locally on your computer now this is
using a quantum simulator which kind of
makes the question why don't we just use
quantum simulators for all of it why do
we have to
real quantum computers why not simulate
everything and to answer that question
I'd like to go back to a previous slide
remember this slide here not now when I
press my clicker in a moment what we
should get in theory is a really smooth
transition to the gravestones yeah that
wasn't smooth at all my computer is
having problems with powerpoints a
quantum computer is rather more
complicated than powerpoints and if you
want to if you're wondering how much
more complicated well IBM actually
looked into this there's something
around called quantum supremacy it's a
concept basically it means the point at
which we can build and run a quantum
computer which can do things that a
regular computer cannot at least not in
any reasonable amount of time and so
what they did is they decided we'll
simulate a rather large quantum computer
actually two of them on their
supercomputer and so the first one was a
49 qubit simulated quantum computer and
that needed four and a half terabytes of
RAM the other one was a 56 qubit and
that needed a little less though I
should note that the this wasn't the
same experiment they ran something
something different on the 56 qubit
computer so it's not like the more the
better but what's really astounding is
this is a huge improvement compared to
other state-of-the-art technologies with
anything that came previously you have
rather larger amounts of memory you need
now eight petabytes or one exabytes let
me remove - let me repeat that an
exabyte
can anyone imagine how large an exabyte
is let me break it down for you
one exabyte that's a thousand petabytes
that's a million terabytes depending on
whether you speak British or American
English that's a mill yard or billion
gigabytes that's ten to the 18 bytes 10
to the 18 what's 10 to the 18 according
to current estimates our universe is
13.7 times 10 to the 9 years old which
translates to 4.32 times 10 to the 17
seconds that's less than half the amount
of bytes in an exabyte that's a huge
amount of RAM and even with the
improvement which don't necessarily work
for all algorithms you run on them
that's pretty hefty now you can run
quantum simulators on supercomputers but
most of all us don't have supercomputers
just standing around in their basements
so for the time being we're probably
bound to something like this and this is
actually a 50 qubit quantum computer
that's IBM built they're not offering
that on the quantum experience at least
not at this time and until very very
recently I thought this would be the
largest quantum computer I would be able
to show you today until literally a week
ago seven days ago Monday last week
Google said hey we have something here
we call this Bristlecone and it's got 72
qubits and apparently a very very low
error rate now this isn't quite complete
yet this is still in testing but 72
qubits that's about one and a half times
the previously largest actual quantum
computer with 50 cubits this could
actually be a contender to break quantum
supremacy now
I don't know whether that's actually
going to happen that depends on quite a
few quite a few questions like how high
or low is the actual error rate what is
the kind of algorithm you're gonna run
on there and can you run an equivalent
algorithm on the binary computer with
you know equal or better results so it's
open we don't know what's gonna happen
but this is pretty cool and Google is
just one of the contenders here Intel is
also working in the field IBM as I said
is working in the field the NASA NASA I
don't think they're building quantum
computers they're certainly using them
Alibaba is working with a university to
build and offer quantum computers to
their customers and quite a few other
companies so there's quite a lot going
on in this field and I actually had to
change the presentation about three
times in the last few weeks because new
things happens okay so let's say I've
convinced you let's say you want to get
into quantum computing what can you do
well there's a few things you can do
first of all you could of course start
using the quantum experience by IBM it's
completely free it's really fascinating
it has great documentation that's where
I learned quite a bit about what I'm
telling you today you can also of course
get the quantum development kits from
Microsoft also totally free and at least
for the kind of experiment you'll
probably be doing you don't need
multiple terabytes of RAM in theory you
can also go to Alibaba they announced on
March 1st that they were offering an 11
qubit quantum computer on the Alibaba
cloud I registered
look I couldn't find it I couldn't find
anyone who had written about having
found it I've contacted their support
and I'm still waiting for a reply so
probably it will be available pretty
soon but as far as I can tell it's not
quite available now also some of you may
have heard about this website Stack
Overflow that's part of a larger network
the Stack Exchange network and in what
they call area 51 they try out sites
that they think may become larger
there's currently a proposal for a
quantum computing sites in that area now
this is a snapshot from last night and
we were at 56% commitment which means
basically we'd have just over half of
the people we need to commit to do
anything I have it on rather good
authority that there's going to be some
kind of announcement very soon about
this and with very soon I mean later
this evening or tomorrow morning so you
probably if you find the field
interesting want to check that out you
can you know scan that QR code and get
right there or you know google it that
works perfectly fine as well
apart from that go forth explore try it
out it's really fascinating I didn't get
into even close to everything there is
to say about quantum computers today
this was just you know the very very
very basics that you need to get started
but it's immensely fascinating and
estimations including my own say that
probably within the next five to seven
or maybe ten years we'll have quantum
computers basically in in all major
businesses things do are speeding up
right now
it couldn't be earlier especially if
you're into security you probably want
to look into this very soon because
chances are organizations like the NSA
and such will have quantum computers
rather earlier than the rest of us and
there are ways to defend against quantum
computing security attacks but you
really have to get into the topic and
other than that's I'm done with the
presentation and there's some time for
questions yeah there's a question back
there yes
mm-hmm
you
okay so the question is basically when
you go from the quantum level to the
macro level you lose most of the quantum
effects due to decoherence and given
that and what is currently in the news
and in this talk obviously about quantum
computing is it a hype do we actually
have quantum computers per se that do
anything interesting we don't at least
if we leave out that Google chip which I
don't know enough about to say anything
for certain we don't have any problems
right now that we can run on quantum
computers faster than on real computers
on any quantum computer we have at the
moment there are algorithms that have
been proven to run faster on quantum
computers in theory we aren't there yet
so there are quantum computers there
just in a very very early stage they're
not in the stage where they're useful
yet it's going to happen pretty soon I'm
sure
probably for most of us it'll be a bit
longer until they're useful but the
first applications for places like you
know NASA
that'll be within the next few years I'm
certain does that answer the question
great yes
hmm basically to to recount the question
why am I so certain that quantum
computers will be coming in such short
notice
basically watching what's happening in
the field and how things have sped up in
the last couple of years is the main
factor the idea of quantum computers has
been around at least since the 1980s you
could even argue it's been around since
the 1950s in some ways and for a long
time it has been very theoretical in the
last one and a half to two years things
have really caught on IBM is offering
their quantum computer they have a
working quantum computer which is
limited admittedly but it's already a
big step towards having something useful
other companies such as Intel and and
Alibaba and Google have started building
quantum computers that are getting so
much faster so much larger in such
little time I mean of course there's the
possibility there's always the
possibility that we'll hit a barrier in
you know three months time and find out
we can't build anything larger than
those 72 qubits that's possible but
right now it's looking very good there
are problems to be solved definitely
before quantum computers too can get to
a state where they're truly useful we
probably need them in the sizes you know
several hundreds or maybe thousands of
qubits for most interesting problems and
building quantum computers that have
those many quant qubits that don't
interfere with each other but can still
be used together is a problem that as
I'm aware has not been completely solved
yet so sure I may be wrong the speed at
which it's going right now does make me
confident confidence that we'll get
quite quite a part of the way at least
if not there we'll get quite a lot
further within the next few years I
still believe that it will be a matter
of five or maybe a few more years but
yeah it's a valid question I guess it's
just belief in the end yeah
okay so the question is why did I build
the schrÃ¶dinger's cat example with four
cubits when one would have been enough
basically when you put one qubits into
superposition which would represent the
isotope in my example and there are that
you get fifty-fifty results so that
would be sufficient it's just not very
interesting and also I wanted to show
the the way that several different gates
work together and we heard the term
decoherence earlier the error rate is
due to the qubits wanting to return to
certain states and that can be seen if
you build the experiment like I did I
could have just built it with one qubit
measure that shown you 50/50
approximately and perfect world you
would have been none the wiser the fact
that we do get errors is really really
important and anyone working with
quantum computers in any fashion should
be aware of those errors so I made sure
there would be sufficient errors to make
the point any other questions okay oh
yeah yeah
the question is are there
non-mathematical use cases for quantum
computers what would you define as a
mathematical use case yeah okay so real
world applications basically there will
be real world applications certainly
right now it's a field dominated by
academics and of course academics mostly
think of academic problems which are in
nature mathematical in many cases there
will be more interesting cases I'm sure
but that's exactly why we have to get
involved now we who work in the real
world the business world or whatever
field you personally work in there will
be use cases far outside the examples I
showed you earlier we just have to find
them
and there are some that go a bit above
what we've seen I mean I showed an
example of or I showed that there was an
example of modeling chemical and medical
processes of course you can break it
down to math essentially but the idea
here is that since we are working with
nature and nature is quantum we should
use quantum computers to model these
things because otherwise we have to
artificially try to model these quantum
effects which we have in our quantum
computers by default and whether
predictions of course whether is also
the models are also very very very
mathematical but they apply to something
in the real world but right now we use
heuristics for it generally many many
problems nowadays that we use heuristics
for to optimize them
I assume can be solved in a better way
with quantum computers sometime in the
future but in general we just have to
look for the problems they have out
there I'm sure but
so far the right people haven't been
looking anything else okay I guess I'll
release you to the beer and thank you
