to talk about that JPA Java persistence
API and I'm going to talk about the
details but also about about some tricky
parts about the consequences of the
action which we are taking all the time
and it's this talk is a GP training in a
nutshell so I run I do GPA trainings for
Bodega company and I saw that there is a
lot of things that I thought they are
obvious and they should be obvious for
me medium and senior developers and
there were a lot of concern regarding
some some things and I want to cover
such tricky parts such things during
this this talk so a little bit about me
- I work as a co-founder of deaths
killer the platform that allows online
programming skills assessment so we
verify if someone is for it for example
able to work to extend the existing
software using JPA using spring using
maven using Oracle databases so the real
word programming skills assessment as
I've already mentioned I'm I work as a
trainer for a particular company I also
a program committee member of the box-t
also of the conference that we are here
and I'm a co-author journalist marching
J shock of the spring cloud contract
project and you can find my Twitter
handle here so feel free to follow me
here feel free to tweet about questions
about some information that you would
like to receive so the problem is that
currently the problem solving algorithm
is very simple it's just you get some
exceptions to Google
with a low error message you find an
answer in the stack overflow
probably like five different answers and
you just iterate for it for each answer
just copy/paste the solution check if it
works if it works then great break if
it's not working then continue looking
for that the problem is that we don't
understand
usually the code we're we are pasting so
the problem is that I faced something ok
it solved my problem but how how it
works under the hood I have no idea
maybe I've just exposed some business
functions to all users to all over the
world and I don't know about that ok so
and now I want to tell about something
more than just copy pasting the answer
so understanding each important part of
the JPA and Joel Spolsky said many years
ago that all non-trivial abstractions to
some degree are leaky what's the problem
the problem is that we know that JPA is
an abstraction for the sequel ok and a
sequel is an abstraction for the
database query language the problem is
that when something is really hmm when
we try to do something really advanced
then you are not allowed to rely on
abstraction because the hibernate
queries hibernate model for different
databases will look in a different way
when I'm writing sequel query ok I can
write a generic sequel query but if I'm
using Oracle I want to use some Oracle
specific functions so great that sequel
is is an abstraction but I need to know
how it works under the hood ok as well
in hibernate I know what entity
annotation does but maybe there are some
tiny differences between different GPA
implementations between hibernate and
ejected open GPA and that's something
that we colder that those those
abstractions are leaking ok and now
let's cover those the
subtract abstraction so this is just a
example of the very simple entity what's
wrong with this example do you see
anything wrong here I have some speakers
of deaf ears so I can give it a award
for good answer
any idea it's generated value so it's
pitiful okay the problem is that the
color notation here does exactly nothing
okay what we use columnar notation for
is to define some additional column
information like change the name tell
the JP provider is the if this column is
knowable or not if I can update it or
not etc
but all fields that are in the entity
are persist by default okay so you don't
need to add anything to mark okay so
this field the name is a column it
should be treated as the database column
it will be treated even with this
without this annotation so this
annotation here does exactly nothing
okay another example what's wrong with
this code safe what's wrong with safe
exactly so I'm telling here explicitly
that I want to save this entity but it's
not needed because it's transactional
method when the middle is transactional
then JP provider cares about all changes
made to the managed entities so the JP
provided is using something else called
a dirty and dirty tracking so it checks
if the entity states has changed and if
the entity State has changed then it
saves and flushes all the changes into
databases without explicitly saving the
product why it's important is really a
huge problem that I use the product
repository say
here maybe not now but imagine that
someone has added some validation and
here at additional logic if product is
valid then safe okay great
but else it will also be safe and it's
so a lot of code made in this world I'm
not saving this entity everything is
okay no you are saving this entity and
it's not ok ok another an important
information about the field and getters
so we know that we can put annotations
on a getters or on a field so who thinks
that annotations on a Gators are good
idea just raise your hand okay no one
annotations on field okay so like 90
percent have no idea which one is better
so to be honest there is no big
difference between using annotations on
fields and gathers it's more about the
religion than about the technology of
course when you use the annotation when
when you place the annotation on a field
then hibernate is using reflection it's
using the access to the field to to
manage the state so we don't need to
have getters and setters and I seen a
lot of entities with annotations placed
on fields with getters and setters why
do you need calcium setter I don't know
maybe higher energy using okay so I have
no idea if those if those setters and
getters are used or not and just adding
them by default okay
and the real problem is that when you
decide for example that okay so let's go
with annotations on fields and new
person joins your project and he's from
the other religion that places all
annotations on getters the problem is
that single annotation on gather is
enough to change the access rules for
the whole class
so I have ten annotations on fields I've
add another annotation on gather all
annotations are on fields are ignored
right now so if there is no getter and
setter for some field it won't be
persisted because I've changed the
access to the class the type of the axis
so if you want to use fields as well as
togethers you must tell explicitly that
access on this class is an access by
field but for this property I'm using
the property access without this
property access the hole access types on
the class will be will be changed and
that can make serious serial serious
problems okay another thing so what's
wrong with this code there is ID
somewhere here hidden what's wrong with
the code we see here what's wrong with
the name of the class yes exactly it's a
keyword so I cannot use this class
because I will get an exception that
it's incorrect grammar okay I expected
that identifier but order is found so
what can I change the first answer in
Stack Overflow is just change the name
of your entity so I'm changing into
orders and let's see
yay works insert into orders great do
you know what's wrong with this problem
it's soft or not let's try to write a
query create query select all from order
Oh Oh what happens no such entity okay
this is a Jake JP QL it's Java
persistence core language but I used to
name the entities and name objects here
from the name of the class and I've
changed the name of the entity so there
is no entity called order there is
entity called orders ok so I've changed
the name of the entity which results in
changing the name of the table but it
does it more than I expected so to fix
this to solve this problem in a good way
we just leave the entity as it is and we
change the name of the table table is
the similar annotation as column ok we
use it when we want to change the
database representation no they're not
not the RM or a model ok but that's very
simple stuff let's move to something
more interesting let's move to the
mappings ok what's wrong with this code
here an alias stickers with all that
kills poor programmers which sort are
waiting what's wrong here yes but what's
wrong will be the V Direction or mapping
do we need yeah we don't know work who
is the owner of this relationship so
what does it mean that let's say that
addresses owner the customer it tells us
where should we place the foreign key ok
so where should I place the foreign key
here
I don't know so let's use two foreign
keys ok and it's done and end up the
default and behavior of the hibernate so
it will hibernate will create two and
foreign keys ok so another question how
can I delete this object or this
relation I can't
okay and the cool thing is that when you
execute entity managers delete and you
pass this customer entity module itself
yeah delete it but it's still in the
database
no exception no any information just
nothing it just won't be deleted so if
you want to use the pdb directional
mapping you must tell explicitly hey
it's mapped by the address okay so
that's the owning side of my
relationship okay so the customer is
owner of the address okay not a simple
example what's wrong here will this code
simple one two money entity customer has
a set of addresses what's the problem so
I I will ask you one roofing do we need
a linking table here
exactly no we don't but hibernate is not
aware of this cool feature that we can
store one-to-many relationships in a
database without using join column so
for this mapping hibernate will create a
join table so there will be three tables
customer address and a customer address
why just because okay so if you want to
use the one-to-many as it should be
taught then you must tell explicitly hey
here's the join column please okay don't
create linking table for one-to-many
relationships okay that's wrong so the
question is what's wrong with this
relation doing it a joint table here yes
we need so what can go wrong
yes hibernate will create two linking
tables okay just to be sure that it's
linked in a best best possible way okay
so
there will be four tables customer
address customer address and address
customer okay to linking table why just
because okay as you probably can imagine
it's not the most effective way of
mapping and it is in hibernate but often
we are not aware of this stuff
especially when we are creating some
model from from from the beginning
because when you join a project and this
project contains a lot of tables then
you just simply add additional stuff but
when you design the database model from
scratch then it can create serious
serious problems with performance for
example okay so let's move to the next
topic we just lazy loading we know that
lazy loading is it means that we are
loading the elements from the database
only when the element is needed not add
of time but just in time that they
access some some element and we have to
proc sync mechanism in Java one is
proxying by by sub-classing so it's the
way that hibernate does it using for
example cg leap or Java cyst and the
second one is dynamic process we are
using interface okay it probably and
will be stupid idea to create interfaces
to entities containing getters and
setters
so hibernate is just extending the
entity okay and is there anything
special that we must remember about when
writing the entity so this entity could
be lazy loaded it cannot be final it
cannot contain final medals and one more
time yes
constructive not private default
constructor okay and these are
requirements that we must met to be able
to use lazy dog right know what because
what are the 90% of the use cases when
we use lazy loading or for which data
for each type of data for Strings for
doubles for collections exactly and the
good thing about the collections is that
set lists
these are interfaces when I use the
collection when I use set when I use
lists it's a collection it's an
interface and can I use my own
implementation of this interface of
course I can and that's what hibernate
does okay so hibernate when you put the
set in your list it's not using the
heart set even if you you know assign
this manually it will use the persistent
set and what difference between
persistent set and set difference is
that this set is persistent okay so for
example this set knows if it's
initialized or not okay and if you are
trying to access any element of this set
then hibernate checks okay so is this
set initialized already no it's not
so please initialize this set and then
return the element so I don't need any
proxy of the entity itself because proc
think the field is enough okay so for
99% of the use cases of lazy loading in
hibernate we can use final classes we
can use final methods and we can use
private constructors and that's okay
that's something that hibernate is able
to deal with spot as you can see there
are free implementation persistent set
resistant back and persistently so the
question is what
that what's the kind of implementation
used here set bagger lists a set
what does it mean is a set it means that
there are no duplications okay a set an
allow us to keep and duplications there
is no order and what's important here if
I add an element to the list to the set
I only need to use let's say two queries
first to check if this element is really
unique so I need to load this element
and second query insert statements to
insert the element when I'm removing
something from the set I'm invoking the
one delete statement and when you need
to update something then you invoke one
update statement okay through two
statements for insert one for update and
one for delete okay very effective very
effective way of mapping the collection
so what's this one set bagel list it's a
list
it's Java list so what's the problem the
problem is that it's not only it's a bag
what's the difference between bag and
list and areas ordering yes exactly we
are we used to use for example like
product dot gets zero get one get two
etc okay the problem is that at the back
now the list and the back doesn't
guarantee any order so there is no
ordering here yes we are allowed to use
duplicates and no there is no order so
what's the problem here is it a big deal
that there is no order in there
duplicate or not it's a huge problem
because imagine that I want to add
something to my list okay
am i able to invoke just one insert
statement no because after adding this
insert statement is it a correct state
of this collection or I'm just
accidentally added duplication no idea
so I need to recreate this list so I
need to remove all entities from the
database and insert then one more time
another problem when I'm removing
something from this list let's say that
I have free products per memory may be
differently I have a product that is
added to this list three times how can I
remove just one instance of this product
no way to do that so I need to remove
all products and insert those which are
still valid one more time to the
database okay so I'm recreating the
whole bag in the database and when I
update it's ok because other it is still
just one ok so if you have 100 elements
in your bag and you remove one thing
then you are executing 100 sequel
statements for the database which makes
no sense and why should I use lists why
should I use back only when I
intentionally want to use duplicates
when you take a look at your mappings
then I'm pretty sure that you are using
list or collection because it's the same
in many and it is and only in one or two
of them you in fact need duplicates so
if you want your entities in your
collections perform well please always
use set if it's false so how can we use
list I won't have an order yeah this
one of many and also order column
annotation which adds another column to
my database we just tore the order the
problem is that when if you are coding
in basic then you know that we're
ordering the lines like the first line
tenth line twenty thirty forty that we
were able to insert something in the
middle and it was 15k line 50 so it's
not something that JPA is a world so it
keeps their ordering continues - one two
three four five if you want to remove
something from the middle then it's one
delete statement to remove the product
with order number five and then all next
products must be updated to reduce the
ordering okay so if you have 1,000
products and you're removing the first
then 999 statements will be executed to
change order to two one three two two
four two three etc etc 999 to 998 so
remember remember about that ok so
moving next staying with collections the
most serious performance issue and JPA
is the n plus one select problem what's
the n plus one select probe so imagine
that we have user entity with list of
addresses which is lies loaded ok I'm
loading the list of users and then I'm
iterating over the users list and for
each user I'm iterating over the
addresses list ok so if I have ten users
then how many times would I load the
addresses table ten times for each user
when using the first address okay I will
make your get of zero and hibernate will
execute the statement to lazy load this
element so ten users in ten queries for
loading the address
address this list and 11th for loading
the user okay that's a serious problem
because imaginative thousands of users
and your lazy loading and have some
information here it means thousands of
queries which in fact sucks especially
when I will be loading for example get
address address get streets okay then it
will be just an abnormal amount of query
so how can I solve so there is a simple
workaround that the hibernate specific
blind feature when you can say that hey
but size for this list is can what does
it mean when hibernate loads the
addresses list for the first user and it
knows that the user is loaded in list
then it will load nine more addresses so
there is no more n plus 1 but it's n
divided by ten plus one problem okay and
I drew any way to solve this problem of
course trees we can use join fetch so
select you from user view join fetch you
put addresses I can also use join fetch
all properties okay so please load this
you and load everything that is
important here because I want to use all
the stuff that is available in this
place ok next week how can we save
something to the database third tomatoes
on entity Manoj one is called the
persist and a second method is called
the merge and what's the problem the
problem is that persist works only for
the new entities and merge works for new
entities and for detached and it is as
well so the good idea is to use merge
all the time right no why because
how much is able to let's see get the
information if this entities new or is
attached I need to execute the C select
statement say hey database use database
do you have an entity with such ID no
okay so I need to insert it
do you have an entity with such ID yes
okay so I need to merge it I need to
update this entity another cool problem
is that I've so many times when someone
replace the persist with merge and was
happy
any ideas what's wrong with just
replacing the name persistent name merge
different signatures of the matters
persist is avoid methods when you pass
the entity to the persist metal this
past entity becomes managed and the
after returning from the function and it
doesn't work for merge because merge is
not void method it returns T okay
so when you pass the user to the merge
method merge method copies the user
state into new entity save this new copy
and returns this copy so the entity that
were passed the marshmallow is not
longer used by hibernate okay so that's
the problem you must use the entity that
is returned by the merge metal not the
one that you passed so it's a totally
different idea then for the persist
method which can bring us to serial
serious problems but let's move on to
the next issues optimistic locking do we
know how optimistic locking works it's
simple idea so I have additional field
this field can be integer but he also
can be a timestamp an 80s why could I
use the timestamp of the version
is there something that I gain for free
by using the time stamp as a version
exactly last update date for free okay
if you want for example pull all changes
from the database that were made in last
five minutes
voila get or give me all fields with
version higher than something okay it's
there these are all entities that were
changed in the last last five minutes so
how it works it works in this way that
and a hybrid adds this version into the
word statement so update user sets name
equal to something where ID equal to 5
and version equal to 3 when there is no
well if the entity was version free is
no longer available in the database it
will be just ignored hibernate will
realize that 0 records rows were updated
so it will throw the optimistic log
exception really simple idea but what's
happening in rest is the optimistic
locking in rest
we've moved we moved from JPA from from
JSP or from GWT applications into
angular but the processing model is
still the same what's the difference the
difference is that and JSP were
operating usually on the entity and the
entity was the thing that were updated
in the model so when I was just of
course the entity was deserialized and
detached but then it was merged and all
there are as well as the version of the
entity that I was updating in the UI but
in angular
I am serializing the entity not as a
Java object but as a JSON or XML or
something else and I send this video to
the browser user edits it
and send it back to the server weave out
the version so what I'm doing I'm
loading this entity from the database
I'm updating the properties and I'm
saving the problem is that verse
optimistic locking the versioning of
this entity works only in the backend
okay so entity can live for ten weeks in
UI in my browser and I will be able to
save it so if you want to use optimistic
locking when you are deserializing the
entity into DDoS you must do it money
wallet there is no way for hibernate to
take care of all that so how we do that
we add a version field into the DTO and
when you receive the DTO from the
browser you load the entity you manually
check if didi orchid version equals
entity good version and if it's not
equal you manually draw new optimistic
log exception and if not then you
continue processing huge problem in rest
applications using optimistic locking
let's move on identity the most basic
methods in object in Java objects equals
and hashcode okay how can i implement
equals and hashcode in the entities and
ideas I could use the ID right ID looks
like a great idea because it's unique
it's fixed it's not changing is it
changing or not yeah if there is big
bigger problem imagine that I'm creating
a user okay and the user will contain
free addresses so the user has a set
okay and I'm adding new addresses equal
new hash set okay then
and creating new address and user dot
add new address what's the idea of this
address it's not persisted to the
database so there is no ID okay so
what's the hash code of this matter
let's say zero so it all three addresses
are placed in a bucket for the hash code
zero then I first list it to the
database and I want to check if this
address is contained in this in this set
so I just involved a set dot contains
and I pass the address and set says that
there is no address why because the hash
code has changed okay
after persisting the hash code is no
longer 0 its 1 or 2 or 3 or 10 and the
hash structures like heart set or hash
map are looking into incorrect buckets
so yes this set is this address is
inside a set but in the wrong bucket and
I'm not able to retrieve it anymore so
that's the serious problem and there is
just one solution for that and it's very
strange solution because we need to add
we need to add the UID okay so the
longview ID to our all our entities just
to be able to use hashcode and equals on
the test on detached entities ok
and that's 32 or 36 additional charts
for every single entity just to be able
to implement the hashcode and equals
properly to work with detached and
unresisted objects ok so we must
remember about that but in fact as it is
the only reasonable solution we are it
as a base entity is the public abstract
class map of the map superclass so is
not the hibernate inheritance
it's just jamming heritance
and here we use the UID that we use for
creating the hash code and for equals
and this one is really immutable okay
it's assigned during the Java object
creation and it lives forever with the
subject because it's persisted in the
database and yes we need to persist it
in the database because we've if we want
persisted into the database okay then
after retrieving the entity it will be
different so please remember about that
because equals and hashcode for entities
is extremely hard topic next hard topic
is the caching okay what's the problem
with cash we have three levels of
caching in hibernate level one cache so
is the entity manager cache second level
cache which works on a whole application
and query cache and now we must also
learn a little bit more about flash mode
so there are four flash modes in
hibernate money all commit auto and
always okay do you know which one is the
default it's the out so the question is
what's the difference between out and
commit yeah the problem is that comet
works only when you come in the
transaction then we are flashing the
data changes to the database because all
operations that you execute on entity
manager so if you use anti-demon are
that persist it doesn't save your entity
to the database it saved only to the
first level cache okay and only during
the flash the changes from the first
level cache are transferred to the
database the problem is that imagine the
situation that I'm adding a user and I'm
using the flash mode commit I've added
the user using the entity Menagerie
user and I want to run some query I'm
running the query not on the entity
manager but on the database but the user
is not yet in the database okay so
that's the difference because auto when
it realized that you are invoking a
select for the entity that has been
changed in the transaction will flash
all the changes then execute the query
okay so that's the big difference
between commit and out auto is an
intelligent version of Comet so what are
the pitfalls of the first level cache as
is so simple the problem is that when
you invoke the persist or when you
update the entity it's only changed in
the first level cache so let's imagine
the situation that we are using the
batch processing okay I'm sending to the
database 10,000 entities and okay so I'm
adding these entities and at the end of
the transaction I'm I want to flush them
all to the database so now hibernate
tries to flush 10,000 entities to the
database at once it's not a good idea as
you probably can image so what can I do
I can flash the entities between for
every 100 entity so I've added 110
degrees and I'm flushing them to the
database but the problem is that when
you flush the database changes those
entities are still present in the entity
manager okay so if I'm just flashing the
changes it means that entity manager
needs to check more and more entities to
know if there should be flash or not
because a valid one entity and I'm
calling flash hibernate checks okay this
and it is new I need to flush this
entity to the database so it executes
the of the insert statement okay then
I'm adding the second entity and I'm
invoking the flash so hibernate see okay
I have two entities
my level 1 cache first little cache is
the first entity flashed yes
it's flushed ok and the second one no
second one okay so I'm flashing the
second entity I'm adding another entity
invoking / hibernate see three entities
in the first level cache is first entity
flashed he has second entity he has
third entity no okay so the time of
separation grows and grows and grows and
it grows geometrically okay so the thing
is that I need to flash the changes to
the database and then clear the first
level cache work knowing and remember I
must remember also that this first
little cash it's not the first level
cache in fact it's the butter okay
it's my working buffer if you invoke the
entity manager clear all entities that
you want it to persist into the database
are gone I've just removed all the work
so it's working buffer not first level
cache please remember about so yes for
watch processing we execute flash and
then clear not in the opposite direction
clear and flash okay it will work
extremely fast but no changes will be
stored to the database
okay so what's wrong with the second
level cache distributed environment
imagine that I have two instances of my
application I'm loading the user with ID
1 on the first instance and then I'm
changing this user on the second
instance ok and then on the first
instance I'm trying to load this user
one more time and my first instance is
hey cool
it's in my segment level cache so I'm
returning its outdated entity so if you
want to use the second level cache for
the clustered applications you must
remember that this cache must be
distributed so any changes made to any
cache must propagate in the whole class
usually we are just evicting the entity
so I don't want to use
this cluster as a distributed store I
can do it but it brings another another
problems like serializing this entity
sending them all over the network so the
easiest thing is just okay so if you've
changed the user with ID 1 2 3
so please advic this user with ID 1 2 3
from all caches ok next thing hql
injection my favorite we all know that
for preferred statement we must use
binded parameters because there could be
a sequel injection but we don't use
sequel anymore
we have fancy frameworks like hibernate
so why for the top 10 on the first place
there is still sequel injection ok
because I can write such query and it
should be safe because it's not sequel
it's hql and hibernate is smart it will
protect me from myself ok and will
hibernate execute such query now it will
be changed to select some OFS from
product p0 underscore 0 underscore where
something etc ok but it won't translate
this one so we still need to use binded
parameters for hql because this sequel
injection is as well possible in HQ r
and i've seen a lot of HQ l statements
built by a string builder instead of
creat binding parameters - please don't
do that because there is still a
possibility to use the HQ l injection ok
so that's something that you must that
you must you must remember ok so if you
want to get more information there are a
few great materials first remember about
verifying the hibernate lock
if you are executing the application
locally
please check what locks are provided by
the hybrid please verify what is the
schema generated by the hibernate what
tables with which columns are generated
okay if you are executing some statement
if you're using the operating you are
operating the business logic please
verify what statements are sent by the
hibernate to the database also hibernate
is open source and I recommend sometimes
trying to debug if you see something
strange in hibernate like this flash
that it's you know not not remembering
that which entities were flashed we can
check it by by by googling by debugging
hibernate code and there is a guy called
the vlog me he'll Sarah who is the real
expert in the JPA and in hibernate it
works for the last two years for the
hibernate core team and he has written a
book which is called the
high-performance Java persistence I
recommend this book because it's the
best and the only good book about the
JPA and the Java persist and he is also
running a blog with a lot of content for
free and there is also library called
jerk it's created by the luca seller who
is the serial sequel expert one of the
best experts in the world and it's the
different approach to persisting from
java because in hibernate we are not
controlling the sequel statement and in
jook you're writing the sequel
statements like insert update etcetera
but using the generated type safe and
strongly typed code for your application
ok so that's all I don't think we have
more time for questions but I will be
here so if you have any questions then
you can
ask them just after the presentation or
tomorrow or on Friday because I'm here
until the end of the conference remember
that you can vote for the doc if you
like it remember that you can keep
voting if you dislike this presentation
and that's all for myself thank you very
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
