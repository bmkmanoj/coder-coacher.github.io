thought I should share some of the
pitfalls but we ran into that you
probably will run into as well if you're
trying out more programming so one of
the first things that we encountered and
you might think every as well is that it
feels like you're in a meal of a
henhouse everybody is talking all the
time at the same time over each other
and I know somebody needs to brag about
they know the domain logic the best or
the business rules and yeah all these
kind of heated discussions in our case
it was a lot of heart debates about how
to perform a certain refactoring in
IntelliJ with the least amount of
keystrokes so can be productive but
that's really what we're there to do to
solve the problem we were working on so
when we start to think about this think
about flow and have a sense of progress
on the problem you're actually trying to
solve things will get better like maybe
we don't need to have this discussion
now is it contributing to solving actual
problem maybe can bite your tongue for
15 more minutes about that urgent need
for a fact when you notice in the source
code that nobody else or teammate seems
to notice and if you work with the
Testament development for instance and
use the red green refactor approach
which means that first of all it tests
that fails goes red and then you
implement the code to satisfy tests it
goes green then you can refactor the
code and then you can have the
opportunity to tune the implementation
you don't need to have these crazy
discussions all the time so you focus on
the problem of actually trying to solve
keep that in mind all the time and good
thing in more programming this year are
more people sitting together it's always
somebody to remind you about tape let's
take a timeout here this is not really
what we're trying to do here in
beginning we knows who had a lot of
discussions about coding standards how
do you instruct your source code
how to name things and so on and to be
honest as developers we tend to read
more code than we write so it's always
good if the code looks coherent and
consistent throughout the codebase we've
probably all seen code bases we can
definitely see that this method over
here was probably written by John
because he always has a particular way
to name his methods or variables and
Mike probably wrote this because he's
more sloppy with indentation or whatever
but as we went along we could agree upon
coding standards and after a while all
the code looked the same regardless of
who wrote it and I mean there could be
some things that maybe I didn't like
personally about the convention but we
agreed upon it and that's how we went
forward which brought an interesting
aspect as well when sometimes you want
to look in the source code history for
who introduced particulars change it
might not even be certain that the
person's a name in the commit blog was
actually a person at the keyboard at the
time so we thought okay how can we make
sure that we always address this issue
and we can have the full traceability of
who were actually involved in a certain
coaching since we can't really trust the
author that's just like the author of
the the machine we used when more
programming so we saw this in a quite
simple way we made a convention that on
the second line of each commit message
Riya specify all the team members that
were involved in a code change at that
particular time and we had a git commit
hook up stream in our source control
system actually verify that something
was specified in a second line and these
names that were specified had to match
the names of the team members at that
point in time so we could always have
full traceability of who were involved
in certain code change but to be firm
most of times it was everybody another
problem you might face which is not
really unique to mo programming I've
encountered it when I pair programmed as
well and it's one person starting to hog
the keyboard ass it's for a very long
time
gets boring sit on the side and it's
hard to keep engagement up so we solve
this by simply adding a timer we tried
to physical timers but we ended up with
one in our ID which we set on a fixed
amount of time for instance six minutes
and when the clock went off the person's
keeper just raised his hands and passed
along the keyboard to next person and
this way we could make sure that
everybody was constantly contributing
because we were all developers well up
to code and sit at the keyboard but also
we could keep engagement up and fight
boredom and this was both well it was a
good first step but since we sound like
from early morning until launch this way
and same afternoon for very long period
of time people have needs you know
somebody needs to get a new cup of
coffee or get a banana or you use a
toilet or somebody starts checking their
phone after a while and all of a sudden
they're at the keyboard you start to
notice like I missed surrounded by a
bunch of zombies looking at their phones
and it's not really contributing to that
shall saw solving the problem and
creating these new features this is not
no program this is just I guess the
zombie programming so okay we thought
about is how can we keep engagement up
so we want to fight the boredom but we
want to stay focused and it's exhausting
so maybe it's good to have some breaks
so we start to employ the Pomodoro
Technique so if you haven't heard by the
Pomodoro Technique it's essential about
you're sitting focused for a certain
period of time for instance 25 minutes
working on completing a certain specific
task and after that pair of time you
take a few minutes break get your mind
off that and to think about something
else you can get a car for something and
then when you start again you can work
focused on solving the same task if you
can complete it or a new task if you
solve the previous one so this worked
quite well for us we noticed that women
took a break people could go and get
their coffee
bananas to make the phone call they need
to do but when we all gathered back
after a few minutes of break we could no
work folks abuse we knew now we need to
work focusing for for 25-30 minutes and
then we time the next break so it made
it so much better in terms of keeping
the gate went up and working focused and
actually solving the problems who were
supposed to solve and to remind us of
all these concepts that we agreed upon
the ways of working be has decided to
let's create a simple checklist to
remind us of these things because we're
humans we're quite horrible remembering
things we've agreed upon so obvious
quite a checklist printed it put it on
the wall next to TV screens who would
always be reminded until we have this
like in the back of a heads naturally we
didn't need to think about it anymore
it's the more thing when working
together quite closely to make sure that
everybody is comfortable and one of the
things we had was we had a debate on
which kind of operating system to use we
had that like a 50/50 split between
developers using an act like myself or
the others they used Linux and we
noticed it was quite cumbersome for the
people not used to a knock to use an ark
when we used to knock and we had
different key maps in IntelliJ which was
hard even even though we were familiar
with the keyboard layout so we decided
everybody's familiar with a we're
comfortable of using a Linux computer
with like the standard key map of
IntelliJ let's use the same Li assessed
in the terminal so we can all be
comfortable working in this environment
regardless of which box it is this is
the Linux box and everybody feels
comfortable being the driver and we can
be productive we also reminds ourselves
about the things that I mentioned like
let's set a timer remember to take the
breaks have discipline and most
importantly is to have fun working
together
when we worked with this for for a quite
a while and we had all these different
things that were in a checklist and back
of our heads which was thought to be
very comfortable we discovered that we
didn't really need the timer as much
because we've discovered this concept
called strong powering which is
something you can use when you pair
program as well we noticed that at times
when we have some idea somebody knew how
to solve a particular problem they took
the keyboard start hacking away and all
of a sudden all the other people around
that person list to decipher the code I
was reading on the screen or if there
were a lot of window juggling Elms get
seasick what's happening it hard to fall
so we felt like okay but maybe it's
better if the person has idea does not
have the keyboard and this is
essentially what strong pairing is about
that you have a driver which is a person
at the keyboard and you have a navigator
or multiple navigators that are the ones
who have the idea I kept talking high
level abstraction on what problem we
were trying to solve
so for instance we can have them you can
think about this as having a driver and
navigating a car so if you have a driver
and have navigator and we want to get
from here to Amsterdam for instance as a
navigator you talk in high-level
abstraction you don't need to tell the
driver to or I'm not now press the
clutch downshift up release the clutch
while pressing the throttle takes the
left lane I will take the fee out and so
on we can trust the driver to know all
these details otherwise we wouldn't put
him in the driver's seat in the first
place anyway and the same thing when we
code I mean we all know that we are
everybody can't hold java in our team so
we can trust a person and on that level
we can talk about the ideas of the sole
particular problem and this was very
very natural and we didn't need to work
with the timer as much anymore because
now it was natural like the the person
had idea is dropped the keyboard or many
times we gave the keyboard the person
that was most confused about what we're
trying to do actually so sometimes I
came from a meeting and joined the mob
and
okay what where are we at the moment
what problem are we trying to solve and
so on and I just get the keyboard like
okay this is it we're doing this API
endpoint right now is supposed take
these parameters we want to handle this
in this way okay I can start filling
around this and quite quickly or into
the loop of what we're trying to solve
well we were doing one week we had a few
production incidents which made me as a
coach for the team to focus on equality
on the next retrospective and one of the
outcomes from that retrospective was
that we should probably do more strict
TDD I mean we had automated test cases
for everything unit test component test
integration tests but we didn't really
always write the test first it was
mostly written afterwards we thought
okay let's give it a chance and write
test first all the time
and we we noticed a quite interesting
side effect not only the code quality
they go up but also we notice that we
didn't need to redo a lot of rework on
some things that we didn't really have
the same understanding off so before we
start implementing something we've wrote
the test cases and already there we
could notice that maybe there's a corner
case a we can think about we just accept
expectations for everybody in the team
on how to solve a particular problem
which is quite useful this one looked
like when we start with no programming
and just had the TV there a big sofa it
was all right in the beginning it was
quite shielded off but to be honest
sitting eight dollars in a lousy couch
isn't that ideal
I mean nobody seen getting younger we
got back pains and nothing but if even
feed himself at the same time which
we're I mean we were sweets we don't
really like to be that intimate with
each other so we decided to upgrade our
team area and bring in a proper table so
people could bring their own shares
there enough comfortable environment and
also this crease on top you can see that
we have our
and continues to liberate pipelines and
our live monitoring from the production
systems always visible so we could have
fast feedback on the things we were
working on so we were sitting there the
whole days every workday and we looked
at when we're coding like this a small
change we can do an iceless change that
we can use send off to production then
we shipped it and we can we follow the
in the continuously bipartisan screen I
went through the pipeline passed all the
gatekeeping if something went red in the
pipeline we could immediately
immediately address that while we're
still in the same context of that
problem worried if there was something
happening production a fast feedback an
address at it right away so I thought I
should talk a little bit about
continuous delivery which was something
that we used it's not a prerequisite for
more programming in a sense but it
worked very well together so when we
talk about continuous delivery is about
getting code changes out to the users as
quickly as possible in a safe reliable
repetitive way so the two requirements
for you to fulfill in words do contains
deliver me the first thing is that your
source code should always be working it
should always be in a release mistake
and the second thing is that the whole
delivery process should be fully
automated so in our case we use
continuous deployment so every time we
push code we can just follow it through
the pipeline's on the screen and 2530
minutes later yourself in production now
the benefits that we always knew what
was in production we never need to think
about is this live or not when does your
code bring value to your users well it's
in when its production it's the end of
the the main branch if you're doing
continuous delivery so we use trunk
based delivery all the way we never use
branches except for if somebody had to
save keep something that we didn't push
production before we went home so we
want to keep doing that the next day or
something
unless some we have a hardware problem
or something but always always use the
master branch because if you're doing
branches you don't you really
integrating in your code that's not
continuous integration then you can't be
sure that your software always is
working and to be honest if you're doing
more programming everybody's working the
same thing anyway so there's like really
really no point in doing branches in the
first place a lot of people use branches
on a pool request in order to do code
reviews but if you're doing small
incremental changes all the time that
would just add a lot of waste and extra
time for people to go through and read
and if you start stacking up smaller
changes on top of each other it's gonna
be hard to keep up and if you're a
bigger diffs is something can be hard to
like you really digest what's the intent
of the code change and something that
you don't really see in in a dufus also
what solutions were discarded before
opting to this particular solution
sometimes it's easy to look at a pull
request and think about why didn't the
person solve this in this way but maybe
they already tried that but it had some
other implications that you can't really
see in the diff and that solution was
discarded and they have all this wasted
time we're going back and forth
discussing the the diff instead of just
doing the code review immediately
together talk with each other
communicate and we can be much more
efficient so in our case we just prefer
to always do the code reviews pre push
instead of having a separate workflow so
we can use the trunk based development
approach all the way so some of the
benefits that we saw when we were using
more programming it was it was like a
bulldozer the mob was always going on
full steam ahead
didn't really matter who rat office
somebody were sick or somewhere was in
vacation everybody's always on top of
things knowing what was going on if we
run into an impediment somebody needs to
go talk to another team that we
integrated with we could just take that
person
go talk to the other team and the mob
could just go on or if somebody came to
us with a question
one person could pop up and ask this
question with the mob will always
continue working but only because you're
used to essentially one computer it
doesn't mean that you can't work in
parallel so one quite useful concept but
we know this was let's give you an
example if you're covering something and
you will notice that eventually in like
15 minutes time you probably need to
interact with the database and we need
to design a new database query to pull
up this data then one person preferably
the sequel guru in the team can use pop
up his laptops are developing that
sequel query while the mob is continuing
with a Java code and once they get to
the point that they need to actually
implement the sequel query it's already
solved it's quite useful to work in
parallel or if you're running to a
problem you don't really know which
spring boots annotation to use and
somebody can work work on a separate
computer to read a Stack Overflow how to
solve that problem while the mob can
continue to be something else so it's
working in parallel but at the same
problem at the same time so one of the
biggest benefits with more program is
obviously we can make use of all the
collective skills that we have in our
team to solve our problems so let me
illustrate that with an example princess
if we have four identified skills that
are core to our team in order to be
efficient developers in our case could
be like Java you need to know how to
code Java to be efficient you need to
know TDD to some extent
we're under stuff on AWS you need to
know AWS in some extent it's good to
have some operational skills and setting
up how centric application centric
metrics features switches circuit
breakers this kind of stuff since we are
responsible for operating the stuff that
we develop so we have one person working
a particular problem it might be very
good with Java so so auntie didi let's
were played up we asked for
many years but has really the Alps
background so this a person could be
fairly fairly comfortable and effective
in the team but still like some imported
aspects because if we're supposed to
deliver all the code changes
automatically into production in 25 30
minutes you need to really think about
how you structure your code in order
it's not break stuff in production it's
quite interesting it's like when you
start with doing TDD you're gonna notice
that your source code it's going to look
more differently you're gonna structure
it so it's testable and the same thing
with well when you're doing continuous
delivery or Kathi's deployment you're
going to start think about when you
develop how is this going to be operable
in production do I need to take into
account back pressure circuit breakers
what metrics do we want to have
monitoring in order to know this if
something blows up in production so but
if this person would pepper them with
somebody with a hostile skills that
looks and like this they could be more
effective and productive and maybe avoid
some of the pitfalls or problems are you
thick running to otherwise but there's
still some gaps here we could probably
be better with Testament development or
making sure that we cover all the
necessary corner cases we want to cover
in our test Suites but then if you add a
third person who might be a job on TV
expert we've all of a sudden addressed
all these different aspects and we raise
the overall skill level of the team to
take into account all these different
aspects that we need to think of when
solving problems together so we just
make use of all the necessary brainpower
in our team and in order to deliver more
efficiently
another benefit was that basically
anyone in the team could represent us in
a meeting we didn't need to go everybody
were the most senior one or the team
lead needs to show up on all the
meetings and never be participating in
the coding
so we rotate like we want to take this
me now I can go today or I'll you can
take it out I'll go to the next one or
something like this
in fact most meanings were eliminated
since we could have discussions and
discussion or decisions made as we went
along when they occurred in the team I
really need to book separate session
like our let's design this verse agree
upon a standard let's do it next week on
Tuesday we have to find a room first ok
it might be Thursday because there was
no rooms available and and knowledge
sharing just happens all the time it's
just a natural thing we even had some
persons that left the team to go to
another team in the company and we
basically needed no handover because
everybody already knew well everything
that was going on so it was it was a bit
strange feeling but somebody left the
team like ok I'm not gonna be in the
stand-up tomorrow because yeah I'm
hearing the other team but do you need
anything for me I know we are have fun
ok let's see you later let's have lunch
someday under product donor he was super
happy as developers who might not think
about it from the product owners
perspective that often but the product
owner he's really interested in that the
most part iced thing the most important
thing gets delivered as quickly as
possible a proton is not interested in
having five things being worked on at
the same time moved a little bit on the
Kanban board everyday for a few weeks
time until they're delivered because you
know you know fast-paced environment
purchase change almost on daily basis so
the thing that's the third most
important thing today minoti even be
interesting in starting implementing
tomorrow or they might come some new
important thing that the product group
has decided upon the building that needs
to go on top of the backlog as soon as
the most important thing right now has
been solved so it made made it much more
flexible in terms of priorities and
you like a jille in that sense that it's
more agile in what we can focus on
working on and we have decided that
keeping all the tickets that we work on
fairly small like it should take three
days to implement each one of them if
takes more than three days it's probably
too big so we had on the daily stand of
meetings every morning we put the dot on
each tick that we worked on and on the
third day with three dots we decide okay
we need to finish this today are we
confident that we will do that if yes
then we'll finish it
if not then let's just slice it and see
what user value have we already provided
can we provide so maybe we can provide
80% for the user value today and leave
the rest of 20% separately so we can
create a new ticket for that
reprioritize that and maybe we can do
some more important stuff before we had
this last 20% so I get a common common
question I get this what's the team size
you should have four more programming
how many people is sufficient is it
three five seven and a thousand or
something in our case in our team we
were mostly between five and seven
developers during my time there and for
us the the sweet spot was probably five
at seven we felt it was a little bit too
much but when we were seven then we
usually had like a pair pair programming
and the mob with the rest of the people
and we decided on the daily stand-up
meeting in the morning which formation
to use for which particular problems but
to be honest if there are seven people
is proba I was somebody going to be sick
or an holiday or with sick kids so we
mostly just mobbed and we did that every
day we just never worked solo at all one
other important aspect I think was when
we realized that we should have some
kind of definition of when it's okay to
start working on a particular issue I
mean in the agile movement it's so
common that
when you start a new team you have to
decide on we have to have a definition
of done to know when we're done and
still when we're working on stuff we end
up in this disease discussions about
okay but this is a feature is it done or
is it done done or is it done done done
and nobody knows but for us we really
noticed a great effect when we decide
that before we can actually start
working on a particular issue it has to
fulfill a certain set of requirements
for instance everybody in the team and
should understand the problem because if
you can't describe the problem you will
never find a solution to that problem
and you should not be blocked by
external dependencies so if we were
integrating with another team and they
were not ready we needed to have some
data from them in order to start we
would simply not just start to work in
that because we don't want to work
halfway get blocked and have to wait
everybody should have a common
understanding and the ticket should not
be too big so we had this weekly
refinement meetings when we went through
the top of the backlog to make sure they
were ready to be started working on
because the real cost in software
development isn't writing the lines of
code the real cost in software
development lies in actually solving the
problem it's all these wasteful tasks
waiting and so on and then it's rework
and we hate rework it's demoralizing and
boring and if we can avoid that we can
get a much more better sense of progress
and productivity so with these concepts
that I've talked about today we were
ordered we were able to go from 12
tickets a month to 50 without changing
the ticket size compared to when we
worked so lower pair programming as we
did before
and also we look at the amount of the
production deployments we were able to
muster every week the average in the
company for all across all these teams
were around five to six production
deployments every day porosity was
between 20 and 25
like the
the normal pace but some days we were
able to even go up to 60 production
deployments every day so we really
outpaced other teams in terms of
fertility and pace and another important
aspect I think is to actually work as a
team it really felt for us that we were
working as a team together prestige less
and with the common goal because we talk
a lot about development teams in our
industry but it's really a team that the
same goal or is it just a group of
people sharing the same interest we can
compare it to the ice hockey team which
has the same goals to win the game or
the championship or a group of people
playing pick-up hockey on the frozen
lake the problem there for different
reasons but there have a common interest
but the important aspect I think for you
to get this to work is to make sure
everybody's comfortable we work together
as a team
no prestige and have a lot of fun while
doing it
thank you very much for listening so we
have some time for questions I think we
have a mic over here here can you use
right where is shout and I can repeat
the question yeah please yeah so the
question is was possible somebody to
work at home and we didn't really
involve those people in the mob we
didn't really have the proper programs
or infrastructure for that I think but
in most cases we have found something
maybe isolated those person could work
on and they you should join us on
hangout for the stand-ups and so on but
usually when somebody worked alone it
was still the most inefficient thing but
I know there are teams that are more
successfully tried out with their moding
thing with screen sharing tools and so
on but
we didn't really try that in that sense
yeah the question is what roles
basically we had in our team is
developers well since we had teams we've
had n friend responsibilities we need to
cover all these different aspects so we
all have different like specialities in
team like princess I'm more into test
automation than maybe the others so
maybe I thought more about how we're
going to test this what kind of test
cases do we need to write but we had
everything is automated like all the
tests we didn't have any like oh this is
a test person and doing manual
regression test because that's kind of
becomes a bottleneck and counterfeits
the continues deliver approach but we
have some people more skilled into the
operation things AWS what more people
were skilled in the core Java things or
a new spring framework which we used so
we had a lot of different skills but I
think it's a lot about how we assembled
the teams as well to make sure you have
this good mix and address all the
different aspects you need to consider
in order for team to be effective yeah
well the people are doing like more
programming well obviously at first
there were some people that were more
skeptical and Edward is different with
different personalities we had some
people that were more maybe not as
extrovert or social like to think about
problems by themself for what for a long
period of time people from different
backgrounds different cultures but in
the end I think when we actually you get
more comfortable in it and we can see
the results and people got more
comfortable working that way in the
beginning we I think we all felt like we
were really productive because we didn't
really have the you know the keyboard as
you usually do and maybe you don't feel
that you're contributing as much but
it's like you have to look at it on the
other hole the whole picture like a list
view of the of the approach and the
problem is trying to solve and make sure
that everybody contributes and feel that
their skill so I shall use to solve
those particular problems so that's
something that we'll work with quite a
lot in the beginning that's definitely
definitely something to keep in mind
please yeah so how we would integrate a
unit developer is a question so about
our team most people were quite senior
but we also had more junior people who
had one person coming directly from the
university joining our team and it can
be quite exhausting in the beginning but
it was like that even for me who had
been working for 10 years in the
industry they're coming in there in the
beginning it's a new new context new
domain business rules and terms that
I've never heard about so I think in the
beginning we're basically all in the
same page anyway so what I did to get up
to speed with what the team was working
on I was in the mob for the for the day
until like maybe 3 p.m. and then in the
afternoon I spent an hour or so or two
it's just deep dive into some problems
or how to figure out how stuff working
under the hoods
and I think it's important in general to
have some time some slack time in order
for you to both build on the knowledge
but also like sharpen your tools learn
new things and not always just sitting
there full focus on just hammering and
drilling and solving problems all the
time so over here
so the question is about different
skillsets and conflicts well we had a
quite quite similar stack of these 15
services that we had working were
back-end with some external facing like
powers but also internal facing it
pirates but what is one front-end app
and sure I'm more of a back end guy so I
had lot of problems with this react
framework in front end but when I worked
together with the person were
knowledgeable in front end we can still
have each other out like okay how are
you doing this in front and okay but in
the backend we use these kind of
concepts maybe we can apply these to
solve this problem where is all the way
around but they sure had a lot of
conflicts in the beginning some heat
more heated debates but I think you have
to look at it like being just
constructive so we had mostly heated
debates about the code convention so
like I'm more for static methods in Java
and some people were really hating it
and sort of okay we can't really decide
so let's just pros and cons with
everything up there on the board you
discuss the options and then you know
after a while you get a common
understanding of the problem and the
sense of okay which do we prefer the
best let's just go with that take a
decision
there's no prestige or anything like
this but yeah yeah
we're all human so it's a lot about
psychology yeah on top
and so how long do you take for us to
get this up and running to run smoothly
I would say maybe a few few months I've
felt then we had like a good a good
first steps at least we had a foundation
because in the first weeks we really
didn't know what we're doing but every
second week we had a retrospective her
to improve upon that weathers and blog
articles and is tried out different
experiments the good thing with doing a
retrospective every second week can you
run an experiment for two weeks see if
you liked or not and we don't commit to
doing anything some people are very
conservative that sounds like all we've
always done this way I don't want to try
anything new or we shouldn't change this
but if convince them to let's just try
it for two weeks that's it of two weeks
you can back out if you don't like it we
can try something else
but we iterating constantly improving on
the processes and quite quickly will
become more efficient and more
comfortable I think in the in the fart
fart area so what's the team lead in
this context well in our sense it was
somebody senior who still a lot of
industry industry experience blood
pressure was also more responsible for
the well-being of the team members had
one-on-one sand-like coaching and make
sure that their person development
aligned with a company vision I guess I
was more of that level not not not about
like seniority knowing the codebase the
best or the main logic or stuff like
that that was basically everybody was on
the same page there and not another
question
pardon get that so how did we interact
with the product owner and the part
owner was quite present it was out there
in the daily stand-up meetings and
usually came by the mob and asked how
we're doing I think it's important that
the product owner feels that he or she
is part of the team
we actually had their first owner
sitting in the mob coding with us one
time but after spending five minutes in
trying to find the curly braces for an
if statement I guess gave up but the
kudos for trying so but sometimes we had
the product owner sitting in the mob
just like discuss what problem are we
trying to solve and like or making sure
to address all the user case use cases
that the customer will face so yeah yes
to involve everybody because that's
knowledge that we want to have and make
yourself when we solve our problems and
create new features please
now we had teams the question was if we
had the team together for a particular
project only over span multiple projects
so it was a team that was more I only
could say like a feature team but more
into that sounds like we owned a certain
set of external facing api's and some
core functionality for the company so it
was more around that and regardless of
their products the company bought
products we were together in a team but
we had quite quite many rotations of
people during this time I was there for
one a half years and a a lot of people
starting and some people left but it
didn't really have such a big impact on
the pace or productivity I think it's
more about yeah okay now we need to
address that we don't really have this
particular skill set anymore so I always
think about how to assemble the team so
we can make sure to cover all these
different aspects that we need to
consider so if we be more programming we
did that the full sprint so yeah every
day from I'd rather stand up at 9:15 so
from there on until lunch and from lunch
maybe to 3 p.m. or something so there
was time in the morning for shaking
emails or try out stuff for reading
blogs or whatever in the same in the
afternoon so we had a flexible work
hours so people can come early or at
latest 9:15 then so it's bi-rite so you
shouldn't start up the mob until after
the daily stand-up meeting but sometimes
we had a morning mob as well yeah there
was a good question so it was a stand-up
still necessary we didn't really focus
about like the classical things going
around there but I said I was doing this
yesterday I'm going to do this today we
rather you just looked at the board and
like walked the board usually since
we're only working on one or two things
at the same time we only had like two
swimlanes on
bored so it's very easy we look at
what's the state of the current thing
we're working on and I'll be running to
some issues impediments we need to
address or do you think we're going to
be done when we think we're going to be
done or the production issues that we
need to address did something happen
last night when we're on call okay need
to address it was more about these kind
of things were like which meetings do we
have today that we need somebody needs
to attend or that I think we're out of
time now but if you have any more
questions just feel free to grab me
during the conference or ping me on
Twitter or LinkedIn or something thank
you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
