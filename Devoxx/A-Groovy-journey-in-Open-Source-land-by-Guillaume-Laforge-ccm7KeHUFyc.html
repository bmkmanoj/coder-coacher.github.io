this devoxx edition hope it's groovy
alright so this is I'm gamla Falls I'm
going to speak about the journey of the
the groovy programming language project
through the open open source land so I
work for a company called restlet which
is working in the realm of api's we have
different projects and products around
web api is and i'm doing a talk on the
REST API design right right after this
one so if you want to check out our
projects and products you can have a
look on wristlet calm and as this is
about the groovy programming language
I'd like to tell you that there's a
special promo code for those who wants
to buy the groovy in action book the
second edition which was released like
six months ago or something like that so
it's a revised for the latest and
greatest groovy and it's an eight now
weighs in about nine nine hundred pages
it's quite a thick book but you'll get
all the latest and interesting bits in
there and if you buy it i'll get i'll
get like 50 cents per book so i might be
getting rich by cell like a million i
don't know not sure that's going to be
the right number of additions will be
able to sell anyway so we'll go a little
bit through the the history of the of
the projects and all the editions it's
inceptions and features etc so if we
look back into the past in 2003 that's
when groovy was born it was made by Bob
McWhirter and Jem Strachan but McWhirter
is quite well known for things like Jay
board rules so it's
not his first it wasn't his first open
source project and Jem Strachan is also
known for service makes activemq and
some Apache Commons projects etc and
back in two thousand three gems was
chatting with his friend Bob and I was
saying you know wouldn't he be groovy if
we could do this and that's in Java and
he was inspired by languages like Python
small took Ruby it said run he felt like
you know we could do something cool in
Java but you know it's hard to let her
influence ja alright so the idea came to
breathe eze and invent and create a
brand new language that runs on the JVM
so that's how in august 2003 gems track
and created groovy and announced it on
on his blog why he did that the
inspiration etc and even in that pre 10
form Greer was already pretty much
looking like like what it's looking like
now and in 2003 we we already had
closures right and it was working on
Java 14 naturally perhaps it was even
working on Java 13 at the beginning no
bootable it was 14 anyway doesn't matter
much but yeah we had closures more than
10 years are going on the JVM that was
nice so the inspiration came from Python
Ruby small talk and other wising I mean
in terms of syntax that that was
actually the the jealous syntax that we
derived into a new grammar for
supporting Java itself as I mean like
copy and paste compatibility somehow
like 95 person perhaps of Java code is
also valid groovy code because of how we
derived the the groovy syntax the Java
syntax into the grid syntax
and on top of that where did tons of
useful methods simplify the the Java
code base to add missing methods to jdk
classes and things like that and it was
dynamically typed only but later on we
we also added static typing and static
type inference etc static compilation so
in 2003 pretty much mmm at the beginning
of the project i joined the project so i
had some some vacations and i had the
need for integrating some scripting
scripting capabilities into the project
I was working on at that time and during
my vacations I was like oh there's this
new cool shiny toy let me play with it
so I downloaded it I quickly noticed
that there were some issues with things
like unicode support
internationalization and things like
that and I had some spare time on the
hands and I looked at the code oh but
it's obvious they made a mistake there
so okay it's open source why not suggest
some some improvements and also I
contributed patches patches after
patches and Jim strike and he'll ask me
to become the the committee a committee
on the project because it was fed up of
applying my commits one after the other
but later on switch more in 2004
actually but later on the initial
project founders Bob and gems left the
project and moved on to all the projects
and that's how I actually became the
lead of the project in around 2004 so in
2004 that's when Facebook was born yeah
but was looking you know something like
that that was also the time for java 5
he had java 5 in 2004 we added a new
parser so there there have been a few
rewrite of the groovy parser over the
years and
this new passer was so there were
actually two hand-rolled passers before
moving to an entire based parser and the
the changes were contributed by John
Rossum Jeremy Renner drum John was that
the guy who worked on the invoke dynamic
support for the JVM by the way that's
also the year where Johann dildo best
known as black drag is a nickname joined
the project so after me that's the
second longest committee on the project
and something that was funny was that
already in 2004 that were already folks
saying okay this is the end of groovy
the sinking ship it's not you know
gaining any traction etc and that was a
blog post on the bio blog who remembers
the bio blog so it's more for older Java
developers anyway not not really
important as we shall see later on in
2005 first flight of the Airbus a380 but
that's also the year where the ground
web framework was really I've created at
least I don't remember the the first
release in 2006 some soccer fans will
remember what happened on the in that I
will on that year in 2006 that was java
6 and that was the first year where a
full-time committer be a commoner became
a full-time paid committer on the
project on my my friend Yohann was that
guy that lucky guy so Big Sky technology
that's the the company behind the north
of just of tour of conferences in the US
for those who know in 2007 the release
of the iPhone that's also when we
decided to go 10 it took us four years
to go to 310 but we really had some high
level standards of what we wanted one
old version
what it should be like and by experience
and also by looking at all the languages
we noticed that language really needs at
least three four years to become good
enough usable enough and useful enough
because otherwise things are a bit too
flaky syntax changes API changing etc
you need some time to make sure such a
project language project really needs
several years before really be right for
a prime time we with Graham Roche the
guy leading the the the the gray of
project as well as with Alec scatman we
created a company called g21 which was
dedicated to a green Grails support
product projects etc that same year that
was the inception of the Gradle build
tool automation and that was also the
first year where were there was a
dedicated conference for groovy and
grails and that was good that was called
Grails exchange later it became grooving
grounds exchange that they work that was
the first conference on on groovy and
it's not all 2007 was quite a busy year
that was also the year where the Spock
testing framework was conceived and what
else that was the year where we released
315 with the long way to Java five
support annotations in and generics etc
that's also when we release the joint
compiler so that you can join compile
java and gu resources at the same time
so you can mix and match groovy and java
sources together you know Java interface
implemented in groovy extending in Java
etc you can do that kind of Circle
Circle Circle language dependency
between your classes and interfaces plus
some other cool things
Paul King were the most prolific Greek
emitter joined the projects as well in
2007 and really became the big number
one committee since the beginning of the
project 2008 you have new CHT infringe
the movie photos we know that movie that
was also the creation of the great conf
series of conference first in Denmark in
2007 the gt1 company my small startup
was acquired by spring source so we
joined the spring source team we had
Griffin for a new project for desktop
applications easy be a behavior driven
development library for your testing
needs that there was also a fork or
groovy called groovy plus plus by my
former teammate Alex scatman
interestingly that was actually already
the third fork of the projects they have
been at least three forks of the
projects three or four I don't remember
but it's quite difficult to fork project
and make it successful but at least what
Alex had been working on static
compilation was a very very interesting
playground for the the support of static
type checking and Static compilation
that we later added to a groovy 2009
there was a famous quote by Jim Strachan
the original founder who said that he
might have not created groovy if he had
known about Scala before perhaps you've
heard about that quote which was a bit
misleading and put out of context by
scala fanboys especially you know it's a
bit like if you had a guy like giving
King saying you know if they had been
jpa when I created hibernate I wouldn't
have created hibernate which
true why invented pretty much the same
thing with the same agilent features and
back to or gems so he studied with
groovy moved to a bit of scala then
moved to doing some cutting and for the
past year is actually back into groovy
because he's using it for things like
continuous integration continuous
delivery with the jenkins the via the
the job DSA are so he had a few tweets
on that and also mom what so he's he he
is doing some groovy again after a quick
escape and to scale and coupling that
here springsource was acquired by vmware
so i joined vmware my colleagues join
p.m. we're on the groove ecosystem grew
again with well some interesting project
like jeepers which is our concurrency
parallelism framework for four groovy
jab that's a functional integration
testing tool for web api switch really
encourage you to have a look at we also
have things like konark cut narc is a
static code analysis tool a bit like
Feinberg's its a mix of Feinberg's PMD
check style etc but specific to groovy
gmail n plus that's a great support for
rebuilding groovy based projects in
maven guru 16 much better performance
multiple assignments more optional
returns that's where actually a ste
transformations came to be popular the
grape system for getting dependencies
easily with a simple annotation then 317
we borrowed the the power assets from
the spock framework and power assets
that's the nice way of doing asserts in
groovy where you see all the values of
the sub expressions of the the
expression that you are asserting a
certain
what else yes some things like
customizing the groovy truth let's call
for politicians and lawyers and guys
like that and also some support for
helping both developers author ast
transformations with the HD viewer and
HD builder in 2010 the year where
volcano wrecked lots of AI mean the all
the air traffic in Europe and well in
the northern name is fair essentially
now I was stuck for a week at the great
conf US Conference in Minneapolis
because I couldn't fly back home in
Paris and friends that was the birth of
rat pack and G contracts for doing a
program designed by contract kind of
programming 2011 that's yeah the year of
the big tsunami we also had Java 7 then
some new projects in the ecosystem like
vertex there was a war zone presentation
about vertex already this week groovy
effects that's a nice groovy dsl for
dealing with the javafx so you can more
easily and more declaratively deal with
javafx rather than you know programming
the the scene graphics etc we really
strip 18 the key change the key
additions and key let's say update to to
the syntax whether what we call common
chain expressions so that's a way to get
rid of dots and parenthesis for the case
where you have chained method calls so a
which takes be as parameter doubt see
takes D as parameters around you chain
method calls like with fluent api is you
often see that in the libraries these
days and that's the ability to drop the
datsun parents and
which makes very very readable dsl's in
groovy because you can almost right
plain English French or whatever
language plain English sentences without
much punctuation so you can really write
things which yeah just look like normal
sentences which don't look like
programming you know with semi-colons
with parent sizes and so on so it's one
of the very nice features which make the
groovy syntax very flexible and
malleable and so that you can write
domain-specific languages some more
tweaks to the groovy closures yet the
building jazz and supports we since the
beginning of the project we had great
XML support but I mean these days most
web api etc are actually preferring
Jason over XML so we added support for
it for Jason as well my friend said like
shampoo joined the groovy team and we
moved the project to get up before we
were the sources were on the cutouts
repository the cadets foundation but
welcome back to cut out later on in 2012
the Higgs boson was far was found and
the the groovy ecosystem continued to
grow and I'd like to mention a few
interesting projects by you know
companies which are quite well-known
like LinkedIn or netflix linkedin
created project called glue which they
use for deployment continuous deployment
of their infrastructure to glue is a
ruby dsl once again a great
domain-specific language netflix they
created Asgard which is actually a great
application for dealing with their again
deployments on the muzzle amazon AWS
cloud they're also this one is venturing
is interesting the the zoo project
that's
kind of rooting framework and library
which defines groovy rules to root on a
request so actually what's interesting
with that project is that I think now
Netflix has like 50 or 60 million
customers worldwide and each time you
know a customer is doing a request to
view a video it's going to be routed
through some groovy logic so each time
you watch something on Netflix that's
going through groovy code and that makes
a zoo Netflix probably the biggest web
scale deployment of groovy to date
because they are you know pretty much
every day like several and several
millions of consumers they don't know
they are using groovy but actually they
either when they request a video on the
net fixed platform that's going through
some groovy code some other cool
projects grew scripts the GS logo that
you see here that some good script is a
transpiler to transpile and phones form
groovy code into JavaScript so if you
want to target JavaScript you can use
grew script to translate groove into
JavaScript code gvm now call the SDK
manager it's a nice nandi tool for
dealing with all the SDKs that you are
using so if you're using the groovy SDK
Grails SDK Gradle SDK vertex SDK now
that's support for other languages not
just groovy and other frameworks and
tools and but initially that was a
groovy specific so more into the modern
age let's say with groovy to agree to
introduce static type checking and
static compilation so you've got all the
type inference logic that you can find
in in other static languages advanced
type inference with things like flow
typing where you see the
you do the compiler checks at every step
let's say variable is being assigned and
see okay now this is an instance of this
and then it's a instance of a subclass
etc so it knows in a very fine grain
fashion what's the actual type of
something and the type inference engine
is quite clever in the sense that it's
able to infer types which are not denote
table in Java so things you cannot
really Express with the Java syntax so
it's more fine-grained if you will that
then what the the javelin which can
actually represent in terms of times
groovy to all added some support for
most of the project coin enhancement
from Java 7 so things like so actually
the sole thing that's not supported is
the the try with resources notations but
this notation we don't really need it in
groovy in the sense that we have lots of
handy shortcut library of shortcut
methods which simplify the use of
resources etc so we ended up not adding
it but things like underscores in
numbers multi cache block etc we are did
all this stuff we also introduced the
invoke dynamic support to make groovy
pretty much as fast as Java even in
dynamic mode but of course if you use
the static compilation feature it's just
as fast as javim so people thinking you
know a dynamic language so it's not just
a dynamic language baby because it's a
kind of hybrid now but dynamic language
has to be slower than a statically
compiled language but with invoke
dynamic that's not really true anymore
and anyway if there are still some hot
spot where you know it's slower than
Java you can still use static
compilation we also modularized groovy a
little bit in 2013 mr. Snowden will
whistleblower that's also also the year
where there was a spin-off of
VMware emc into people also all the
spring stuff tomcat style guru grill
stuff went into in two people at the
same time the ecosystem continued to
grow with things like grain which is a
static site generator in groovy the
first one with the little crossed bones
that's a lazy bones which is a project
template system I can easily create a
template for any kind of project and you
can customize that with a some groovy
logic next for is a kind of workflow
system I won't dive into all of them
groovy 21 we continued refining the
invoke dynamic support for better
performance and there were still places
which were not as fast as they could
have been what's interesting with the
the static type inference we had the
static type checker we we implemented we
also allowed people to create their own
type checking extensions so if you have
even a very dynamic groovy
domain-specific language you can make
you can create type check custom type
checking extensions which allow you to
create compilation errors analyze the
code and create compiler compilation
errors even for very dynamic code so you
won't get runtime errors all that kind
of things you'll be able to define new
compilation errors if your dsl is not
following you know the rules imposed by
that dsl in groovy 21 we introduced meet
annotations which is way of regrouping
annotations in one single annotation
because sometimes there are you know
frameworks which rely perhaps a bit too
much on annotations and sometimes it's a
bit like you know annotation driven
development you've got a class of five
lines of code but you've got ten lines
of annotations you know you see what I
mean and sometimes there's a pattern
where you Ryu
is a certain set of annotations all the
time like let's say on your domain
classes you might be having three for a
notation that you use all the time
excuse me you can regroup them with a
meter annotation so it's your own
annotation but which regroups all those
annotations and the thing is that it's a
compiler thing right so in the resulting
bytecode if the the retention is the
annotation is retained in the in the in
the bytecode it's notice or sanitation
the the class will have all those
annotations which are regrouped by the
meter annotation so it's really a pure
compile-time thinning to improve how ids
understand groovy dsl's a wheel so added
an annotation so it's not a
transformation but an annotation which
helps the groovy compiler know how to
delegate certain calls with enclosures
to some other objects so this is a I
don't know if some of you went to
Cedric's presentation on groovy dsl's
just just before my talk but here you
gave some examples of that what else
yeah we bundled jeepers 10 in groovy to
that too we added to all the Java 8
wasn't there with lung disease etc we
added closer portion to single abstract
method types into a groovy so whenever
you have an interface with one single
method or well one single abstract
method not you might have default
methods etc or if you have an abstract
class with one method to implement you
can actually use a closure in place of
where you would have used such a sum
type so it makes the code much more
streamlined and instead of having to do
things like you know new runnable void
run blah blah blah you just pass a
closure
well it's not a good example because
brewery courses are also reliable and
that's just to give you the the idea so
instead of creating an anonymous in our
class you just can't pass you know a
groovy closure instead so it's pretty
much the same system as what Java 8
introduced except that it's not just for
functional interfaces but it also works
for abstract classes as well so it's
very Java lambda friendly so wherever
you would use lambda in Java 8 now you
can actually use a groovy closure I mean
when you're developing groovy obviously
so it's the same mechanism so it's
slightly different syntax because Ruby
closures and Java lambdas are have
slightly different syntax but that's
pretty much equivalent in 2014 that's
the what's the name of that probe the
feel i probe which lending on the i
forgot the name of the blue comet anyway
that's the year where java 8 was
officially released in terms of the
vehicle system the little Duke
Pathfinder Pathfinder thank you the
little Duke at the bottom is for a
little framework called what is called G
bench for doing some micro benchmarks
and elasticsearch decided to use groovy
as the default scripting languages so if
you want to or customize elasticsearch
you can enable groovy in groovy to dot 3
we added traits so that's a bit alike
interface default methods in jar in Java
8 but a little bit different and the
sense that it's not yeah well you how to
say that all right so I could make a
full presentation on greet rate so I
won't dive into the the differences
between traits and default method in
interfaces but that that's going a
little bit be
in then nobody can do with default
methods trade so that's a nice way of
combining different it's a bit like
interfaces with concrete implementations
for some of the of the methods and you
can inherit from several traits so you
can recombine different behavior coming
from different traits together yeah we
further improved the performance of the
Jays and support some new HT
transformations in your mock-up template
engine one of the interesting
characteristics of this template engine
agree as at several template engines for
years but this new one also adds a
static type checking static compilation
support so that you can have template
which are pre compile and execute as
fast as as possible and that's pretty
much it for groovy the history until
it's a great 23 the history tale for
well till till the beginning of this
year okay and now let's have a closer
look at what actually happened those
past 10 months first of all well the
groovy and grails team have been fired
people all decided that we were how to
say that politely we were not a
strategic let's data thanks for the word
it's always difficult to him to express
that and still be you know I've got tons
of friends at pivot also i don't want to
be and friendly with them but yeah they
got we got fired because they thought
that were grooving res were not
strategic and they wanted to focus on
Cloud Foundry etc and despite green
Grails have always been used for things
like cloud computing for distributed
architectures for high-traffic website
etc typically the kind of
settings that the the can of
environments where groovy ingreds were
cloud ready already but well they
decided that it wasn't really the big
focus was really on Cloud Foundry so
they decided to get rid of us however
they were friendly enough to give us a
bit of time so they decided that at the
end of the past year the previous year
but they gave us steel much 31st to
release at least the the next major
versions of both groovy and grails we we
had some time to do that but yeah that's
I'm still a bit bitter about this story
but in groovy 24 a key highlight in 324
was the the android support so since
gree 24 you can actually use groovy to
build android applications and one of
the examples i could mention is the the
new york times they decided to
reimplement they're angry depression
using groovy + RX java and so that it's
a much nicer to develop with a more
concise syntax and as fast at java
basically because they use static
compilation so green plus static
compilation + RX java and they were very
happy with the result so if you use the
New York Times Android application
that's actually a groovy Android
application and beside that naturally
also because of the android support we
we worked actually on things like
optimizing the bytecode to make it even
leaner even in terms of size when you're
on mobile devices you also need I mean
the memory that you have available is
usually it is usually smaller than you
know on server applications typically
because that's just a handheld device
some more refinements in the trade
support with a specific annotation to
say that a trade can only be applied to
certain types that's what at
self type is useful for more HD
transformations and so on so you know
after having been fired what else could
possibly go wrong you know couldn't be
worse than that right actually that's
the Krause demise kudos the foundation
which has supported groovy for the past
11 12 years I was closing its doors so
all the project hosted there had to move
on and go elsewhere so we had already
moved some of our infrastructure things
like github but they were still quite a
few things available that could house
like our bug tracker like so we also had
a get mirror there we had the website
etc so we also in addition to losing our
jobs trying to find a new job and having
also less than to work on the project
because you know we were hunting for a
new job well so we you might be
wondering you know what's the impact on
groovy after all what do you think that
people would you know by fear of what
would happen to the project perhaps
people would stop using it or something
like that not quiet so if you look back
at the figures the downloads figures for
me downloads is a key indicator for the
success of an open source project if you
look at past figures so agree was
downloaded almost two million times in
2012 3 million in 2013 4 to 5 million
2014 and oh well 2015 is not yet over
but if you had to guess how many
downloads would could groovy gets for
this incomplete year less than four dot
five as much as for that five million or
more than 45 million downloads
someone says six flower hire 10 oh
that's big bold number i like that so if
you look at the first ten month of 2015
we had six point six millions of
downloads but it's actually maven
central only because we moved a bit of
so there was also some legacy downloads
from cut house but I don't have the
figures for that so the figure I have
the figures i have is not totally
complete but you know that's pretty
close to i don't know if it adds perhaps
or not the median or several hundred
thousand i dunno but we also host the
binaries on bin tray from a jet from my
friends from jeff rob and what happens
if i add the numbers from being 333
millions downloads from vintry plus the
6.6 million and you get almost the 10
million downloads that you mentioned so
you were the I don't have anything to
give you but I could have you know given
something for the winner with the
closest estimation so nine point nine
million times that groovy has been
downloaded so compared to the previous
year to the previous year and the year
is not even over the project was
downloaded twice as much more than twice
as much as the previous year so now
what's next first a few words about our
respective situations like the the core
the core groovy and grails guys were
working at pivotal so Cedric Johan and
myself on the grease I Grails we had
Graham Jeff and Larry and so we were all
on the pivotal payroll and we moved to
you know different places I moved to
rest let's a trick on Larry I moved to
cradle Graham
Jeff move to OC I and Johan is going to
join can you presume that's the latest
news I got and what else you know we
decided to we could have put you know
everything I mean in terms of
infrastructure of the great project we
could have put everything you know on
github or some static pages somewhere
use a github issues or things like that
but we decided we wanted to stand strong
stronger message to the groovy community
and ecosystem so we decided to join the
Apache foundation for us there's a clear
message to the community here because
for us so the the Apache foundation is
the one is the foundation which is
closest to our you know DNA if you will
compared to some other foundations or
similar organizations so the message we
wanted to send was that the group
project is here to stay and what's nice
is that the the Apache foundation also
gives a certain level of Independence
for the project meaning that we are not
at the mercy of any commercial interest
so some commuters might be paid to work
full-time on the project of course
that's totally possible but at least the
it's not because let's say pivotal
remove the funding of the project that
the project is going to die because
there's I mean all the project is going
to be you know close chores or or things
like that instead with the Apache
foundation you know that the project is
here for the long term that nobody can
close the project or anything like that
and one of the interesting values of the
Apache foundation is also the the
community which is a very big and
important aspect of the of the
foundation and it's something the Rita
Marie cared about so we join the Apache
Incubator at the end of March we were
lucky to have some great mentors to help
us through this process
and the initial set of common errors
Paul King said a Pascal Johan and myself
so I just I did the PMC chair because I
was just voted as the chair of the PMC
of the Apache groovy project so now you
can pretty much say Apache groovy
instead of just groovy if you want so we
moved the infrastructure the mailing
list were moved to the Apache
infrastructure jireh issues as well get
so what's interesting with get and
especially at the Apache foundation is
that for legal reasons the main line so
although get is a distributed VCS but
for the the main line or the the main
code base has to be on the git
repositories from a patch so we only
have actually a mirror of that
repository on github and it's not the
same old project that we had on github
so we had tons of stars on the groovy
project on github but we lost all of
them when moving to a patchy so if you
want you can go to the the mirror on the
github mirror and add a star please do
so and so that we gain back all our lost
stars after that some new comedies or
past committers actually join back the
projects like Andres the aggressor and
Keegan wit that's the guy behind the G
maven support she'll a very brand-new a
committer a very talented committer
during the project very recently the
following steps following entering the
incubation the we had to make a first
release right to follow the the Apache
guidelines in terms of licenses
how we deliver the binaries and all
those little details required by the the
Apache foundation so we did a first try
but we we had some further tweaks to do
to be really fully compliant with the
requirements but in July 9th we managed
to breeze or first Ruiz with the new
infrastructure and greet 244 actually
integrates a very important security fix
so if you're not using 3244 if you're
using an older version please be please
be sure to have great perhaps you've
heard I think that was this week or the
previous one where there was a bit of
buzz about some serialization Java crl
sterilization issue perhaps you've seen
that birds in the in the news where
sudden projects were affected by a
malignant code that could be executed
when deserializing java classes so we
were affected by that problem but we
fixed that several month ago so that was
an article and info queue which
mentioned that groovy was affected but
only old versions of grey were affected
and more recently we also released to 45
with when we were the most of the core
groovy team was a variable at javaone so
we did release together and now what so
what's in grid 2 for 4 525 etc so we
continue to improve the compiler
performance and various improvements to
existing HD transformations like
canonical using meteor annotations it's
a traveler yeah I have some examples of
that so can only call it's like the at
immutable AC transformation which
generates all the code for making
classes immutable but this one is for
mutable classes so it creates a proper
equals and hashcode property string
method etc constructors and whatnot and
it's actually on paper it looked like
the combination of all those other
transformations but in practice the
weight it had been implemented that
wasn't the case so we slightly change
the implementation to make that metal
rotation so that it's a somehow a
synonym of using all those other
annotations at string at equals and
hashcode it said we what else include
names from to string yeah so that's just
showing one aspect of canonical which is
when you pass parameters inside the
annotations if there's not such a
parameter on the metal notation it's
going it's going to find which bundle
annotations requires that a tribute for
this meter annotation capability we have
a class mechanism which is called the
annotation collector which helps
bundling several annotations together
and we have more fine-grain fine-grained
sorry fine-grained control on how those
annotations are merged together there's
a new map constructor to create named
argument constructor we have what else
could I tell you about that so if you're
not using at immutable or at canonical
you can still benefit from the map
constructor but here you have some more
control as well and the things like also
compilation errors if you if you have
errors in the in the name document that
you pass to the map constructor and
another aspect which is interesting with
that mechanisms that there's the pre and
post
attributes which allow you to do things
at the beginning of that map constructor
or after that map construction and yeah
I was mentioning that in relation to the
map constructor but that's also
available elsewhere in a ste
transformations when you have all those
transformations where you specify like
here for the auto clone transformation
you won't say ok don't care about the
surname property of that class if you
made a typo to surname you would have
gotten a runtime error but here it's
been improved so that you get a
compile-time error instead although
surname is inside the string the
compiler is now smart enough to figure
out it should throw compile time error
rather than runtimeerror the chapel
constructor there's a new parameter so
the triple constructor generated several
constructors depending on how many
parameters you passed to the constructor
but if you use defaults equals true it
only generates the the full constructor
with all the properties of the other
class the immutable class also works
across the the class hierarchy so you
can have here I have an athlete class
which extends a person class so you can
actually make that work before I
commutable was really only working on
base classes classes extending object
basically so now it also works for the
throughout the class hierarchy we also
added some new methods but I guess I can
skip that for it when you when you work
with all the things like find all
collect map etc so it's even a little
bit smarter in the sense that when you
have a certain type of list of map etc
it's drawing as
not just possible to when you use all
those final collect map methods etc it's
trying to use the most appropriate
container class which is the same if
possible as the original class were
iterating over we also improve the the
compiler puff month thanks to a new
class reader instead of relying on class
loader to do a class reading so when you
do compilation you need to read all the
methods available on other classes that
you need inside your own groovy classes
so we got a nice contribution from
someone from JetBrains to make the the
compiler even smarter well that's quite
a long journey since 2003 so the the
latest news and I'd like to also close
the this discussion with some remarks
about open source professional Prince
Wars and so on but in terms of the the
latest news about the the group project
inside the Apache foundation so very
recently we run the the vote for
graduation so the project management
committee decided to do a vote to make
groovy a top-level the batch project so
so far we were still only an incubating
project not a full-blown top-level
project so the project committee voted
for that then the incubator committee
also voted for the graduation and
actually the next step is for the the
final decision from from the Apache
board to say okay yes no a groovy can
become a top-level project so perhaps we
might have to do some further tweaks
that haven't been caught by the the
incubator PMC etc but normally perhaps
even next week if not later groovy
should become the top-level project at
Apache and then you'll be able to fully
call it a patch agree not just grew but
keep calling coding it grow and to close
with some remarks on open source
although I was bit you know disappointed
by having been fired of that dream job
of working full time on groovy I'm still
grateful for all those companies who
decided to sponsor degree and grails
project because when you are focused on
the project full time it's really not
the same as you know spending your
weekends nights um on an open source
project because you can really focus on
puter factories and more thorough
examinations of the poor internals of
the project etc and of course having big
companies or not nestle big but having
companies fund open source projects
often help projects move faster and
iterate faster feature after feature so
I'm very grateful for all those
companies and not just people all VMware
springsource but also all the other
companies that let groovy committers
work even if only part time on the
project I really have to be you know
grateful for that because it really
helped make groovy such a mainstream
let's say our native language at least
that's probably the most popular
alternative language nowadays even if
there's most much less light than before
and bootstrapping what did I don't
remember what I want to say about
bootstrapping forgot so it's called to
have pictures you know in your
presentation but as I didn't put shown
out so I don't remember what I wanted to
say you I mean you start projects you
know what at night weekends etc and make
it useful for your use case in the
company you're working at or some
personal projects so it helps get the
the project studied but again to eco my
my previous remark professional burn
source is useful for moving forward and
making some strong progress in in the
life of a project and sometimes the
problem you have also with project which
are we've got lots of external
contributions from guys who are not paid
to work at all on on groovy but some so
it's in French that's the I don't know
it's called in in English the rabbit and
the tortoise or something like that I
don't know should have put an English
title on that one sometimes developers
don't work at the same speed basically a
full-time employee will be able to move
forward more quickly than a contributor
a contributor not working full-time on
the project might have more difficulties
following what's going on in the project
so sometimes there's a difference
between those two kind of developers and
commuters and sometimes it's make it
makes things a bit harder for the
community to continue contributing
easily so it's something you have to be
aware of when there's a when there are
companies involved in an open source
project and the last aspect i wanted to
mention was that actually trying to
encourage people to contribute to open
source project i mean i can encourage
you to join the project and submit
patches etc that's how i joined the
project actually right so that's how I
became a Greek emitter it said Ron and
then let Lydia started leading the
project in 2004 but yeah it's not um
it's not always easy to to get people to
contribute and especially a project like
a programming language is not something
that is easy to get into so you can work
on things like the DSD k the libraries
etc which probably the easiest part
where you can contribute but things like
going into the hardcore parts of things
like implementing you know the byte code
for the the byte code generation for the
compiler or working on
the on Taylor grammar etc those parts
not necessarily the easiest part to
contribute to so it's not always easy
and people often start with some small
bits in the let's say in the suburbs of
the big town that is the project and
then progressively are they as they feel
more at ease with the internal how the
work the projects working internally
then you can actually make things more
you know make more meaningful
contributions right so thanks a lot for
your attention we've got a couple of
minutes left for some questions so first
of all thanks a lot thanks a lot and
yeah I'm happy to take a couple
questions if you have some anyone over
there Spock yes
yeah so is spot what's the future of spa
whether it's actively supported so I
mean since Spock 10 it's quite major
there's not that much to add or change
something I actually would like to seize
the there were some work in progress
stuff on the nice reports for instance
that I'd like to see but otherwise I
mean poke his eye yeah I think we
haven't seen a release in a while so
there were quite a few small
improvements etc that would probably
make it important to me to make a
release out of that that could be a good
thing yeah but uh they I don't think
that's all that much activity because
it's already quite major and there's not
really much to add unless you see
something that's worth adding 2 to the
project but don't hesitate to also ping
the the Spock team on the remaining list
who to us more about that yeah another
question yeah in the middle top of there
here
yeah so we had a question of so with the
loss of funding people firing us finding
a new job it's drive we could have
studied a a new company around the the
groovy grails group technologies etc
that was definitely an option and we
even had even some VCS and venture
capitalists and interested in there in
that but we felt that so I mean we could
make easily make a living by just you
know supporting the projects doing
consulting training and so on that's
that's not really a problem but we we
wanted to if we were to create a new
company we wanted to you know create
some interesting or cool product or
project around that using those
technologies and project which would
really you know make a difference in our
you know field in our communities and
although we had quite a few ideas there
was there was already quite a bit of
competition in those fields so we felt
that we probably need to make sure our
ideas a bit more before really thinking
about creating a new company out of that
and now I mean everybody is spread
across different companies so I don't
know if it will ever happen actually
better than you know Never Say Never ok
so times up thanks a lot for your
attention and enjoy the rest of the show</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
