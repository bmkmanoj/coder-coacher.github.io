the courageous ones for the last slot of
the day yeehaw
hope you have great day today we're
going to talk about the new platform and
the language called e and we're gonna
look at that we're gonna look at that
some decided decisions that they made to
make the language interesting and the
second half of the talk we're gonna look
at which tools in the Java ecosystem
could have been inspired by Eve so it's
a it's a new experimental platform and
people doing that or just running
experiments about how to maybe better
write software so it's not directly
applicable but it is typically inspiring
and I hope you will look into that and
think about well maybe maybe something
like this would be useful in my
applications and then when you develop
software you will think about how to
make it possible let's start about with
me I am a developer advocate my name is
Alex life I come from the company called
zero turnaround and usually I reside in
Estonia which is kind of terribly cold
right now and so I'm happy to live here
as developer advocate one of my main
responsibilities is to care about the
community so I like talking to you all
kinds of developers I've been a
developer for approximately eight years
before switching to this different role
I'm one of the co-leader of a virtual
jack and you can find me on where if you
have any questions about this session
software development or life in general
Zero's around is a company that does
tools for java developers we have a
booth at the expo floor so if you're
gonna come and talk to us and check
those out we would be happy and my
employer will be happy and they will
send me to more places to talk to more
awesome people with all that mentary
thing out of the way let's talk about
software development and if you talk
about soft
relevant you know that it's typically
pretty complex and hard tasks and it's
the demanding job and while I know that
we typically enjoy developing software
otherwise we wouldn't be developers it
really is kind of complicated and there
are a number of reasons for that
one of which is the software that we
develop is there large complex systems
consisting of many moving parts and this
is the I think the first image that you
see in Google when you google software
architecture or web application
architecture
and you can see there are many many
layers so the thing is most applications
what did you just do they transform data
right we it we have a database store
somewhere and that database tour
contains data and the user request comes
we take some data out of that transform
that into the user credentials since one
passes through the layers of our system
and then pass data back transforming
that at every layer the complication
from that comes that every layer takes
different approaches to how to handle
and represent the data and through the
try to hide some abstractions try to
hide some corner cases but the offering
you a instruction for this particular
layer they also introduce vocabulary
they increase some current cases and in
different data models
so there are HTTP verbs there are SQL
queries and there are no SQL solution so
if you put everything into like a like a
table right you will see that typically
there will be a data model there will be
read operations to get the values from
the data model there will be write
operations and you can see that through
the typical layers in the web
applications though those abstractions
and those data models will be different
and from that comes a lot of complexity
naturally as accomplished developers we
learn how to tackle that right we live
and breathe this day in day out so it
comes to us as a second nature but
typically if you think about how did you
start when you started
or how with different new people come
into the industry there will be pretty
confused about that and every layer like
even if we don't look at the picture in
in in in general there will be two ways
to look at at the operations what's
possible so one will be a very high
level abstraction if we talk about HTTP
or how the internet works you could
imagine that it works magically like
that and you have some a user story and
there is a magic thing that satisfies
the request by the user and this will be
a high level abstraction they were easy
to understand they're not very useful
because they limit applicability of that
there are many languages and programming
languages they typically occupy some
certain niches in software development
and say the easiest way with the highest
level of abstraction will be DSL a
specific language to cover specific
business needs but typically they will
have very little applicability if you
think about something that almost any
person can do think about the
spreadsheet right you can create
formulas in there you can perform some
computation in a spreadsheet but there
is very little what you can do with the
spreadsheet especially if you consider
normal tasks of a software development
it's really hard to create a web
application insulin inside an Excel
spreadsheet or their work RTD real-time
apps or distributed systems kind of
impossible so you need to go deeper and
when you go deeper you uncover that
there are very very many details of what
happens even when he did the simplest
action so as an example of that the same
used the story of bringing Google Chrome
to the web page there was a repository
with quite a lot of text that explains
what exactly is happening at every stage
of processing that requests the rest
everything from what happens when your
keep is pressed how the operating system
interacts that and this is not an
abstraction right this is explicit
specification what happens you can do
anything with that you can modify that
to your needs but it's really complex I
don't believe that
any normal software developers actually
even understand how the commuters work
to this level so we all deal with some
sort of abstractions but as we know they
are all leaky and we know that at least
since 2002 very long time ago and and
that's what that's why the software
development complex so enter Chris
Granger he's an exceptional person and
very smart guy and he's one of the main
people behind the platform Eve about
which we're gonna talk in a minute
somewhere in 2011 I think maybe 12 they
wanted to tackle the problem how to make
software development easier not just for
new people but for developers as well
so what they first thought they thought
that we don't have enough tools and if
we have better tools we gonna have
better experience developing software
maybe tooling can help so naturally they
picked the first tool that any developer
uses throughout the day and that was the
ID and they decided let's build a new ID
and the main point of the light table
which is now has become an open-source
project is and it's a fairly interesting
IDE what they wanted to do they wanted
instant feedback to the changes it do to
the code and they wanted to bring the
source code that you write and the
execution of the code that you see in an
application closer together so one of
the defining features of the light table
were that they would render the values
of variables right next to the source
code using small rectangles so you
execute the code and then propagate the
that data back into your source code and
at that time that was pretty interesting
now I know that IntelliJ IDEA at least
does that I think out of the box I don't
know about other IDs but at some point
they decided that yeah ID is great but
it doesn't solve actually problems
because while it is a tool it's still
the programming involves lots of
abstractions and they're hard to learn
and they're hard to operate with
so they decided to peel it into a
different project and they created or
started crated if if is a program a
programming language and the platform
with the main goal to give anyone access
to programming in computing as a general
purpose tool so to avoid that very steep
learning curve but at the same time not
to limit the applicability of the
problems that we'll write so the ceiling
on the power is low and but the
abilities of the platform should be
immense
so they should be ready TD to create
normal typical solutions to the programs
so we would have real time collaboration
sharing data between programs building
web applications but they wanted it to
be understandable so they created the
platform and they created a language and
the language and the programs in that
language in EVE look like this if
operates on blocks of code so it uses
literate programming and you you specify
your program in a file using pieces of
text like that so that your IDE is
anything that can handle on the markdown
file every block of code concerts
consists of a couple of operations if
views and looks at the world and tries
to see everywhere a database a database
not in a typical relational database
meaning but a storage for the records
which is the main think that if operates
at so the block looks like that you
search a database you pattern match the
records that were found in the database
you transform the data using some
operations and then you bind or persist
the data back into the database and in
this case when I say database it doesn't
have to be like a document store but
everything can be database just like dr
ql looks the universe at the universe
like a graph and there is some wrapper
that actually hides the complexity of
the world and makes it look like it's a
graph the same way eve looks at the
world and sees only records
and apparently typically people know two
models of competition so we know Turing
machines obviously where you have a tape
with cell values where you can read in
the right data where there is the lambda
calculus which is equivalent where you
have functions and application of the
functions you also have a third kind of
square model where you have a string of
data and then your operations or you
take a substring of that based on the
pattern match and you change values and
you write it back into the same string
and you apply the operation again and
again and allegedly that model of
computation is equally powerful to the
first tip so it can do anything that
normal program can do and it is kind of
what happens with Eve as well
there is documents you find stuff you
modify stuff and you put it back into
the database database didn't anything
the communication channel between your
server and your client could be database
and you can write records that your HTML
view of your application it consists of
records which are the tags you can write
modify them you can write them back it
could be a communication between
distributed parts of your system it
could be the actual persistence tour or
anything the records is what if operates
at and this is a dominant data structure
in Eve and it looks like that you define
a record you give it a name and you give
it a sequence of tags which would be the
qualities the parameters on which would
you like to pattern match remember you
don't just create records out of blue
typically you would find them from a
certain database and you wouldn't like
all the records in that database but you
can specify the constraints records can
be nested and you can have more complex
parameters and you can you have a couple
of syntax options to to specify them so
you can use premiere attributes through
the documentation not notice that this
equality there it is not an assignment
this is the equivalent sign so he don't
just modify it yet you can also have
nested records
and you if since every record has to
have a tag which is kind of like a class
to specify what kind of objects we are
trying to deal with you can omit the tag
and you can use just the hash tag thing
so all those three lines would pattern
match the records of type person where
one was specified the age and ante
address another one will specify the H
as well or just find people by name
which is RAM so those two things are
equivalent and records is how if does
the pattern matching and after that you
you can deal with thus those values if
you want it talked about operations
there are very limited set of actions
that you can perform the first one is
search and that as I said the pattern
matching of the record in a database you
can also commit which is the way to tell
if to persist a data record into the
database more you can have search and
bind and in a bind system you you
specify a database to persist data into
and you specify the records that you
would like to persist you can use
information from a pattern matched
records and bind is a very special
operation it tells if to update all the
subsequent records that support this
change so if in this case we search for
the time every time the time will change
this code block will be executed then
we'll get the number of hours and then
we will bind into the database which is
a browser a div that uses the
information from that that means that
whatever else is dependent on on the
record that we created in the HTML the
those code blocks will be executed when
the value of time will change so this
way you can think of this as the big
Excel spreadsheet where you specify
values and we specify dependencies
between the cells but you don't do that
in the weird format of a spreadsheet but
you specify that declaratively
in an in-text file
and that is that is how if programs look
like we're gonna look at a more complex
example of that in a couple of minutes
so think about this you can have
multiple records you don't have the
assignment
this is equivalence that this is the
fewer example of a logical programming
which is as well as functional
programming or object-oriented
programming is a paradigm about how to
structure and execute the programs the
cool thing about this and the very
interesting bit and why you could be
inspired by it if is that for
object-oriented programming we know
which types of problems it solves well
for functional programming we also know
what class of programs which is so as
well for example when you need to
process a string of data functional
programming is a natural answer if you
need to have like a mutate mutable state
probably functional programming will not
be a good answer but an object-oriented
paradigm probably will be the thing with
logical programming is that it's hard to
find the niche for which the logical
program will be the proper answer on to
the question how what's the most natural
way to eat is to solve that program but
maybe maybe if can't make some steps
into what's what to give us an answer
why logical program is great I know one
example of very widely used logical
program and that is the bytecode
verifier in the JVM I think it's still
written in Prolog so if you if you want
to get accustomed with that you can look
into that this literally a specification
of how the bytecode verifier should look
and it's the big chunk of troller code
because that's the easiest way to
specify constraints but other than that
it's a kind of news thing based on the
patterns on in the records you can have
filters if anything about databases
typically what you think about is in SQL
right it works the same way it's DSL to
access data store it in database so
corresponding to the Select will be the
search operation corresponding to the
word law
we'll be ability to filter attributes
you can filter them directly in the
record so just using the record
description syntax you can filter them
out of the record or you can use also
the dot notation to access the
attributes and perform filtering on that
just wearing the data typically is not
enough so sometimes you need a more
complicated ways to describe your data
Eve supports the conditional equivalence
so you can have the if-else blocks when
you specify the code and you can provide
the parameters or transform them on the
fly while you're searching Eve also
helps functions and functions a very
interesting thing so it's not the
function in a typical Java ways where
you specify method and it can do
anything all functions have the same
signature two types of signature they
take a set of records and they return
the set of records and the functions
operate on that set of records element
wise so they take all the records and
said that wear pattern match and they
implement say a map operation from the
stream API so you operate on every
record one by one and then you return
the output set or you can have the
aggregate and aggregate just collapsed
the set of operates at the set of
records into a single value and that
would be corresponding to the fault or
reduce in the functional programming so
with those two you get fairly complex
tools that are easy to use given the
standard syntax and primitive operations
not creative trivial to understand
operations of search and binding and
then you can do complex manipulation the
standard library the standard library is
not very large but it gives you the
essential tools to create web
applications so they have the aggregates
they have the math syntax strings you
can have the HTML library for it's a
low-level interface to create HTML
elements because we will be focused on
focusing on Web Apps because that's how
we develop software now you have the UI
library which
the syntactical sugar or HTML so you
have a much easier time specifying
elements like UI buttons and cones and
everything but you also have access to
files you have access to system which
typically will provide either randomness
or the time this the system parameter
here is essential because what you want
to do you want your system to react to
time passing and to do that you need to
declare a database and you need to
search on the time and that will be
fright it from the system library or you
can just output stuff to the console but
with access in the file system what you
can do you can build everything right
when you have the operating system
support for reading and writing files
you can build all kinds of complex
programs Eve comes currently until it's
it's a it's run time currently it's 0.3
release and it's written in JavaScript
surprisingly enough currently they're
working on 0.4 where they will rewrite
quite a bit of that in rust for
performance reasons but they're working
it so and you can run that in headless
mode so if you would like to write a
simple program with if and serve it from
somewhere you're totally fine to do that
you just need note and run the
JavaScript and you will have an or you
can just go and write small programs in
an online sandbox besides the standard
library you can modify the data directly
so if you have a record you can commit a
different type of record where you will
changes things you can add attributes to
the set of favorite foods with plus
equals so we do not increment that by
pizza but you append that you can remove
elements or you can fill merge two
records into our complex record after
that this is everything you can divert
the records and the only other thing
that if knows how to handle is the
database and this is this is one of the
most important things in EVE anything
can be a database if you don't specify a
date
you will he will operate on the local
namespace of the records that you just
emitted think about that as a global
variable store but he can have any kinds
of Records you can search from one
database and bind values into different
database this is how you would take
information from one day to the actual
relational data store and word that to
the client stuff like that
if platform provides you with a number
with a number of implementations for
databases and you can do pretty
interesting things so why I'm talking to
you this is just to give a glimpse of
what if consists off and now I'm gonna
go and show you a couple of programs and
Eve and you'll get a taste of that and
then we'll talk about the good parts of
that what people can do using Eve and
should they be should they be I'm not
advocating for you for using Eve but I'm
advocating probably for thinking about
how interesting Eve is excellent you can
see my screen I'm not sure the
resolution is what it's supposed to be
but it looks okay no might be not what
about this
yeah this is fine excellent so this is
what an ID looks like you have the a
table of contents you have a single file
which is a program it's a little program
which is a great because you can merge
the specification or your intention what
you want to do and the actual code looks
and you can see that the read the code
looks right in there where you would
specify the code let's remove the table
of contents
the good thing about this is that you
merge your intent for writing program
and the program together if you ever saw
an outdated Javadoc file not Java Docs
file Java the comment on the method this
is how he would probably eliminate that
problem it's very hard to change the
code without changing text about it when
it's like just continuous block of code
and you can see that the blocks of code
can get fairly complicated but he
recognized the same structure that you
have so in this example for example we
switch the browser and the session to
the menu and if we find that you can see
the message click here to begin this
example is a flappy bird game and it's
actually works and it's all written Eve
and it renders the HTML right here a
cool thing about that is that they have
the program is just the declarative
blocks of code what makes it work is
that the platform takes the data takes
the real world and pushes that through
your program just like you do in the
reactive programming programs you
specify the code and you don't specify
how to manipulate the data but you just
specified that I would like to do this
this and that and some system takes care
of providing data and passing forward to
the next chunk of code this does the
same the benefit the direct benefit of
that is that platform has immense
visibility into your code and what it
does so they have the thing called magic
debugger and it's enabled but click on
the button and it gives you tools to
access and debug your program at the
unbelievable layer level so
click on the button if I click on an
element that is rendered first of all it
Scrolls down into the V the code block
that actually renders that it knows what
renders to any element because well
that's the system handling the
declarative code you can see the
attributes so it's very easy to debug
you can find events to which this object
will react but most importantly wait a
second come back you can say how you can
say why is this it drone why this is not
drawing and everything to show you that
it's actually this program let me just
change it on the fly I'll take my
Twitter image I will replace that and
when I could play you can see that it
changed and it's still working so this
is the next one feet but this shows that
this actual program works in that
another cool thing is if you click with
the magic debugger on any block of code
you can see that it can tell you why
this code block was not executed or
failed or how much time did it take any
general performance sense so you see the
data of how much time the system was
actually dealing with this particular
chunk of code again this is only
possible because the system handles the
data transfer between blocks of code for
you
why is it cool because it's kind of very
easy to adapt the systems because it has
this very tight coupling between the
source code and the actual execution of
the program this is what they probably
wanted to do with the ID when they
started that but unless you control the
system and the platform you cannot have
a very tight connection but it will be
very cool to have that so you can play
with if I just like on on the website
and they have multiple examples of what
to do including I think one of my
favorite is the typical 2d MVC thing
quite working and you can see that it's
just what sixty lines of actual code so
you can play with that only free time if
you get inspired I don't think you
actually should do that but you totally
can do that if you
if you want to so let's go and talk
about how this is relevant to Java
developers and what trade-offs do they
have when they decided the system so the
good parts you have code and comments in
the same place so you will intuitively
change the specification first it allows
all the parts of this team work at the
same code base in the same way another
poor very positive thing is it reuse
world as the data
so did your data model and your
abstractions are quite simple
what do you want to do you still
whatever you want to do you still use
the same syntax so it's very easy to
comprehend at the same time you can have
complex interactions like sending an
email or slack message or changing the
HTML in a very intuitive way I think
there are like nine operations in total
that Eve supports compared to how much
Java offers you and how many ways to
shoot yourself in the foot using any
lower level language this is pretty
sophisticated the reactive blocks of
code are an amazing way to specify and
declare what program needs to do it
literally you say when I see the pattern
let me execute those things and if will
take care of that and that is very sweet
the transparency and effortless virtual
visualization of what is happening
inside gives you very nice tools for
development you can also have the
monitoring or memory monitoring or
performs monitoring right in there and
the top of that you have this magical
debugger which can help you develop
programs very easily
I for one would I wouldn't miss that in
Java but now I know that it exists
sometimes you have be very handy just by
clicking somewhere in saying that oh
bring me to code that renders this or
doesn't render thing so those are very
good parts but the biggest benefit of
Eve is that they have this single
philosophy that the code is not an asset
is a liability
the more code you have the hardest
change and the more code you have the
more you would be likely to dig into
different abstractions and ruin things
for other developers to come who will
not maybe that well versed in the
abstractions that you're using so job
security is fine but it obfuscates the
code just like a graph QL if pretends
everything is a database but what if is
great ahead is that any system that you
write it separates the querying because
you have the search operation it suffers
declaring of the operations from
persistent operations and this is
something that currently is getting much
more popular so you would like to have
the command Cori responsibility
segregation in any of your apps you
would like to have different ways of how
you query the data and different model
for that and different data model for
writing operations and you would like
the data propagate between those two
easily it's a great system it's really
kind of not that easy to implement in
normal Java where other languages but if
takes that and does that with with ease
because they control the full platform
and also if you think of a one block of
code they can do just several things
they can hold some local state and they
can modify the local state they can
react to things in the in the
environment and they can also send
messages or say that oh you next block
of code please update yourself so it's
very similar to the actor model of
writing applications and if with every
single through stateless API headers so
he read the data from the buffer
manipulate stuff and then write the
response but buffer so it's a powerful
concept and you see that how those
things kind of mirror themselves in Eve
so it is an experiment but it's a very
interesting experiment so the single
vision allows Eve to have declarative
programming to have database data like
keys and triggers dependency tracking
debugging watch
expressions the reloading of the code
the serializable state performance
profiling and the distributed data and
computation all in one package so those
are very good things and if we would be
able to have those in in in a typical
Java program that would be immense
unfortunately obviously we cannot have
all that in the Java program because
first the platform wasn't designed this
way but we can look at several tools or
approaches or advices about how you can
build and structure your java
applications do you kind of maybe get a
little bit closer to the tooling and the
excellence that if or freeze you when I
say excellence it just I mean it seems
great I'm not really sure how to write a
large program if it does not have
lexical scoping so you just have
individual blocks of code that have
local state and then there is a global
default database I'm not sure that it's
very common a pleasant way to write
large programs but tooling seems really
nice so let's talk about Java now we
still have time left so first of all
when I talk about the database we have
the relational databases or a seed
databases and it's kind of cool but we
also what we have we have local state
that sits in in the JVM heap and it
would be very cool if we could use that
heap and pretend that it's a database if
we would have atomic access to that to
that memory sports when you talk about
atomic access to that memory the
software it's an actual memory comes to
mind the software it's real actual
memory is the paradigm of how to
organize concurrent computations
typically and there are several examples
of an implementation of STM on Java so
typically a good use case for the STM
will be if a memory each chunk of memory
that you want to modify if it has
frequent reads but very infrequent
writes without any collisions then you
can think of a software international
memory and you probably see the benefit
in performance or not so the the most
trivial example of the so transaction
memory would be a caste operation when
you compare and swap data in a single
in the single reference and you can do
that either using the java.util
concurrent package the Atomics or you
can bring the library if we look at the
akka astrium it offers you in number of
classes it doesn't transform the whole
heap of Java program into the software
into actual heap but it it can isolate
some objects and said that now those
objects will hold data that is access to
which is transactional so the smallest
example is an atomic ref which can hold
an object and you can atomically set the
values for that or swap it with a
different one and you do that using a
inner class atomic or you can specify a
lambda with a single with a single value
it you cannot do much but if you have a
map which supports an atomic access then
you can do many things as you know if
you have a map and you have you can have
a nested structure you can represent
almost anything at least javascript
managers to represent anything with just
maps and if you execute a code like that
and you execute this atomic operation
the software it's actual memory package
will will make sure that anyone who
observes the map outside of this and
reads that will either see all three
operations written all together or none
of them will will succeed so we get the
atomicity and that is a fairly cool
concept so next time you want to write
concurrent code you might consider that
or just go with an actor/model the hot
reloading of the code java comes with
hot swap there are also different tools
available for reloading code on the fly
one of them called general is by Z
written around
so with this exactly what it does you
change your Java program it reflects the
changes in the running JVM process so if
you want to know more about that come to
the booth we can talk to you later I
won't spend time here the thing that I
talked a little bit about you probably
feel built a large system you would like
to implement the command for
responsibility separation so you want to
separate models for you the reads of
your data and the rights of data and
they would typically do that with an
event handler that reacts to the rights
for the reads if you think about seeker
s you should definitely look at Kafka
and the Kafka streams which is the API
for processing those events definitely
there are great talks or blog posts or
documentation about how to do that if
you are ready to change the infrared the
infrastructure in the architecture of a
system take a look at that if you're not
ready to change the infrastructure of
your system because that's a very
significant change that takes money and
time at least consider doing a very
simple thing you read you might you
manipulate data in two different ways
you read the data and that could be
complex queries and you write the data
and that is typically quite a simple
operation so if re-architect in the
system is hard consider just using
different approaches for how you read
and write data if you use JPA or
hibernate it is excellent at saving data
right you just have your data your
object model and you just say save and
it becomes a database but querying as
the special complex wearing is kind of
hard to implement in hibernate so what
you can do you can easily specify those
complex queries in SQL directly you
don't need to use a library for
everything that is offers to and you can
use either plain SQL or maybe a library
like duke which prov offers you but
typesafe DSL for special SQL queries
maybe your code will be easier now the
declarative approach for writing code
kind of gets more and more popular so
you can take a look at the reactive
streams and the extension for that what
it means that you will be able to
specify pieces of code that will
subscribe to each other and subscribe to
data coming from the other chunks of
code just like with the reactive blocks
of code in Eve and you can have the API
supporting that the operations to
manipulate the data you have normal
software that will have an use
taking that approach so a spring five
comes with a functional web framework
that features reactive a reactive
paradigm and where you can write your
normal web application code in fully
reactive way there are many
implementations
if you having a client-side then there
is a live javascript library called mob
x which reacts to the changes in the
state and and it derives anything that
can be derived automatically from the
state if you use react then react reacts
to the state changes and modifies the
Dom the HTML of your pages and mob acts
can populate and react this changes in
the data and together they can work
pretty neatly if you use IntelliJ IDEA
and personally I think it's great idea
so but whatever use IntelliJ IDEA comes
with a good thing called stream debugger
which is a tool that offers the
visibility into what what's happening in
your code if you use the stream API in
your java code it's kind of hard to
debug that typically because well you
never know
and it's when the data flows in a big
volume it's hard to traverse whatever
element transforms into and if they pass
feel first or at which state they
disappear so the stream debugger in
IntelliJ IDEA after you execute stuff in
a debug mode it can show you a
visualization of what has happened in
during that stream processing phase so
the current data of the stream is
evaluated and you can see that the
initial values were those and then the
operation was applied and you can see
into which values they were transformed
and you can follow that and it's a much
easier way to debug string processing
because here you have the whole picture
single glance and this is quite quite
easy you can also specify individual
steps or individual data and you can see
the results of of those in a split mount
so that's a thing that I've they release
that very recently a couple of months
ago maybe half year
time flies and I've I know that not that
many developers yet know about that but
mostly people converted to using Java 8
and obviously we all started using
streams where we shoot and where we
shouldn't and this is a nice tool that
can help us figure out why it's actually
happening
another thing that gives you visibility
into into what's having the work in your
program could be an advanced debugger so
cronin is a tribe trout trine 3
time-traveling debugger which it does
you execute the program and it saves
what has happened throughout the program
what values were written and read from
the heap and what were the variables at
every moment of time and then it can
allows you to replay that if you are
curious about how it does that without
actually sacrificing all the pro phones
what it does it doesn't transform the
whole java application but it allows you
to specify several classes which you
want the instrument and then when it
records data about that class those
classes it gives you abilities to travel
through time for that and see how the
value is changed which is very very good
ability to have especially when you're
trying to chase a hard to reproduce book
and the top of that inside the code when
you are reproducing the session what it
can do it can allows you to add logging
statements to for the variables so not
only get this binary execution profile
but you also get like a text if you want
to do that of what has happened to your
variables and then you work better and
saying what was in your system and then
it's easier to debug if you think about
performance and the visibility into poor
phones the state-of-the-art approach I
think T performance monitoring and read
I understand what has to happen with
performance would be the Java Mission
Control well together with flight
recorder so what it is Java Mission
Control is a it's a mmm I think to
monitor the state of the JVM
I think works for Oracle JVMs I'm not
sure if they actually works for other
and the flight recorder is an on demand
a turn on feature that can include the
data about the execution profile about
the garbage collection statistics about
the optimizations in digit a heap about
latency of certain events which logs use
which IO do you use so it requires a
number of things using low-level probe
so it's fairly efficiently you can use
that introduction I think in production
it requires license in development it
should be free to use so the biggest
benefit of that it doesn't you don't
have to write all the data data to a
disk so it doesn't have to come with a
large overhead but you can just spin
that data in memory and do not write any
data until an incident happens when you
feel that performance gets low or you
get any monitoring alerts you can flush
the buffer into a file and then you can
restore that and analyze that data
offline as you would do with the normal
profiler so you would see the view where
you have the hottest methods or were how
much memory anything tip and what was
happening with your garbage collection
so it's a fairly interesting tool to use
in production or just to analyze what
happens inside your apps if you
interested another tool by the returned
called extra ball and what it does it
visualizes the performance of your
application while you develop that it
injects a view into you into your code
and then it shows you a full call stack
of what has happened in the background
and shows you the bottlenecks and
everything so you can care about
performance while you're developing your
application about that you can learn
more as well at the booth although there
are a number of tools and what I wanted
to say with this session besides trying
to introduce you to Eve as a platform
and tell you that such a thing exists
and maybe make you jealous about how
amazing the future software developers
will have it I wanted you to
at the current state of Jawa software
development and thinking about that
there could be tools when you find the
problem that he don't know how to solve
easily think about that maybe there are
tools or maybe there are different
approaches that could help you and and I
hope this was an insightful session and
you learned maybe at least something
about the tools or something about if
with all that we have three minutes for
the questions I'm not sure if the timer
is still going but we have three minutes
for the questions and if anything you
can always find me online and then we'll
be happy to chat with you thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
