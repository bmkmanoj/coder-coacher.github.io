welcome to the lesser session on the
under flexure normal section I think we
have one closing session after us but
this is in the last session and we're
our targets on virtual reality and also
some stuff on how you can program for
virtual reality in also the relation to
to Java Alex and myself were having a
discussion about a year ago and showing
some some cool stuff with virtual
reality and and I asked him here how do
you do that and you showed me some unity
program and saying okay that's nice but
can we do something in Java so we
challenge each other and this is
basically the journey that we took at
the part of a year and this is our
findings and some some some findings are
are promising and some are less
promising and we like to take you to our
journey during this during this talk so
we're going to do that to the following
agenda we're going to introduce yourself
very briefly and then we're going to
discuss a bit on what virtual reality is
and briefly on some historical facts of
virtual reality and the basics but
that's just to get up to speed and then
we can talk about virtual reality and
the relation to Java and how you can
work with Java and virtual reality and
then we can do a comparison of a simple
game that we made in four different ways
and we're going to show you what our
findings are in what is the most
productive and most efficient way to
develop such a game so short
introduction Alex yes hi my name is Alex
on the hot sauce areas you can lose the
last part and I kind of long at three
hubs one of them is bouldering another
one is been surfing and actually I'm a
pretty vivid gamer myself select the
game a lot as a couple of treatments
that is : what you want under my belts
I'm a master in game studies I was I'm a
software engineer at CGI in the
Netherlands and I'm a yeah a Java one
rockstar from 2016 yeah yeah that's me
there
like to workout like to run a lot and
like to develop like to code and notice
the picture describes but I have a
master a Bachelor in food science so I
like to talk about food my achievement
matches what you call Bachelor food
science two-time finisher of American
that's actually thing that I'm very
proud of and a software engineer at Jeju
isn't so a virtual reality yeah start
with a question whoever experience
whoever at a virtual reality experience
either a cardboard or a headset okay may
let a rephrase who didn't okay that's
the better yeah so yes yeah and who has
had an experience with the oculus rift
and the HTC vibes and all that kind of
stuff so anything but the cardboard okay
so mostly I think concluding that would
be the cardboard and but yeah we did
this talk a few months ago and yeah the
responses were different virtual reality
we taking off and a lot of persons
people have had to experience the last
few months or not so long ago so virtual
reality what is virtual reality or you
can look it up on the internet you have
a nice definition of it on it
it's a computer-generated simulation you
can interact with it seemingly real and
you can use equipment to interact with
with the world and you have the feeling
that you're in it but what actually is
meant by these words is that it's
absolutely awesome so that that's more
the definition that we're looking for
yeah so I think it's appropriate to give
a little bit of history on virtual
reality can someone take a guess
when virtual reality really started
anyone a year the 70s no no no back back
back way back way way back
in 1838 the first-tier says their scope
viewers were made and you know the
things yes item earlier you know you
have disliked pictures with two sides
and you put them in a viewer and they
look like they're really immersive and
in front of the eyes on living stuff so
pretty much pretty early then we go 100
years in the future and then the pretty
much the first flight simulator was born
and and people the pilots had to really
step in top it really thing and what's
immersive and icon and a really cheap
computer but back then probably not so
cheap that all showed all kind of stuff
and skies and etcetera etcetera in the
1950s the sense Rama was released some
of you might have heard of this it's
special virtual reality topics it's it
has been discussed a lot as one of the
first real immersive machines that
really brought which reality up to speed
back then in 1968 the sort of demo class
was released that was like the prototype
of the hololens do you guys know the max
of talents so what the thing that it was
huge it needed like two trucks to
completely move the whole the whole
machine but it actually shows primitives
cubes and triangles in front of the eyes
of the user pretty much what the
Holland's can do nowadays and what
argument augmented reality does in 90-87
the which the term virtual reality was
born there was a company that was was
pushing all kind of projects and
consumer well a product's based on
virtual reality like glass to play games
and all kind of stuff
in 1995 didn't intend Oh Virtual Boy was
released anybody that had one of these
at home
yeah will be surprised if anybody
anybody did has because it was one
probably the biggest commercial failure
of Nintendo but now it's worth a lot of
money now it's worth a lot of money
because there's only like sixty thousand
bills present so
but yeah kind of commercial failure then
we'd go into 2012 where the outputs
kicker kickstarter happened huge success
of course and in 2016 the first really
consumer based head mounted displays HP
survives illustrates at Aerojet o
released and even all kind of other
apparitions that really help you immerse
yourself in a virtual world like the
omni treadmill where you can walk around
the blade gun strike like a real soldier
if you ever wanted to yeah and why
virtual reality is hot let's have some
numbers we have 243 up to 43 million
users all around world and rising six
hundred and fifty thousand units head
mounted display tercer our show the
oculus fight give your name them and
with the cardboard side your 15 million
cardboard apps are downloaded and last
year was a huge explosion in the amount
of apps for virtual reality and also the
download so of it so it really taken off
anybody here know what the most popular
cardboard app is anyone want to guess
virtual reality cardboard app sorry yeah
no the oh c'mon no no no it's a chair in
a room it's a kind of immersive game a
game yet game it's an adventure where
you go on a really dark in a really dark
room with one chair and then you hear
sounds and the chair moves and you don't
see anything and it's kind of a scary
game and it's the most popular game that
was by far our most downloaded on the
Google App Store so if you have a
cardboard night spree here starts now so
it's free so we did try give it a try
why
it's getting more and more common of
course but it's new it's a new new
technology everybody has a new feeling
and a new experience with it it works
and you actually know that you are
flying you you feel the wind through
your hair
everything reacts in the same way you
feel free you fly like a bird and it's
immersive it's fun you actually want to
take that final step and dive into the
pool but you're not in the pool so the
it's really really taken off so and most
of that because the edge players really
live up to the experience that you
expect it's getting so much better and
it's even getting better day by day yeah
so when we start this little thing we
look at like other of the hardware that
works available and we try to try to
further pretty much everything let's see
what was best to use and what not so
this is our little star rating we're
putting ourselves so it's our own
opinion so by no means necessarily the
truth but close to it but yeah so you
have this that you have two HTC vive
it's made by hate to see but the
software is made by valve the which also
makes steam a huge game platform and you
can really see the influence evolve
because it's completely integrating
streaming with a lot of games and etc
and the most cool thing about the HTC
vive is out of the box it tracks your
movements actually your steps so if you
walk around it completely tracks you
around in the digital world so you can
really walk around with a headset on
that's or if the the first version
didn't have that nowadays you can also
do that with an oculus rift but
performance vice the HTC vive is a bit
better than the oculus rift when you
think about virtual reality you actually
want to aim at 90 frames per second I
want to say frames per second FPS does
anybody here have like something like
I've no idea what it's talking about
okay that's good that's easy which makes
it easier for us
so yeah you probably really ain't 90s
and the HTC vive most attend I can't do
that and the at least riff sample
sometimes struggles and the PlayStation
VR which is the latest of the three
actually almost never reaches that
ninety FPS threshold so that's where a
lot of people also get a feeling of
nausea when they use the PlayStation VR
motion sickness motion sickness
executive you
I finally with the gear VR tanned the
cardboards probably the most accessible
devices because they are very very cheap
you can make a cardboard yourself with
like three dollars or pounds or euros or
whatever very accessible and you have
the Google Play Store and very easy to
download all kinds of apps yeah also
looking at the common users here Alex
already mentioned for the visor huge
gaming backgrounds use gaming community
yeah that's one of the the communities
simulation is the other one healthcare
and 360 if you look at the games and
you've got like the chair in the room of
course what I deserve but it is this is
another scare rule scary game people
really dive into the game and actually
are genuinely frightened and yes things
that you can build you can create your
own world around you and this is how it
how it's built it's a HTT 5 game and
also no actually I think you can create
a world and you can make it work and
make a work for you and experiment a lot
with things and you have also other fun
games like audio shoot where you work
out and listen music at the same time
and hit the notes with with your heads
and move around
it is really fun and maybe also
simulation in simulation or you already
think racing etc but you also have
really nice emulators like Godzilla
simulator that you can actually know
what the feeling is - yeah crash crash
your city so that it's something that
you is really useful real life
yeah the traditional ones are a
simulating
now Formula One and moxtra stuff I
didn't get that good because he just
regarded he also did a lot of
resurrecting the light is now in the
tracks so that's real good but also in
emergency situations how do you react
taking people onto virtual experience in
an emergency situation makes them react
more naturally and when it actually
happens so that that's really yeah good
good good good practice healthcare it's
really hard to get people out and
workouts but if you make the experience
more fun then people are tend to go out
more and work out more so that that's
good but not only that doctors and
medical researchers researchers can can
use 3d modeling in the virtual reality
to make much more accurate Diagnostics
so the they can find diseases more
easily or operate more accurate and
exposure therapy and this is someone
who's afraid of heights has a lot of
problem with Heights and they just lay a
plank in a room so the situation is
totally safe but the situation is
actually not so safe and yeah they get
actually exposed to to their height
affair and researches show that it is
much more efficient than the normal
therapy so it's real good
usage then exit evolving on a plank yeah
absolutely as also lower death rates but
360 of course you can experience your
concert a theater you can be minimal of
concerts and that that's absolutely
great but after a day of hard work you
want to relax into a desert area where
there's no sounds where you can look
around to breathe through your hair so
now that that that's nice to totally
relax but sports that's the most
catching thing that I see over here and
I would have paid a lot of money for
yesterday evening to be to be to
experience the last three minutes of
Lian iyx in kershel way so that would
have been great we are in alcoholics so
we are where we should be I think your
average Realty in Java now it's very
interesting if you guys think about
virtual reality in Java do you then does
a platform pop up which this is well
nature to it or you can go to virtual
reality in Java Android you know Android
is indeed the one of the things we're
going to discuss probably the biggest
thing going to discuss but there is a
second thing but which would not gonna
really discuss but we're mentioning for
completeness it's Jane monkey engine
does anybody know Jane monkey engine
yeah so like like the ninety percent of
the rest of the rule so it's a game
engine written in Java and you can code
for it in code games with it in Java but
the community is very small updates are
very scarce and compared to other game
engines out there like unity unreal cry
engine etc etc its vast interior so we
looked at as we looked into it a little
bit but we didn't really necessarily it
was even a contender to creating virtual
reality applications so for it but next
that we have Android smartphones indeed
with the whole carpet thing and the
Galaxy gear thing it's probably a very
interesting platform to look into on how
to create virtual reality apps on with
Android native
then you click it away thank you very
much sorry
so Android native what do you need to
thank you but do you need to build for
Android native actually you need Android
studio or IntelliJ it doesn't really
matter you can also use Eclipse or one
of your own ideas but anyway studio
really makes it very easy because it
comes packaged with an Android that's
the gain and pretty much everything you
need for Android
it also comes packaged with Gradle I
know some developers are in really
really fond of Gradle but you can also
use me with maven and next to that we
also need the cardboard SDK so which is
freely available from the Google
developer site so no big hurdles here
and it has a couple cut pros and a
couple of counts well the biggest Pro of
course is your coding in Java right so
we'd love to do and that's what you can
do
performance-wise it's a it's a really
nice addition because well you go in
OpenGL and OpenGL is really fast but
there are some struggles with that and
the community is really big so there are
a lot of people working on this over the
of the whole world and start Stack
Overflow for example is filled with
people asking questions about how do i
code a VR in Android the cons you can
only use some smart phones of course and
you're limited by the platform you know
so what an Android device can do that's
pretty much everything you can do and
you have to use OpenGL for 3d
manipulation and all that kind of stuff
which can we get can get really
irritating but we'll get to that once
we're structuring the code so it's
trying to work with sorry but yeah and
the problem let's put it in again
so what we're going to do now is we're
going to show you a little demo you have
to show the screen here what yes it
should come each there we go
the phone screen and you have to stop
the presentation so we have actually
five demos for you today
one is a 360 video and image demo and
another one is there we go and the other
four are the same virtual reality
application so there we go so this is a
simple photo demo I'm just selecting
folks from a gallery and above one well
I don't know if you guys recognize this
guy anybody ages means yeah so this is
this is an ordinary picture which is
kind of rendering a 3d 360 way no really
fun so if you really take a 360 picture
you can imagine this looks pretty pretty
nice and then you have the the only one
it's a video which now just turn just
finished of course so what we're doing
but so like this can very easy just add
360 a 360 view in your applications or
360 360 video view yep translation yeah
things you need to show the code yes
absolutely I think you guys want to see
the code
yes so first of all a lecture churches
360 degree images and you need to define
a layout XML for that in Android
it has anybody worked in Android
actually yeah so you in Android you work
with use and you have to define what's
in the view and that become that's in a
layout XML yeah yes it is very
occasional it's a VR panoramic view and
then you need to give it an ID and some
some properties then with analyte data
to what you what you do with it and next
next to that you define a vir panoramic
loop which is in the following pop
package and you bind it to to the to the
layout XML is that you have the ID over
here so find few by ID so you bind to
that view and you do the same over here
you have some options where you have the
panel options which is most important is
type stereo over/under which actually
means is its picture taken by 360 camera
which is the top and bottom which is a
bit more different or is it is it a
normal picture that you need to render
in 360 and then you load that one it can
either be in your package or you can
load it from an external source video
system that very isn't a difference you
have to layout XML again a few
definition and you have an again you
have the ID and set some properties not
that very sophisticated and you bind
that in a VR video view it can be found
in the following package again the idea
is here the binding factor over here so
it finds it by the ID and again same
here the option stereo over/under 360
video you need to use it and then you
can load the video from the assets and
can either be a local package 12 or you
can refer
refer to something that's on the
internet or something like that and then
you play it and that's basically how you
do the 360 videos and the 316 pictures
it's it's very simple Salem within
couple lines calculus but now we're
going to the demo that we created for
four platforms yes so when when I was
thinking about what kind demo to make as
a pretty much someone in and with the
games background that was like
immediately it has to have explosions or
some something with explosions
so uhm we create a simple application
you can walk around there's a cube
floating around and being rotated this
explosion so what you can do is when the
viterbo press a trigger and the car and
the galaxy gear also has a thing that
you can tap on the side and that we use
that as an input to shoot a laser and if
you aim at the other box and you did you
hear explosion sound they gave the box
and that you've actually come and it's
response and then you can do it again
and again and again and again and again
there we go so it's a very simple demo
on but it kind of shows how which
reality looks based with your Android
native code
Oh
yes so how do you actually build what
you just saw very interesting for me it
has anybody worked with unity before do
you guys do you know what unity 3ds the
game engine so it's a very very advanced
game engine which I have done a lot of
work with I then had to step back from
that advanced game engine to Android
native and OpenGL so it was really fun
fun to do so if when you when you start
with a draw Android 3d VR your layout
XML looks actually this is pretty much
everything you have in your XML file yes
a GVR view and you'd pretty much say my
whole screen is a DVR view and that's
everything I want in here and then you
need a class that extends from the GVR
activity and implements the spell
renderer interface in android activities
are pretty much the entry points of you
have a main activity and the center
point of your application and here what
you actually saves my main activity the
entry point of my application is a DVR
and Virtual Reality activity which I
want to use and with that to get some
standard stock methods which you use to
implement your virtual reality stuff on
create well exactly what what you would
think it does this is called once when
the application is created when the
activity is created and here you can do
all kind you want to do on
initialization for example here we set
the count of view for to be a virtual
reality based and we set the GBR view to
have a DVR object so pretty simple on
servers created I don't know if there
are fans of OpenGL here or Vivid users
of OpenGL here or anything that would
have expected so but up GL
for example first it has to create all
these surfaces always 3d data and all
the can stuff and once that is done this
is called so anything you want to happen
when OpenGL is ready to be used
it's putting the on surface created
method and sort of furthermore you have
the only frame method this is probably
the most important method from
everything because this is called
everything before everything is done in
render so for example the if you want a
lot of framerate if you want to know
what your FPS is you have to put it on
the new frame a method in here for
example what we do is we get the head
transform that's for the rotation of
your head very important in virtual
reality of course to track the head of
the user and we actually set the camera
to follow the head and actually change
based on the rotation the pitch and the
year as goals in Virtual Reality terms
of the head and then we do some other
transformations and knobs and stuff on
draw I actually saw you have two eyes
when once you put the phone in the car
but we don't really necessarily see that
that well that they are two eyes because
of the lenses but you have two eyes and
this function is called ever before is
before is drawn is ready to be drawn so
it's not necessarily the same as on your
frame every frame because it it's not a
frame rain dependent so stuff that has
to happen on the rendering of the eye is
happening here which isn't essentially a
lot this is pretty much all so
everything asks I have put in that
method myself and eventually you have a
car Bo trigger and that's exactly what
you would think when the curvature gets
pulled we shoot a laser and we vibrate
we were great the phone and it's pretty
much it and when you go on drawing in 3d
you work with OpenGL and the Android
native of gl-class is called
20 it's pure hell to work with it I can
put it anything in other any other words
I've almost sat in the corner crying
because I had to make this this work I
can really tell you exactly out words
and what you need to do but I thinking I
would need another two or three hours to
explain everything thoroughly so what
you need to know is you have your vertex
data and that's a position in a 3d space
it's a vector of three coordinates so to
say so of chording on the x axis on the
y axis and the z axis and then opengl
knows when it means where it needs to
place an object in its 3d world
including environment you need color
data with a gba data this should be
pretty self-explanatory right and you
have normal data which actually defines
the face of an 3d object so from which
side should this object be visible and
that's mainly used for lightning for
lighting calculations so shadows and
darkness and all that kind of stuff and
when you want to move through the
objects you use matrix everything works
with matrix calculations if anybody did
some higher degree math over here then
he would have done something with
matrixes I would imagine and I'm not
talking about the movie here by the way
so everything works in matrixes so every
model everything of your 3d world is
actually and flows array of sixteen
numbers for example the laser is a array
and what I do is I set its identity
matrix to be zero pretty much and then I
wrote you can rotate the matrix based on
the pitch your head up and down or your
your head left and right on certain axis
this is the z axis saw rotated from the
set axis by the pitch and this I rotate
on the I axis by the yo and then I can
actually place the laser exactly in
front of the of the camera so
when I look here the laser actually gets
spawned here but when I look there the
laser actually gets ponder so that's
exactly what this piece of code does
and then on every frame I translate the
metric the matrix of the laser by 0.5
steps so it actually moves forward
that's pretty much what's happening here
and if you want to do some very basics
and I mean very very basic object
collision which is necessary to well
make explosions happen you have you need
to grab the model cube 14 number that's
the Z position and check it with lasers
each position with have certain offsets
and then you know well it's if it's
within those bounds then it's almost
there and we do the same on the eye
position and then you know that the
cubes the laser is probably around the
same position as the cube and then you
have a collision and then you can
actually spawn a sound which happens
using the GVR audio engine and this is
probably the easiest thing you can do
that you have to do in which reality in
java you just need to create an gvrl be
engine objects with a nice high-quality
preload the sounds in a peripheral being
of other threats otherwise the main
threat has to wait until the thousandth
is loaded you don't want that and create
the sounds object and eventually play
the sound oh you can and you can also
set the sound object position to have a
nice 3d sound effect and other kind of
stuff like your stereo stereo sound
because I hate it either the 3d so much
I decided that I need to I needed to use
something else another framework and
that was Rajawali which can be found
here and we have an Ender SDK and the
red diwali and an android studio and
actually how this works is we have a
layout XML and which looks exactly the
same as the cardboard by the way and
furthermore we get into
the codes real codes we have a VR
activity and which coming fasten the
project originally up there and again
the oncreate but the big difference here
is that you don't actually start
spawning stuff here and start doing
stuff here but you create a Reggie
Valley example renderer and you know and
you set the renderer in without using
that function that's method and
furthermore that's everything the main
activity has to do when you if you use
Reggie Valley it's very important and
furthermore again you have a cardboard
trigger which you can use to spawn a
bullet or laser something like that the
VR renderer which which I just show
which is just shown it has a method
called init scene and this is called
every time a scene is initialized and
destruction allows the user to have
multiple scenes within the main activity
which is very important if you want to
do as switching between scenes reaching
between worlds all the kind of stuff
Reggie Valley allows you to do that it's
very very interesting
and what I do here is for example
creative directional light in the world
adelies set the farplane so the camera
actually doesn't render anything four
thousand thousand units and a certain
background color and that's pretty much
is the own render function with Rajawali
is the same as an only frame function of
the google native SDK carpetas the case
so this is actually called every frame
for example here with Rajiv Ali I'm
looking every frame if I'm looking at
the cube I'm checking if I'm looking at
the cube movie spawning and using 3d
objects this is probably the biggest
plus point of Reggie Valley compared to
the Google cardboard VR is that you can
use primitives so instead of having to
define everything as a matrix and float
matrix myself I can just create a new
sphere with a certain radius assigning
the material set the material set
our set Association sets its rotation
and then just add it in the scene and
you have a bullet you have a sphere in
your scene it's as easy as that and then
if you want to move it instead of having
to translate its matrix all you need to
you can just call a function they may
move forward with a certain step and you
and your booth goes forward and finally
audio is exactly the same as you know
the Google cardboard SDK so nothing I
knew there yes did you want to share the
demo all right you rolling yes maybe
that's a good idea
should I show you how this how it looks
yeah let me stop the presentation let's
go in here yes
so the thing with with Raja Valley is
that it does make things very very easy
and out of the box but you as you can
see it is a yes it is inverted when with
a reason because if a change and turn it
around all the coordinates in the world
actually get kind of screwed up for
example the the bullets are complete
inverse so they actually spawning behind
you now and I looked around in a search
around and it looks like it's really
about within the rarity value framework
so what I would advise is use the Google
cardboard native VR implementations and
combine it with a ratchet volley
primitive stuff to create an easy way to
implement virtual reality in Android
yeah
going back to the presentation no yeah
yeah I could call them way back in the
presentation yeah you sir okay
this was a rendered part so okay and
yeah we we showed how to do the for Java
and we're using an order Rajawali there
also some other ways to do it would like
to show it now the first one is where PR
and where PR is an open standard and
makes it possible for you to have an
experience if we are in the browser the
goal is to make it easier for everyone
to have a VR experience and it has been
around since 2014 and hasn't been
developed by Mozilla VR team it consists
of three components WebGL and it takes
care of the 3d rendering 3GS which is a
JavaScript library for trillion browsers
and the web PR API would make everything
possible like navigation tracking etc
there are two main frameworks within web
PR and the first one is a frame which is
developed by the Mozilla VR team and it
is a web frame standard that works on
the Dom and you can use it with with all
your favorite libraries and this and you
also have reactive er framework which is
from the guys from the react it's also
of course Facebook oculus so that's kind
of a buy-in and you can do everything
from former JavaScript site using a
react framework I created a friend
demo based on a frame which I'm going to
show no yes
okay there should be a book somewhere in
the works
yeah it's giving away so let's be the
same demo only a bit different its man
the most difficult part is hitting also
explanations are that good
that was the code so it's not a
difficult if you play from the current
society yeah yes okay
Network right awesome yeah okay briefly
go to the to the code yet what you need
to do from an iframe perspective is
include the framework and framework is
of course library JavaScript library can
be obtained at a frame that IO and you
can use the script tag I use 0.2 but 0.5
the latest version I use 0.2 because I
used two external libraries which come
from Kevin NGO which is one of the main
developers of a frame and a Google PR
team Google Mozilla VR team and so I use
it you can use external libraries after
that you need to register components
because we have a box in a world we want
to interact with it we want to use it we
want to move later so you need to
register components to do that you need
to do that before you declare the HTML
part of the of iframe and you can do
this very easy iframe that register
component I registered a click listener
over here which actually has a function
an init function you can do something
when it's a click so the count the the
laser shot and there's a lot of
JavaScript behind it but I'm not going
to show the tier that's in a it's in
github and see it plays the sound and
then the the biggest part of the HTML of
the a frame framework is the is the HTML
which it's really compact what you see
over here the on top you have to see
which is the 3d world you define it like
this you have assets like sounds texture
sky etc any of entities like Alex also
mention for Russia volley part you have
primitives you see the a books over here
that's a primitive style of a lot of
other primitives and you can use them
you can give them texture you can system
position you can give them animations
which we did over here you saw the Box
moves that's why I wasn't able to hit it
that well
and then you
you have another entity which is vital
that's the camera and the camera
basically says it's the line of sight
that you that you're looking at and it's
the background you see attack called sky
which actually generates everything that
surrounds the world and you can use it
what I what you saw was a 3d picture a
360 picture but you can use anything for
for that so hang on to unity yeah so
yeah well as unity guy myself I had to
make the same thing I made with a
yelling unity which here was
significantly easier so we have the same
daemon but the thing because of the time
I'll skip this one it is practically the
same except stuff looks better and we
actually have a go direction oceans
you're very exciting exciting so if you
start up to unity well of course you
have to download unity all the canned
stuff but actually all you need to do
within UTS go to project settings the
player settings and then take this this
one box virtual support that load the
cardboard SDK and that I you have
virtual reality engine teen every time
you build it's actually virtual reality
so that's everything you need to do with
unity to actually enable virtual reality
and then doing the same stuff all you
need to all you need is a standard unity
engine classes and for example update is
a function that also runs every frame
and then unity out-of-the-box checks if
Maps the mouse button 0 that your left
click on the mouse trigger so you can
just check that use my use my left click
pressed it's actually the same as it's
been triggered pressed if this happens I
just spawn a bullets on a certain
position with a edit with certain vector
the right vector that is the that the
z-axis with a certain certain offset and
then give it a rotation and then the
bullets slice so very simple one to one
line and you actually have a bullet and
then if you want to actually move
with you grab again its position it
again effect back to three objects and
you add a certain a certain speed every
frame this is the time it took you need
to complete each frame so every frame
you to a certain speed on a certain
vector and it moves forward and so
that's pretty much everything it does
and if you want to do audio this is
pretty much everything to do we get the
audio source of certain components and
you play it and that's pretty much it so
you induce a lot of clicking rounds
actually and adding stuff components to
objects and on the code side is very
light you're also going to see that I'm
comparison because you have wheel we had
to compare stuff so do it only on on
certain areas yeah so as technical as
possible so we started with the build
side so the actually build size of the
apk of the stuff how big is how big is
it
unity is a whooping forty five point
eight seven megabytes so I can't expect
that because unity actually builds a lot
of stuff with your wiki build the web VR
is actually five point five megabytes
and the biggest portion of that sort of
photos 5mv five megabytes of the photos
so it's basically way smallest exactly
Raja Valley its own is nine point four
nine point four five megabytes and
Android is 12.20 one megabyte this was
very particular to me and didn't expect
this one so apparently if you use the
cardboard as the case it's really a lot
of class a lot of stuff that gets
packaged with with application secondly
we have the lines of code a unity I did
this in 85 lines of code so very quickly
that VR is 175 lines of code mostly
because of the JavaScript that's added
to it like 140 lines of JavaScript and
the rest is HTML yeah
so if you use Mary Valley the you have
245 lines of code and if you go the
native way with OpenGL Nathan you're
over a thousand lines of code
and 500 of those lines of code are
actually matrix definitions of your
objects so what are the what are the
positions what are the vertex normals
Excel adds a lot of stuff that you
actually don't want to think about if
you're making very virtual reality
applications so next was the frame rate
which I was very enthusiastic about to
discover what frame rate was best until
I discovered that androids always
natively caps everything at 60fps which
really made this race a little bit
anti-climatic to be honest and then we
also discovered that Firefox for example
also caps its frame rates on 60fps so as
far as we could sell the only the only
browser doesn't natively cap its frame
rates is Google Chrome but can can be
capped by for example Windows or the Mac
OS if they feel like it Google Chrome
can go up to 90 frames per second yeah
that's sort of tests have been done with
it yeah and finally our own feeling and
our amount of butter Fox during
developments so to say well of course a
unity native guy I'd like very lacks
stuffing within an hour at demo done
using well where we are well you have to
use JavaScript so what more do you need
to say about that one right yeah and the
other part they were actually bridge to
the park and Laura Roosevelt actually
had to kind of - especially the bugs in
the in the framework itself produced a
lot of water fuck moments for exam what
is happening here why is this happening
all the kind stuff and yeah I don't
think you can even count the amount of
frustration and what the fuck moments we
had during developing in output chills I
don't want to know you know
so so that's basically I hope you
learned something thanks for watching
peace out and coat of all demos can be
found on these two github pages yeah and
if you have any questions we'll be here
and or there or there but basically
mostly here now so we have one minute
left I see so that's one question any
question ok well that's easy enough
think there might be a question sorry a
physics engine no you can download in a
third party physics engine if you want
for Android so there are physics engine
for Knight Android but you have to
download them separately and use them
several games with yeah we a material
can with anything yes and also with
react fear you can use that together ok
well thank you very much thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
