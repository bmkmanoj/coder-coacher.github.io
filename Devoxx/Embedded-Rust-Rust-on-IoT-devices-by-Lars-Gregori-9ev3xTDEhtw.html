IOT devices my name is Lara GUI I'm
working at SP high press in Munich and
they are working at hyper slaps team and
at hyper slaps team we are building
prototypes we're connecting Internet of
Things with our e-commerce platform and
here you can see on the left side our
smart wine shelf for the blinking and
lift up of the wine bottles we're using
Arduino and for the communication
raspberry pi in the middle we are using
a light blue beam for the ble
communication and there's also an
admiral process on it same as in arduino
and on the right side it's our infinite
card prototype which uses an esp8266 so
we are playing around with yeah embedded
devices so and the motivation for this
talk was this page I found it was about
functional IOT and on this page there
were three programming languages and
also rust and I thought okay rust
something functional maybe you have to
look at it friend of mine told me yeah
you have to look at rust and okay maybe
that's the starting point but there also
was something interesting on this page
with um how imagine how IOT devices are
so they are connected to the Internet I
mean that's the point internet of things
without internet there are only things
am they developed in short time storing
personal data and also sometimes a Wi-Fi
password so therefore they have to be
secure and they're getting more
intelligent powerful but on the other
side cheaper and also with the service
and all the old code which it's maybe
not updated that's all the problems we
are having getting now starting everyday
you'll be reading on the new some botnet
is up and the ZigBee protocol for
philip's you or something was hackable
and the page ask can see be designed for
Internet of Things like this for the
devices and the answer was no it can't
I thought okay maybe I have to look more
into rust so my talk will be about
giving overview about rust looking at
embedded rust cross compiling and micro
comb micro control of debugging yeah so
let's start with an overview when you go
to rustling org you can install it and
download it and there's also some
information or trustees so rust is a
system programming language it's fast it
prevents segmentation fault
that's main problem with the CC plus
language and guarantees thread safety
okay so I looked at of FAQ page
yeah safe concurrent practical system
language nice but there's also one
sentence they don't want to be 100
percent static safe or reflective not
too dogmatic so for example if you have
unsafe code you mark this code as unsafe
and don't get the help of the compiler
but you can use unsafe code if you want
and rust is developed by Mozilla for
their next browser engine called servo
and they already take some parts of this
proof of concept and put them into the
Firefox so in the actual Firefox you
already have some rust code and rust is
multi-payer Dickman so it's not only
functional programming as a thought in
the beginning it has also some old piece
code paretic man inside of it but the
interesting part is don't use the
garbage collector so with the
intelligent memory handling they don't
need garbage collector and it's built on
LLVM and russ is cross-platform so you
can use it on Android iOS and
let's talk here about embedded devices
and you have the conditional compilation
so if you have some code especially for
a Mac or for some embedded device you
can mark this code but what makes rusts
also yeah
so different is the control and safety
so if you look at some rust videos you
get an overview with the control this is
how you can access the memory so with C
C++ you can access every part of a
memory but on the other side side you're
not safety so language itself doesn't
help you really to access parts which
shouldn't be accessed because you have
something wrong in your code and then
you go down with go Java hiding and at
the end you have Haskell which totally
safety but you don't have really control
about it
so question is where's rust in this
diagram there's a gap between C C++ go
maybe no it's totally con you have told
control about it and it's absolute
safety and we thought this I thought
okay let's get more into rust and the
reason for this is the rust concepts
so the key concept is the ownership and
then we have borrowing and references
and the lifetime which is with is
advanced concept of the borrowing so I
will show you now some ownership and
powering code examples I skipped the
lifetime because yeah when you play
around with rust there's this nice
sentence in the documentation where you
can find here you have to fight borrow
tracker so you get error messages
anything why is this happening and then
you have to think about and it's like a
gamification it's like you try to fix it
to let it run and at the end here you
get more and more into the board checker
so here we have the ownership
I haven't backed off one two three in
rust will use the rust uses and macro
for this that's the reason with the
exclamation mark then we assign this
vector to a second variable do something
and at the end we want to print the
first element of our vector what will
happen you get an error use of a moved
value so when you assign your first
vector to a second variable you also
move the ownership and the reason for
this is there could be something inside
of it like take something out of vector
two so you don't know effect or if your
first element exists which value it will
have or something like that you have an
example I have value one assign it to be
two and print it in this case everything
is fine the reason for this is integer
and primitive types are using a copy
type trade so every time you assign a
value to another value the value will be
copied and the vector itself doesn't
have this one of these reasons maybe if
someone wants to copy one million items
from one side to the other side and
around it gets rose
yeah you can implement your own Vektor
with a copy type on fit or you can use
this kind of code so in rust you define
a function with the FN key word then we
have the function name then the
parameter with the type of the parameter
in this case we are having them back to
within 32-bit integer I set the
parameter and after the error you have
the return type in this case we have the
back two vectors and also an integer
32-bit then we do some stuff with vector
one and two and hand back the ownership
in our return type with back to one
vector two and 42 so in this case we are
defining some vectors calling the
function and get back to your ownership
but it looks a bit complicated to write
this kind of code so there's the
possibility with references so here you
can see the vector has an ampersand now
in front of it for reference and we only
have to return one type so we can do
this now for return 42 as answer and
when you call the function you also for
the ampersand as a reference for this
values and can use it think that's clear
but what happens if you want to change
something so in this case we're having a
vector and put back to value 5 on it and
here we're getting an error once again
but this time is cannot borrow immutable
borrowed content as mutable mean you
have to think twice and you get it ok I
borrowed it as immutable so I couldn't
I'm not allowed to change it but I want
to change it the reason for this every
variable in rust is per default
immutable you couldn't change it so if
you want to change it you have to use
the mutable keyboard so in this case we
define X as a mutable
variable then we assign Y with mutable
reference to X add to the value 1 and at
the end we want to print it so what will
happen everything is fine
5 plus 1 is 6 the reason for this is
first immutable and curly braces so in
this case the code gets a different
scope with scope in and after the end
scope destroys everything inside it and
giving back the reference it's the same
if if you would call a function I can
see some faces with getting more yeah
getting complicated so the rules for
borrowing first you have a scope which
have to be less or equal than your main
scope and the other rule is you have
only one or more references in this type
are kind AIDS it's immutable or exactly
one mutable reference but not both of
them so what happens if you take the
pray curly braces away we're getting an
error once again and this time you're
getting an error because you cannot
borrow an immutable variable also as
mutable so on the top we have a mutable
and want to read it immutable and this
against the rule where you only have a
mutable or immutable variable so at this
point I think you get an idea but not
understand it completely so you have to
play around on the document page you
have document page there are runnable
examples in browser you click on it and
can ya remove the curly braces or
something and then you get an error and
play around
and after half a day you get it a little
bit more clear okay now going to the
embedded rust part I found a project on
the on github it sink gets an
experimental project at the moment it's
for the ARM processor
it shows rust as safety features it's
mostly assembler free and completely C
free for this example I'm using an stm32
nucleo f4 which you can see here can
everyone see it I think oh yeah there's
here we are so in the middle the
blackboard that's the STM f4 11 re then
we have our left and right some sockets
also an Arduino compatible socket some
LED it's already on it some buttons and
a USB connection for it and for this
example I'm using the green LED already
so pa5 trust remember a 5 and P c7 c7
this is where use for this example so
let's take a look at a demo of space
great
so these are the examples which the sinc
project already have so we have most of
them uplink examples there's a Bluetooth
Low Energy example and some serial
communication but I'm staying on on the
blink example so in this case with
source main I think everyone can see it
here so the first line we're using
feature this means inside of Rusty's is
or everyday new dead of develop or
continuously develop so on a nightly
build you can use the feature keyboard
on a stable build they are not allowed
so for this example I need a special
version and I'd live a nightly build
version so the idea behind this is you
you have some new features you put it in
a nightly build or in beta version and
if they are successful they go into a
stable version then we have the null
standard keyboard this is for embedded
devices it's not using the standard c
library we don't have file access or
something
so you just skip this then used part how
to import some something into rust it's
a little bit different then in in Java
but I think yeah you can also make it
big then we have our main function in
this case we have to initialize the
stack and also the data because we are
embedded it's all the same with to some
assembler programming but if you do Java
it's it's there so you don't have to
think about then we have our LED or
first one so Yam using port a and pin
five so this is a five this case is an
unsigned 8-bit integer as an output then
I have led to C seven in this case
set up the LEDs set up a timer define a
variable for the delay and you have the
loop set first LED on second off wait
and the other way around and wait again
and loop through it okay cross compiling
so if you download the rest compiler
crust on from the internet form from the
rest page you have the stable version
but if you need some nightly built or
something you can use rust up
it's an installer for rust and then you
just say installed nightly something
from September then go into my Russ
project and overwrite the default
setting so every time I go into this
directory I'm using the nightly version
and outside I'm having a stable version
and we also need some new compiler for
this for the ARM version so here you can
see arm we on the ARM processor nan
means it's bare metal it's no linux or
something running around on it and it's
an embedded application binary interface
that's the EB versus using cargo as
package manager with rustbelt we can
build it and I just put here the target
and feature yeah a parameters on they
also can put into some configuration but
to make it more clear so we are using
some v7 it's some arm code base and the
features of the stm32f4 okay
so let's go out here I have my built
file with this all of them run it and
it's already done
because I already compiled it if you
compile it from scratch it will take a
little bit longer
so now I've changed some value because
you can already see it's blinking I
changed the delay to 100 the old it
takes a little bit longer and now I
upload it it always fails that's cool
and now it's blinking faster so with the
upload I connect the nuclear board to my
laptop and it's getting as this storage
device and just copy the binary total to
the store storage on this throw it here
you can see it on the last line maybe a
little bit higher so copy text copy it
to the volume note f4 11 re ok so and as
you can see it's blinking faster now so
I really changed the code it's really
rust it's not some some default example
or something ok an hour will debug on it
so there's some error some failure
already inside of the sync project you
have to comment out the debug GP script
thing and then you can build compatible
a debuggable code for it otherwise would
release code it's no problem with ya and
for the debugging I'm using open OCD so
this connects to the microcontroller
and open mobs in Port 3333 and then I
can open the debugger connect to it
remotely on this port load the file and
I can do something so I will do it now
first of all I start the open OCD as you
can see that microcontrollers stopped
now and there's lots of flashing here so
there's zero communication with this
device then I open up the debugger
target mode thousand three hundred then
I need this file just copy it I want to
overwrite it yeah no problem and now can
list my RS code so you can see it here I
can also set a breakpoint and the main
function this is somewhere here at
eleven and I want also a breakpoint at
thirty two that's the first time I'm
setting the LED one too high
now I can continue and it stops at main
I can now type next so go further and it
stops on line 34 with said hi so I just
continue once more and then you should
see the LED blinks and stops again at
thirty-four and now I can step into it
so this is the function itself said hi
then I get your offset the pin number or
can also print
self so that's a reference I print self
pin it's number five do I already have
to port no I think not step further and
that's the off no let's see offset true
where do I get a port there's some where
the port ah
it's under get registered so here you
can see the PS are are it's it's some
memory in on on the device and with
changing the flag to true I setting the
output to a high and that's when the LED
get turns on okay I just continue now
because now I can also throw the
variable delay 100 just changed I can
also change it set delay to do it one
second so and when I now continue takes
one second and should no force too fast
continue I'm okay
oh yeah thank you set delay - look
what's I always forget it why do I need
X equal sign
okay now takes longer yeah break12
yeah
so I also can change the variable it can
also disassemble this quote and I always
discuss this I'd copy it I couldn't
write this assemble this is arm coat
looks like a little bit like Java
bytecode and when I go to 600 somewhere
here we are with the arrow in front of
it then you can see a BL that branch
load so it's a call to our said hi
function I think that's yeah continue
break file everything demo I've already
gave so what have we seen today and rest
overview embedded ross code some rust
code also how to cross compile and debug
it what we didn't solve was the hello
world
the typical hello world but the blinking
hello world for embedded devices yeah
that's it
some question I think there I I couldn't
answer borrow check us questions within
a short time so if if you have yeah if
you have the compiler for it they they
don't use they don't come transfer it
into C code it's well good question
yeah it's economy that's the arm
compiler yeah right I'm not sure if they
if they're using a C code on it that's a
good question
didn't looked at it what they're really
doing it into the back end on it some
other yeah at the moment it's only they
started this project and continually
developing on it and at the moment
there's no Wi-Fi connection or something
so this is yeah I think it's also
something which will be more complicated
to rewrite everything into rust so this
is also one main problem with rust there
are lots of C code lots of libraries
outside of it so you can use it with
rust but in this case you are using the
unsafe part and yeah then you still have
the problem that this library will have
some some problems and everything will
be unsafe yeah
more questions I'm around yeah that's a
good thing
there's an STM l1 also which this is
therefore it's a little bit more
powerful but it doesn't have to be
powerful um this one has 512 kilobytes
laughs and 128 kilobyte SRAM we're
talking about kilo not Tara or something
yeah and the l1 is also possible and I
have it here somewhere okay more
questions thank you
you
