talk about how to make the good old
hibernate or M world will work with the
elasticsearch so my name is Emmanuel
down now I work for with the Indiana
team really for quite a while I've been
working with them for quite a while and
I'm generally platform architect for
everything data in inside right at
middleware okay welcome I'm David
Plateau and developer at elastic the
company beyond elastic search on over
tools and I'm working specifically on
elastic search itself that's all okay so
hibernate you know probably the object
relational mapper otherwise I'm not sure
why you're here but it's really an
ecosystem of things different projects
that address different issues and
hibernate search tries to fix the
problem of being able to create of
inverted index on top of from an object
and we've got different sources of
object being changed and our net or our
M is one of those source and we have
different way to index information the
main historical approaches we see no no
we have the elastic search one so what
is elastic search elastic search is
basically a search engine built in Java
on top of reason and it speaks JSON over
HTTP so basically you can use that
whatever your techno technology stack is
and yeah really easy so in action oh
yeah ready so we've got the code of what
we're gonna run here and we're gonna
show the QR code a bit later anyway
whoops that H yes you saw the future
there you go
so we built an application which is a
demo here and we are using some written
some tests to to run our application so
I'm just going to run the test to check
that everything is working fine okay so
we have tests so that's the demo without
elasticsearch without an answer yeah so
the object we are going to manipulate
today are video games so in this on tt
video game we have some fields like a
title or description and so on we have a
inner object name publisher if I go to
the publisher I have the name and the
address and so on I have a collection of
tags for this video game and also a
correction of character for this video
get for this video game and if I look at
the tests we have now at the beginning
so we are using your eye bayonet
obviously the first thing we all do we
are doing is to create our data set so
within a transaction we are building a
first publisher for the videogames and
then free characters Ouija Frank and -
you know all those characters are
persisted and we are creating the first
video game so this video game is this
title revenge of the samurai a
description rating and so on this
publisher the one we have defined before
and also two characters here with G and
- and sometimes when we persist this
first video game we persist a second one
here tanika's return and a short one and
then in our test what we are showing is
that we can create a query using a
bayonet here I want to cry wee and I'm
looking for a video game where the title
of the video game is the title as passed
I'm passing as a parameter area so here
I'm searching for this exact chain
string which is a revenge of the samurai
I'm expecting to get some result I
expecting to get one result where the
title is exactly revenge of the third
one so this is the first test on a
single field single term you know just a
bit more tricky we want to search for
only one sub term within the title so we
are
or like person search yv person samurai
persons and we obviously check that it's
a welcome full scan right yes this guy
know hopefully index force gun yeah we
have free video games so that we were
but obviously if you have millions of
videogame that will be that we become an
issue for sure
and when I'm searching here for two
terms so revenge and Samurai obviously
it's working but if I'm searching for
the same same same term sorry but
reverted interrupted so Samurai and
revenge when it won't work same if you
had to had capital s not capital S yes
only would have it will fail and have it
exactly but everyone so we want to
switch to elastic search and to do that
we can do that manually actually so I'm
going to switch on a branch where
everything is already written I'm just
going to explain what what we did in
that branch first of all we added
elasticsearch library so the client for
elastic search and also we are adding
you know Jackson library Jackson will
help us to transform our beans to JSON
documents because elastic Josh only
speaks Jesus so you have to send Twitter
sex orgies and documents if we look at
the test class again first of all we are
building our maple
Jackson maple so the the maple which
will help you help us to transform Jesus
to bins and bins to Jason and we are
building elasticsearch crayons so you
know we are using a transport Leon and
this client will connect with a steed
search which is running locally here in
a docker container on this address and
this is the default transport port we
are using so this transpose spots is
used by elasticsearch to communicate
between nodes and the client we are
using today is using that death port so
what changed so within our transaction
here we are still just
sing some videogames oh I forgot to to
explain some annotation know after so
within the the disconnection we are
going to just after we have tested the
first video game we are going to call
elasticsearch with the client and we
want to prepare an index operation we
are going to index our document in a
index name video game this is the type
of our documents and the ID of the
document itself when we are writing this
document as a JSON document using your
Jackson so we basically say lies this
bin to JSON document and we set that
source to elasticsearch okay so if you
got an exception here you swallow it
right yes so what you can do you know is
maybe to hold back the current row
section if you have any way or you can
just your print whatever you want to you
ops team yeah because well whoops yes
because yeah I just want to pass this in
database whatever is are coming with the
shots and join sir but then if you so if
that passes or can see the first video
game is persisted then you index it then
the second video game is trying to be
persisted and then there is a failure in
which means the Russian relational
collection is rolled back so no game is
stored what happens so in a sea search
elastic search is not a small section on
system so you can't hold back what you
have indexed so if you son an index
operation to elastic search it straight
you can't roll back so ok you have to do
that by yourself
okay maybe crush everything and we index
everything I can do
sorry
hopefully no same thing for the third
video game yeah we indexed exactly as we
have seen before
okay we change few things so in the
character yeah objection I had to add
this diesel in your for Jackson if I
don't do that
when Jackson we try to generate the JSON
document it will go for infinite loop
because the video games do sorry the
character as appears in a video game and
a video game as a collection of
characters and so on so forth so I have
to you know that that fit okay and if I
remember when you save the video game
and also updated the index so what
happens if I change a cocktail do you do
I have to reenact the video game so bad
manual is somehow oh yeah so probably
you have to detect that in your service
layer and then read again the video game
from the base and some operations with a
successor Windex the video games it's
not automatic right so so that's it even
though such parts itself I forgot to run
the test - okay so what I'm doing you
know instead of coding ability
I'm using now elastics of crayons so I'm
running a search operation on indexed
video game and I'm using your match
query on the field title I'm searching
for revenge of the samurai when I'm
executing this and I'm getting back a
response from elasticsearch and from
this response I'm going to iterate over
the results and for each result I'm
going to read the shows document which
has been stored into elasticsearch and
with jackson I will convert it back as a
video game again okay so this is not a
manager object by hibernate right so if
I modify it or if I navigate down it
might not have the objects I expect yes
it's a pube in Iran that manage it why
so what you can do here you can get
instead of that the ID of the document
and then call ID on it just right after
that and read the database again using a
Burnett with this idea that you can do
we know so we check that everything is
working well
same for the over things the cool thing
now that we have a video we have a
certain shine is that even if I search
for the inverted term for samurai Riven
instead of 300 Samurai then this will
obviously work
if the tests are passing did we start
the dukkha yeah okay don't crush my demo
so so this this is what we did you okay
I know there is notion of analyzers in a
elasticsearch so you can select which
analyzer to use for which field yes so
you can define that so to do that you
have to build what we call some settings
and remapping for the entity you are
planning with to do that you are just to
send a request to push your mapping and
as an example I can show you your what
the mapping is looking like you know so
for example the mapping that
elasticsearch
auto guest is is like this so you ever
get a set of properties on you know you
can define to analyze okay so so what do
you do you if I want to customize things
I maintain this JSON file on my yes so
anyways or something within your code
base you add this route as a resource
but then anytime you want to obviously I
do field or modified some properties of
your mapping when you have to address
this but you have to think about it okay
but you are always saying hey that is a
bit complicated you have a better idea
to solve yeah yeah I think I have the
solution
yes sorry I've been nasty to him but I
like it
so what I will do is go back to the
legacy branch actually I do I'm going to
go a little step further and go you know
an already pre-configured one so I'll
show you very quickly the palm here I've
added hibernate search and two two bits
the one that says please listen to
either net or I'm and notify me of every
change that happening when hibernate or
and or something and the other one that
says hey please use elastic search as
the backend the code that does that and
I use version beta 3 the Welsh the
candidate release is going to happen you
know within a month
maximum we worked quite a lot in the
last few months to
really get something very good and
running and the second thing is to
configure some things and just like
hibernate everything is configured
either in your persistence dot XML
hibernate dot CSV dot XML your whatever
spring files or whatever the first thing
is I decided to use elastic search as
the index manager the second thing is
I'm using on pointing to the actual
elastic search instance yeah you know
you're using the rest port right yes
because we didn't want to be tied to one
specific version of elastic serve so we
use pure rest calls and we don't have a
dependence here on your library okay so
we just released a new client for in a
6.5 dot o which is res based but for now
is to low-level clients so we are going
to enhance that in the future and then
we will be able to switch with this
Italian probably right and finally
because we've got the classes and
classes our properties with types and we
can put annotations on that we actually
have all the information we need to
actually create the what you call the
mapping file for elastic search so we
can create it and push it to elastic
search you can group existing data as
well yes it's up to you so this one
wouldn't drop the data but you get a
recreate that will not drop the data
we've got a merge strategy which tries
to if you do a change to also date the
index as long as it's compatible and so
on so next is to actually decide which
entity needs to be indexed so entities
are not actually indexed by default so I
need to add add indexed and then I
decided which field I want to index I
don't want to index all of them so I'm
going to index the type description can
you set an answer for this field for
example yes
so I say analyzer and finding the h1
piece you want the English one and
what's happening here is that the
definition is the one that we will ask
elasticsearch to use and elastic search
happens to have an English analyzer
sweet propagate that so you can do that
for numerical values as well sorry that
would work dates as well but we don't
here and this one is interesting so
that's another object a number date
object in this case and by default we
don't index stuff so you have to decide
what to index or here I want to index
the name but I want to embed that
information so it's it's the
normalization really so when I index the
video gamer will also index the
publisher and in this case publisher
that name okay
same for collection I can say index
tamadate and use the field stuff here so
that's a collection of basic types but
that also works for the yeah they may
need to arrange the character thing so
are you not going to have this infinite
loop that we discussed before no well I
guess at some point we had in the code
but not anymore
so there are two reasons why we don't
have it first of all because I don't
embed video games in here
I don't propagate things so I don't have
the issue of you going like in loops but
even if I had added an odd index debated
annotation here hi danette source by
default we look and if it finds the same
instance twice within a depth it will
stop and you can configure that by
setting an explicit path that you want
to index and not everything so there is
a lot of freedom here what I will do is
add the contained in which solves
another problem of use so because of
that information when I received a
character change event from hibernate
hibernate say hey hold on a minute
character is actually embedded inside
video game let's go up look at the video
games and upgrade them because the
character has changed actually only if
the field properties out are I've
changed if special Power has changed is
not a problem
so okay our model is ready now yeah so I
guess that in the service layer or in
our test you have to implement that the
fact that you have to create an index
push the mapping and then send the data
to a 6oj
nope hibernate so store does all that
for you so what happens is the deep
integration between RM and hibernate
search means that within a transaction
we collect we see all the changes that
are happening and the one that are
involved either contained in or an
actual index entity we put in a queue
the purse is happening inside the
database and when the transaction rolls
back then this cue is discarded but if
the transaction commits we are like okay
here is some bunch of stuff we need to
index and let's go and index them in
batch so we use the elasticsearch
batching approach and boom everything is
indexed so you don't have the problem of
stuff partial index while the data is
actually not there okay you have to fix
now the I guess the search itself yes
why not fix it but no use now this
awesome shine exactly so there is a sub
interface full text entity manager which
which does expose the the full text
query capability essentially so I'll use
that and I'll also create what is called
a query builder so we've got to query
approaches one is to use the native
elastic search syntax and the other one
is to use the hibernate search
higher-level DSL which stocks objects so
that's the one I will demonstrate first
and then we'll move to the other one so
I'm creating the query builder for the
video game getting it I know I'm ready
to replace this and the chair is coming
thank you
so instead of having the create query
I'll just replace it with a create
native query
oh no not create any difference create
full tags a query in which case I can
use the query builder inside this one
builder so you need a keyword query on a
specific field so I'll use that title I
could use all the fields so I could
compound stuff so it's a very nicely
scale as far as complexity of the query
and I want too much samurai revenge
you know forgot the capital wrong god
that that will work I will also say that
I want to target videogames so only this
index is actually used and there is a
I'll suppress the warning here it's
something we'll fix in the next version
of next major version of
let's search so it's my no improvement
but that would break backward
compatibility so we won't do that by the
way I think it should work yeah let's
see and you are getting back a list of
video games those are coming from
database exactly those are just like the
objects you would have retrieved from a
GPL query that's the one you retrieve so
video game if it as a lazy Association
to the publishers the not publish on
this case but the character then when I
navigate I'll get the characters and so
on and so on right if I change the video
game it will be to change will be
propagating so can you use elastic
search query instead so instead of so
I'm just replacing this part and I'll
say elastic search queries and I've got
two options the query string which
neither of us really enjoy as far as the
language so the JSON which is a bit more
full features let's than you right I
cannot write a jeezum document but I can
copy/paste the JSON document so that's
what I'm going to do here and that will
also return managed video games we just
happen to use the elastic search native
syntax yeah but before that I'll do
pagination I'll say hey I only want to
retrieve the first you know ten results
just like Google and that's very
important to do pagination actually
elastic search mandates that you do up
to ten thousand results and not more by
default so we highly recommend you to
use the pagination indeed yeah and the
other thing I can do is to say hey I
don't want to retrieve all of that data
I just want to retrieve some of it so
I'll use a projection just like you can
do a projection in SQL write the Select
part and here I'll say I just want a
title and let's say that I want to get
back to school yes to score is the the
relevancy of a result compared to
another one
by default the full-text search engine
returned the most interesting results at
the top and it's a good and interesting
metrics to compare the top to the next
element maybe if the next element is
like 10% in relevancy or
the other one maybe you don't want to
expose it and in this case I'll also
return the source which this resource
which happens to be the G's induction on
that we push to elastic search so
elastic search stalks G's on so we
create a JSON document with the stuff we
want to indexed and pass it along so it
means you know that we are not getting
back managing quantities yeah so we are
not getting back a videogames
technically yeah actually we'll retrieve
an array of object so that's super handy
because if you just want to display the
result for your users and you don't want
to go back to the database you just have
to use projection for that and
everything exactly all the stuff we
don't have time to show you that but the
query builder is actually very powerful
pretty close to the perf enough of
elastic search except for the
aggregation at the moment range query
aggregation of boolean queries faceting
keyword which is the classical full-text
query more like this actually doesn't
work for elastic search because we have
a very specific algorithm so it more
work phrase query we can do sorting
spatial query and so on and so on so
that was just to show you how things
work so that the gist of this
presentation is if you have an hibernate
or web application and considering
indexing the information inside elastic
search go and look at the hibernate
search integration we've solved a lot of
complex problem or annoying problem you
would have to solve manually so indexing
is retransplant and the query is at the
object level instead of down to the
elastic search level even though you can
still do native elastic search queries
and lots of more stuff like error
handling so giving you back doing a call
back in case of errors so you can log to
the system in or what or what not the
mass index are to initially load all of
the data from your database and push it
into elastic search without writing line
of quest
well yeah just annotations faceting
geolocation with already showed you that
very quickly in the query builder and
then once you have index data into
elastic search you can use some of the
nice
we have at elastic so for example Cuban
area well you can navigate for your
result and explore your data set and
make sense or show that basically and
scale I would as well core thanks for
being here we've got five minutes for
questions so let's try and use it use
that time yes yeah yeah the question is
can I restrict the fact that the entity
is indexed based on the state of the
entity for example if I've got a blog
and the status is deleted I don't want
that to be indexed the answer is yes we
have that inside hibernate search on the
entity you wanna teach it and there is a
method that should return I want to be
indexed so I do not want to be indexed
yes
yeah the question is that we doing to
face commits between elasticsearch and
the database so there are two reasons
why we don't do that
first of all elasticsearch is not xa
compliant so that would be a bit tough
yeah we could do last resource I guess
the reason I we don't do it is because
we feel that if you lose the indexing
it's not as problematic as actually
losing the database transaction so you
want for for example your order to be
committed into the database and okay
well there is a failure with the index I
can catch up a bit later because I've
got the raw data so that's the main
reason we don't we don't do the actual
indexing as as a two-phase commit that
being said we can do two phase commit
between the fact that we want to index
and push that change as in to a JMS
queue and from there if you can if you
do the JMS queue with proper you know
non-deliverable thing happening you
would be able to get guarantee that at
some point you will get everything into
into the index another question on top I
didn't get the beginning of the question
it's a great question that's a revision
so hibernate search can you repeat the
question yes so the question is does the
data has to be in the database or can I
actually find it just in elasticsearch
so let me tell you some things and let's
see if we can answer that question so
there is the the stuff we've
demonstrated here is the integration
between ORM and elastic search via
hibernate search so if you use a valid
or GM which used which exposes access to
the no SQL universe and not the
relational universe you would be able to
say I'm going to Index this no SQL data
into elasticsearch so that's
non-relational so it's not exactly on
sorry on your question but that's
interesting
we've got also an icon at search
integration with infinite span for
example so we listen to the infinite
span even changes and we do the
indexation through that and it's not in
the main branch but I actually wrote
something that is kind of a manual way
to say here is an object change and
please hide on itself go and index that
information because I wanted to use that
in a universe where I just had a file
system and I didn't want the that full
database on whatnot
so I guess you could use that API which
is in a in a branch to do what you're
looking at or the alternative issue if
you really want to just use elastic
search is to write an ionic or GM
dialect for elastic search to store the
data in a grenade or GM sorry in elastic
search via hibernate or GM and from
there you would be good to go
depends a little bit on what you want to
do behind the after that but that's as
close as I can get from an answer maybe
one last question yes
we not what will it be available well it
doesn't work so the question is what
happens if elasticsearch is not
available
first of all there are lots of tools so
that elasticsearch can be available like
reputation and so on you can talk about
that but at the moment from an identity
search point of view if we try to do the
indexing and it first you've got this
error handling API that will be
triggered and the error handling is
actually a piece of code that you write
yourself so you could have a login to
your to your sis admin or maybe a retry
operation after five minutes in inside
your applications or something like that
we don't have a system where we actually
physically choose things and then try
them again I guess we could with the
fact that elastic ìdonít search has a
kind of a way to push stuff into GMS but
I haven't actually tried those kind of
combination could be interesting I think
rather yeah it times a rod on okay thank
you everyone and if you have more
question you can come down lots of
stickers will stay to my session then
