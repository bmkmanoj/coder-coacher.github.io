first of all thanks everybody for giving
up 15 minutes of your your lunch hour to
come to the session it really appreciate
it
and it is 15 minutes I'm going to be
really quick that hopefully give you
something really excited to go away with
and I'll actually be done at the Oracle
stand afterwards if you wanna have a
chat about this so really quick
introduction grant Ronald now um I work
in the the product management team
responsible for our mobile and
intelligent box okay so that just slides
over with okay what I want to do now is
just show you some of the cool stuff
that we are doing with but now I'm going
to show you some products and stuff that
we're working on so Oracle always likes
me to put this slide up so the first
thing I'm going to do is look at why
bots might be interesting chat BOTS
well again time being short or they want
to spend too long extoling the virtues
of messaging apps and stuff that let's
just acknowledge that we have like a
couple of billion people that the planet
we're communicating with each other
through messaging apps like Facebook or
slack or HipChat WeChat all those poor
things
so wouldn't it make sense it wouldn't to
be nice that as well as just
communicating and chatting to our
friends we could also maybe chat to
business of services you know order
pizza check our bank balance check the
the results of our exams or something
interacting through natural conversation
rather than trying to find a website or
downloading a mobile app or something so
let me start by showing you an example
and here's something I've been playing
about with just to get you into the mood
of what a chat bot does so let's imagine
here I want to do some banking on the
chat bot here so let's ask a question so
what is my balance
okay so I've asked that question what's
that my balance but it's an incomplete
question well what kind are you talking
about
okay we can in my savings account so
check my savings account and they are
your balance in your savings so it's
gone a back-end system and it's pulled
up some information no obviously there
is a million in one different ways I
could ask that same question so I didn't
put savings in but I might put what's my
balance in savings
so actually specify the full amount of
information that we need to actually
retrieve and we get that back as well
and I can ask that in different ways
there how much do I have in savings so
another way of answering equation as
going to same question so essentially
we've got three four hundreds of
different ways of asking that same
question and it's going to still resolve
the fact that well even though you can
ask this in many different ways
I will resolve that - meaning the same
thing you have the same intention which
is checking a balance so let's try
something else no because having checked
my balance I want to go out tonight or
you know last night and I need to clear
the babysitter so let's see pay the
babysitter so here's a different thing
this chatbots going to do so I'm asking
it to pay the babysitter and again I've
asked a question but not given enough
information to resolve or answer the
question for me so it says well wait a
minute what kind do you want to make the
payment from okay so my my checking
account and I'll come back and see okay
checking how much no all conversation
don't necessarily follow an exact flaw
at this point I may think we'll wait a
minute how much money have I got before
I pay so how much do I have in
so I ask the question how much do I have
no notice that it's remembered that I'm
talking about the checking account so
it's not said but what kind do you want
to know so I've kind of injected a
separate conversation into this pay the
babysitter conversation yes it's
remembering what we're talking about
which is kind of like what you'd expect
when you're talking to somebody okay so
the balance of your check okay I've got
loads of money I should have spent more
money last night so let's say pay and
then we'll finish the conversation
how much do you want to pay because I
work for a US company then I've got to
stick it in dollars here just because
that's who built the demo ok what's the
payment amount of $50 and there we go
we'll get the fill your payment of $50
is made to the babysitter that I talked
about earlier from your checking account
that we talked about earlier and it's
gone to some back-end system and it's
done that transaction for me okay so
that's the the the I suppose the sum of
what this chat bot is doing some banking
chat box how did we build that this is
the really interesting thing about how
we build these chat BOTS so this is a
intelligent bot service okay part of our
mobile cloud service and what it does is
allows you to define the things that
you'd like the bot to do make
connections to back-end systems to do
those things but also provides AI and a
natural language processing engines so
that understands the million and one
different ways you could ask how much
money other got or pay somebody so let
me take a step through here we've got a
number of bots and we could get our
might envision myself having a master
bot that controls the first line of kind
of communication and then depending on
what the questions ask we pass you off
to the banking bot or with paschal to
the password reset bot or we send you
off to somewhere else that has to you
know get a an engineer to come and visit
over the use case might be so let's look
at my master bowl know the first thing
to make clear here is the chat bottle
that I just showed you it wasn't an
all-encompassing conversation okay it
was a limited scope and that's exactly
what the chat box should be I'm not
going to sit down with that banking chat
bot and have a philosophical discussion
about you know the life universe and
everything okay it's there to do a set
number of things okay and in this
example here for the sake of the demo
I've kept that that this thing really
does three use cases and you can
gracefully handle if you do ask it
something philosophical how they
responded but essentially there are
three things that this banking bot will
do it will check for balances that will
transfer money and it will tell you what
you've been spending and if things are
and money on so if I say well my banking
bar I would like it to cope with or
manage the fact that you can ask for
balances what we do is we say okay when
you create an intent so intent is the
thing the the bot will actually do or
respond to or a use case and what I do
is I seed it with about half a dozen or
a dozen of sample phrases no to be clear
this isn't a rule-based chick okay if I
ask a question which is not covered in
there that would be pretty limiting okay
so we're not trying to ensure that we
cover every single example of the way
that somebody could ask how to how their
what the balance is what we're just
doing is creating a couple of
represented phrases and what we do is we
actually then train the bot and it will
take those phrases and put it into some
neural network which will then
understand that if I ask a question
which is not one of my samples which is
highly likely then it gives a
probability that would you know what
with the words you've used in this input
and a couple of training sentences
you've given me
I have a 98% probability that you're
asking about a balance okay and I can
actually test this here and there that
the tests are so and so how much or we
asked before what is my balance it's
saying more than eighty two percent
chance that you're talking about balance
ease or I could ask and how much do I
have in my savings account
and again it's resolving seeing based on
these crazies we'll get a rough idea
that ninety eight percent ninety three
percent probability
however there's actually two stages that
are bought service gives you in
processing that language the first is it
just checks the input phrase against the
trained neural network based on those
phrases and gives a probability but it
really doesn't know anything about
languages stuff as such at this point
it's just using these sentences as
really tokens okay our frequency of
words appear but it then goes through a
second stage and this is a called NLP or
natural language processing so there was
a natural language processing it has
been specifically trained in for example
in this case English using a huge body
or corpus of data including things that
Wikipedia that will then start
understanding the subtleties and nuances
for language okay so for example if my
bought was for phoning up my phone
company to tell them our problems with
my my am phone line if I said something
like my phone is bust
okay now Buster's a bit of a slang term
but having been trained at a whole body
of public vailable information it would
understand that robust although it can
mean many things can be having a drug
bust that can mean having a course or a
statue well in the context of telephone
and fixing
things bus probably means broken and it
will lend itself to getting a higher
degree of probability to your reporting
that something's broken okay so there's
a two-stage process going on here based
on some sample phrases we give it and
the natural language and that's all we
have to do okay because really the level
of natural language processing here is
just to work out what intent we go to
I'm based on that intent we can define
what
for example backend system that we call
to actually get about now when I showed
you the example with how much does my or
how much I have in and my savings
account I could have put in savings or
checking a cone or credit card so the
intent has a variable element to it and
so what we can also do in our box
service is define the variable elements
of an intent and get them to be
specifically picked out of the natural
language so in this example here you can
see that the balances intent we'll also
look for something called an account
type and an account type they look here
is a list of the possible banking or
accounts that I have with a bunch of
synonyms associated with it as well and
you'll actually see this in the tester
that if I say let's clear this how much
in savings
I'll see what's my balance in savings
you'll see that it's actually worked out
is pulled out of that sentence the fact
that you're talking about the savings
account and assign that value to this
variable account type okay
so similarly if I did M X it would say
well you're talking about credit card
okay so it's pulling out the variable
elements so you can define
domain-specific entities or variables so
like account type or if was doing a
pizza bot I might create a variable
called pizza sighs okay so it would
specifically look for in your sentence
if you type and I want to order a large
pizza it would take a large but we could
also associate synonyms with large so if
it was a 14-inch pizza or huge pizza or
whatever the different words we could
pick those out and resolve those back to
a specific domain specific piece of
information such as large pizza now
there are also a number of common
elements that you might want to pick out
and these include things like dates
currency for numbers x okay so we also
provide a whole lot of pre-built
entities or variables that we'll look
for and pull out the sentence so again
and the way of an example let's say how
much did I spend last week so that's
resolved to the track spending intent so
it knows you're talking about that that
that Intendant that used kids but notice
that it's also picked out last week it's
resolved as well being from the 30th of
April to the 7th of May okay so you
don't have to put it in machine specific
format we're talking in a natural
language and it will work out well if
you say last week three equal if you say
at last month
it will pick out the correct and resolve
that to something that that your
back-end system will start
understandable that's a sequel query or
something else you have your back-end
right timing short moving on really
quickly so the last thing to show is
well a conversation happens in a
conversation has a flaw so I'm going to
show you this is actually one of our
pre-production builds so this is
actually we were working on a visual
designer for this but this is what you
see under the covers that basically on
asking a question okay the flow will say
right I will get the input from you as
long as it's greater than 40%
probability we will then jump to the
correct point in the conversation so for
example if we work out the you have
asked start balances then what we'll do
then is we'll set the value of the
account type and if you have not entered
a count tape will stick up a list
component in which you can select one of
the account types and then once we have
all the information we will actually
call something called balance retrieval
and bounce retrieval is actually just a
rest web service that will go back and
do the right thing okay 50 minutes geez
that goes quickly what I'm going to do
is just point you to if you'd like to
learn more we're going to be done at the
Oracle stand just down there as well
I'll be done there if you don't have a
chat about this or you can follow us on
Twitter
they've got my handle here at GW Ronald
so thank you very much for attending
this session give me a good lunch any
