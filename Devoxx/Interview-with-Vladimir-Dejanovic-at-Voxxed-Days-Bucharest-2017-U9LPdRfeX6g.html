and moving large scale so that sounds
like it has a bit of a backstory to it
well I think the pain of wearing happed
also is you know a tip adults in life
because they like to say those during my
talk I remember because for me the
happiest day was when I was kidding I
was playing eating candy and then it
like comes the you need to go to school
you need to go to college you need to
start working and like that's like
pluses and minuses my sports you have to
work but plus you can buy down the King
you want and like I think that same goes
also with with the software actually
with the products everything fits again
like when you start small you want to be
grown to grow like you know to get more
users to get more experience those kind
of things so again if you manage to do
that then it's perfect but it's yeah
it's bit of painting in between because
again you made some assumption along the
way which maybe are not really the best
way and again you find out how actually
or not dentist fees after you've eaten
all the candy what do you say going
large-scale it's not scaling you
databases scaling your applications or
is it is it everything I would say
absolutely everything because again like
when you design a system for example and
you have work 1,000 users per day you
can have a problem with one server in
one database but when you go to like
millions and millions of users then you
find out everything is to scale up so
application service data business
networks data centers also procedures
the way that you deploy software the way
that you monitor that everything is
correct
still that again if something goes wrong
then how to find out where how to react
fast so again also one thing that I
didn't really mention does not give me
the talk but again also the people
itself needs to also to change because
again you need it
you had one skill set we need one skill
set very well small scale but I just are
going large and large then you probably
need some specialists and again also the
people needs to change and they need to
also expand their knowledge and their
abilities so when you come up with a
strategy for scaling what do you think
about you have to think about
everything or is there a nice logical
progression of what you scales maybe
first of all you scale the
infrastructure then you get in new yes
well I like easy but they know like with
Adria like you know go ahead fastest you
can adjust double-checked you see like
actually where the pain points are
because you know you can assume that
something is going to crap but until you
really try and see you will not really
know so also one thing that they
mentioned during the talk is like more
interesting and that's I think the key
point because again if you're monitoring
you can see okay is your CPU almost done
if you're maybe maybe your memory almost
done it how is the harddrive how is the
network and then you can see okay this
part is going looks like it's going to
be in trouble very soon so then you can
step actually do something again you can
assume you can guess let's see something
is going to break but again you really
don't know and that's really something
which it's completely mine changer when
you have go like with millions and
millions of users there the application
that you're talking about in your talk
what's the story behind that well I
think I was kind of lucky because I
moved from a lot of different companies
for a lot of different projects and I
saw story from all kinds of sides so I
saw like Jewish when your one-man show
and you have to do everything so it's
also like even taking the cables from
the server to the network so to say you
know then that meant moved also to the
companies where they're like huge you
have like millions millions of actually
customers and that also tells and
puzzles users so you don't even know
about the defects of the system so I've
been in different type of products
different type of companies and then I
feel like basically about that my
experience by seeing the good parts in
one side and also in the other side and
all experience from actually from doing
a lot of starting off from other people
that they talk to it so what's the most
positive experience you've had with
scaling the good parts well I would say
the best part is that again surprise
something that might sounds very
surprisingly but I worked in a company
which served the millions and millions
of users and we didn't have any fancy
tools so it was everything with the
scripts and custom made and it was so
long tack but again when you think about
it
low-tech something is very good because
if there is a low tech tourism
small amount that can go go wrong again
I mean your sky scale that that really
helps up and then again weeks something
that we usually at least when we start
think about in school we all thought
okay like you need to denormalize
database in its foreign keys you need
this you need that all these kind of
things because like they will make sure
that your application we're good but
then as you go move to large scale if
you remove all those kind of things and
go a different way and actually make
your application smart but database
stupid and go a very very low-tech it
scales very fast and very good without
any fancy tools so you have total
control as well
yeah control so it was for me it's
really pleasant surprise it's something
that's again like I think hopefully
people understand after this offer well
it's like he take away from you took
away I would say are the two things
first motor everything because systems
full braking that's the fact of the life
and again the second is a fourth like
yeah be prepared things will go wrong so
then figure out what you need to do at
that case a special monitoring really
helps with in like having the test and
having the log silicon fees doesn't
guarantee that when users keep your
website is doing still stay up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
