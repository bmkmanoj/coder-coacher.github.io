welcome thank you for coming to my talk
the outcome is better than I hoped for
so that's pretty good so um today I'll
be talking about the effects of the GDP
are maybe just a quick race of hands
does anyone know about GDP are Wow okay
that's great
so um we'll be taking a closer look at
what it is and I'll at the end I'll try
to come up with some steps that you can
take and because of the nature of the
GDP are it's pretty hard to come up with
some general steps that anyone can fall
because it's so specific at points so my
name is Michael I'm developers IT
software my text is an open source
library it's been around for 17 years
now I'm being the developer at I text
software as an open source company I'm
very much interested in open source and
licensing I thing is a very interesting
aspect of open source world and it's
something that I've always been
interested in legal issues and stuff
like that if you want to follow me this
is my sweet Kendall I don't tweet a lot
but you never know so maybe first a
disclaimer I'm not a lawyer as mentioned
I'm a developer
my biggest expertise in legal issues is
being stopped by a police officer for
jaywalking so don't take my word for
anything on this so if you want to take
away some things from this and if you
want to take some action steps if you
won't have questions I'm I'm ok with
answering name but if you really want
some specifics there are other people
who are more certified for this but this
is a general introduction I hope that
everything I say is right because the
gdpr is really open to interpretation at
some points okay so let's start the GDP
R stands for general data protection
regulation this is the opening paragraph
of the illegal text no worries this is
the most that you'll see of the text but
it's just an easy way to to get into
what the GDP R stands for so the GDP R
is on the protection of natural persons
with regards to the processing of
personal data and on the free movement
of such data repealing a directive
there's a few things in there that we
can
dissect and zoom in on the first one
that we can dive in on as a regulation
people familiar with EU legislation no
that's usually the you sets out some
directives directors need national
implementation you can compare it to an
interface in Java so the EU would send
out the interface and every country
would need to implement the interface
this has some meaning to the GTR because
GPR is a regulation it's not directive
regulation means that it goes effective
now it doesn't need any national
implementation there's a small side note
to make that there are some areas that
do need national implementation like one
I can think of right now is national
security for instance but in general
it's it's applicable to everyone in the
EU effective media okay so moving on on
to the next big key word of this intro
text is a natural person what defines a
natural person according to the GDP are
basically a natural person is the EU
citizen I assume that most of you here
are EU citizens and so this applies to
you you are protected by the GDP are as
a person the person is also known as a
data subject in the GDP our text moving
on we see the next important keyword is
personal data of course the definition
define there is quite obvious it's
information that relates back to a
person to a data subject but what really
is defined as personal data how far can
you go with personal data there's the
obvious stuff like name address national
ID number and for instance in Belgium
everyone is assigned a number at birth
it's your just a date of birth and
butter your girl boy and how many boys
were born born before you and this
obviously really expect to you if you
have my name Michael the man then you
know that it really expect to me if you
have my address you know it relates to
me this is the obvious stuff this is the
stuff that everyone thinks of the GDP
our even defines this stuff as being
personal data this is the critical stuff
the sensitive data this is medical
records
keeping track of all your illnesses over
the course of your life that can be
related back to you even though your
name's not really apply to it DNA it's
basically a fingerprint that relates
back to you this is also personal data
as defined by the GD P R and then there
is the less obvious stuff also defined
this IP address email addresses tracking
information like I have a badge at my
work it works with RFID the tracks
whether I open a certain door or not
when I open it this is also personal
data it can be traced back to me because
it's assigned to my name may be less
obvious is also HR information your
company for the purposes of performing
your job and getting paid check for
instance keeps information about you in
their systems stuff that's not on there
and it's a bit vague I've been looking
over the internet all over to find
whether or not it's been affected by it
or not is we're all coders here we all
have git repositories or SVN
repositories and in a commit any kid
commits and an email address is linked
to it I haven't found whether or not
that applies to it or not but I think it
does and that also has some applications
when you go further down the GDP are
when you talk many men were talking
about the rights that the data subject
has excuse me so the open source company
that's quite important to us when we get
a pool across from somebody we're
getting personal data from somebody is
willingly giving us his email address
and we store it just because we need to
store it in our git repo but that's also
something that we store then we have the
other actors and those are indicated by
processing of personal data and free
movement of such data the first one is a
data controller data controller is a
company or organization collecting data
it's as simple as that basically anyone
here working for an company works for a
data controller they cook they collect
information on you and a data control
can also be a website that tracks your
movement that
keeps like a mailing list available
that's also data control a data
processor is a company that processes
that data on behalf of the data
controller think of companies like or
tools like Dynamics CRM instances
marketing tools that based on your
browsing behavior on a website assign a
number to you if the number is high or a
hot lead if not then you're not
interesting or interested in the product
at least so that's a data processor
these are the other two actors that
should be careful when implementing the
gdpr
so what big fuss is mainly about this
who does the gdpr effect as the text
outlines it's on the protection of
natural persons natural persons being EU
citizens any company targeting EBU
citizens be it for marketing purposes
sales purposes is affected by this
regardless of where the company is
located so doesn't matter if you're an
American company in African company if
you're targeting EU citizens then you
have to follow or we have to comply to
the GDP our rules the last line is
pretty central to the let's say DV the
theme of the GDP are the focus is on the
citizen not on the company and then the
last big part is the director of a
directive of 1995 there used to be
implemented in 1995 there wasn't data
directive it's called data directive I
think of 95 yeah very easy to remember
it was already pretty progressive and in
many ways the gdpr resembles that
directive but it has been implemented in
95 it was outdated because in 95 the
internet wasn't what it is today and we
cannot imagine how an internet then
looked right now but so the GPRS
replacement of that directive with new
technology and new actors in line
because data processors didn't really
exist at the time think of a Google of
of Microsoft etc those didn't really
different as big as ever today and then
the last let's say big definitional gdb
are things that define GDP R is a time
frame it's been let's say made public at
2016 April 2016 but the enforcement only
starts in May 2000 18 so companies had
two years time to prepare or to set up
an action plan to be compliant to the GD
P R and starting from that date the EU
will start enforcing the GD P R I'm not
really sure how they will enforce it
they have one big let's say stick behind
the door and that is fines if you google
GD P R then the first thing you'll see
it's a very hot topic the first five six
entries that you get back are just adds
of consultancy companies of legal
companies trying to make you afraid of
the fines so every time I write an
article I read up to X million euros or
X percentage of global revenue and I put
X there because that number was
constantly increasing depending on where
I read the article at one point I
expected the percentage to go above 100%
so technically this is true this isn't
GDP our text but throughout my research
I came across like this this goodwill of
the EU and they will not hand this out
building nearly as I say so as long as
you can prove that you're making
progress that you're trying to be
compliant the EU will be mild
of course I refer back to my disclaimer
this is my opinion this is my
interpretation don't take this as a
truth but this is my feeling that I have
from this one quote that sticks with me
from an interview with EU parliament
member is this won't be the carrot not
the stick I like that very much
so um the fines they are there they are
there for the like the extreme cases of
abuse of non-compliance don't be afraid
of the fines look at the future try to
move ahead and the fines are there for
the people who are really stubborn for
the companies who are really stubborn
and don't want
move forward so now that we've got the
basic definition out of the way let's
continue with the collection of data
there are some rules for collection
they're not limited to these but these
are the ones that I think are more
important so you need to state intent
there needs to be a clear goal etc the
duration also needs to be as limited as
possible to ensure that everything can
be kept safe and secure the next thing
is actually the bigger one consent I
think we've all come across the website
and we've entered our personal data and
then we had to agree to the terms of
agreement and at the bottom there's
always a pre checked field that says I
want to be part of your mailing list I
agree to these terms and serve of
services that that's not allowed anymore
you cannot give your consent without not
explicitly and you have to make the
physical act of clicking that button of
saying yes I agree to to give consent so
this is something that we all can change
right now in our own web applications
this is something that we can do right
now to be compliant it's it's a minor
change of course management might not
like its mark they might not like it but
it's a very easy change to do and the
more important part is without consent
you're not allowed to collect data and
even more important the consent can be
withdrawn at any point in time
so that gives the EU citizen a lot more
power in its relationship to the to
their companies another cool aspect I
think is the the effect that a website
or an application cannot deny you access
if the data subject doesn't consent so
if the data is not necessary to operate
maybe let's take a look at Facebook it's
it's a very good example because of just
the nature of face because and what they
do so I tried looking myself up where
I'm not being logged in and this is how
it shouldn't be this is also how it
isn't but this is how it shouldn't be
like you don't need to be a member of
Facebook to see whether or not I am a
member if I allow it to be found on
public searches this is how it isn't so
Facebook is doing this correctly there
are showing my results if you look me up
and well not logged in I and there are
more Michaels but I blocked out the
second one they want to leak out
information yeah but this data is not
necessary for the up for the you don't
need the data subjects consent to to
have this functionality in Facebook if
you want to see my wall if you want to
see my friends walls then you need to be
a member
that's logical because you need to be a
friend of me and mine and then you need
to have my consent and cetera so this is
a correct implementation of the gdpr
actually that's pretty good ok then this
is also a very very health topic and
when you read about it and online the
rights are the data subject the gdpr
outlines a few basic rights that you'll
think that is very basic to anyone and
but it's actually amazing that people
are really thrown off by by a few of
these rights so um let's take a look at
the first one access everyone should be
able to freely access their data that
any company has on them
the GPR also specifies that there should
that that it would be ideal if the
industry would come together to make a
reusable format and to agree upon a
shared format but I think we already
have those formats and Jason or XML so I
think for safe there this is again going
back to the Facebook example you can go
to facebook.com you can log in and then
ask Facebook to get your and user data
from them and they will provide you with
everything they have on you you can ask
them to print it out I think there was
like this trolling campaign a few years
ago where the people was just asked
Facebook to print out their data but
yeah that's not I know young too much
they're just complying to the rules
updating this is another obvious one LT
does subjects should be able to update
their personal data this is actually
something that companies want I think
they want to have your most up-to-date
information there's something that you
want so this is nothing but benefits for
both parties so this is not an issue
it's the it's this one that's providing
to be an issue
deletion it's not that the fuss about
deletion is not about having to delete
the data it's about how vague the
definition of a data of personal data
really is that makes it so that
companies are hesitant to talk about
this or talk like really in detail about
this so you should be able to request
the deletion of your data in very very
specific cases they can deny your
request but it has to do with public
interests the public order and stuff
like that but it's really really really
rare grabbing back to my Facebook
example this is something I don't know
how to do it right now but it's
something that they used to have a
problem with if you delete use if you do
it your own account of Facebook it yeah
you know it's it's only a flag that's
being set that you're inactive your
account is still online it's still in
the databases
you're still there if you make your
account if reactive again then
everything is still there that's a nice
user experience feature by Facebook but
it's not really compliant but with the
GDP are not on this slide is also the
fact that you'll need to be you'll need
to guarantee to the user to the data
subject that your data has been deleted
it's a bit tricky to give like actual
hard proof but you're asked to do it
anyway
but this this has some fake implications
as well for instance let's assume that
my brother isn't on Facebook and he was
present during my wedding of course
and I upload a photograph of my brother
is that data related to my brother or is
it related to meat or both of us what
happens if my brother while not being a
member of Facebook asks to delete that
data Facebook might not know who my
brother is
by name but they can the facial
recognition technology is far enough to
at least know that were related to some
degree because he's in a lot of pictures
of mine how far can the because for the
lesions go because the data on my
brother has been collected another vague
use case that I haven't been able to
find anything on online is just assume
that you've been sending me emails and
context of a text we've been talking
licenses and we come to agreement you
buy our license you buy our product and
then a few years down the line and you
quit your job it change companies but
you ask your previous company to delete
all your data and then you ask us to
delete everything we have on you as well
should I delete my emails it's a bit
tricky I haven't been able to find
anything anything everything like Google
turns up just to be like this this
complaining of marketeers that they
won't be sending out they won't be able
to send out mass emails again which is I
think a benefit okay anyway as mentioned
TDD the definition of a personal data is
so vague at some points yet another
point it's very specifically the even
mentions DNA in the text so it's it it's
a bit of a mess sometimes and that's
where all the controversy lies it's it's
sometimes not well defined another lot
of times it's well defined and then
coupled with the the high fines that may
or may not be applied to you that's yeah
you can see that's a breeding ground for
for yeah mass hysteria
and this also ties into the right to be
forgotten it's a very nice catchphrase
it sells let's say articles as you might
remember there were some court case a
few years ago against Google that some
people wanted to be forgotten they want
to have some articles written about them
removed there was this guy who
ironically that I'm talking about him
now but he wanted to have an article
written about him that he couldn't make
his down payments on his house removed
from Google and Google had to comply
with that so that's basically the reason
why you at every Google search you now
see this at the bottom so this doesn't
mean that anything has been removed
they're just covering themselves with a
blanket statement so action plan s
mentioned I'm not a lawyer as you might
have guessed by everything that I've
said the gdpr is quite vague it's quite
general an action plan it's so specific
to each company that you'll have to look
at your own company and then talk to
everyone involved and but here are some
guidelines that you can follow that that
you can talk to with your management
with your other colleagues whatever so
um the main takeaway from the from the
GPR is designed by privacy so when we
design new applications we always think
about the the stack that we'll be using
how much money we'll throw against the
project and etc but and the EU wants us
as a technology industry to also include
privacy into our design processes that
might sound a bit fake it is it's up to
us to define this actually but let's try
to come to a general set of steps so
first things first
talk to your management if of course you
can't make as a developer if you have
upper management and and and layers of
management above you this is not a
decision that you can make
that doesn't mean that you cannot
influence the the action process so talk
to your management make sure that they
are aware of this they might already be
they might already be a plan of action
and if they're not you're scoring points
both positive and negative positive
because you're thinking outside of the
technology field you're looking at the
legal field you're trying to save the
company a lot of effort a lot of money a
lot of hassle also negative points
because you're giving them a lot of work
or making them aware that they have a
lot of work so um
take that does it make but talk to
management first if you don't have the
decision power then the next step is
list everything that you collect on
anyone like every database that you have
every cookie that you keep every every
everything on anyone ever listed like
what you capture why do you capture it
is it really necessary to capture that
to make your process run and to keep
your functionality running where is it
stored how is it stored what's the
security that I that you're using how
long is it stored can people the leader
data can they access it like basically
just a checklist of everything that
you'll be doing that you're doing with
data this is a very arduous task a lot
of efforts goes into this task I know um
we've been doing it ourselves it's it's
a lot of work and a lot of things you'll
find a lot of things you stumble on a
lot of things that you won't even have
thought of before like the git repo
stuff is something that I only recently
thought of but it's it's it's so small
it's so let's say stupid but it's it's
personal data that you're collecting so
collect everything that you have that
you own your own project on your own
applications this also includes HR stuff
by the way and like even on devoxx if
you go to a booth and they scan you
that's collecting information of course
then the next step check the tools that
you use like if you work for a bigger
company then we'll have a CRM you have
an ERP system and
those also have sensitive data sensitive
data being the the personal data this
data subjects check those you don't need
to make sure that they comply I don't
need to tell them to be compliant just
know whether they're compliant or not
and then take actions from there like
your marketing tools are they compliant
aren't they compliant it's very
important so these are usually
externally developed or hosted and
doesn't mean that you're free to just
say I don't care you have to know
whether or not you are compliant okay
then as we all know recently there have
been a lot of data breaches security
breaches a lot of companies have been
hacked data has been leaked personal
date has been leaked just recently in
the u.s. personal data of millions
hundreds of millions of American
citizens has been leaked has been hacked
so um I'm not saying that you can
prevent every breach but what you do
need to have is a breach policy like
what do you do when a breach has been
detected how do you detect breaches who
do you contact
what's the severity of the breach etc
these are all quite these aren't like
technical questions but these are
procedural questions like do we have a
procedure in place today to detect
breaches this is a pretty open question
actually this is not something that I
can help you because this is your your
own company's implementation okay and
then measurements it's a very brief list
I I know um but it's it's so hard to
come up with like real real real
concrete steps that any developer can
take so um the most obvious one is to
anonymize your data is that if that's
possible do that um if it's not possible
the gdpr text also talks about Sudan
amaizing your personal data storage and
that means that you
actually extract the personal data from
the functional data that you're using
and in in your application and the user
becomes an abstract ID like a number a
random string of characters and there is
a link between them but you keep it
separate
for instance you keep the actual
personal data separate and then the
synonymous data in your another database
is something and you encrypt the former
but not of that or but you should
encrypt it a lot about you know what I
mean encryption is very important of
course I hope everyone is already
encrypting his data if not see me after
and we'll talk so we take as many
precautions as possible and storing data
of course you don't need to go too
overboard with it that you're it's not
getting feasible anymore to work
properly with your data but it should be
encrypted this is something that we
should be doing right now
and and the last one is already
implement or prepare think of ways to do
guarantee that data subjects can
exercise their rights these are the
rights that I was talking about earlier
like accessing rights updating and
deletion these might not be present in
your in your applications but these
don't need to be in your application
that just need to be a formal process of
allowing the user to exercise his rights
like that there should be a formal
process that the user can identify
himself and then that he can get his
data that he can update as data and if
not then you're not being fully
compliant let's say um okay
yeah I went a bit too fast because my
nerves I apologize I I said everything I
had to say so I'm very happy with it so
let me just summarize real briefly so
the summary is the focus is on the EU
citizen on the data subject it requires
a change of mentality not only in the
developers but also in the management
side of things and basically it boils
down to using common sense when you
design an application look at just place
yourself in the data subjects position
like do I want this company to store my
information do I would I like that with
how would I want a company to handle on
that information just use common sense
the EU is quite of these two my feeling
is quite liberal on that enable try to
if they see that you're trying to be
compliant and they will be happy I think
so the intent and actions are the key
factor it's better to do something than
to do nothing even if that something
doesn't lead to full compliance see and
it's hard to be fully compliant because
it's so hard to to just figure out what
the full compliance e is so um that's
the key factors so yeah I do apologize
for being a bit too quick because of my
nerves but I thank you a lot for being
here and if there's any questions I'll
be happy to take them now or after after
my talk thank you
any questions yeah you sir oh that's
that's my feeling I haven't found
anything that discusses this topic so so
sorry the question was um I was talking
about the 'get history stuff the git
repo and if the name or email address
might be an issue
I haven't found anything like
sustainable substantial about this on
the internet but according to my gut
feeling it's personal data that we
collect on open-source contributors for
instance so I do think that it is
personal data that is affected by this
regulation how to solve that I don't
know yet it's going to be hard to just
go back and edit the kinda commits
author of every commit to run a filter
branch on that I'm not sure how to
tackle that but yeah that's something to
discuss with a lawyer I'd say but
according to my feeling it does affect
it's there's a fact about GPR yeah yes
sir IP addresses yeah so the text does
include it doesn't mention IP addresses
I didn't write that text I did write my
slides but it's just a common
combination of the stuff and although
it's not a like a hard link to some
people because I piece can be dynamic
but it is included in the text so um I'm
not sure what you want me to answer
about it so it's it is personal data
actually um okay sorry okay thank you
anyone else yeah maybe you there yeah so
the government's no no so the question
was how does this affect the
government's how does it affect the
institutions and of course there are
special exemptions for the government as
you mentioned yourself you cannot ask
the the the text collecting of office to
just hey could you forget my name please
I don't want to pay my taxes yeah it
doesn't work like that
the government and its agencies like
police enforcement national security tax
collection etc they all have special
exemptions so it's big thing the
government is exempt from collecting
from being compliant to this of course
they have their own regulations on how
to store it and what to do with it but
they are accept exempt from the GPR to a
certain extent yeah I'm not familiar
with the privacy shield so I don't know
because I didn't know what to privacy
shield was in detail so I can't answer
that question but to just pull the line
a bit further and we have a public
github repo and we think that the public
rest at least with our internal gets
repo which is the same just a mirror we
can develop internally first and every
push to github so for us and this is
also included in our internal stuff so
it's not only github but there's also
repo
um it's it's also reflects - - you've
been based get repo servers not only get
that because it's based in the US
yeah I'll just walk all the way over
there yeah
yeah so the question was how does
so I mentioned DNA how does fingerprints
relate to death yeah
fingerprints are also identifiable to a
person so they also follow underneath
the GPR of course I only have a limited
space on the page I don't want to
bombard everyone with too many terms too
many words so yeah fingerprints also
fall under gdpr
positional data like geospatial yeah
that's also in there that's basically
the bit that I was talking about with
the The Bachelor I have on my work for
my office that's you could also consider
that geospatial information when I open
one door my company knows that I'm at
office a if I go downstairs I hope
another door they know that on my office
is C for instance so that's also
geospatial so yeah it also falls
underneath death yeah you sir so the
question is is is it okay to remove the
names from medical records yeah that's
that's basically part of the personal
mission of the of the data so if you can
make your data in such a way that it's
not traceable back to person then it's
at least more compliant than doing
nothing but to give to be so specific I
don't know it depends also on the nature
of the medical records sometimes in
medical history of a person can be so
individual that it just traces back to a
person given the string of diseases and
then a string of operations you can you
can deduct so it's it's a bit of gray
area so that's the difficulty of the
gdpr know yeah maybe you in the white
shirt first
oh so you collect data or your company
or a company collects data on EU
citizens and they sell it to another
company or they send it to another
company that sells it oh yeah you all
fall under the GDP are you because you
collect it and then the other company
because they process it they process the
data from the ah okay yeah so um I
didn't mention it but you also you give
consensus to a company and to its
processors as well so um when I give my
data to Google for instance or another
company they also it also applies
further to to processor or software so
that would be your company let's say and
then but if I revoke my consent then
company a needs to pass that on to
Company B so it's basically a network of
constant requests it does that answer
your question
because it yeah if not come see me after
okay anyone else yeah you
yeah yeah as I said it also applies to
it's very similar to HR information so
um you guys don't know my paycheck
information that's that's good I think
but but your work for a government
agency so but as mentioned before and
that the government has special
exemptions and in order to function
correctly and without any that's a real
hassle of getting everyone's permission
consent stuff like that is falls under
that umbrella of the government is
exempt so if you work for the government
it's basically absent except but yeah
yeah there are some edge cases but I
think you fall under the exemption of
that okay yeah you sir let me just
so the question was how will the EU
check whether or not non EU companies
will be compliant and what can I do
against that and the second question was
will that not cause US companies for
instance to to reject EU citizens that
those are various concerns there are
also concerns that you'll find when
you're start researching this topic the
first one is you you might have heard it
in the news like a few I think it was
months ago
that Google was fined like a very high
fine by the EU the EU has has that power
to enforce that it don't forget that the
EU is a very big market the EU has
around as a few hundred million people
living here a very high-tech very let's
say well-off continent that we are so
any US company that wants to exclude any
EU citizen is excluding basically a huge
piece of the world huge piece of the
market just because we are unified in
the markets mixes makes it very strong
for us we have a very strong argument
for for making that point actually
so I'm sure companies can decide not to
serve any EU citizens but they can do
that before the EU about GDP are as well
did just now have it like an actual
reason to do it but I don't think that
will happen yeah you sir no that would
be I'm not really too sure about that so
the question was about what about
science contracts and I think it would
be counterintuitive to contract law if
you could just say I want my name to be
deleted from this contract because
that's a bit counterintuitive to how
contracts work so I'm not a lawyer or
anything but I think that's also one of
my first questions so yes sir yeah yes
so the question was as developer as a
support member am I allowed to see
customer information in my first line or
second line support
yeah the gdpr doesn't restrict anyone
from seeing data it just enforces
companies to have policies in place to
protect the data to make sure the data
doesn't get leaked doesn't get in public
for instance and if your company is
going to be qdp are compliant you'll
notice that they'll start looking into
DPOs Data Protection officers those are
like let's say security consultants
that's let's use that word and the EU
expects around 80,000 new jobs being
created before DPOs
so if you're interested in that that's a
nice job opportunity but you can still
see everything in your company that you
can now I will just be that there are
policies going to be set in place the
breach policies will be set in place
just mainly aside from the technical
side of things it's just procedures that
need to be set in place policies that
need to be enforced so I hope nothing
will change for a day job but I don't
think it will ok yes sir
that might that might be a problem yes
so the question was can I use production
data in in testing what yeah yeah but
I'm not fully sure but I think it is
yeah so um I don't I don't remember if
it wasn't my slides but if you if the
customer the customer if the user gives
his consent he needs to know to what he
gives his consent to so um using
production data and test environments
that might be an issue if if he didn't
give consent to it that's easily fixed
of course just ask isn't consent to yet
yeah that's also a possibility and the
relationship between the
yeah yeah it's actually very nice issue
one that I didn't think of so that's
pretty nicely the issue is using
production data and test environments
that's not allowed unless they consent
but you can anonymize or pseudonymous to
an extent that the data is not
recognizable anymore or traceable back
to person and then you can use that
because in an development environment
you want to have like actual data
production data to test on and that way
you can let's say have anonymous data
that's that was your pointer right yeah
I think that that's how it should be
it's also a lot easier to ask it yeah I
was just going to say that it's a lot
easier and a lot cost more more
cost-effective to just ask consent for
it for that no no no as mentioned um
have you ever had for instance the
medical records that the other sir just
asked if you just remove the name you
can still trace back to a person based
on some key factors in the data so
anonymizing is good and all but it's not
the final and final means to your ends
so um there's a lot of things that
you'll need to talk about it's it's your
team and with your managers actually and
your legal team if you have one okay
so how is the analysis on big data
effective that's your question that's
basically the same question as before
right just a different context No
so um the previous question was and can
I use production data and test
environments and your so it's basically
a deflection from your consent that
you've given you've been received and
it's basically the same now it's just
you're using the big data that you
collected then you try to analyze it and
I think that's that's let's say easily
solved but by just making sure that you
specify correctly what you want to do
with the data and that the customer or
the user knows what you're trying to do
and get consent for that
it's basically transparency you want to
be as transparent as possible the EU
wants you to be transparent about what
you do with data that's basically my
feeling as well that I get from it no I
know I know okay anyone else yeah yes
sir how are you sir yeah
as long as it's necessary so the
question was are there any it's very flu
but I'll repeat the question first so
are there any time constraints on
collection storage of data yeah your
remark was yeah I don't know them by
heart as well but then they're they are
defined in the text and it's basically
short it's very short</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
