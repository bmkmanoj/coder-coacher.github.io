to admit that I'm a bit confused right
now because not only because I'm French
and being surrounded by so many Brits
it's very unnatural for me that alle bit
yeah
I'm a bit confused because when the dear
people of devoxx invited me they said
hey come to the box it would be fun you
see and i said yeah why not but what he
devoxx actually and said oh you know
it's a huge conference with a lot of
developers almost all the Java
developers will be here so I was pretty
happy because I like talking in small
rooms in front of three or four people
and they said well then might be a
little bit more than that and of course
I laughed because I was thinking of all
the Java developers and I said you know
we are in 2017 so nobody does Java
anymore and in fact they were true so
I'm a bit confused because I had
prepared a very good talk about all my
best Java jokes and clearly you are not
ready for this so let's talk about
something else like artificial
intelligence because well artificial
intelligence is the future it's
literally changing our lives and and if
you take some domains like the
self-driving cars it's crazy the fingers
able to drive you from point A to point
B almost safely and on the way it can
make the difference between the bikes
the pedestrian or the vehicles and it's
crazy if you think about it 20 years ago
the only self-driving car you knew was
the one in Knight Rider and we are
almost there with yeah less turbo boost
and and crazier cuts but we are almost
there and it's crazy and artificial
intelligence is even changing big things
like arts I don't know if you guys as in
I've seen this painting but it's a very
interesting one because it's the last
Rembrandt painting that we have with a
tiny detail it's that it has not been
painted by Rembrandt in fact a group or
sure as built an artificial intelligence
and set it with all the things we knew
about Rembrandt's painting and once it
got ready they asked it's you draw
something nice and boom here is what
they got and it's crazy because it's
even asking interest interesting
questions like is this an original
painting of ramrods or is this a copy of
an original that from bronze had never
painted it's crazy and the robot can we
talk about the robot this little dude
has been built to lift the charges and
it can even avoid objects coming at high
velocity it's crazy and we can now build
robots that mimic human behavior this
one for example is known as the Java
developer robot don't laugh at 9:00 in
the morning it has launched maven and
now it knows that the day is completely
 up so he has to go back home it's
really what we what we can do now and
this one this one with two wheels can go
almost everywhere and more than that it
is better at skating than you and me and
it's crazy if you think about it but we
stay humans after all and as good humans
when we start tinkering on things and
discover that they are better than earth
are doing some stuff we try to remind
them that life is hard and what betters
are the good kick in the face to remind
you how how life is but don't worry they
are just machines what could what could
go wrong in such an in torturing them
anyway so
we have made a lot of progress in
various domains and the good question to
ask is what about artificial
intelligence in video games and in fact
like in every other domains we are now
at the top of our game
we are excel so we have done so many
good things in artificial intelligence
and yeah yeah well maybe not the right
example but maybe this now if you take a
newer game something with a boss
something with an enemy you will see how
wise the decision-making is well ok yeah
maybe we haven't done any progresses in
20 years in artificial intelligence in
video games but a good question to ask
is why is artificial intelligence in
games so dumb and it's a good question
because you know among developers we
have a good joke when someone makes a
bug you know he smiles and say you know
it's not a bug it's a feature and
everybody laugh and you got fired and
everybody laugh even more and but it's
interesting because in video games it's
probably the only time that this same is
true because all you have seen
previously are no bugs the artificial
intelligence has been designed like that
because it's important to understand
that in video games we are probably only
domain of all the computer science field
to use artificial intelligence that
isn't that doesn't aim to add the
perfect artificial intelligence because
we don't need perfect actually
artificial intelligence we don't want
one simply because of this because
perfect artificial intelligence is
boring really like it is just here to
remind us that we are just bags of meat
with very slow reflexes and the time we
need to only pressure button a perfect
artificial intelligence at the time to
find 250 ways to kill humanity
efficiently we don't need that you have
to understand that if you put a perfect
artificial intelligence in your game you
will bring frustration to players and
it's very not good for your business
because a frustrated player will not buy
your game he will probably say mean
things about your game on the Internet
and some moms will be insulted on
Twitter and know mums need to be
insulted because of artificial
intelligence and it's easy to understand
that with this gif even if it's
mesmerizing and you haven't even heard
what I said
about three minutes but I'd like to
video again it looks like that
so later miss shot backflip headshot
yeah nobody wants to play against that
because it's not even playing it's no
fun so it leads us to the smartness
paradox because I asked to admit that I
lied to you so remember that I'm French
so it's normal for me to lie to you but
I lied to you because yeah when we work
on on competitive games like a racing
game or our sport game we try we aim at
building a perfect artificial
intelligence and we spent months maybe
years working on that trying to make the
best day possible
and once we get it we smash it hard in
the head just to make it dumb enough to
be beatable by players because it's
easier for us to make a smart AI dumb
enough to be beatable than to make them
a I look smart and it's very peculiar
and I guess we are the only one in this
industry in the computer science field
to do that but when we talk about
artificial intelligence in game you all
think about the virtual player to
compete against or to play with but it's
not only that we usually use artificial
intelligence to simulate normal behavior
I'd like to show you a short video of a
game nobody knows something called GTA 5
where some of the non playable
characters helps with the right
simulation simulation sorry do
incredible things
maybe yeah so you have chaos with a car
in fire and the fire truck is coming and
try to extinguish the fire but you have
just enough room from the for the yellow
car to go in but now the yellow car is
spread and the driver take that as
integration so it tries to solve the
aggression that the fireman acts like a
group so let's try to solve the
aggression with a good kick in the groin
yeah and what the aggression is over
maybe they all take the extinguisher
back and finish extinguish the fire yeah
the good all routine yeah now that the
fire is over and everybody know yeah
everybody's dead
sorry so I already get back in the car
and go back to the routine and yes it
was yeah yeah so we can talk about the
violence and and we can debate about
that but it's just a video game but what
we are just watch is incredible
if you think about it nobody could have
predicted this and because we use
something called a behavior tree which
is a very simple decision-making tree we
can have something like that with the
right simulation at the right moment
with the right conditions and it's crazy
but there are also some games using
artificial intelligence differently not
as a competitive player or as a behavior
some games use artificial intelligence
at their very core and I'd like to show
you two small games made in France by
two very small teams the first one is
called gladiators large efforts in Galia
but you are in charge of a group of
cling machine and you have to program
them and to develop their artificial
intelligence to literally destroy the
your opponent's team and it's very
interesting because you know when you
think about artificial intelligence you
think that it's complicated and you have
to do a lot of math and and and good
algorithm and big algorithm and using
give your trees very simple very simply
you just have to link boxes it with
within each other you can create
artificial intelligence and once you
press play you see your little killing
machine moving and do what you said and
it's very rewarding and really it's
literally porn forward for programmers
and it's a very good game it's available
on PC Mac Linux and Android and and
please try this because it's crazy
another game even zero even zero is a
very different game because
the narrative game and you end up in
space in a space station with the sole
companion you have is called Kaizen and
it it's literally a chatbot so you can
ask everything to to Kaizen and it will
try to answer you and sometimes kills
you but you know chatbots and i'd like
to show you a very short video about
even though it's a very famous youtuber
and please look at at this face when it
discovers how different the game is I'm
getting a lot of alien isolation vibe
from this oh it's very much like it's
people at the thing kinda computer
executing charge meant identifying SH
Silent Hill please enter a new login can
I
yeah and cycling on keyboard is not easy
for everyone so living yeah okay just
tell me what the terminal is let's
accelerate yeah but you will find maybe
I don't know I suppose we do it oh oh I
could actually claim Oh jackaboy login
input successful do you want to keep
jackaboy as your new login yes oh you
use your jackaboy creating Hey
incrementing event um success and here
we are nice to meet you Jackie boy nice
to meet you too mr. robot hey let's TV's
you I can take that we will become good
friends you and I I hope so
you can talk to me in plain English
Jackie boy I am talking you in plain
English
in plain English hey jackie-boy
it's my duty to let you know how to
control things around here okay let me
have it
terrific do what like okay so how do I
control a thing if you formulate a clear
instruction I may do it for you
just try and you'll see open door you
learn fast
Jackie boy executing open door cook look
awesome oh god it's gonna get really
confusing then after a while it's like
open door execute order 66 and you're
almost done looks like we have the door
they have some of the same sounds like
Boyd and mom from grow up um where are
we you are in the airlock one that's
really cool the fact that I can actually
ask it questions because normally it's
like you type out stuff and then the
game just tells you stuff anyway and
let's get it here to not spoil all the
fun but the game is available in PC and
Mac and it's really cool because all EOS
Titan could not have been predicted and
when you will play this game you will
probably type something else and Kayson
will always react accordingly and again
sometimes kill you but it's a very good
game and I'd like to conclude with a
very short story it's a story that is
known to be fake but I chose to believe
it
because I want to believe that even then
AI from video games can teach us humans
something and it's a story that takes
place in a game called quake 3 arena
quad free arena is a competitive game
where you have to bring diplomacy using
a rocket launcher in the face of your
opponent and it's a very competitive
game it has been launched in 99 so
internet was not what it is today
so in quake 3 you can start up your own
server and play with your friends and
it's the story of a guy who has played
quick 3 during months with his friend
and forgot that he owned this server and
found it back four years later but the
beauty of quake 3 and is that when you
don't have enough human player the game
will spawn artificial intelligence to
play against them and for years for
artificial intelligence is very long so
also the artificial intelligence can
actually learn of the game so the more
they play the better they get at killing
each other and it's the story of this
guy coming four years later to see what
happened and once he logged in all the
artificial intelligence starts running
in circle around him but nobody was
firing anything and when he moved they
moved with him but nobody was firing
anything and the moment he aim and try
to shoot an artificial intelligence they
all reply instantly and kill him because
they have made war so many times that
they are discovered the best way to win
war and the best way to win war is to
not participate because because nobody
nobody dies if nobody kills thank</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
