Sabrina I'm a developer hacking on open
web technologies with an open device and
today I want you and CSS to get back
together you know because I mean I love
this language it's like I really like it
and have you ever noticed that
there's some developers we're with when
it comes to CSS it causes strange
reactions let's take a few examples so
if I take Samuel is a Java developer he
wants to learn Scala obviously so what
does it do he goes on Coursera to learn
about the latest lessons he goes on the
web doing tutorials if it's the latest
book from March another ski classic okay
so what about Scarlett Scarlett is a C++
developer she wants to build native iOS
application what does she do she reads
about stuff she she applies to a
professional training about the mobile
platform and it's languages so Objective
C and Swift so Robert hmm Roberts is on
a different path I mean he was back in
developer and recently he's been doing
more and more front-end stuff he finally
learned that javascript is a real
language I mean come on so Robert
qualifies himself at as a full-stack
developer and so what does Robert do II
watch his latest video on YouTube about
best practices but the language he goes
ready to go to the documentation of the
late
just frameworks the the trendy ones you
know what what time is it
yeah maybe there's a new one who knows
so well Bert when it comes to CSS
warbird takes the shortcut he goes is is
afflicted with a DD do you know
autocomplete driven development so if I
take some CSS so I'm just playing you
robot here so okay so this is SS it is
simple it's a designer stuff I mean why
would I read the documentation of
something that is key value pair and
that looks like JSON okay so that takes
big bleeds out obviously there's a width
hey fixed okay so ugly borders go away
nice so autocomplete okay so I want some
background crow oh okay back on crow so
I'm not a designer obviously right
textcolor textcolor textcolor zero okay
yes this is so easy okay
so recently I just introduced Robert to
this new tool which is called Emmet it's
a tool that you can install in many code
editors and IDs
and it's a shortcut system to really
write CSS and HTML more efficiently so
okay so you better me Betemit it's
pretty good so from famine is just F F
okay
maybe I could Center staff so text
edenia Center okay yes maybe a bit of
padding nice
now Robert needs to vertically Center
the block on the page what could
possibly go wrong
okay so okay I'm gonna send out Jesus
civilizing burn okay oh okay
Center mm-hmm meter yeah yes it is the
foot thing we never understand it but
wait a minute Oh No yeah sorry guys
please friends help me
can I put bootstrap in the project so
Roberts I told you CSS were the real
language you know I told you and like
anything that it's you're in your full
stack you have to learn it if you want
it to make sense it's obvious so if you
are built read the documentation of
vertical align you would have seen that
it only applies to inline elements and
table cells for example if I take this I
have some text so inline elements for
spans and if I change the CSS it will
make more sense so I can do
vertical-align:top an Iron Man and maybe
vertical-align:bottom and Captain
depends you know so you're starting to
think like okay vertical align works on
text okay but it doesn't touch the
container it's actually because there
are some borders there's some space
around it and it's normal so the box
really touches the the container and
you're like okay but the text really
doesn't fit the box
it's normal imagine you have like here
like the sending letters so it will
really go
at the bottom of the box and if you had
any uppercase accent welcome on and
windows I mean it will be also on the on
the top of the box okay
so just remove this okay so if I were to
do what I really want to do which is
doing some vertical-align:middle you
know I would just do vertical longer any
meter
oh nice this was what I wanted to do but
actually because it works only on text
if I do this okay wait a minute
it only works on the same line it's text
it's why if I add this one yeah if I add
many elements like this it will go on
several several lines and everything is
centered on its own line okay and if I
move fury on the second line the second
line will grow higher and everyone will
still be centered on it so this makes
more sense when it comes to we also
talked about float so floats were never
designed to do what we try to do with it
at first
floats were like okay we want to
reproduce this kind of you know magazine
or or newspaper article I just want to
do float:left and omit the Carter floats
on the left you can float on the right
okay this doesn't matter and is
alter-ego clear just is just here to say
okay I want to clear everything that
floats before me so like this but
because it's floating on the right it
would work like this I could even do
clear both as you know that's when
people will say okay let's use bootstrap
but when it comes to really using floats
to put stuff next to each other well
like okay so you have these boxes and I
can do fruit left hmm okay so fury is at
the left of widow but actually if I do
this fairy is above window the only
thing to remember here is that when I
float free it goes out of the flow and
every element the container itself also
displays and is painted on the screen
like fury doesn't exist so they all go
one way up and Widow is behind it so
that's when if I float this tree we're
like okay this may be good this may be
not let's do that left Oh classic
problem everyone floats so the container
is like I don't have anything to display
inside me so I am high to zero you know
that's where we invented we invented
clearfix techniques with a useless deal
that we put there and if the div clears
even if the div as a height of zero it
actually tells the container to be
designed properly so there's lots of
problems with a float if I play with the
contents like if I do this it will do
strange stuff and if I do this so if I
play on the height of iron maybe okay
maybe what I wanted to do probably not
it depends of the cases but most of the
time we we want stuff to act differently
and when I shrink the width of the box
it comes crazy I mean look at this okay
this is new okay this is why floats have
a way to to to behave and it's okay but
they were never meant to do what we do
with it so stop yelling at them
and start hitting it yourself okay so
what what we want is we want something
more flexible introducing flexbox so how
does it work if I take the same example
and I move the CSS okay
I do this mmm yummy I mean with only one
property I can display stuff next to
each other and that's only the beginning
because if I were using floats and I
want all of them to take all the space I
have to know how many elements I have if
I have five of them it's like 20% if I
for them it's 25 et cetera here in Flex
there's the parent the Flex container
and there's the items the the children
the floats the Flex items so on the
parent you always put display flex and
on the children you put something like
this oh nice
so now we can remove those so everything
is flexible you know and I can remove
other other people it will be flexible
okay so what's what comes really so
right now we should be hmm this this is
coming to be nice but I am not finished
so what is really interesting is that
they are not laid out next to each other
it's it's actually the case right now
but if I do this flex direction column
oh now they are laid out below each
other okay so this is the most powerful
stuff of flexbox and you're like yeah
but if I do this it's actually exactly
exactly the same it's like five lives
between each other you know
but if I put a height okay and I rehab
this this is nice and then if I change
the flex direction which is by default a
row I can play stuff you know I can
really change the way I want to design
them okay so let's look at flex one into
the details it's actually your shortcut
so it's like I would have written so
flex grow one flex shrink one it's not
supposed to be pixels okay and flex pays
is zero okay so actually this property
is the same as these three ones
okay so let's remove this one so we're
like okay flex grow maybe it's related
to growing shrinking shrinking okay so
if I do this it should make sense I need
to on this one so it's very really twice
the size as the others let's check so
Emmett is not only usable on CSS it's
also usable on quote on HTML so I can do
a rule or a ruler I don't remember so
we'll see with units okay this looks a
bit like a CSS selector I can do like
ten of them and put some content which
will be the number tab oh this is nice
okay and then you can go back to the CSS
and cheat a little bit okay everything
is there so now I have a room and I can
check if everything is like twice the
stuff which is not okay this is going to
be yeah so yeah so what
No I think it's so the the thing I want
to show is that flag scroll is not like
sorry
thank you yeah yeah it's the sorry it's
the units so it's this one so when your
colleagues say something listen to him
okay
so this makes sense sorry so fear is
like twice the the width of the users so
you're like okay so grow is like a
weight or something you know on a scale
but it's actually depending on basis so
the the room is like you lay out the
elements when they were like this so
without any flexible flex ring etc you
look at what's available in the
container and you distribute it
appropriately according to the the flags
glow so let's try this if everyone
doesn't have any width
okay let's smooth that okay so no wait
everyone disappeared logical so now I
need to disk
evenly distribute the remaining space
that's why everyone was like 20 20
percent of the space but if I say okay
you are 30 pixel you are 19 you're 30
okay if I have this the remaining space
is like five units and not ten so you
have to evenly distribute five units to
each of them so fury will be two widow
will be four iron will be two units and
the two others
we'll be just one growing from zero to
30 pixels so I just have to put back
flex flex screw one okay
does this make sense and so you're like
yeah but you talked about bases yeah and
wait actually it doesn't make any sense
if I change the direction because now
everything is in this sense you know
okay so if I remove this width let me go
back this okay if I remove the width and
I used them as flex versus this is now
an indicator that from the beginning
they should be 30 pixel 1930 zero zero
and then you should evenly distribute
just like I said but now it also works
when I change the direction the other
way would be to put with an eight into
in a position so it wouldn't work so if
I do this okay nice don't ask me to put
the ruler on the left on the right
please so this is starting to be nice
and actually it works the same way for
shrink so if everyone has had a basis of
100 pixels okay and if I remove this
okay so you're like hmm 300 pixels five
elements come on it's because the
default from flex flex shrink is one oh
so I'm allowing them to be shrinked to
fit in the container but if I don't
they bleed out which is normal okay
so shrink is the opposite of growth you
take what's bleeding out what's outside
of the container so this this is the
thing you will be using to Eve
only reduce any element according to the
shrink wait so if I said to I run to
other shrink of - oh it would be
shrinked twice so ask your core engage
in business it is not hot I always
missed with this yeah okay nice you see
okay okay so what's really great is that
once I'm there and remove this I have
several more powers so I can do I'll
remove this - sorry okay I can also use
a property which is called justify
content and do Center okay this is
centered on the main axis and the main
axis so remember there's two direction
so flex direction the default is row ok
but if it's column it will be centered
always on the main axis for justify
content but I just changed the direction
of the axis okay now I can do this I can
do the the little border of justify
content which is a line items Center I
just centered blocks vertically and
horizontally in CSS you can go now
so there's many many more interesting
properties so you would think that you
you could put stuff on the left on the
right but as I explained this doesn't
have any meaning once I'm doing this so
there's two properties called flex and
and flex start
so depending on whether the main axis is
this way or this way it will go there
okay so you have just by content flex
and you have so space around this is
nice space between okay I see space
around sometimes it's a bit fuzzy
because there's twice the amount of
space between them that you then you
have on the edges so could be fixed with
the padding's
another another day okay you can also
trick and say a line self yeah flex
start for example okay so now Iron Man
so remember aligned items right now is
this way because the direction is wrong
but if I say aligned self it's actually
going top only for iron or this way
what's really fun is that when you
change the direction it's not really
rotating and I at first you're like okay
this is going to do this and it's not
but if you look at it and if you look at
the properties it really make sense
you'll just have to play and play and
play with it the last thing the last
interesting interesting things to say is
if I want them to so let's put them like
this okay
if I want them to be maybe too large so
if I do this and if I do a basis that's
too large so flex pays is 100 okay
you shall not shrink okay so this is
bleeding out but I can allow them to
wrap so flex wrap wrap okay so now I can
say you're allowed to grow maybe okay
and if I planed on the basis if I'm
really small for example so if I do five
times fifty it's okay but once I reach
more they are wrapping and that's really
really nice
the problem is that if you go really far
they go this way but you're still in
Flex Direction world which is like okay
so and obviously when I change the
direction they go the other way and
again it's not a rotation this is really
really powerful stuff and we have
everything we need to do very
interesting things so I could be able to
do a more real demonstration so if I
have a container so I'm in a bit of a
hurry so container menu maybe with a I
can do this with items menu items three
of them contents menu item number okay
this is nice
main maybe with many low hem once I had
a project manager saying are you gonna
let this latin text no okay yeah
so the colors are already there now I
can play with it I can do flex display
flex on the container oh nice
there are next to each other but because
they are too big
the they are fighting to be shrinked you
know there should normally be outside of
the container and then the browser is
like okay I must shrink you too so you
just have to say I don't want the the
menu to be shrinked okay nice can add
some padding okay here to be
perfectionists sorry so here what's nice
is that now I have a a component that I
can put a width okay maybe this yeah
like this okay
and I can put a height so you're like
ooh this is strange it's because of this
so let's see the container okay
do you know overflow overflow otro hmm
this way you have a completely flexible
component if I change this the the space
the main component meditates is
completely flexible if I had for example
a language that was really longer it
wouldn't matter and I could put like a
max width so it wouldn't go crazy you
know and that's really the the power of
of CSS flexbox so the most interesting
thing and trick to do there is to change
the direction so for X Direction Karim
oh great and then I can do flex box
inside flex box so if the menu is like
display flex its item will be next to
each other and I could do justify
content space around me
nice you just need to add a few a few
media queries to be maybe it that way in
portrait and the other way in landscape
I don't know it would be on your project
so let's finish this business so with
the power of flexbox you just have to do
I mean holy grail of CSS or centering
both ways once you do display flex you
can even better even only have a better
margin photo so better means power oh
okay
this guy is nuts I really a power mod so
I hope you liked this presentation I
hope you think no I hope you think
flexbox are great like I do because they
are and I hope you master your CSS
editor too and with that I really thank
you
I have one minute for question I'll be
there all week until Friday don't
hesitate to ask me anything is there any
question right now
with ya it will actually I showed
everything with pixels and with M's and
persons it will work the same way but
you'll have to do the math on what your
aims and persons resolve to two pixels
but yes it is what I didn't show and now
I learned about it it doesn't work
everywhere I mean it would be too easy
you should use autoprefixer which is
something like I have display display
flags and maybe I would automatically
not need some prefixes you have a great
article with great you know diagrams on
CSS tricks complete guide to flexbox and
be sure to look flexbox it's a github
repo that references some bugs when you
go nuts with floats position plus flex
box etc so don't hesitate for the
question after thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
