we'll talk about a topic which is very
close to my heart is something that I
will be passionate about so I hope you
will enjoy and in case at the end that
there will be some material if you're
interested to discuss further so let's
start with the definition of legacy code
this talk will be mostly about the
legacy code
so there is a one word in our industry
at least in UK is very common I'm not
sure in other country but is the idea of
a brownfield development which is we
have to work on someone s code and all
the code and the brownfields came from
the industry in the Builder world that
means some some side that me with all
the structure that may have to be
destroyed and rebuilt again and of
course the opposite of a brownfield
development is the greenfield
development where everybody want to be
where there are just a low of a nice
green lows and smooth heals and you can
do whatever you want so what is are the
normal perception about wrongful
development and yeah everybody mostly
ate it and something that okay you have
to do to feed the family but don't ask
me to love it and so but when I was in
Japan one day I came upon this kind of
pata Heath which is where it's not the
kind of pottery but is a you finding the
pottery museum at this kintsugi
which are this spotter here with the
kind of a gold fix and a beginning when
I saw the first time I was thinking I
don't know maybe it's a kind of
decoration or whatever but actually it's
not a decoration it's been something
that has been invented in Japan because
some Emperor or some nice guy anyway
with a nice Potter he poked the Porta he
I said oh come on this was a very
precious Chinese pottery what do okay
let's go back to the Chinese to fix and
the Chinese fix was very very ugly and
the Emperor said no that's really not to
doing this we needed to find a nice way
to fix all the stuff and this is a
Japanese art basically to fix a broken
bottle using gold in the past was real
gold and the point is that at the end
the fixed pottery is better than the
original is kind of more valuable more
experienced and it give a better is kind
of more valuable object and it kind of
took me to think a bit about okay so we
have this this is kind of the the
magenta liner is the normal legacy code
where we have every new feature will
require the more and more time and money
and resources to be important done and
the blue one is a kind of mythological
fix at the cost diagram with the
emergent design where everything is
really fantastic and we are in a kind of
a great world our code is really really
nice and so we have a kind of fixed cost
for feature so even after years we can
add a new feature more or less in the
same time in the same cost that
the beginning of the project so what I'm
thinking is okay maybe maybe just maybe
we can switch from one kind of the other
without static from zero but okay let's
see why people really eight legacy code
the first legacy system in general could
be most of this talk actually apart from
the technical side at the end we'll be
valid for general system not only
software but so we have yeah this is a
we founded as squirrel family inside our
production service and basically they
are the only one that know how to works
which is more or less a bit less funny
but what's happening in all big
organization some piece of code that
will in a body want to look at and there
are kind of becoming very expensive to
run a maintained and sometimes it's
expensive not to money but in a whisker
because if this goes down it could
really takes a long time because nobody
so this is one problem of a legacy
another problem of legacy the technical
that maybe you know about the technical
data idea is that you can write a great
code that will be no debt or you have a
quite canned crappy code that probably
will require you in the future to fix it
again so it's kind of yeah you can go it
away now but you will be adapt that you
have to pay someone in the future but
what's happen if at the depth that goes
up and up and up at some point that you
really have a floor closure I mean you
cannot send the depth anymore and this
is kind of defining with that legacy
system and this is a kind of a funny
description about the mega maybe the
legacy system was not such a better than
the beginning but nobody really talked
very well at the beginning and they just
keep adding load and load to the poor
texture and at the end it's kind of
risky there could be some kind of
technical solution which are not so
smart as they seems at the beginning and
yeah I mean I don't know how they took
this picture I hope it's a fake because
otherwise I will probably not be in that
pool but sometimes working in legacy
system you know you gotta sign into a
project and then when you realize the
project you are feeling like being in
that pool say okay I want to go out
please let me change the project very
quickly and then there is another
problem that every time something goes
bad then standard to go by them bad
again because of the call so-called
lower broken windows so I don't know if
you don't know about the idea is that
you have a nice house and nobody's
living but it's still okay then some mom
someone broke her windows and this is
not a big deal just a broken windows but
when other people say that the one
windows is broken they start ok nobody
care so I can work with the others and
then very quickly all the windows got
broken and this small as in the same in
the code I mean until the code is kind
of a nice code I mean maybe okay but
then someone commits some very bad stuff
up to just make it job done then we have
it to work again you see that crappy
code they say well if you voted this
copy code that my fixer doesn't have it
to be better than this and so crappy
goes on and then yeah the continued
status residency I mean I'm being
supported well basically every single
week there was a big a man just calling
people in the night scanning to the top
as a staffer and that was completely
avoidable it was not a specially complex
project was just the very bad state
where he was and at the end maybe you
wanted to retire say okay let's forget
about let's let's
let's remove this from the system
because we have it a new one well yeah
but we really don't know who is using it
because there are so many possible
connection and maybe someone who wanted
to use this once in a month once in a
year and it's very critical so who knows
who who who is going to take the
decision to switch off yeah maybe that
baby just left it so this is a more or
less City usual I mean this was at the
problem and then let's see what is the
usual solution but actually before going
that just does someone of your work with
the legacy system okay yeah yeah just
yeah they got the public and how many of
you loves to work with the legacy system
okay yeah that's a good stuff
so okay we have the legacy system so
what we want to do the usual solution
forget it let's write again and manager
loves to the solution because means
budget they have they can make a kind of
impactor they can make a very nice slide
they can help desk area and developers
loves it because of course they can put
any kind of hyper framework library that
they just read about and that they
really really wanted to share to use and
put in their CV so yeah everybody's very
very happy so you know shiny and but is
really better because it's not that mess
sometimes some technology are not really
I mean just because something you can do
something doesn't really means that you
have it to do something just because
it's you know I mean before this is
there was a very good talk about the
Apache spark which is a fantastic tool
that we are using and my job but since
we are using the job but we're also
using for some stuff that really really
didn't make any
apache spark just because you could have
done with this simple but much simpler
solution but you know it's in you and
people want to use and then what's
happened okay let's say we wanted to do
the new stuff and yeah we are we've
happy so why not that in just a few out
you I mean who who will notice I mean
why not that will be better in this life
so you know it's just we've just seen
that you wanted to rewrite a lot of
people came to you say ah just we are
right and there is a this list a little
list and then when you start to be
writing up you know you can a is
specially beginning you revise something
and there you put okay this is a
temporary solution but don't worry let's
just put the for a moment but then
someone forgot it about and then we have
to work in you know I'm not is not I
know that the new avoid left completely
unfinished I mean and I also work in a
project with the the new invited was
left unfinished because it was at the
mall esterday half the development cycle
was completely clear that it wasn't
going to met the requirements so they
started a new a new requirement and also
that one after a couple of years left
are finished so they are still using the
original system that was the six years
ago and nobody is fixing and the last
time that I heard that they were
starting a new completely new system and
this is the kind of a stuck in the
middle risk so okay you bet in
everything on the news system and what
if the new system is not the living and
that the old one is still going was
because nobody is knowing about maybe
you file the people who work on that or
maybe the people left you know so there
is a lot of actually eating cost right
Costa which are not really easily
accepted when we
talk about right everybody wanted to say
that let's right so let's forget about
what one typical figures that since you
were able to work in two right in the
first place
you kind of think that is easy because
we have a kind of success bias so it
works on I mean this those stupid guys
who what that is crappy code were able
to do so it will be much better so this
is not it but there is a lot of
knowledge in the Cohen code and there's
something yeah they could be copy but
there's a lot of knowledge condense and
int and discover all this knowledge can
be very costly and then also the data me
question at the end
I mean data migration is really a
nightmare for any kind of a project but
when you do a bigger white that can be
really really something that can kill
the project if it's not possible to move
migrated the actual data you have to
consider to live at the project because
you cannot go so this talk will be about
a different approach let's change our
point of view
- toast repair which is quite famous guy
I think have this very nice quote legacy
code often differ from suggested
alternative by actually working and
scaling and yeah let's think about I
mean let's this think I start thinking
about how is it so bad the code or just
that do we like just to complain about
and yeah the defender have Boy Scouts so
I say you have they always to live they
would a better place what I mean here is
that sometimes the problem with the
legacy code is maybe not sometimes maybe
all the times the probably with the
legacy what really makes very
frustrating working with the legacy code
it's not much that the code is terrible
but the fact that you cannot change it
so being in bed
environment is bad enough but being
embedded moment and not to be able to to
change it's really really frustrating
but if you have that power if you can
change then the bad environment became a
kind of challenge and you can have a
kind of a Boy Scout but to find a way
out of the of the mass we needed to find
the root and the idea of this talk is
that you can basically improve the
current legacy called legacy system
without having to do a bigger void but
to do that you needed to find the order
to plan something not that just happen
you really to study about and there you
have to plan for some milestones and you
have to make sure that this those
milestone can deliver some value and
they can be stable in the self
so you it cannot be something that you
really have to do everything to make it
work but something like the Boy Scout
that you can do something improve and
then maybe next year do another start
and that must be solved one problem
because you can do something was but you
really wanted to to deliver some value
today of course there is a catch and the
catches that is not easy and it's not
straight a-apparently on the paper it
total Havarti is faster so you can say
okay we can rewrite this in six month
one year two years if we do one step by
step a probably it took like two years
but the following is that yeah in the
worst case scenario but you are really
risking a lot you are betting a lot on
that instead if you choose the safe hope
that maybe me not the fastest water can
be a bit convoluted but at the end you
really lower the safe deep the risk
so just as an example something that
someone will probably think about now
this we need a new beaker right so we
have a a client-server application
monolithic using our color written in C
sharp and we wanted to switch something
like html5 with the rest API that works
on Cassandra oh you can do that you
cannot do that so let's do a write but
it's not really so what you can do is
something like okay for example we can
one solution we can concentrate on the
front end and we can change the current
application to work as a back-end so we
are the kind of REST API interface to
the current client server application
and we use that application as a
back-end for a new front-end that we are
writing from scratch in that way we can
completely concentrate on the front-end
side having they were back-end working
because it's the old one that is a
consistent and aware show and then when
the front-end is finish we can started
with the opposite and we stand started
to for example remove some feature from
the old one and start overwriting the
new back-end and start having the new
front-end start using some feature found
in your back-end or from the old one I
mean it's not easy but it can be done
and the same if you have a monolithic
application and you wanted to have a
kind of microservice architecture you
take the monolithic sand you start
cutting off some functionality and put
in some containers and you can redo with
other other languages you can do
whatever you want but it is that steps
baby steps two weeks deliver some value
and even if a probability the
intermediate system is a bit more
complicated if probably always have some
some advantage because the new stuff
hopefully will be better or more precise
or far
they're almost edible than the old one
okay so this is a kind of a beaker have
to split the beaker right
but this is also another alternative
which is a Dakota rejuvenation and this
is when we don't have it to do such a
big change or maybe one of this change
it was just let's look inside one of a
change and basically this is that okay
we have a very bad Java code and we
wanted to go to very good Java code and
to do this we kind of a factoring but in
a kind of strict sense a factor is not
the right word because of a factoring
means that how stop explain in this
paper exactly keep at the same behavior
instead in we don't wanted to keep all
the behavior I mean we wanted to get rid
of the bugs for example and maybe we
wanted to do some improvement in the
meanwhile so it's coda rejuvenation is a
better world so the idea is it's okay to
do progressive right it's okay to do
Quadra termination it's definitely not
okay to do totally right and it's not
okay to keep in doing this kind of Dutch
tip fix it when you just fix small
things just to make a stuff work so okay
if we on this let's see how when we do
one or the other I want to have right I
want to rejuvenate so called the
rejuvenator is a kind of so if we can
keep at the same code that just improve
decoder will be much safer so if it's
something that we can reuse is
definitely a very big things if it's a
risk for the business also is a very
good thing to keep their his case low as
possible and how often does have it to
change it because yeah if it's changed
very very often we probably I mean we
are to consider that there can be both
one flicker part is that are we
understanding the problem better now
because as sometimes
yeah we wanted to have right and we do
some estimation but really not 100% sure
what the old system that in that case it
really is not a good idea to do a right
another question is I will better
programmer that the guy who voted stuff
first
I mean maybe yes maybe this stuff was
written by some external agency that was
very bad for some reason or the other
but maybe not maybe small Isis where
same guy is so why we think that we can
do better the second time because usual
is not and it can be done quickly
because yeah you can do the the right is
faster even if it's progressive so we
can do right in a 2-3 weeks
yeah probably is a good idea if it's
something that takes six month I would
say no because it's never six month it
would be much longer so this is the kind
of discussion that I have a with some
people doing after doing this talk or
the kind of workshop and some people say
yeah our legacy code is terrible but is
really critical for the business and say
yeah but you know you you can rejuvenate
it you can keep improving what is
working on and say yeah yeah yeah we
know and we know about I can show you
how we absolutely know how to data is
not that so you we start to rejuvenate
our code is completely impossible to
change now the point of this talk is
that I don't think that this one I mean
you really have to take a D they had the
pill oh no the blue pill and started
looking and it's it's really possible to
change the code if you really want to
and it's not even so expensive okay
let's go a bit on technical side the
talk started so a bit of antipas typical
antipatterns on on legacy code
when one is color stovepipes this is
just a bit of a terminology if you know
about the stuff pipes means that you
have a discord with monolithic
application where there are some stuff
that are almost I mean 90% identical in
four different flows but completely
duplicated another is called a lava flow
because you know like after a volcano
then at some point someone thought that
using JSON was a very smart at the end
and say no now we are using Yamla for
configuration and someone say and now we
want to use this had a new stuff and it
has some part of the code that are still
relying on Jason's a pattern Yamla stuff
like that and the coldest still the
layer after layer then there is the
classical spaghetti where you have some
bunch of code all the classes that are
using other classes and this absolutely
impossible to disentangle because - you
try to touch as the panacea everything
eyes and yeah the last but not least
they got class when you have a nice
glass with like 10,000 lines of code
20,000 or so cold that really really do
a lot of things and nobody really knows
why or what was supposed to do and you
cannot really split it's like having
spaghetti all together and you can see
okay you know we are clink oh that TDD
solid principle yeah let's do that but
there is a catch I don't know how many
oh you know the expression catch-22 and
by the way is very good novel if you
have a sometime but the novel is about a
pilot that was a he didn't wanted to fly
on the bombing airplanes and so it was
if you are crazy you you can basically
cut attempted to fly but if you don't
want it to fly you are not crazy by
definition
it's very hard to be poor crazy and here
in our profession the idea is that okay
I want to do a factor but all they're a
factor in books told me yeah before
starting a factor you need a unit test
and they say yeah but I need to write a
unit test and it's a factor because at
the moment I cannot really refer to
anything it's like kind of a catch-22
and then this is a kind of my idea my
purpose and is about Alcala alchemical
rejuvenation and the idea is for him
it's very simple at the end something
that I did modern ones and so you take
your application you seal everything
with external test then you split your
application modules and then you clean
up adjust the module that you have to
work with and then once it's clean you
can write unit tests to keep it clean
and then if it's needed you can switch
to other module and I could dispose a
ceramic rejuvenation and it's the reason
why it was alchemy alchemy was because I
was reading this book when I was
thinking these things and this is a
really good book about alchemy and
nothing about programming but the idea
is that we are kind of seeing Hulka me
as a kind of you know mumbo-jumbo kind
of tweak stuff but in in the beginning
in the middle age acne was really top
notch chemical and the scientific
foundation of alchemy was actually
pretty good for their knowledge and
basically they said that there are kind
of a principle inside the matter so
there is the metal principle and the
ground principle you can mix and split
it was a and there has a lot of
experience experiment that was proving
the lows so at the end of the beginning
was very very sign so then when they
became a kind of freak
stuff stuff like that do you heal
chemical I mean good the scientists they
started saying that alchemy is a bit of
a tainted the name so let's just drop
the the beginning aisle and just call
the chemistry that his sons better and
that just differentiate but the
beginning alchemy has a decide yet to
build basically to purify and when you
take a metal and you purified it
completely basically you go to the gold
so to how to do this step zero first of
all always forgettin in here simplified
your body so you have a big project
usually the onboarding is a nightmare
so first step is 0 is some simplify your
own body you can use a variant a you can
use docker you can use a script and
Sybil whatever but you should have a
solution where someone new came in the
project in a few hours is able to write
the code in deposit because otherwise
there are so many things that nobody
really document how to write stuff so
just the embody on the project miss very
long and this is really really a problem
for all the other stuff so second step
let's wrap it with the test and notice
that when we wanted to wrap something
with tester for this purpose we want to
test all in all because we cannot really
split and we really don't know about I
mean it's not given that the tester are
something like a dear Septon test
because sometimes you have just an input
and output and the input that output are
really not they are not really this case
they are not really readable human
readable I mean so it's something that
just prove you that the system is
working but the problem is not much it's
not a use case they say but they still
proving that this is so this test can be
different from the normal test but it's
very important that you have and also
notice one thing once you did that the
disturb Z huh the onboarding then you do
this stuff you kind of spend the time
but we are not just wasting time because
you're actually creating something from
the project that is useful regardless
even if you don't do all the next steps
you still have a project that before
nobody really knows how to touch now you
have a some easy setup is the
configuration and you have some tests
that you can anyway even if you don't
want to do any kind of a fight and keep
going with the terrible fix you stick at
some test that you can use so it's it's
actually a value for their company it's
not just then if you do this you have a
to splitting modules and when you split
module remember to split vertically not
horizontally and when I mean vertically
mean you have to split module for
feature not module for layer so having
like you eye level middle layer and
persistence layer is very bad idea how
to split in modules because we want
independent modules and then you have a
yeah your spaghetti code to work with
that you can enjoy at the end everything
is Italian tested s so we have our nice
module and we can started with the next
one and so this is a very quick visual
recipe we start with the spaghetti place
we put the tests around and then we
start clipping a clip in this kind of
and let's do a bit of technical some
Java example the first of things is Pat
easy very very easy but is quite
important is get with double sink Latin
because sink return are really a
nightmare when we want to do the split
of the modules later and I want to go
very deep now but the idea is that most
of the singletons are
it a stateless of stateful and the
stateful singleton or something like
sessions cash or stuff like that
and the other kind of more difficult to
remove and what we can do we can
basically put them in a kind of service
locator so at least we had us all the
singlet onto one single single term
which is the service locator itself all
the other single atoms that we have a
usually a lot of singlet and in legacy
code that we are not really
they are stateless so they are quite
they are not very hard to to remover but
I mean the singlet uh make it
complicated so we can usually just
instantiate that in a different way for
example D D controller or stuff like
that basically we wanted to instance it
to a higher level and then use a
dependency injection instead of just
having a single no this is was
practicing so the second idea is that
this automatic sale and then here the
things now notice that when we did I
will speak a bit about this kind of four
techniques this techniques are kind of
meant to be without unit tests because
we are still in the phase where we don't
we cannot use unit tests the idea of
this technique that is very very
mechanical stuff that you do to decoder
without the time to improve the code or
make it much because you really wanted
to keep it a change at the minimum and
we only have this kind of external text
anyway but that usually a slower so it's
something that you really wanted to run
once twice in a day and you want to be
so how to split the decoder into modules
basically the idea is that
let's introduce an interface let's use
this interface as a kind of facade
pattern and then put everything that we
wanted to to put in another module
behind the interface and this can be
done basically just using
of IntelliJ a factoring tools away
almost you have it a finca beta before
but you really almost not need not to do
any kind of dirty stuff and this
everything should stay reasonably
comparable and work so we have an
example here which is almost identical
to production one I mean I simplified
the bus it's quite really terrible and
so the ideas that we wanted to work on a
specific model but this module is using
these two things called connection and
config manager that came from well
that's something that we don't really
want to touch and so we wanted to make
sure that everything that related to
connection and configure manager doesn't
go inside our module so how we can cut
this so the first step one basically is
defined this interface which is this
data context in the top and let's
basically put in the test FS the stuff
that we need and then we'll change we
all know him we try not to change our
code and we just created this interface
and we put this just stuff that we
needed before so so far so good and then
we can well basically when we sometimes
when when we we do this interface we
realize that actually we don't need so
many things because we needed this high
level object only because we need a
sample in this case a config manager we
really don't need to hide all the
configure manager because the only thing
that can make magic that we use is this
stringer his configure this code was
doing some
configuration for kind of some security
and so instead of passing the config the
world config manager to the one coda we
can just say we can just say let's just
get this risk string and just use the
risk of string this is just an example
but just to do something quite a bit and
then we can do kind of some stiff with
the other thing the with connection and
we can either the connection inside the
using basically call back and instead of
passing the connection to our module we
can say no we can put a call back to
this facade and then our module lambda
or something like that it will be called
using the we using the connection so we
don't have it to give it a connection to
our module but just run in next time so
after this changes basically our we
change our main method with the logic
removing all the best stuff that we
don't want we pass the new facade and we
just get the stuff with the facade and
we just get we don't need that the
config manager anymore but just we
needed for the facade to give us the
specific risk that we need also we don't
need the connection anymore we just need
the facade to run our code inside a
connection context and so at the end we
can finish the stuff and our initial
module II just need have have this
execute was basically we don't need any
more all this stuff that we don't want
to but we need this said that a context
builder so we need this kind of external
environment and that means that we can
now test all our code mocking the
external environment so we are
completely free to start unit testing
and in reality what we can also do we
can move this stuff up and up and then
at the end of having this modules that
only have a kind of dependency at the
beginning of the module and then
internally completely consistent and not
that basically doing this kind of
substitution is almost completely
automatic and we don't have it really
risk a lot of introduced impacts one
thing that we need is kind of discipline
when we do this kind of a factoring we
he'll have it to be clear and not start
doing improvement to the code a while
we're here we can do the improvement
once we have a unit test in place and
the the last one this lambda I'll caster
which is a nice thing that Java it give
us the idea is that it's very easy way
to remove some code duplication without
actually writing new class or
inheritance which is something that
sometimes bring up some bugs so just to
give you a very simple things we have a
very to class with a very simple stuff
one it calculated interest using the
Libra so from a user get the user get
the loans from the user then get the
Libra wait then for hitch lon
to apply a rate that is a person as
method as parameter in the method and
deliver which is kind of fixed in the
retina so and and then the the next one
basically is a is doing some an other
kind of interest a using the credit
check and so we we do a completely
different in it but and then for each
loaner we calculate or eighteen
different things so the the classes are
quite similar but are not completely
identical we
can do some refactoring instructing
using strategy pattern but will be a
kind of risky some think that we can do
instead in a very very simple way is a
it's a kind of it's not very nice at the
beginning basically we just introduced
to lambda what you do function basically
as a parameter of the function of the
owl our method 1 will be : the beginning
and the other will call us on the
specific and the note the nice things is
that we heal it because in one case we
have a discredit checker for the
initialization that we use inside the
cycle the other case we have adjust the
double the decision but with the lambda
we can use an external type so we don't
have it to specify which is the type in
our class the only thing that of course
the two lambdas have to use the same
type this a in the generics so the
actual implementation yeah this is the
implementation the code so basically we
just called it the two lambdas with
apply and that the context not that the
context there is a type I a that we
don't really know what whatever is they
the only thing that we will pass to the
second lambda and this is how these two
things are code there will be written
but yeah the nice thing is that you can
do this step by step and then basically
using the same class
introducing the lambda we start in the
second class and using the first class
and then remove completely Segovia's and
finally the this is the default
technique is called a solver coagula and
the idea is that when we have a
spaghetti code we have a lot of objects
that are related to each other and this
is a bit of original code that we have a
nablus a client the print
the label and then the printer want the
client and the label so this is the
output of the software every right
something like that I don't have time to
look at the code but yeah this is the
original code which is a bit of a mess
everything is the old one so the idea is
that okay you take all your code all
your function in your code and you just
put all the function in a static class
and all the function basically from a
basically from a method that you make
everything like a static ice or coaster
they need a lot of parameters because I
didn't adult parameter but once you do
this basically all the parameter make
very simple then to have write a new
classes where if you have only one
parameter for example these guidelines
just work on a tour so I get friends
definitely go on address when you have
more than one you can decide which is
the most important you can leave a
static but the final example is much
cleaner and all this is done with the
basically automatically factory on
IntelliJ and you can find it on github
all the acceleration per if you really
want to see the code and try to do it
yourself so to conclude really that
rejuvenator decoder can be fun at least
for me and this is my personal attempted
to kansui
of course it's not a real gold but it
was a broken in the face and now it's
kind of fixed and it's kind of nice with
this gold stick and yeah if there's any
question and I'm trying to collect
material about this topic because I'm
really interested and yeah I like to put
some together
for those any question oh okay I hope
the tribe with some feedback ever you
enjoyed thank</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
