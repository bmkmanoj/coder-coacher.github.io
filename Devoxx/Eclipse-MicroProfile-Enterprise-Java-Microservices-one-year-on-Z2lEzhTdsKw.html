make sure Clips micro profile enterprise
Java moko services one year on a nice
short easy catchy title for this session
my name is Ken finian I work for Red Hat
and I lead the wild flight one project
though for today's purposes I am the
neutral third party so on our panel
tonight we have mark little tonight
somewhere we have mark Lowell from red
hats
we have Jonathan Gallimore from Tommy
tribe we have Andre me Holly OH
got there right good from Pereira and
Emily's young from IBM so we're going to
start out with a little bit of where we
are one year on and obviously we have
micro profile one Oh last September
which was just aligning with CDI jax-rs
and GC JSONP that was given to us from
Java EE 7 and then one of the bigger
tasks that we undertook at the beginning
of the year was to move the Eclipse
Foundation so I guess a question to the
panel would be lessons learned in the
first year in terms of what we've done
what we've achieved and what we could do
better
who wants to take out the mantle first I
think we should have before we had -
well yeah you're on this works is it
yeah I can hear the temperature Yemi ah
lessons learned I think would include
making sure you understand the Eclipse
process and how it fits into your
existing process as soon as you possibly
can
rather than or will just figure it out
once we get into eclipse
so Clem Clem is sitting the audience
from the vertex team and you know we had
a lot of problems with vertex for the
engine eclipse process and you would
have thought maybe I should have
realized it would have been interesting
and it was interesting it still is
interesting so I think and not this
isn't a diggit eclipse I'm sure if we go
into Apache or somewhere else it would
be in the same thing figured out or
figure out what process you have
beforehand what process they've got
maybe you have to throw stuff out yeah
we have to modify anyone else ever
coming yeah I echo those those comments
like we've currently got the config API
that's going through the process at the
moment I think it's you know the first
one is always likely to be that the
hardest one to get through as we learn
the process but I think it's quite key
that we learn to sort of share what the
process is with everybody else who's
who's participating in micro profiles so
that hopefully we can get the next
proposals through more quickly I just
say that maybe like going into echoes
echoes foundation is really good for us
it teaches a lot lot of things and gives
creates a platform to communicate better
and also resolve these intellectual
property and for the purpose things
things are legal stuff but it also slows
us down very very like significantly and
we didn't expect that so in the end of
the beginning we were hoping for to have
a releases like every three four months
now we are having release like nine
months after the first release so it
really slowed us down but things are
improving and in fact we are not we are
going to release a new specification and
other three specifications are being
worked on so we have to keep up and get
the gather momentum or increase momentum
to have real work done not only tackle
eclipse and the processes yeah I think
here the first year is lesson to learn
is to how to do the real stuff with the
big unity so I think is it like take a
configure as an example like the first
time we will learn how to start that
like has a real real piece of the code
and how to interact with the community I
think is a which is a configure example
so the full
Pro proposals will move along faster
hopefully but I do I would like to
invite a yin Robinson to come here to
initiate your experience as well
we need a chair sorry I'm no you're fine
yeah I'm I'm here for you yeah Oh lovely
thank you I'm I'm I'm Ian Robinson I'm
the working I'm the chief architect for
WebSphere and IBM so I work with Emily
Emily does all the work on the micro
profile side of things and then I just
try and keep the rest of the company
going in the right direction with
respect in micro profile area in terms
of what we've learned in the last year I
think that the the thing we this panel
more or less was was here this time last
year we said we won't talk about micro
profile then because it didn't exist we
were talking about Java EE and what to
do about it since it was going down but
going down the tubes a little bit this
time last year and micro profile I think
was pretty much created as a result of
that panel discussion and meetings and
get together as we had afterwards one of
the things we said at the time was we
needed to do things faster than Java EE
what we've learned over the last year is
that whilst we think we can do things
faster than Java EE there was an initial
process hump to get over and that's what
Mark was referring to so we'll see but
I'm expecting that by the time we get to
Java one will have more will have most
of those specifications that Andre was
talking about out there so yeah you
cannot have an area moving on so kind of
our roadmap plan which hasn't been
formalized yet within the community but
this is just our current thinking is to
have a 1.1 micro profile release in the
and quarter this year so this stage that
probably looking like early to mid June
is our kind of best guest right now and
then a 1.2 leading up to Java one and
then potentially a 2.0 in quarter for
this year and what would be in those
this is kind of currently our I guess
you could say feature backlog in
somewhat prioritized order obviously we
have configuration which we've already
talked about there's fault tolerance
security token health check full toilets
with event streams monitoring open
tracing and then some Java 8 API so that
are being updated when that gets
released so where that fits in terms of
releases kind of like right now
configuration is definitely in 1.1 what
else is in 1.1 is kind of up for debate
and also whether things get completed
and how far things move along we're
trying to improve the speed but we're
not quite there yet so is there anyone
here that wants to hear about security
token exchange what that is what that
means because they don't want to bore
anyone to death with stuff they're not
interested in there anyone raise a hand
interested in hearing what it is okay
moving on health checks anyone interest
in there okay we have one panel what are
we doing with health checks and so
there's a the health checks proposal
that's currently being discussed
provides endpoints to basically make an
HTTP call to discover the health of the
server and so that returns a HTTP
response code along with along with a
set of data JSON encoded so you can
actually get more detail about what has
actually happened during that health
check and actually get more detailed in
terms of what's of what's gone wrong so
the idea there is that anything can make
a call to that that endpoint and it can
be secured to various different methods
that would be available inside your
inside your server
but the client was calling that could
could could be anything else it could be
it could be another micro profile server
or it could be another system entirely
so that you can actually report on the
the status of what's going on and could
these be health checks used for like
container readiness and license checks
and those kind of things yeah absolutely
so there'll be a bit they'll be a base
set of health checks plus you'll also go
to define your own application based
health checks as well so you'll get it
there'll be something that you can
inject in with with CDI and you better
set the status of a particular item when
inside your application so if there's
something that's very specific to you in
your app that you want to report on you
can do that you can do that easily as
well great I'd like to also also
reminder there has been a confusion
between what is metrics proposal in the
healthcare proposal because metrics is a
different proposal and the main
difference is that they're both they
both expose data about what's going on
in the service but the health check is
only exposing like binary data really
saying if the service is functioning
well or not or not functionally or maybe
some something in between that is like a
warning and this is with the aim of
automatic like automatically reco fixing
problems sometimes in clusters of
services when there is a tool that can
restart a services if something is not
going going properly exercise is not
working properly so it's a narrow scope
for health check valve metrics managed
to provide all the additional data and
anything like about a CPU usage that you
can monitor to optimize the service but
not not basically for my other basic
information is discovered by the health
check proposal just to find out if there
is something wrong if the service should
be restarted or at least checked or what
going on there yeah just I want to add
one more thing on the health check
basically health check is very simple
the degrees that are preachers is the
application developers responsibility to
tell whether these applications are
poured down the only to status either up
or down so that's not really simple
probable okay any other questions on
health checks from anyone before we move
on yeah so you know on the face of it
you might think that just being able to
specify that capability in an
application is a very interesting as 101
different ways of being able to do that
already but the thing that's interesting
for us certainly for IBM about this is
we want these applications these micro
service applications to be deployed in
docker containers in a management
infrastructure coordination
infrastructure which typically we we
doubled down on kubernetes at the moment
but we want there to be the same way for
all of our customers micro service
applications to be able to report on
that data so that we can build
intelligence into the routing layer in
the platform around obviously you know
that's something that everybody else is
doing as well the question then becomes
how do you hook that application
intelligence into the infrastructure and
get the infrastructure to exploit it you
need to stand a way of doing that this
is how we want to do it
great thanks Ian so monitoring Andre
kind of touched on there is slightly
different from health checks
is there anyone wants to know what we're
out what we're planning around
monitoring oh we have one who wants to
talk about monitoring
okay
so again like like the health checks
there's there there be the capability to
sort of push out information about the
server itself but also the ability for
your application to specify its own set
of metrics that you can look up and
again it's it's through a restful
interface so it is a it is a it is a it
is a pull based mechanism what's in the
proposal at the moment what's quite
interesting for us is that we've been
looking at various different ways of
doing this inside Tommy tribe and been
looking at sand push-based
things and we would we were chatting
earlier on about some similarities and
differences in terms of capabilities in
in the in the different products that
we've been working on but it's it's nice
that we can as participants in micro
profile we can all come together and
come up with something that we can all
that we can all support so it's you know
what you're using to query your metrics
is becomes agnostic of anything that
we're that we're specifically doing on
the hood yeah this Jonathan said then we
had a channel earlier today and we found
out that we do a lot of stuff that has
very very much in common like with the
women with the health tech serve well
health checks and wrong-doing and also
with a caching so with monitoring in
regard to fire our server we just
derived from GlassFish we we already
inherited from GlassFish the rest
interface that provides loads of
monitoring data those a lot of metrics
it's only that people don't know much
about it because it's only provided by a
bi classifier and
it's not very common if other other
implementations or other vendors provide
that they have completely different set
of api's so it's fragmented that is
already there and the multiple vendors
provide that so it makes sense to unify
that and create a unified API for that
and what we also do in a Paillard server
is that we provide a means to to define
thresholds which are I think what what
you meant by KPIs you can define levels
which are acceptable which are which
will issue a warning or which are
critical so for example if the CPU load
is over 90% for some time it will issue
a warning so this is also a kind of
functionality that can be integrated
into this specification so we were
looking forward to it and we hope that
all these ideas will will be part of it
I just adds a little summary for the
monitoring so basically the two
categories joins the container stages
wise application status and also in the
mailing list we even talked about how to
integrate so for tolerance which is
monetary so money to income money to
like a circuit breakers it has and etc
so one last thing I would like to add is
the currently the proposal has not been
merged so if you have any comments any
cetera and to speak up on the on the
proposal
okay moving on distributed tracing
anyone interested in hearing about what
we're thinking in that area
oh we have another winner so this is
like these changing problems or was put
forward by a couple of my colleagues
basically is where interest stages to to
cannot reach general consensus about
treating treating api's so I think
underway discussed on the community to
bring up forward for the open treating
API and then is we just started putting
forward a proposal so people can choose
a different tree implementation and also
the proposal was a quite supportive by
the open changing community as well so I
think is that yeah currently we work
yeah we work hard to get the proposal
and in implementation and inertia
one of the reasons we got this one as
something that we want to get done in
the one of the first phases is is the
simple observation that as customers our
customers break their monolithic
applications down as lots of small micro
services flow in the trace all the way
through it becomes more important it's
pretty easy to do problem determination
on a monolithic application becomes a
bit more exciting when you've got lots
of micro services potentially running
asynchronously with respect to one other
in containers
maybe not all co-located so a again lots
of different ways of solving the same
problem but if you want to make some
match micro services from different
sources then if we can get Java based in
particular focusing on Java based micro
services to start with to collaborate on
doing things the same way using the same
set of technologies then it makes it a
lot easier for us to put together a
comprehensive end-to-end trace and you
know help with application performance
issues and indeed infrastructure
challenges - thanks Ian and another area
we'll be looking at heavily is for
torrents so I don't know if Emily wants
to tell us what we're doing in that area
because I know she's worked heavily on
that for tolerance is the one my
favorite so I think it's a very hot
topic because whenever when you mention
about macro services and you all want to
do the resilience micro services I think
it's around 12 factors brought out by a
margin folder to build the resilience
macro services so which is why we trying
to propose these four tolerance so
basically a micro profile
I mean community we're trying to cover
the we're trying to reach the general
consensus about Heidi is to achieve like
a reach why and bulkhead
and cicada breaker and fullback this
kind of category so when we first
started is this is very interesting as
we studied with the non CDI approach and
as I was the objective was rejected by
can say is the candle I think is the
right quote it's good comment anyway
Allison is a trying to fit in with the
CDI paste and then is the way are the
CDI based API and then ISM and then now
we flip are we trying to get a CDA based
api's I mean agreed upon the implemented
and at the same time when the we
implemented a CDI based API so that will
utilize the non CDA as sti's so so I
think is that and these turned out
places to be okay so so for tolerance
there was the splitting into two parts
one part is based as mentioned by cancer
previous right so the pace means
achieves everything but you cannot like
visualize them the second part is that
the part with with the streaming in the
region so basically you can view the
circuit breaker status and etc so it's
very easy to see oh this circular so
here is it open our eyes closed or half
open through system this is status to
try and to I mean make the API very
simple and at same time we're trying to
I mean trying to improve the usability
there is a second apart anyone else have
anything on would sorry
I'm an impartial third party yeah I
guess in terms of fault tolerance I was
the reason that we moved to a CDI first
approach yeah I blame me for that
I kind of felt that given micro profile
was mandating CDI then it kind of made
sense to take that approach and if that
happens to mean that spring can't use it
well then so be it that's just an
interesting byproduct of the decision
yeah but I certainly think fault
tolerance is important and I I was also
pushing quite heavily for the stream
stuff from in the initial version but I
didn't win that one but I think it it's
going to be very important thing for
micro sources so it'll be good to get it
in there and get people using it and
seeing what they we can do to improve it
anyone else have anything on that yeah
I'd like to say that ken is not the only
one that was in favor of CDF as a
project
I also kind of a kind of like it more
than going to witness Hawaii in Java
plane Java first and it was for
pragmatic reasons not to ignore Java but
I imagine that and it turned out to that
the CDI API is much easier
it contains it's much less code and much
much less problems then that plain Java
API because with Java you need to define
interfaces you need to define the life
cycle but with CDI CDI makes all many
things for you like the site so I said
life cycle is there already you don't
need to treat or specify how clouds work
one building works which is specify how
things are injected so it turns out that
the CDI API took much shorter time to
create and to talk about or talk through
than the Java API so then if we take
this approach I believe it's we can
deliver much faster at least something
were
working and at Champlain Java API
afterwards because it's also relevant
it's relevant not only outside of micro
profile or CDI but also to be usable in
CDI extensions so we if we want to go to
one level deeper we need to have a plain
Java API but in that case we we have to
solve some problems and one of those
problems is how to dispose some some
objects which are just created by
calling static methods and the other
problem is that the API is much more
complex and c-d-i API
you also have anything they want to go
in so in my opinion and this is just
this is just me I think that this
specification this this the need for a
set or a standard way for Java micro
services to be able to build full
tolerance in is the biggest gap that
Java EE has today and spring obviously
did you know they did a good thing with
with the Netflix hysterics libraries for
the spring programming model so you know
hats off to them Java EE needs it is bad
and I think if the sooner we get this
done in micro profile the better because
I think this is the most important spec
we're working on at the moment in my
opinion I kind of agree although I
actually think getting the security
stuff done first is more important
because I'd rather have my micro
services fail and be secure than keep
coming back every time they die and then
be really insecure actually with the
sector it is quite convenient at the
sake of the new jsr is coming with Java
EE 8 and we hope to incorporate it at
least partially into next versions of
micro profile and in fact we are going
to evaluate every jsr delivered with je8
if it can be incorporated if it makes
sense to make it part of biko profile
too but it also takes some time because
we need to evaluate if it's valuable if
it fits to the model
so but that's the intention Thanks so as
a vendor what's your top feature you
want included obviously Ian's is fault
tolerance we know that one yes security
I think probably security and the
metrics and help health checks a PI
analyst for us yeah so some of those
things that were discussed maybe maybe
health check is probably more
significant significant for by our
because we already have a lot of
functionality there that's worth to
specify and promote and but we are like
we also kind of like a JK API which
which has been discussed before that he
has some issues even with Java EE and it
also has some issues with Marco profile
but PI our implementation already
provides a cache with with hazel cost so
we'd like to discuss it even further and
I think what is kind of necessary is
thread managing threads and messaging
but this is a long future yeah I agree
with en and which is for tolerances
otherwise I was not working for
tolerance haha yeah
does anyone from out there have a
different view or agree with anyone up
here or strong opinions either way
[Laughter]
okay okay so we obviously this is the
current community we have we're always
looking for new individuals or groups to
join we want to try and get as many
people interested in this as we can to
help improve both the speed and types of
specifications we can bring to bear and
these are some of the reasons resources
we have obviously the micro profile i/o
site we have a discussion forum which
has a nice bitly link there that you
should be easy to remember
that's where everything gets discussed
and everything gets happened happens it
can be quite overwhelming at times
particularly if you're just getting into
it there are lots of very varied
discussions but also good ones as well
and then we have also some samples and
some other repos which actually should
change that to the Eclipse all that's
wrong it should link till to the correct
one properly for you though anyway so
now is there anyone from here today who
wants to ask questions of the panel
mardon's make sure everyone can hear you
we-we-we the users and the user groups
want a working demo application and we
want it now is that going to be on the
roadmap well we do have the conference
demo though it hasn't been updated in
quite a while
there was never working in the first
place it's hardly well maybe that's
something we need to add on to the Roma
thinking here formally as it gets added
to the roadmap then it might be you know
then people put the time and effort into
I think Yonkers if there's nothing it's
great building these pseudo
specifications or specifications but if
no one's going to build at something
they usually yep yeah we're I think
we're in trouble
no that makes sense and I appreciate we
as user group members should be actually
helping build those things so well
sometimes easier said than done
so I was just going to say be good if
the users helps in that regard but but I
would agree with you I think be nice if
every time and I think this was one of
the things that we talked about a Java
one last year nice every time we did a
release
there was this app whether it's the one
that currently got was it was something
different but something to demonstrate
that was available at the point of
release rather than either never there
or six months later does anyone else
have any questions they'd like to ask
the panel I do have some further pre can
questions we can throw at them if no one
else has anything else well let you
ponder that for a moment
I know it's need to calm down everyone
so here's a fun one
where's Oracle who's going to grab my
truth on that work well they have they
have offices in London sure there's some
there they've got them in the u.s. after
you give it more specific where is
Oracle in relation to the micro profile
effort well the canned and the honest
answer is we've invited them a number of
times publicly and privately and they
have declined to to get involved and
that's and they've done that publicly as
well I guess a follow-up question in the
you can answer both is is micro profile
looking to compete with Java EE as a
standards body so I want to answer add
to Mark's answer to the first one as
well both both of us both mark and I
have and of our respective company
chains as well reached out and try to
well we've had some good conversations
with Oracle but they although they have
declined to join in the micro profile
effort itself anybody that was at Java
one last year will have seen at least
some of the fruit
of the that the efforts we're making
with them because a tinel's Java EE
session at JavaOne last year he called
us out and he named checked micro
profile as a community effort working
around the edges of Java EE and that's
you know that that's that's what we are
at the moment we are a community effort
that is helping trying to help Java EE
which brings us on to can second
question which is are we trying to
compete so I think it's fair that
members of micro profile can take you
know different perspectives on that I'll
give you I'll give you mine and IBM's
we're not trying to compete with Java EE
because Java EE is important to us and
our customers but Java EE went to sleep
and we couldn't leave it asleep we try
kicking it a few times and it didn't
wake up
and so you know from my perspective from
IBM's WebSphere is and our java
customers perspective we are building
things in micro profile to run we're
then on top of Java EE and it is my
expectation that we will take the work
that we do in Java EE and bring it back
the micro profile and bring it back to
Java EE as JSR s and you know will
either drive those things into java re'
or we won't but in the end if we get it
into java re' great if we don't it
doesn't matter because they'll still be
a you know a broad consensus community
we believe that we'll be using these
technologies with java re' and there
will be a spectrum of micro profile and
java ee stuff that just all works
together and is part of the same thing i
mean i can echo that and say what I've
said publicly and priorities Oracle as
well that you know we're not competing
with java re' were we're not a standards
body
we are trying to evolve Java EE and you
know push it in directions that are
experienced based so that we can
eventually come back to the JCP if
that's you know the right standards body
and trying to standardize some or all of
the things that we do in micro profile
but you know the JCP process is
deliberately and correctly slow because
it is a standards body whereas you know
if we can get our process issues right
the Rohtak step at the start we can go a
lot quicker energy than the JCP and then
feed those things back into series of j
SRS I really echo the things that here
in the mark have posted from our put
from our point of view we went if we
remain committed to to Java EE as well
as micro profile as we don't see them as
competing with each other we will
continue to support both going going
forward yeah I agree that we were not
competing we are basically trying to
help Java EE and DCP move forward and I
would say that we are taking the advice
of JCP when were many of times we've
heard that before it's suggested that
before submission of jsr that's it's
good to have at least one implementation
then it's really really useful and used
but and we are extended in extending
this to a collaborative effort and
trying to standardize some or specify
some things together so that there will
there will be not only one
implementation but a couple of
implementations already before we can
bring that to the JCP so it's like a
second level specification it's not is
not we are we are not a standards body
so we don't want to specify everything
for the whole world but at least we were
a couple of a couple of vendors and a
couple of projects can agree on
something
in
and then that could be that could be
summed up standardized or even if it's
not standardized some some users was
some people don't care if it's supported
by significant number of projects and
vendors yeah I agree with all of them
honor I just add some other contacts
from the Oracle point of view from my
tour from match has briefed achat on the
dev walk for us earlier this year I met
GSR chia Heather and also Java year
chair Linda actually they are really
supportive work and the encouraging
artists submit ideas are proposals so
yes is that proof another question
that's a little I feel what about non
Java services is that something that
micro profile will ever consider or look
at or want to integrate with wants to
take that you mean on Java and on JVM
could be both yes absolutely absolutely
should do more than just Java on the JVM
and you know micro services we've heard
a few people talk about anyway you know
how we have interoperability to through
rest over HTTP micro services should be
inherently heterogeneous I think there
are things that we can do in micro
profile that should be useful to know
developers just as much as scarlet
developers this is somewhat come back to
the discussion we had that Java 1 last
year like the difference between a kind
of trying to remember David's terms it
was like an implementation standard an
interoperable operability standard where
the latter would be more appropriate for
non JVM or other jvm languages as
opposed to the actual standard yes among
the JCP and Java is really focused more
on
Portability and interoperability you
know particularly now that moving away
from Cobra which was rightly or wrongly
the you know the Interop mechanism for
quite a while it's much more now about
portability I think what we should be
doing in my micro profile because of
what micro services is all about is you
know trying to address my Portability
and and interoperability you know else
yeah so just to follow what what Mark
said already we have this discussion
about things around us not only inside
of the applications that are built on
top of any micro profile or java
implementation but when in regards over
to other services or even in
infrastructure like a self-discovery to
also or kubernetes is you know all these
things that make our integrating these
services together and we already have
some specifications in mind that at
least part of them specify things that
are not related only to Java Java that
they are not dependent so we were
talking about health check and metrics
both of both of them intended to specify
a common REST API and REST API is not
tied to each other not even save JVM so
if we specify what's kind of data and
how is exposed through rest interface
that can be also used by other services
like nodejs
or similar so there is a value in what
we are doing and for other projects
outside of micro profile initiative and
will be it will be nice if this value
can be extended to other projects
without making them micro profile
compatible so that's where the notion of
micro profile in terrible the
interoperability comes in two separate
pieces which are not specific to Java JD
and other that can be used also by other
other other services or infrastructure
tools having means almost falling out of
a chair trying to reach a microphone -
we have an argument yet so that's done I
know yes Bend is like an IBM a Red Hat
and PI are and Tommy everybody's
building a micro service environment
that is by its nature by the nature of
micro services polyglot however from so
again this is this is this is this is an
Ian perspective and it's different from
what you just heard I think that it
would be a mistake for the micro profile
collaboration to run too fast
before we learn properly to walk with
sorting out a better story for
java-based micro services you know it
obviously everybody wants to solve world
hunger but you've got to do things you
know a bit at a time so I am a big
believer so certainly when when when it
comes to organizing our own priorities
and resources within the span of control
that I've got within my organization you
know we're building stuff in a polyglot
fashion but we are focusing the work
that we do around micro profile on how
to solidify and nail the java concerns
for micro services because you know
outside of java ee other than vendor
specific approach is no one else is
doing and that that's what I want to get
out of micro profile so I am taking a
very very java first approach but that
doesn't mean the other language is
unimportant it's just that from a from a
you know a repeat collaborate and lead
to all stands perspective
the thing that micro profile helps me
with most of all is getting a common
java approach to micro services that
makes sense we got about seven minutes
left are there any questions anyone's
thought of from the audience that they
want to throw at the panel Oh still
overwhelming excitement so what about
standards now this one's kind of a we
touched on a bit before and I guess one
of the questions around this is does
everything micro profile do become a GSR
at some point or some other standard or
is this a case of some things might and
other things might not all we just don't
know at this stage I'll express an
opinion sure I think everything we do
could be submitted and should be
submitted as a jsr but in the end if
those JSL fall on the rocks in the JCP i
don't care i might slightly rephrase
that I think everything we do could be
submitted as a standard to an
appropriate standards body that may be
the JCP for some things but if at some
point we go polyglot it may have to be
some other standards body for some
aspects I think we're from my
perspective I don't necessarily know but
it makes sense for the things that we
work on if appropriate to submit them to
a standards body then then that's
something that we that we should look to
do once once so things with we reached a
point where there agreed on and mature
enough to do that I agree that I think I
think all all the work we do has the
nature that it is naturally
collaborative work approved by many
vendors so it has a good good starting
point to become a standard if it's
widely accepted but my point of view is
that yeah we can propose it as a stand
the jcpoa even so any other standard
body but it shouldn't slow us down and
sometimes sometimes that standardization
efforts slow things down a lot so I
think only a handful of specifications
may are worth to propose and go on go go
through the standardization process what
other things are more experimental and
might be changed or revised in the
future yeah I think his you for the
specification and now putting the GSR is
his ideal situation ideal outcome
because when we said Harper this is a
macro preferred or IO our aim ways to
prototype mature the technology and then
send it to standard body if we can see
that happening
that means we haven't done the right
thing okay unless there's a tidal wave
of questions from the audience I will
say I'll give our panel here like 30
seconds to kind of give us their view on
micro profile that hasn't been expressed
already if they have any opinion they
want to share holding back the wave of
questions and and like so overwhelming
interest that we've had I like to repeat
something that we've all said I'll send
our various representatives have said
over the last year or so this is a
community driven effort it's really
important that people are interested in
enterprise micro services that are based
on Java EE that you know they get
involved because it's a great way of
shaping how we move forward as an
industry anyway also anything they want
to add I think I just want to sort of
repeat one of the things that I sort of
touched upon earlier which is you know
from from some of the conversations that
I've had today it is quite obvious that
you know the individual companies we've
been working on some of the things that
we've talked about today in our own
implementations and it's really great
that we can come together and
collaborate and come up with some
interoperable ways
of working on these things and so that
you can have a solution that's a
agnostic of any particular any
particular vendor it's really really
nicely how everyone's come together as a
community flap I'd like to express that
I think I believe that any
standardization or a collaboration
effort among many many vendors of
products is a really useful and I think
every one of us that is part of my Co
profile the weeds and that otherwise
they wouldn't be doing it and we've seen
that other other projects were also
interested maybe maybe not to join
market profile but to discuss things and
exchange ideas and this is really
motivating for for us to continue this
work and in the end I believe that any
collaboration and standardization from
brings our industry forwards we we are
not completed only amongst ourselves
otherwise we wouldn't be doing it the
way we are competing with other
technologies and we want to want to
interest our users and customers so it's
important to collaborate together to
innovate and this is where market
profile is in what world is its main
Pole yeah I think his collaborator case
so collaborate innovate and there is a
way to reach fast and then learn
mistakes get get some feedback and
improve I think that's a way to succeed
so I just finish up by saying that we in
IBM we have we have we do things of one
or two ways we are they go on and do
things ourselves or we work with other
people and I would say looking back over
our history we've done a few things on
our own really really well made us lots
and lots of money we've done a few
things on our own
really really really badly and but
honestly the things that we've been the
most successful with are well
worked with other people because you
know they tell us when we're being
stupid and I'd like to think that we
bring something to the party as well
great
thanks everyone so I'd like to thank our
fantastically dedicated audience today
it's been wonderful
hopefully you've learned something of
interest from the panel today and
they've learned something from you and
I'll just finish up by saying please
come join us in the community criticize
us when we're doing something stupid
give us a hug and help yes and help more
the merrier anyone can help thank you
very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
