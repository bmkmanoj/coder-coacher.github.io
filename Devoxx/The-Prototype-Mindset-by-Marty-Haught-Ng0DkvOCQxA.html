that's ledge plate you asleep alright
well we're going to talk about the
prototyping mindset I'm curious how many
of you work on sort of early stage
product development type work few of you
most of you okay it's cool nice alright
so I is Marty hot and I am NOT a Java
program anymore I used to do that many
many years ago but i I've been building
software for 19 years and I would say
when I was putting the sides together
that 16 of those years have been spent
doing early-stage product development
prototyping mostly in the start of space
and the lessons i'm going to talk about
today have come emerged from that I now
run all software consultancy in Colorado
and I've been doing that for 11 years
and we now focus solely on protecting we
should do rescues and some mentoring but
we primarily do prototyping and I've
noticed it of course each and every
products a little bit different but
there are these sort of unifying themes
and practices that help make prototyping
go a lot faster and bring products to
market i'ma tell you project that we had
a few years ago hidden genius and it was
interesting because it went really well
the beginning and then started struggle
after a month so the client approached
us and they had they had a very grand
vision for creating a sort of crowd
driven platform that would identify
technology challenges that cleared
eventually become competitions that
companies could compete and build
solutions that make our world better
it's a very great idea
sort of a sort of a Kickstarter meet
SpaceX or something like that and we
were happy to build it and we had a
fairly tight time constraint though they
had two months because in two months
they are going to present this to the
MIT Media Lab and they're going to use
it this product in their class to bet
ideas so the game game was on we had to
definitely deliver this and we had no
problem we were able to build something
in six weeks it's fairly focused with a
minimal feature set and you're able to
demo it it worked in the class it went
great we were able to help them focus on
being lean and delivering just what they
needed for the demo and it worked but
what happened next is a bit perplexing
we've helped a lot of different
companies over the years and typically
they were pretty motivated to get their
product to market but this one sat for
another 16 months before it was used by
users how do we go from two months
successful demo was maybe fifty percent
feature complete or closed and takes 16
months now some of the things that
happened were out of the control of the
client and our team's hands so that was
understandable but that really is no
excuse and I sort of when I fought back
about the early year or two of this
project I came to this quote that is so
true and I think this was the heart of
the matter that really wanted to polish
and perfect all of what they were doing
before they'll anyone see it because
they're going to be embarrassed that oh
you can only get a first impression and
then they're going to leave they're not
going to use a product they will get it
had lots of excuses but I think this was
a missed opportunity and thing is this
is not unique to this project I've seen
this many times where projects clients
they don't want to let users start using
their stuff until it's
and you know perfect in their eyes so
we're going to talk about the Minimum
Viable Product how many of you have
heard this term MVPs familiar with it
okay pretty much everyone here the this
is a great term it comes from lean
startup and you can see here's what how
Eric describes it a product with just
enough features to gather validated
learning about the product and its
continued development and I want to
really focus on the fact this is about
learning and tight feedback loops
because prototyping really is about that
you're trying to figure out what to
build with the least amount of effort to
make sure that it's going to have a good
reception for your users and so the
prototyping process and the mindset that
we're going to talk about today is why
view is the best way to reach an MVP for
your product so some questions of what
we might want to prototype because some
people might there we'll just let's
build the real thing why do we need to
use a prototyping process versus our
traditional process what we're going to
talk about some of that but I see the
prototyping and this approach is the
fastest most cost-effective way to bring
a product to your users into the market
it reduces time to market which for most
of the products in the clients that we
have China market is their top value
they really want to hit and easily
collect user feedback early so
collecting is your feedback is going to
be key to a lot of what we do here a lot
in this talk and prototyping allows you
to get that a little more easily so yeah
we prototype because we don't know if
our solution will solve the right
problem and oftentimes when we see a
project come in we ask about the problem
and the solution because sometimes their
suspect and what's interesting about
this and where the prototyping mind said
too early to my my impetus to write
about it and create this talk was last
year we had a fairly experienced
developer join our team
had never done any prototyping and he
struggled he wanted to build software in
the way he had been raised to build
software and it was at odds with the
rest of team so during our one-on-one
and over the course of the project we
talked about all the various ways that
was creating friction and wasn't working
so well the project and so that is what
led me to sort talk about the protec
mindset so I via the pro subbing mindset
at least the theory or the underpinning
of it is that it's keeping your focus on
the fastest most efficient way to
validating your products unknowns so
we're started seeing a theme here where
this is very much out of the Lean
Startup camp but I don't feel that you
need to with the prototyping mindset
follow any strict policy you know like
follow Lean Startup because I tell you
what only two clients over the last
seven or eight years since we started
using lean startup principles have
actually wanted to do it for real most
of them have no interest in doing all
the things in wien stardom and that's
fine but we can still apply these ideas
to more traditional projects or more
traditional clients that aren't willing
to go whole hog on customer development
and all that so we're going to cover six
keys to protect me today and this is a
very vast topic I couldn't quite put
everything into this talk I didn't
really want to talk for more than 50
minutes anyway and I think these six
keys will give you a nice foundation
that you can take back and apply to how
how you're building software now the
first key is no the roadmap this is the
first part that we start off we start
off the beginning where we're trying to
figure out what we're building and why
this piece is going to be critical
because you're going to be using it as
the basis for how to make decisions and
how to proceed as you go through
building your prototype and your MVP so
how do i define a roadmap there are lots
of definitions out there when I the way
I think of it in this case is that it's
a plan that identifies the problem the
solution and how the product will
address
those needs you'll often see these as a
set of features you I mock-ups these are
stories that's typically how it comes to
you the thing that you won't see in
roadmaps commonly is that they will talk
about other assumptions and the unknowns
but they should so let's look at the
traditional mindset around road maps and
sort of the reason we build products
trishul mindsets except the road map at
face value doesn't know to ask about how
it came to be assumes the business has
done their homework that we don't need
to question them on how they arrived at
their conclusions and doesn't question
the problem or the solution we're just
happy to build with the fastest to build
in contrast the prototyping mindset is
one that is was is questioning
everything about what we're doing and
why so asks about the problem with
solution because oftentimes there might
be some flaws there might be something
they overlooked identifies key features
because if you're going to build a MBP
you need to really know what at the
heart of your product and make sure
you're building just that or at least
you focus on that initially and thus it
seeks to list assumptions and unknowns
because we're going to be using this
list later on so there's some common
road map pitfalls that I see the first
one is that they're established without
engineering involvement and this is
always a sad situation when I see it
because many times I can tell that
engineer do not set out this roadmap
because it's not got flaws and just
maybe has some things that are going to
work out so well for building an MVP and
what's even worse about this as well of
course we could have talked about these
things when we r you know discussing the
ideas and could have avoided them or
attuned them to be a more reasonable
thing to build an MVP but that
oftentimes stakeholders sign on to the
roadmap agreeing to spend a certain
amount of budget or money and they are
really interested in revisiting that and
so you might have to proceed with a
flawed plan that maybe is doomed to fail
if there
not willing to adjust the other pitfall
that I see a lot is assumptions are
presented as fact it is a common pattern
I've seen in founders that they convince
others including themselves that these
assumptions are true that they are a
given and that the project paid places a
lot of emphasis on the fact that these
things are true so that when the product
finally goes live things don't go so
well is because these assumptions were
never really validated and tested and
thus the product fails or dies on the
vine or what it might what it might be
because they didn't do this early on
it's sad because they could have done
this immediately and no neither we have
changed course or maybe we shouldn't
build this thing after all if we look at
hidden genius they had a lot of
interesting assumptions their question
is will people care enough to spark
technology challenges that are
actionable that someone might want to
create a competition out of will there
be companies that are willing it will
see these competitions in a time that is
given and want to compete a lot of
unknowns a lot of questions and these
are things that we want identify very
early on c-can we validate those or test
them before we get too far along in the
process the final piece of the know the
roadmap key is what i call the product
compass and it's really made of three
parts where the product is headed and
why a list of assumptions about and
unknowns that we want to validate and
the essential value proposition the core
essence of the product that people are
going to be hell yeah i really want to
use this and with these items you now
can have a bearing and know how to go
through building out the product with
these items so k number two focused
scope prioritizing what to build and
what to defer is your first step along
narrowing down your NDP to something
that you can reasonably knock out
quickly and it is rare that I've seen
product owners able to scope down their
product to an MVP or something they can
build in six weeks or not so it's
something that we as developers as
engineers want to help them along the
traditional mindset in this area really
is pretty hands-off about scope we view
scope as an external concern that isn't
that we are not part of or now we're not
supposed to be making that decision we
don't question the value of a feature
we're happy to build everything they're
putting in front of us even if some of
those features may be questionable like
why are we building this now because I
don't see how this is critical to this
product right now sure I can understand
it's important later on but why are we
building it now we don't question that
and we don't offer ways to limit scope
when we are building out certain
features if we look at the prototyping
mindset we focus instead we focus the
scope on what's important we know what
those key values are key features let's
build those we defer anything that isn't
vital because we'll be able to build it
later on but why are we building it now
so we looked at we also looking for ways
to test assumptions as we encounter each
of our features there might be
assumption or something someone known
that we can test out improve as we're
doing it we identify that and we look
for ways that we can test it I want to
stop and talk about the complete product
vision versus the Minimum Viable Product
because this is a source of friction
that I've seen on projects product
owners typically when they imagine their
product they've been managing it for a
while they probably have a grand vision
it's probably a three to five-year view
of their product and it's very difficult
for them to see it as a small little
thing emerging in an MVP and because
it's reason they're going to struggle to
help you identify what to build in that
first six months or six weeks so instead
we need to help them identify the core
of their product and have that be
something that can stand on its own and
something that you can build and allow
the rest of the
addition to come later I think I'm kind
of touched on this a little bit the
scope is so important that it's
something that we want to apply and
limit as much as we can it has an
incredible impact in time and cost so
much so that it's our easiest lever that
we can use to help us launch the product
early and I have thought about the sort
of applying the cap theorem to projects
which is sort of time costs scope pic
two well scope is the easiest one that
you can play with and it's the one that
i recommend it's a lot easier to deal
with than cost in time my final point
here is that you should focus on key
high-value features not just an
arbitrary feature list because someone
thought it would be useful I can tell
you that a really good product is not
the kitchen sink big bag of features it
is really focused valuable features that
help someone solve a problem and they
get that so don't feel that a long
feature list is actually a positive
let's go to key number three measure
progress so how do we know for making
progress a lot of times right we if
we're knocking out stories cards or
building things to spec you're making
progress but that actually really isn't
true I mean it could be true but it
isn't for certain or true traditional
mindset certainly beats it that way
Patricia mindset also considers these
are feedback another concern that's
something that we need to go and worry
about and oftentimes we're unsure if a
feature actually solves the problem once
we build it we hand off or on the next
feature I don't recommend us especially
on your pride typing instead I would use
this mindset before you build a feature
asked how you're going to gauge success
before you start where that look like
either the metrics or something we can
track what do we want to hear from the
users which they be able to do we want
to ask these questions before we get
started highlights assumptions to test
again if their assumptions are unknowns
we want to figure out what those are
that might apply to this feature and we
want to see how we can test those how
can we measure it can be sure that we're
actually validating that those
assumptions are true or not true and
then we validate value through user
feedback so unless we're getting user
feedback we can't really consider that
this is solving the problem with the
user so reasonable outcome for any
feature is that your move or change it
significantly and this is odd this is
one that when new developers come to
work with us and prototyping they're
like well of course if we agreed to
build this we're not going to take it
out but actually you should you should
consider that if it's not solving the
problem or if it's not working right you
should either remove it or change it
this is going to be important for us to
think about as we go forward so when I
consider this the progression of
validation of how we determine that
something is successful the first one is
acceptance criteria and this is a very
normal one this is what we've kind of
view now which is okay what is the use
case or what should the user be able to
do for this feature great that's the
acceptance criteria that's pretty easy
number two after we know that's been
handled is user feedback we actually
have users use it we ask them how it
went you know what they thought of it we
talked to them the figure out if it's
working or not for them the third one is
observing behavior so just because the
users told us something doesn't mean
they're actually using it or it's
actually helping them with some peace so
observing their behavior which this
might be classic usability testing maybe
using heat maps to watch what they're
actually doing but this is where we can
determine if indeed the feature is
successful there's a new product I saw
our new service out there called full
story calm it's really pretty cool and
it does this easily to drop in and I'm
sure there's others out there so there's
a lot of options for us to observe their
behavior and forth is engagement metrics
maybe not so useful when you're really
starting off very early but it over x
will become really valuable and this is
something like using KISSmetrics or
segments or tracking your own data
internally in your product
but this is the idea that you're
watching what actually happens in your
system you know how many abandoned carts
do you have how many people are checking
out you know how whatever the activity
that's important for your domain you're
seeing that that's actually happening
and you're tracking it ok later on you
can compare numbers and you can say
quantifiable yes this feature improved
the product in this measurable way
here's the hidden genius voiding widget
and originally it was a simple plus one
minus one for voting but along the way I
guess the client talked to someone that
felt that this is a missed opportunity
what would be even better is if we had
three slider bars on a 0-10 scale that
would tell you how actionable how
achievable measurable compelling that
this goal will rule or whatever it is
about a competition would be this was
not validated all that heavily we had a
few users play with it but they were
already experienced maybe power users in
the system and there were never any sort
of tracking of metrics of seeing how
users generally across the whole board
we're using this product and we use this
voting mechanism so what's interesting
here is that if the common user was
daunted by this or didn't know how to
use it and they never voted was that
more valuable than a simple plus one
minus one I don't know but this is an
example of where you might make a change
and you think this is fantastic but if
users aren't using it or if they don't
get it not so much so i recommend you
view every feature as an experiment each
gets validated before you consider it
success let's move on to key for and
race simplicity this is where we're
going to start to get into some of the
ways we build our software and what i
see typically is that we as engineers
will over build or a build out
everything that we can imagine in this
case the traditional mindset would
implement the full feature we built the
feature as it's going to need to be for
the length and lifetime of this
everything we can imagine all the edge
cases we're going to build it special
mites that does not seek minimal are
tailored solutions we're going to build
the real thing has been requested and we
often complicate features with food
future future proofing we're trying to
predict the future we're trying to
imagine how how our system is going to
grow over the course of time and we're
going to predict that we're going to be
ahead of the curve and add extra
engineering in so that we're ready when
that happens the prototyping mindset in
this case takes a different approach we
implement the bare minimum necessary
whatever it takes to get out there to
users so we can validate it that's what
we want to do and nothing more we look
to look for minimal code alternatives
I'll give you a nice example of that in
a moment and we build in small
composable parts and I'll also explain
that in a moment this is the great club
and this reminds me of something of a
situation that had couple months ago had
a prospective client approached me about
this new product we wanted to build and
in there we're going through all the
different features and there was one
point where a product would go through a
complex approval process and he has a
big black box of you know approval
process and I asked well what does that
look like as you know what does that
entail and he's like well it's pretty
complicated and you know I've got some
ideas on how that's going to work and I
said well could we for now just have
when they win or request approval it's
in an email to the admin who would be
doing the approval and then they can go
back and forth like an email and figure
out what needs to happen and then when
it's all said and done the ad mink and
then click approved like in a back-end
would that work he's like yeah I'd be
great this is a great example of where
you think of a wait you can validate
something about your product without
writing code or writing very little code
and what's really nice about this
particular situation is that one he
didn't really know what that approval
process was he was going to try and
figure it out but probably a good chance
he would not get it right the first time
but instead he makes it manual he now
can document and go through the
process of what that approval flow looks
like and figure out what's worth
building what's not worth building all
the time approximating used and they're
learning about things the other piece is
what if it turns out no one really wants
their project approved or it's very
infrequent these are great things to
learn and something that if we had built
what he originally thought we need to be
built off the bat graph of that that's a
lost opportunity that could have avoided
a lot of engineering until later when
they're really sure about what need to
be built at that point so we're going to
talk a little bit over engineering and
this is something that I certainly done
many many times in my career and I've
seen it happen lots of my projects and
it's just human nature for us engineers
and that is we're trying to predict the
future we know this has bidness the past
we're going to try and future-proof what
we're building problem is when we do
that one we probably aren't particularly
future all that accurately I don't know
what you all but I think I'm not doing
so hot on predicting the future exactly
and of course the process means more
software which actually blogs down the
process and is a liability later on when
it needs to change which brings to one
of my favorite quotes seen this I'm sure
from Lord Cunningham extreme programming
what's the simplest thing that could
possibly work this is a great mantra to
use as your prototyping because it
really applies here and its companion
phrase yag v you are going to need it I
don't know how often I've said this and
projects I say it all the time and often
times it's true and if it's not true i
want to hear why they really need it and
why they actually need it right now
which reminds me of this quote from Ron
Jeffries again stream program which I
think of is just in time programming you
know if you don't actually need it right
now can we defer it a little bit longer
because if we can that is fantastic and
I highly recommended I countered this
talk maybe it was last year at rheas
dozen 15 this is a talk by Greg young
called the art of destroying software
and in the talk he gave in 2014
and here's the concept there that we
should optimize for delete ability in
our code and one of the thing in
particular struck out as I watch this
talk which is we called the one week
rule that each self-contained part of
your system should be able to be
rewritten within a week from scratch and
by somebody who doesn't even know what
it's supposed to do I don't know how
feasible this is for all the systems but
I tell you what it's a fantastic idea
and really this concept isn't new at all
because I see this in the UNIX
philosophy or you can pipe a lot the
programs to go to make a larger workflow
but it's also at the heart of
microservices thing is we can use its
approach without going to microservices
wrap the bat or using some other
complicated type of approach we can
simply segment and isolate our code in a
monolith or whatever with the idea that
we have these imaginary service
boundaries and we try not to violate
valid violate those boundaries and gain
removed coupling so when I think about
this I think about optimizing for
deletion i think that there's a number
of benefits that we gain because we have
these define sort of contracts in ways
these parts work together you have less
coupling that's a positive these of
course are smaller less complex units so
that's great it reduces the cost of
change so for our prototyping mindset
this is like gold because if we get it
wrong if we didn't you know guess the
future correctly or all sudden this
little component needs to be rewritten
it's not a big deal you didn't lose a
lot and as long as you didn't grossly
misidentify how the system should work
you can't replace a park here and there
and you can move forward so you don't
have to worry about predicting the
future because you know you can replace
any little part without too much effort
so if we look at our our voting widget
could we have built a simple approve
disapprove mechanism and that would have
worked well enough I think it would have
and we wouldn't have had to worry about
if we got it wrong we could just rewrite
some part if that wasn't valuable and we
wouldn't have had to guess if we need to
build out all this we could build a much
simpler
like my last thought here is really a
good one which is if it's not absolutely
necessary defer the decision so
important move on to key five avoid
feature polishing picture polishing is
an interesting thing it's something
actually I want everyone every engineer
to be able to do it's a very positive
thing but it's a positive thing that you
want to do when you know your features
going to stick around which is not when
you're prototyping so where are some
examples of pica polishing pixel perfect
you I own in the user experience is
they're all like really positive things
these are great way it's time to do it
so the traditional mindset here is going
to embrace feature polishing is given of
course that's how we're building our
code why would we build anything less
why aren't we shipping our best possible
code every time that's personal mindset
and that usually is how you should work
unless you're prototyping so prototyping
looks at good enough builds a good
version quickly focus on quality where
it matters when its kita validation sure
we don't want to write bad code this is
not rewriting crappy code this is just
we're writing good enough code or
implementing a feature just well enough
to validate and be a solid foundation to
build upon that's what we want polishing
a feature that gets removed or changed
his waist and we don't want to waste so
we don't to polish early and really when
I think about it you gain more value by
validating your next feature than
polishing something that's good enough
there's a point where that might change
but you'll know and then you can say
okay now it's time to polish these
things because they're really really
good and that's fine but you have to
make sure you're at that point and not
just because that's how you always
develop software so true perfect as the
enemy of good enough as I've seen this
quote like in 100 variation over time
it's a great one it's a great one to
think about when you're thinking about
feature polishing so we're on to our six
key here which is understanding
trade-offs so what happens when our
experiment succeeds
becomes production code it's likely to
happen and we need to know how to
proceed so the thing I think about once
features been validated you have some
options here you could stick with what's
good enough that's fine we could
certainly do that until it's more where
there is enough business value or reason
motivation to make it better you could
polish what you have if that's just a
problem that's great you can modify
based on feedback so maybe there's some
adjustments you need to make or maybe
you rewrite it because you learned a lot
about how this feature should function
and now you know a better way a way that
you want to implement now so you can go
forward with it so it's totally fine to
rewrite it if that's what's valuable of
course you can remove it if the feature
failed but we're looking at features
that had some validation and worked
mention cost fallacy and this is
something to be aware of so some cost
fallacy if you're not familiar with it
I'll use an example of let's say you go
out and buy a case of Twinkies and just
said that's a good idea and you love
Twinkies so you start eating Twinkies
and then maybe you've eaten a quarter of
the case and you start feeling bad so
you get a doctor and they talk to a
doctor about your feeling bad he's
asking you what's going on with it
changes lately and you're like oh I
started eating Twinkies a lot of
twenties every day because I bought this
case of them and be like well you gotta
stop eating Twinkies because that's
killing you it's making you feel bad so
stop doing that like oh okay all right
so you go home and you look at the case
of Twinkies and even though the doctor
told you that it's bad for you you
shouldn't be twinkies anymore you need
to cut it out you're like inside your
head i just paid a lot of money for this
case of Twinkies I'm not going to waste
my money I'm going to eat the Twinkies
that's a sunk cost fallacy and the thing
is this applies in lots of places in our
lives but especially in software if
you've invested a lot of time and effort
into building some code or some some
feature or whatnot you don't want to
just throw it away because you invested
so much but if you get to the point
where it's clear this is now liability
it's not helping your product it's not
good you should get rid of it don't
imagine the value you've sung
into it as a good enough reason to keep
it around if you have other reasons to
get rid of it so beware this in costs
policy the other one I think is really
important and I stress with my team is
for every shortcut you put in you have
to have a strategy to make it right so
if you're prototyping you're making
shortcuts and you're thinking of ways to
more quickly validate your features
that's great except for at some point
you're going to have to fix those if
those features stay in you have to have
strategies before you get going because
you don't want to paint yourself into a
corner and maybe choose a bad shortcut
and now it's too difficult or too
painful for you to now remove it think
about that before you go forward with
your shortcut and the final piece here
is about unfinished parts and when I'm
prototyping on a project we have this
conversation before you can get started
especially important for the product
owner is that we need to understand that
we will be leaving unfinished parts
behind so we need to be able to go back
and finish them so don't think that once
something's down validated okay let's go
to production let's place crank it up
and the volume like well let's make sure
that all the unfinished parts that are
important need to get in there so you
have that conversation with your team
about that so question about what can
you do that completes our six points
I've talked about a number of things
here that you could use and put into
practice it may be that some of your
environments and I don't know if is true
for you because most of you raise your
hand that you're doing prototype
released early stage development you may
not be able to do all the things I
mentioned here today and that you know
that's you know it is what it is and
hopefully you can see what you can apply
and you can have conversations with the
team and with other stakeholders back at
your place where you can determine if
there's something they might be open to
I encountered this story not too long
ago about ING Bank which is a
Netherlands bank a multinational
corporation that is pretty much firmly
in the enterprise and they adopted this
new model called scaling agile which I
had only heard about recently and the
short version is that these are small
cross functional teams of the cul squads
that own their customer facing product
in the end so these teams have people
like business folks marketing business
analysts you know data analytics
whatever alongside engineers designers
all working together a small team like
maybe nine or ten people and they're
responsible for everything so they
totally can do all these practices in
their little slice of their service so I
think this is really fascinating because
here's a enterprise corporation that has
a doctor to cross its organization and
it's very encouraging to see this
because if they can do it then what
other organizations you know what could
they do could they adopt us as well and
I think the answer is yes so if you want
to go out you can google this there's
plenty of information on scaling add you
to look at by ng it's also known as like
a Spotify method are still going a
Spotify the one who sort of prototype
this I guess but it's very interesting
so go look it up so so applying these
ideas a few ideas I want to leave you
with before we jump into questions which
is I think you should invoke Agni
whatever it makes sense that's something
you can do I think I don't a project you
can reduce the complexity of your
solutions I think that's an opportunity
you have regardless of whether you get
to talk about scope and how you measure
your progress and focus learn focus on
learning and type feedback loops so
always push to have the type feedback
loop you can and to always be learning
about what really works for users and
what does it all right thank you so
questions
no questions really yes
okay right so the the question is you
know when I talked about getting your
code to users as fast as possible was I
meaning end users I me a select group of
users and the answer is it's definitely
the end users it could be initially when
you're starting off these would
typically be early adopters so these are
people that really have the problem
you're solving and are willing to work
with a very early alpha of your product
people that are probably a little more
sympathetic to your to your cause to
your major founders whatnot but they
have the problem so it's not just the
product owner it's not just the internal
team QA whenever it is somebody who
actually would use the software and you
get to there as soon as you can so
typically I would want to see maybe two
or three weeks we have something that
these people can use possibly maybe not
that fast depending on how fast you can
prototype you might be a little further
um but as soon as possible like like one
feature is ready or two features are
ready and that's it I want to see users
play with it I want to see them use it
and get feedback from them
right so the question you have is that
you might lose the trust and the
interest of these users if you ship
something too early that so flawed that
they'll be like blow you off because
it's not not worth it so the answer is
if your product isn't that compelling
that these key features because I'm
we're talking about shipping the key
features first we're not talking about
shipping oh you can log in and change
your profile or something like that you
know like we don't care about that
that's that's sort of things we need to
do but that's not that's not the value
proposition of your product the value
prop whatnot so if if they get that
feature and they're pretty men on it
that's a really damaging sign that that
Wow maybe our product isn't that
interesting after all I mean it's up to
you to decide is this feature actually
usable I'm not talking about you know
you've got one or two screens I'm
talking about a feature that's
invaluable on its own so like you know
whatever your product does hopefully you
can min from with something quickly that
they could play with and sure it's not
complete they can see how it's not fully
formed but they can also see how it's
solving their problems that they're
happy to play with it so you have to
find users that are willing to do that
and they do exist yeah yep yep I can't
you
sure so the question it as you're
building out these new features you
eventually get them to production and
then there you have the production app
out there but you still have new
features that are going to be going
through a similar process how do you do
that and get it out there and maybe not
disrupt with in production right well
there are a number of ways and you
definitely can do this so so one
possibility if something is so you know
unfinished you might use something
called feature flags where you keep this
new feature that is really half-baked
hidden from your existing users that are
using the product so this is like a more
mature fix they're probably post MVP
right that you would say you want to do
something new but it's not quite ready
for everyone well you can have feature
flags to have only a small number of
users have access to it in production
and then as you're seeing success then
you can flip the bit and more users
across your entire product to start
using and you can definitely do that in
any any mature product platform or
product as well so that's that approach
i would say that also in general you are
constantly ship stuff so if you have an
environment where you can't ship
features really quickly so like we we
ship several times a day typically and
it you know it's effortless so maybe
it's a 5-10 minute process to get things
out again because we're prototyping we
don't have a large huge codebase so
that's that's that's feasible and when
you're in that phase you can really ship
quickly and most of the people are using
this when you're like in an alpha they
understand that things might break and
so the idea is that well things might
break cook you also can credibly quickly
so they understand this though anything
stays broken it seem to stay broken for
it very long if you don't have the
ability to shift quickly then you'd want
to be a little more careful but I think
at that point you're not really
prototyping right you're in a different
way of being anyone else
alrighty well thank you everyone I'm
happy to take more questions or talking
with an offline about this if you would
