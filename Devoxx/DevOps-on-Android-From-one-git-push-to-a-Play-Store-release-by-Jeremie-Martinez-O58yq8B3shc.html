I'm glad to see so many people
interesting in Android development in
devoxx so thank you for joining my name
is Jaime Martinez you can find me on
Twitter on my blog you can find on the
slide so back to the torte
the main idea is to show to demonstrate
that nowadays with the right tools the
right methodology we can now achieve a
full pipeline to release from one get
purge to pester with ease so first a bit
about where I work I'm working a captain
train obvious terms Android application
does anyone know about us or what we do
some ok so basically we sell 20 kids
around Europe from as many carriers as
possible so the idea is to provide a
user experience that the current
carriers cannot provide so we are
together with a back-end team trying to
integrate as many carriers as possible
so it's going well we have been acquired
back in February by a train line and so
basically we are still doing the same
thing we are just underlings European
train and they are doing the UK market
so we recruit for most opposition so if
you interested don't hesitate to reach
me after the talk so let's start with
the conclusion it's important to
understand that process is dependent
context what I would pretend today works
very well
I already implementing values project a
captain train for instance we huge a
huge part of it but it remains an
objective it's a long path to reach this
level of maturity on CI process on
Android so it would really depend on
your team your application your company
everything on the context is important
so see it more like a recipe that works
for me
take whatever you can that you find
useful to be able to reuse it in your
case but yes this tolki most about to
feedback but what I implemented at
captain train and what is working for us
so if we take another look at my tolls
title what do we call DevOps so let's
take a definitions it promotes the
release process which bring together
through communication and collaboration
both development and operational teams
well we can see that there is a program
here I don't have in a personal team
when I'm working on an Android
application the only thing I have is a
famous and feared developer console so
please stop console I'm very sure how
many Android developer are in the room
please
okay so many how many have written in an
app professionally like not on a weekend
project a pet project okay so mustard
okay great
so the idea is really to see how we can
interact with the Play Store but before
going to the priest oh you must have a
good continuous integration so let's
make sure we have the same definition
first for me it's automatic build you
must stop the pit works only on my
machine
second the build will fail fast so you
will be able to fix it fast so you will
guarantee you always have a working
build and it's really important then
your build with already tasted so you
can ensure quality and a low vision then
if you have a constant packaging you can
avoid you manual if it's always it
always package the same way there is no
reason it won't work so that you need it
and finally every release since you are
a bit more confident in your process and
you trust it you will avoid by surprises
and you will have a reserve risk so why
I'm talking about continuous integration
and you will see it's some part of my
talk like 10-15 minutes it's because
that's the source of a solid process
maybe it's obvious for you I think you
are devoxx you you probably know about
continuous equation stuff and and things
like that but that's not what I see in
Paris when I meet customers and stuff
like that there are not really I still
see people building a PK on the machine
and just not using testing and stuff
like that so that's why this is
important to have a reminder about it
it's something that grows a lot recently
like the last two years and but I still
see some project neglected so yeah so we
take some times to see how we can have a
solid process for the continued
saturation so here's a very start of pop
flying I guess nothing fancy so I kept
him trained we use get lab as a want
equation server but there are many
others that were perfectly fine Jenkins
CI circle CI Travis CI goo CD and so on
github is a very good tool and we were
already using it for the sauce
management so we just go with it went
with it because yeah back-end was using
it and stuff MZ also so let's start with
the first step which is a push how we
work at captain training we have two
branches one dev one master when we may
up dev into master we tag and then that
correspond to it is then when we want to
write a new feature we make a branch
write some code commits then if you want
to merge it into dev you have to be
always be based so you base the stuff is
over the branch and then you can we can
manage it and this feature will later
merge into the master process ensues the
master branch time so after a few rules
we have a merge request is mandatory we
is always at least one reviewer
your branch must always be based and
with and every merging is done with a
match commit so enough as for a while
it's always the reverse that will be is
that we mount the branch we used to say
that if there is a bug in production 51
percent of the responsibility is for
developers that implemented the future
49 percent is for the river so it's we
since we have a small team will remain
everything ourself create human testing
and stuff like that so it's important to
bring everybody on board about the
responsibility that we share cross
project and of course a branch has
already busy waste once again nothing
fancy the next step is the build so here
we have to build the debug and release
the debug is done the dev branch the
release done with the master branch we
of course used weather I don't know if
anyone is using something else than
cuddle it's probably not to buy is the
best idea right now it's fully supported
by Google it's really maintain its
upgrading a lot recently and there is
really no reason to use anything else we
also use docker to build our IP km the
CI so so it was a French one every build
is related we have different
architecture possible and finally we
have no power the thing is before we had
to connect to the CI server we didn't
have the financial use Android team
because we don't use it so much so being
able to build with docker let us make it
as able to really easily work and to
really have the power to upgrade GK and
stuff like that then the next type is a
testing so firstly if you doubt it yes
we test even on Android 4 so you need
tests basically it has been here for
more than two year we finally a virgin
for some taxes before we are just a unit
for it which is really paying us to say
little so we also have something called
robolectric who does know about warlike
chickens at room okay so just a minor
robolectric basically is a way to test
your Android code directly on a GVM it
will shadow some classes from some rich
family plot them in the in the GBM Ringo
unit ID you know you unite testing and
you will be able to test some stuff you
have to be really careful about your
electric because most of the time when
you are interacting with android
framework you are not testing using zone
read framework you are using a shadow
that is not the real code so be careful
about it and what i say a lot is you
have to test you code that is using zone
with family not to test on read
framework i saw a lot of people trying
to test i don't know the lifecycle of an
activity or package manager and stuff
like that so that's really not a good
idea just stick with with testing you
use of the framework for instance I use
it a lot for testing my pass syllable
just an example so does it works it's
really easy
that's a good point it's a dependency
and then you have to add to annotation
the first one is at one with that you
will be able to to run robotic test
basically the second one is a config
where you will be able to to add some
configuration like where is the past of
the manifest which says DK you want to
run your test on and stuff like that
integration test so there was this
debate like some years ago like one two
years ago espresso Robuchon that is not
anymore
really espresso is really once again
maintained supported and upgrading with
Google so it's really the beta to
actually to to work
integration test so integration test
instrumentation test and to end I mean
that probably I was the same he has to
run on the device so yep my my opinion
is that for integration test most of the
time you only want to test the main user
flow it depends where you are in your
project that for instance at captain
triangulation we are changing a lot of
stuff all the time
so maintaining our as tradition test
would be just not possible I mean we
have two and a half people in the team
right now so it would take two too many
times but I think when you reach this
point in your project where you are
maintaining in that you know creating it
it's a good idea because yeah you will
avoid revision and stuff like that
for instance of captain train so as I
said we sell 20 cats so what I want to
be able to test is search the book out
so be able to book a ticket to pay a
ticket and finally to see my ticket and
be able to travel with it so that's what
we will test it's really yes the main
flow and why our user on learning our up
yeah that's the main idea because if you
are familiar with train you know the
fails are really complicated this is an
all industry and I couldn't test that
every card and with discount card with
every route is working well so we just
try to have a test that will ensure that
our main goal is always verified and
checked in Australia and that's--it's
was test a bit about the quality for
instance when I said earlier that the
caption when we implemented a huge part
of it of the processor we presented a
this is the case where we didn't we
don't choose what I will present because
we are small team and we have huge and
in death
car reviews so really count on that to
be able to to maintain our cleanliness
of the code I would say but there are
some tools that can help you especially
if you have a lot of junior developers
in your team or if you have I don't know
if you are alone I mean that happens a
lot to me before I just was a one guy
doing some with the application so I
need someone to verify or something that
I'm not just writing bad stuff so sonic
qube is the one it's really two basic
aliy it will groups words that you share
with your team or that you shell and it
will monitor you Java code and do some
taxes analysis not static analysis so
you will be able to retrieve some else
any catch about your project what you
want really application code base it's
very easy to set up and I'm pretty sure
most of you already know about it so
just a Gradle plug-in to add and gradual
tax to run and it's working perfectly
then you have linked so does anyone does
everyone know about lint or what is lint
on Android okay so lint is a tool
associated with Sondra weed that will
monitor you could to find errors and
warning on really specific undo it
problems for instance when you want to
use a method but it knows it is not
available for the Android version you
are supporting for instance I don't know
I want to use a method available in 18
in API 18 I am just reporting 16 so that
will be a crush on the 16 and 17 IP API
and the N devices so it will say ok yeah
you are doing something bad it will also
help you with runtime permission fine
stamps you say ok I access something
about the contacts of your device and
you didn't ask for the permissions it's
this isn't dangerous runtime permission
you have to make it validated by the
basic user so it will raise an an arrow
and say ok here's is something wrong
also you
and finally an example I have is when
you are Co the string it raised a
warning saying okay one day you will
probably want to be multilingual it will
be really difficult because yeah you
should not utter it wrong but what lets
people know is that you can go really
further actually you can implement your
custom link so what is a custom link is
basically implementing your own link
rules so this is a classic Java project
that will have a task from SAMHSA's
weather that will have a task that will
install your jar that in the dot on grid
/ lint I think and you would see the we
saw some code that it's really simple
and it really can help your team for
instance the issue will try to detect a
is every attribute that we write in our
unreal application must be prefixed by
city to make sure we all void clashes
with other library you could use so the
first thing is to extend a detector yeah
I extend the resource XML detector but
there are lot of detectors like Java
detector by the class detector
translation detector sourly Google is
already providing a lot of detector that
you can just plug in and extend a bit
too much to behavior but it's really
easy for the issue when you create it
you have to pass an ID so a teacher not
prefixed you must explain what you are
checking so you must prefix your custom
hgr by city you may explain why you are
doing it actually
so we prefix all our teachers to hot
flashes finally you provide the category
at a priority and severity and then you
links implementation you have with the
scope the scope is where should I go it
helps me to say okay I should look at
the resource I scope so it's all suffice
but you can say also the Java files the
class files and stuff
flex that once you have you issue in the
a resource XML detector it's really easy
it's almost filters the first one is
okay I want to look only I add XML files
the second one is I just want to looks
as a folder values then you say I just
want to look at the a teacher tags and
in the ITTF tags i want to look at the
name actually attributes and once you
filter everything when you write the
visit element method you have the good
stuff so you are returning your
attribute node check getting the value
and if it doesn't start with on the
widow with city you will report an issue
so when you report an issue you provide
the issue with which it before the
constant the node where it happens and
what they call a location and another
definition it will helps the IDE to
display a warning directly inside with
this information and to locate where why
you have the problem so actually
interesting the final step is to create
another class which is called an issue
registry one stands in Captain friends
equipped internal is free and you
provide the list of issue you are
supporting that's where the link will go
it will retrieve also issue addressed to
extension and will also issues and then
you'll be able to generate a custom
report and the research will look
something like that
so usability in the typography step and
you have then the explanation so please
do not underestimate the link rules are
really powerful and they can really be
useful I see men in to use case the one
the first one is you have a junior team
for instance and you want to be shows I
respect sir will you created or you are
integrating new people and you want to
make sure they use the same code rules
around among the project in Android you
can write the link rules to make sure
that another use case I have is when you
provide a new library for instance and
open-source library
you want to make sure that the
developers that are using it use it the
right way so basically you provide your
link fools that taking that can be
installed and then they're able to see
okay that's how the library
Menten as things of stuff so I should
follow
well it's good practice and then
packaging so nothing fancy again first
filter your hostesses ProGuard you use
your apk your codebase it's not about
the efficient stuff because there is no
real secure channel without saying it's
more about to get the method and the
class you are not choosing but that I've
available in the library to make us be
apk smaller a symbol sangmoo ipk and
finally zip a line about the same stuff
don't lose the Keystone it happens so
front of mine is difficult then zip our
new apk a small tip IQ I could give is
if you use the dot the darts dead for
option it will use another algorithm to
zip a line which is I think it was free
time low slower but since you are
building your PK it doesn't really count
at this moment but it reduces a PSI from
two to five percent so it can just be I
mean it's free sigh sigh saving so don't
hesitate I think I've algorithm in
scholars apply to to be clear okay then
we have a good continuous integration at
the end of the continuous integration we
have an LP k what do we do now
so the first step is to do continuous
delivery so what do I call continuous
delivery basically I call it the
function is automate releases in order
to deliver quickly easily and reliably
okay so Maxim's what about the
continuous deployment
okay so my advice is continuous
development deployment on native Android
app is not really a good idea I see two
three main reason I think the first one
is too many updates every time you
update you up user notification so if a
user sees too many or update like I
don't know every day every two hours
probably you can you will start to ask
question I mean why is the updating so
so many so many times I mean is our bug
can I trust them also the single saw is
about the bandwidth if you are working
for an app for some countries it could
be difficult for them to be able to
download every update you have so be
careful about it the other stuff is
about marketing so when you don't have
enough content between to release it's
really difficult to write some release
notes and actually is not as something
that is pretty much read by the user on
Play Store and they are really
interesting it so we really use it at
caption trained as a marketing marketing
yeah marketing way to to market our up
basically and it can be really useful to
have some content and to be able to see
okay we take like a half on this with
with our user and say okay here's the
news don't worry didn't forget it forget
you our be still on maintenance we are
still using it so don't don't be afraid
we are still working on it so what I
what I want to sum up is being able to
release every hour every commit every
day is not something you always want to
do you have to be careful it's not
because you can do it that you want to
do it so just be careful about it and
sing about your use case and stuff like
that obviously depend where you are in
your project if you are working in right
now and you are creating it you will
probably have to confront you to the
production
faster okay so we talked about really
sort of the beginning of the tool but
what is the release for you for you for
me it's really simple it's some steps a
better step then I roll out from five to
100 percent
it happens on two weeks first week for
the beta which is composed only of I
don't know 100 people maybe that are
huge traveler by train that use your app
almost every week at least and they they
try it up a lot so we can have a good
feedback about it and then we have this
world for one week so one day each day
weeks we increase the percentage it's
done every six weeks on Tuesday so why
well why six weeks at the beginning it
was four weeks because four weeks will
work for for us it's a good time between
having like as I don't want evil with
you with the user be able to keep them
alert outside and also six week is large
enough to be able to ship fully future
where we all feature we we see that
right now we have some problem because
our future are taking a lot of love a
lot of time to be implemented so six
weeks is really perfect for us and why
on Tuesday because not on Friday and
because Tuesday was really great for us
because also Jim is in the office at
this moment and also it has a reputation
to be the best marketable day so we went
on Tuesday but as I said depending on
your own your company so when we want to
release basically the sale earlier we
merge them into master then it claims
the continuous integration process and
then the continuous delivery process so
the continuous delivery process is
composed of two main parts the first one
is the screenshot and then drives the
publisher but the screenshot the funny
thing I say I can say is don't neglect
it
it's really useful especially for
start-up like us to learn some
conversion
it really helps and if you have bad
screenshot you can really deserve you so
be careful be careful about it so but
for instance at captain train we are
linked we are managing five languages we
takes a screenshot for each languages
and we have four devices the one five
the tablets events Dublin line and the
way so that makes a lot of screen shot
almost 200 so we automated it how we did
it we used I mean we did it like two
years ago it was done by someone called
fluffy Aloha in my team it was a gnome
made tool with a UI you to my top we are
right now thinking about changing this
stuff but it works for us it works
really well but there are no other tools
you can use on the market so if you are
using spoon with you want instruction
test there is no reason to not reuse a
screenshot it's sticking to use to
reduce them on the Playstore and then
also this tool screen grab by Fastlane
that is working very great and is
open-source and is doing bye-bye Twitter
so you should check it out and then zai
is a public so the publish my first idea
was how can I avoid bite surprises
because after all I'm dealing with
prediction and whenever captain train I
see that my colleagues way of testing
some stuff manually and I was like ok
now we can continue to do that
so what are you actually testing
manually what are you afraid of the
first thing the welfare is permission so
when you bump a library the library we
can drink
permission you didn't want and you will
see it only when you program the pistol
so the idea is to check them on a unit
unit test so it's really easy
I can show some code basically I got an
eye test we retrieve from the merge
manifest or the permission the male's
manifest is before building you are you
ipk the Android build system will which
we've also Android manifest from your
library we are using it including on it
will merge them into a single one and
then it will be bundled into a PK so the
idea is to just retrieve this I speak at
this moment and which of all the
permissions has and compare it with the
one you want and if there is a mismatch
we felt a bit sorry then there was
testing a lot database upgrade upgrade I
think most of us have a persistent
solution in the up it's almost monetary
nowadays so we probably have a SQLite
database or we all know very well but
you have some glove upgrades so I would
also in unite test to do this so
basically we just import GDB GDB see
sorry tiger and then we watch our
watching an eye test so this Unitas is
we create a GPO panel bar that just
representing the SQLite database then we
use on key at Midford on a new database
from squad database that has nothing in
it and then we use on a breath method on
the origin database from the version 1
to the current version of the trees the
original database is the database in the
state of our first 3ds in generate
application then from this to database
so we have one database suite from
scratch with all such key as a schema
and one database upgrading every upgrade
we all we ever released they should be
the same so we extract the two schema
from them and we compare them if there
is a mismatch we fight the build to
extract the schema is really simple we
will prove the connection with
the driver obviously and then the method
that we are able to use the table we
build like a string which which is more
like a key actually of an energy fire of
our application of our table sorry
with the table type and the table name
double type because you can with this
method you also retrieve the views if
you have some once it's done we do
exactly the same for all the color of
all the table we build another that
identifier sorry with the column name
the type names reasonable and default we
build this the string which is basically
yeah it's really identify this : and we
add it to the schema so at the end we
have everything we have a set of string
that where each string represent as a
table or column and exactly what is
table and what is the current our schema
but you can go further if you wish you
can have primary keys cross references
and annex and almost every single data
ok so once I removed all the things that
were fed off we can go to the pistol so
I let's start with a small game to
opinion what does this tiny arrow does
yeah do anyone as an idea
exactly yeah actually it's not select
the percentage it selects the track you
want to to release so if you want to
resume the production on beta rollout
you will then have to choose but I mean
it's really not obvious and it can be
really tricky and I would assume that
something like that like the percentage
of the lot would be asked later but no
it's really asked there and I mean it
really happened it already happened on
in our this process we click on it and
say of what 100 percent sorry so yeah
this is just an example how the priest
or console can be tricky and that's not
a task you want to use man to do because
you might forgot you might make mistakes
oh yeah another one is okay let's say
you have to issue a PK to 5% and then
you need to do our tricks when you
publish it again you have this dialogue
what does the publish know to production
though does it I mean does it release to
5% or to 100% the the truth is it
reduced to 5% so it does a good thing
but when you click it you don't know and
you are always afraid of clicking okay
okay hopefully it will work as I wish
but I don't know about it
see this is just another example sorry
this is just another example of why the
concern can be tricky and you have to be
careful when you click on it so we
wanted to remove this step so it works
very easily you have to first go to the
first console which is a developer
console you create a new project you
enable the Google API Android developer
is a Google Play Store Android developer
API then you go to create a new
credential you take the service icon key
one which will make you download a JSON
file that will be that we will use that
off so you save it and you then you you
continue the process then you go to the
Play console you go to settings API
access and then you link your project so
if since that's the same account you
will see that all the project from the
developer console available in the Play
console and you can link them or earning
them it allow you to use the same
publisher on several application and to
use several publisher on the same
application so you can do whatever you
want physically then you choose a client
so Google provide an HTTP API but you
can also provide the Java Ruby and
Python so you can choose whatever you
want I will go with the Java because I
assume everyone here is familiar with
Java sunscreen unknown we'd talk
so we use this dependency with the
version weak to the - ref 20 - 1.20 1.0
that nobody understand why but this is
the one you have to be up-to-date
because I changed it sometimes and then
we can start to script basically our
videos so first we achieve an HTTP
transport layer JSON Factory and then we
create a credential so for these
credentials that's where you JSON file
we downloaded from the developer console
earlier will be useful so you provide
the transposon Joosten factory of course
and then you provide a private key ID
which is in the JSON file then a service
I can't ID which is not in the sound
file it's you email address I didn't
know before writing so I have to try
some stuff to make it work then you for
the scope because this crenshaw could be
used for several scope in our case we
only ones on trade publisher and then
you provide the private key you deny
geologies which is injustice on file and
then finally you are able to create a
new publish publisher which you will
precise the package name and then you
will see it's always the same the naming
are quite bad I think but it works so
from the to be sure you achieve an edits
and it is basically a production manager
I mean that's how they should call it
but that's an edit then from Exedy from
these edits you insert a new package a
new a new transaction basically with the
package name and then from this
transaction which proved an I believe an
ID which is a transaction ID that will
be used on every call designer later
once you have you as I say one you have
this ID you can start publishing stuff
so the first thing is to retrieve the
listings you create a new listing the
listings you basically have the object
where you will hide your listing and
then you will commit it and it will be
reached so you create a listing and then
you update it with the package
directional ID the local for which you
are bleeding if you're blushing sorry
and the listing and then that's always
the same let's together for the images
so the screenshot you retrieve an object
images you create a new file content
which is you image with the mime type
and then you upload it with the package
selectional ID the locale for which you
are publishing and the type of the top
of the device every device is or is of
course available from five tablets even
tablet anywhere so everything can be
automated automated and then we go on on
the apks that's why you are twisting I
guess so where it Reeves the apk is we
create a new apk and then we upload it
with the package the transaction or ID a
new apk and we retrieve this subject
which is returned is an IP in a TK
because we want the version code because
the Russian con will also be used for
the later call once you publish your apk
you will assign we will assign it to
track so you will show your tracks to
create a new track with a version code
and then you update it with the package
directional ID and the type of tracks
you want here also several
also ones also all the one you need
production bailout beta and alpha and
finally yeah finally we have the article
listings so as replica listing
correspond to the what's new you haven't
christop so you retrieve an applique
listings you create a new one with your
wisdom gem so you watch new and then you
update it with the packet directional ID
the version of the apk the local you for
the local union and the content and then
you execute it final step we have we
need to validate basically our our
transaction to make sure everything will
go smoothly because Google has some
rules like you have to have a title less
than 32 character sinks you have a long
description that must be you have a
what's new for instance must be less
than 4 500 characters so it will check
that everything is okay on the table
this rule and then we'll be able to
commit the transaction which we actually
makes the release enter process so we
saw that we are able with this API to
update the listings the screenshot ATK's
what's new on the track so basically
everything you do action currently
directly with a click and drag on the
console so this trip is unmade I did it
like more than one year ago now but the
also stable solution that appears right
now so there is a Gradle plugin which
you can use I think Fastlane also I
didn't did slide but I think Fastlane
also working a tools to to be able to
upload to the please talk directly so
there is a greater plugin which is just
two tasks you have to run with the
configuration you want and then I is a
Jenkins is also Jenkins plugging a good
reason why we still use our omeg tools
its first we own it so you will know
what we are doing and we have some
constraint like so screenshot I'll store
on outside server where we really want
to go with our credential to which user
stuff so it would be difficult to use an
assault or battery and then we're done
so
we went from one push through a full
continuous integration process with
build test quality and packaging at the
end we generated an apk and then we get
we went to the continues delivery
process with taking the description
automatically and then publishing
everything on the pistil thank you it's
all for me
if you have any question I think we have
some times so don't hesitate there is a
mic over there if you want to use it
otherwise I would repeat the question so
yes so the question was did I consider
writing the tests will with the PIO and
and people that are more yeah okay
so at captain train we have three people
will start up so basically we do
everything so there is no Pio we have we
own our own product so so that's wait
but it means we are in charge of
maintaining the test making sure our
good for the product and developing the
future so we don't have this case of
synchronizing so since we own everything
but other side it depend on the case I
think it's great if you have a huge team
and you process with product owner that
is really implicating you know you know
team it's probably great to have someone
make sure making sure that the tests are
working well but he has to be a bit
technical because really on do espresso
testing are not really easily read or I
mean no one probably it's more it's not
the developer that has to write them so
yeah you have to be sure yeah and stuff
like that yeah exactly yeah I know but
yeah yeah that would be a good solution
I mean I don't have the program so again
I'm producing else but that would be a
good solution I think I know see a chasm
what's something about it so for us what
you can it is there other questions yes
sure
yeah if it can very easily yeah it
shapes and it reports to me okay it
fails because you you didn't make sure
that your title was less than such it
took a character so I fix it and then I
will put it so yeah I have to start the
Builder process by hand because I want
me again so yeah but we try to make sure
actually I have some you unite tests
that run on this project which makes
sure that all the content store from the
marketing always validate so yeah so I
don't have this program most of the
times very late just to make sure
everything is is met I never read yet
never felt in myself is there any other
question
oh yeah sorry agency you good question
we it's bad
we used to store it in the get in our
git repository no we store it in an
azure project which is encrypted which
we I mean yeah I'm not the one that did
it so I'm not really sure but I think we
store it in internals of get where it's
all encrypted and you have to have the
good write and stuff like that which and
the credential for this guitar on isto
on the CL machine that is not accessible
by everyone I think that's how we do it
but I am not very shocked to be honest
so we're done okay thank you for joining
and if you have any questions on Ted
duality to ask me later and have a good
meal</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
