to this private quickie session my name
is Olga I'm working as software engineer
at Sencha and today we'll talk about
JavaScript best friend or called ext J's
so this track is called modern web and I
will be talking about modern web for
enterprises so you may wonder why what
is for what is the difference what is
the point and the point is that
enterprises have a bit different
requirement for web application
development they would need to develop
fast complex business critical
applications that have to be alive for
several years so every award in this
definition is important and I would like
to explain them shortly
what means fast first means that to be
competitive enterprises have to shorten
time to market as well as release time
for every new version of their
application what makes application
complex applications complex when it has
many modules sub modules Congress or
even thousands of user stories many
years of development and huge codebase
and what makes application business
critical business critical is an
enterprise applications that have to be
stable and reliable and few changing
business requirements it's very often
when business critical applications need
to handle huge datasets huge business
datasets so be very data-intensive and
also here we could talk about product
development versus application
development enterprise have to define
all process of a new application release
how it will be deliberate plan and
schedule so here it's more like
delivering of product was delivered and
just web application and application
should be alive for several years so it
should be easy maintainable
scalable should follow all the new
modern techniques specification
standards and should work with all new
browsers and devices you could not lose
users that installed the latest version
of Chrome for example and the center
suits profit linked to this enterprise
requirement because it provides friend
Bob JavaScript framework and all tool
surrounded that let you rapidly build
intensive cross-platform enterprise web
applications so framework called Exige S
it's really mature framework more than
10 years old and for web development
it's huge life long life and today's
release the release day for washing 6.5
and how extjs could help to handle this
business requirement enterprise business
requirement the exegetical has a huge
amount of robust building components
optimized to work with huge data sets to
handle this huge data sets we have an
advanced data package that could be
considered to communicate with server
using different protocol received it in
different format and it could be
basically integrated with any back-end
or database it's completely
cross-platform framework so it supports
all browsers from modern one down to
Internet Explorer 8 at 9 and in
enterprises it could be critical to
support legacy browsers because of
security reasons they could not just
upgrade and you could really develop one
application with one code base and cover
all devices desktops tablets and
smartphones and we have advanced class
system and architectural patterns that
lets you make your application more
scalable and maintainable siminoff 60
dress application is extremely easy so
it will look like changing some
parameters like phone scholars in a
graphical UI
there is also a lot of tools around
framework that allows you to build
debugger inspect test and senior
application and what is really hot now
we also support modern web features like
progressive web app or new versions of
echo script so biggest advantage of exp
GS its robust components it has almost
everything that you may imagine Greece
Greece 3 Greece but pivot grids charts
calendars dashboards and all other
components and I would like to show you
just a couple of examples in real time
ok looks good it's a grid so we have
buffered grid when you have a huge data
set you could not just render all dating
and browsing a grid you could not for
example half 1 million records in any
table and what we are doing with support
buffered rendering so part of a data
render it at this time and when I start
scrolling like this new data will be
received from server requested from
server set from server and renderer so
and all the data that is not visible
somewhere from here will be removed from
a dome so do model is always small and
stable it will also support group and
filter insulting like locking some
accounts on the left side and scroll on
the right side columns widget Road
widget so you could basically insert any
widget inside of row boarding yeah all
other stuff and you could also export
all data into Excel with formatting and
trick parties this one is normal desktop
grid and if I would change device to eye
patch for example just make it
one and go to fresher page and increase
of course sighs yeah
like this yes so we have an iPad view so
our grid we have the same grid but it's
adjusted to iPad view that's 100%
working better and it supports all look
and feel of our tablet application like
momentum scrolling you could scroll your
applications all widgets are the same
roll widget Collin widget checkboxes
also sorting grouping like show some
columns or heights and columns group
basis fields for example yeah I guess
ideas run a column to group by but any
date any case and you it's a great
component and another component that I
wanted to show you it's calendar
component you could drag and drop
different events for example have
different calendars configured could
have month week work week or day view
you could also validate if some events
could overlap but it's not allowed
depending on your business rules so back
all components are perfectly compatible
to each other you could integrate them
as you want the optimize to work with
huge data sets if you are interesting
you I could show you a grid with 1
million rows and they could be easily
customized as I said you could really
develop one application single codebase
and cover all devices but of course you
could have different use for different
devices here I'll show you showed you
agreed so grid could be for tablets
could be for desktops but for example if
you would have the same application for
phones you would use lists instead of
grid because it's easier for phones you
could also have completely different
builds for different devices as a
runtime framework will detect device and
serve only needed code for this device
and like common techniques like
responsive design also supported you
could use them and we have all the
classes that will need it for managing
data like models stores fields with
different types you could use different
proxies to communicate with server using
Ajax JSONP REST API and others readers
and writers to read data from JSON XML
array and you could basically configure
your own reader that will get data from
any any possible in any possible format
associations it's like one-to-one
one-to-many many-to-many association and
if you have internal dependencies in the
data validators to handle data
constraints create update destroy
operations could be bench it together
into session for package data
manipulations to handle transactions for
example architectural pattern so it to
just help you to organize clean code
separation you could use
different patterns like model view
viewmodel model view control to separate
your cord and it could be really
extremely important for complex
enterprise applications not like just
simple calculator or I don't know Stock
Exchange and you could also use data
binding to simplify source code of your
applications two-way data-binding this
formulas is also supported seaman so
similar for extjs application is based
on stars and tactically awesome CSS or
CSS with variables or some additional
like mix-ins
we have several predefined themes like
material design theme iOS seam but you
could extend them and configure them in
a graphical interface change a simmer
just in change variables change colors
for buttons for grid head of background
colors etc and we also provide a
JavaScript based SAS compiler code
fashion that could compile SAS into CSS
directly in a browser and you could see
in your application without page reload
just change some variables and in the
browser session will compile into CSS
and you will see all changes so runtime
Seaman tooling as I said there is not
only just framework but also other tools
around that could increase your
development speed or improve application
quality essential command allows you to
build minimize application architect
it's a special tool that lets you
develop your application just by drag
and draw and drop in different
components to the canvas configuring
them and it will generate all code for
you you could also use different
plug-ins for your favorite ideas that
will allow you to generate code to code
Auto completion or refactoring of your
code inspector allows you to inspect and
Dibakar each serious application similar
I told you and also we have a tool that
to help you to create unit and
end-to-end test for application as well
as like special event recorder when you
record tests based on user interactions
okay and what is now very popular with
support that must grip the new versions
of Eknath grip 6 and we support
progressive about features like that
allows you your web application look and
behave like native applications for
example start run your application from
an icon at home screen or support
offline mode using service workers and
all these features could be supported
just by some considerations you do not
need to manually code your service
workers you just tell that this part of
application should be cached and
everything will be done for you so it's
really a complete framework it includes
basically everything that you may need
to develop application class system data
package layout data binding area support
wrote rotors charts seams touch devices
support etc and it's really fast and
stable framework very well tested to run
about 10000 automated tests every day
and nothing used in the nearest time we
are going to release make our components
available for react and angular users so
it will be separate products called the
exterior act and ext angular component
library that will include all the xes
components and this components could be
natively used in vector or angular
applications so react
ext react will be released next week and
angular part will be released a bit
later so just summary who is using
sensor we have about ten thousands
customers to million developers more
seven million for the downloads and half
million active form members and there is
just customers just to give an idea what
kind of companies are using Exige S so
that's all I have a one and half million
for questions so if you have some I
could answer otherwise just come to our
booth it's just near lunch place so we
could talk and I could show you more
components visualization components or
really huge grids thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
