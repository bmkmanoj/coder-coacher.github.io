and our hero has decided once again to
code on his in his office and yet
another side project yes at last it's
going to work this time I hope let's try
oh yeah five minutes later
farmers later
suddenly the door opens sorry suddenly
the door opens what the hell are you
doing it's his wife you still working at
2 a.m. you woke me up with your bloody
music wait honey only wait it's not what
you think it's not work it's it it's
actually a funny story so they don't
start it with a simple question can I
make two devices two laptops
oh by the way I borrowed your laptop can
I make two laptops communicate with each
other only using ultrasounds yeah and so
I got a bit carried away and I created a
musical instrument well with my super
nes remote and it's pretty nice I don't
care if you really wanted to use
ultrasound I would still be sleeping
right why are you doing this I really
don't get the point what's the purpose
welcome everyone my name is Massimo yeah
I'm a web developer and today I like to
talk about side projects and I'd like to
tell you about one side project one side
project I worked on last year so whether
is whether it fits in with my wife or
with my my girlfriend's you know the non
IT persons I always have a hard time
explaining the concepts of a side
project I'm always trying to say well
you know it's it's kind of a pleasure
and actually well first I have a hard
time explaining what I do for a living
I'm like okay mmm I build websites
trying to avoid the you know printer on
Windows installation
most of the time people are like yes is
the IT guy so it's a bit hard should
remember you some Christmas memories
maybe so when I tell my friends I spend
like four hours this weekend trying to
create a musical instrument with a very
nerdy device I don't always get well man
it's awesome you really know how to
spend your free time
really nice no most of them most of the
time I get you're such a nerd
what's the point of this crap so this
kind of reaction really drives me crazy
I mean I really get the impression that
we live in a world where everyone is
trying to organize his personal life
just like his personal professional life
and like everyone is trying to maximize
the return on investment of the travel
we are doing or when we are enjoying our
Abbey's and I understand the idea I'm
also trying to to maximize what I'm
doing on my free time but I think
there's a limit and I think we've come
to a point where we really want
everything to be useful and I really
don't like that the other reaction I
often have is people think I'm a
workaholic
well yes I sometimes sent email work
email and coded a few step forward for
clients on my free time but most of the
time when I'm working on a side project
it's completely different there's like
they daytime bbear you know on one side
working for clients solving problems
with building software and when I do
that I have the three famous constraints
you know being cheap being fast being
good and trying to explain to the
clients that they can't get the three of
them they only get to get to but and on
the other side there's nightlife you
know our weekend you know and on those
periods I don't have any constraints
at least I'm fixing I'm setting my own
rooms and that's why I think side
projects are awesome so I want to talk
about all the other reasons why side
projects are some an Indian we may
tickle a bit on why sometimes it's not
that great
so for that I'll shine I share my
ultrasonic adventure with you and it all
started with a side project a year ago
when we were with my ex colleague at
devoxx so imagine yourself in November
last year we are discussing having fun
and then we got to beat more sales and
back then we were working on a tooling
for presentation trainings just to
control us a set of slide deck so
basically it looks like this the tool we
were working on but it better right
because PowerPoint speaker mode is
really nice but the next slide is really
small the notes are like if I want to
move while I'm speaking I just don't
read what's written on key notes you
have the same kind of thing but you have
the Apple way so every font is thin it's
it looks cool but it's unreadable from
there the notes are so so small I can't
read them so what we are proposing is
more something like this so on the right
side I have the current slide and the
next slide and on the right I have some
cavatelli prompter so I have the notes
but not only the notes for the current
slide but the whole speech and it's
really nice when you want to create some
effects when going from one slide to
another so we also added a few timers
etc so how does it how does this work
it's basically a web app that you append
on your laptop it's the present of you
and on on the second you set up your
laptop in extended desktop mode so the
second screen is basically what's
projected here and on this I have a
second browser window that only displays
the slides
so everything is connecting connected
and everything is receiving Evans from
my remote so each time I'm pressing
slide next it's sending Evans to the
water window here and the browser window
here okay so that's pretty nice and I've
been using that for a few years it's the
same with the reveal.js
speaker mode etc but the problem is if I
want to do demos just like we all love
to see at a box I have to struggle with
this driving this guy crazy at least the
guys that are upstairs crazy why
everything is blinking it's not full HD
anymore and I have like 200 people
waiting for me to make sense of that
kind of UI so it's really a problem when
you want to do demo and still demos and
still have a present of you so what we
thought about was to keep the set up but
forget about the extended bestop mode
instead we're going to set up the
classic mirroring mode where what I see
here is exactly what I see there but
having that I don't have my presenter
view anymore so I still have my remote
sending only events here but now I have
a second machine so my wife's machine
sorry
so this is the Machine you see here and
basically it's it has the speaker view
details on it and on this one I have the
slides now I just need a way to make the
events because these remote is in
bluetooth with this machine but now I
need to send events from this machine to
this machine so it's easy right I have
Wi-Fi or something but I still need a
way to transmit it between two web pages
so daytime uber was like okay let's do
WebSocket I have already used it I know
a few libraries it works well no
surprises it's okay so putting WebSocket
between the two machines would mean that
I need a client
on each machine but I would need a
server right in between so I was a bit
disappointed by that at least day time
River was disappointed by that and
that's where I think in site projects
you have time to make some discoveries
so that's why they are awesome and I was
thinking about stuff I saw in a few
conference notes at devoxx and other
conferences I remember hearing about
WebRTC and I was like I think we're
hearty she can help me removing the
server part and made two web pages
communicate with each other without any
server between just like that so I
looked into WebRTC anyone knows about
WebRTC okay so if you know everything
about it you can fall asleep there will
be sound afterwards to wake you up
it's not a talk about WebRTC obviously
but I just want to share a bit how it
works and a few basics so for those we
don't know where RC has often been
labeled as the Skype for the browser
it's web technologies that enable you to
do audio video chat with just HTML and
web standards without any plug-in etc if
you want a good example it's tolki and
using it for my conferences with my ex
colleagues and it works really well so
you have every every details you need in
the specifications at the web RTC about
the API in the browser etc and you have
all the protocol definitions at the IETF
so basically web RTC is known for audio
video but you can also transfer any
arbitrary data and that's what really
interests me like you know you know
technology everyone is is using it for X
but I want to use it for y right so I
stumbled upon something called web
torrent which is exactly using the
sharing arbitrary data between
bitches so if you go to that page you
can see a movie so it's a creative
common movie obviously and actually the
bits of the movie are loaded from many
other people that also open the page so
just like any any torrent download but
directly in your in your webpage without
any any plugins so I think it's a great
opportunity to open up new ideas on the
web to decentralize it with so I was
interested in in the same technology to
transfer arbitrary data between him and
him so I could do slide next so let's
take a small example for web ad C so we
have John in Chinese because why not
they are on the same local network and
they both have local IP address ok so
what I need to do now to initiate a
direct connection between the two
machines is for John to create what we
call an offer okay and so it's basically
a way for John to say ok we are going to
do audio video and a few details about
the connection we want to set up and
then Johnny's needs to send back an
offer so we have to do a round trip
between the two machines and on top of
that because John needs to say to
Johnny's a my IP is this I can talk in
ipv4 or ipv6 UDP TCP etc John will send
what we call ice candidates so it's a
candidate is the world around where
which Chinese can contact John so an IP
a port TCP UDP etc obviously Chinese
needs to do the same so she's sending
yeah sending back a few ice candidates
and once the round trip has been done
we'll be able to set up a connection so
in an offer and in an answer you have
this you have to send all those data so
you have fingerprints
IPE stuff and a nice candidates
containing this so again you can see an
IP
you d be somewhere etc in a port so to
transmit this from there to there one
time and then the other way I would be
able then to establish a direct
connection but so I'll do a small demo
sorry so here we're gonna pretend
there's two machines here on the right
it's Chrome for John and on on the left
sorry and on the right it's Firefox for
Chinese so the small demo I built to
really get into the low-level API is was
just to create a connection so I could
send evidence so when I create the offer
I'm just serializing the big stuff I was
showing you with the SDP
and the candidates so I'm sending them
to Janice she reads the offer and
creates an answer and then I'm sending
it back to John which reads the answer
and look at the console okay now the
connection is open between the two
browsers so pretend it's on different
machines and now we have a direct
connection so I can click on preview
slide many times and I'm sending
evidence to the other browser which is
logging them same the the opposite way
so that's exactly what I was trying to
do the problem is in real life you can't
really send stuff with copy Bastien
right so we have to find a way to send
the the information the offer and the
ice candidates from John to Janice and
for this the web our CD protocol talks
about signaling the process of signaling
so signaling is just sending the in
those information from one machine to
another machine so basically you have a
signaling server that is also on the
same local network and okay
so that's the moment where my own side
project is failing me during my talk but
it should be okay contraire just to
refresh so yeah you have to to send the
information from John to Johnny's to a
signaling server and for this what we
what many people do is to create a
WebSocket connection between the two
parts with the signaling server and
sending the information from one point
and then the other way so just trying to
do live fixing at the same time it's
gonna be alright
sorry and I try to do it blind for now
so once you've done the right the
round-trip you can establish a web RTC
death eternal connection where you can
send direct information between the two
machines and that's exactly what I
wanted to do so then I got a bit more
interested in how could I do this with
the internet in between so maybe this
machine is on a Wi-Fi and maybe this one
is on 4G or something so I got into the
details and I really understood how it
works but so it involves having
Siller signaling server but then to
cross the net servers you'll need a some
kind of stun server okay so you you have
to do stuff like who am i and then it
tells you well on the internet you are
this IP Dysport etc you have to do the
same thing on the other way and it got a
bit boring at least I was really
interested for my side project at the
basics so so yeah so I think that's
where I got Bob but I learned just
enough I needed you to do that so I
think that's why side projects are
really awesome and I really need to fix
what's HAP
somewhere I'm really sorry let's try
again
I lost the Wi-Fi maybe it should work
now now maybe this one lost the Wi-Fi
worst okay the Wi-Fi is deactivated this
is not good I think I pressed a shortcut
which I shouldn't have okay let's all
cross fingers yeah 200 crossing fingers
should be okay almost sorry
don't build your own tools at least
don't put them into production yeah I
can't see anything on my laptop okay so
when you have that in a big conference
you have to sing so do you have a song
in mind
okay I really hate that
something is oh okay this is new sorry
if you were going to Cisco if it is
working so I have nothing in my machine
but I have this should be okay okay so
let me get back to you up to speed
side projects are some because they
allows you to learn deep breath so we
are to see I learned a lot and but I got
bored after learning just enough for my
side project so if you want to use it I
really advise you to use WebRTC adapter
it's a small library or at least set of
JavaScript that helps you for your web
at sea project world everywhere the same
way most of kind of and if you want to
do data transferring like I did I advise
you to use simple peer because I really
wanted to learn the low-level API but
it's really really low level and you
have lots of boilerplate so with simple
pin you'll be able to send any arbitrary
data between the two browsers so where
does it work basically it works almost
everywhere and I think this website is
not up to date because Safari just
announced web as his port in version 11
of iOS and Safari but I mean I haven't
tried it yet officially but they say
it's supported the problem is in Safari
and edge the the data channel feature is
not working yet so you will be able to
do video audio chatting between two web
pages but for now you won't be able to
send arbitrary date so I was looking to
do a server less
communication between two machines and
well there's a server so is it several s
well if I read that the definition of
several is there is a server so okay but
what I really wanted is several a
service you know what I mean like I
really want no server in this so I want
to send from this machine which has a
black screen but anyway to this machine
this amount of data and those small eyes
candidates and that's when I was like
hey psych projects are awesome because
I'm able to experiment I have the free
time I can do whatever I want I don't
have to be cheap fast good so I started
experimenting and I started reading on
the web how could I send I couldn't do
the signaling without any server then I
stumbled upon an RFC which is RFC 25:49
if you look at the data it's from April
1st so yeah IP of our agent carriers it
has a Wikipedia article so if you watch
Game of Thrones you have faith into
sending information with pigeons and
waving right it's like so fast anyway in
our case it won't work so I continued
doing a bit of research I stumble upon
this article and this guy's done a
project on github that goes with it
which was interesting then I found this
project ok QR codes I'm interested or
not so the idea is to the the laptop is
displaying multiple QR codes because
there are lots of information to send
and then you have like a smartphone you
with the camera you read the QR codes
and then the smartphone is showing the
QR codes back can you see me with the
two laptops like ok I'm doing the
synchronization it's got maybe right
ok yeah er codes right so I continued my
research
about the chromecast anyone owns a Crone
chromecast yeah right so like two years
ago I heard that for the guest mode so
if you want a friend at your home to
control your music which you don't have
been want to but you have the guest mode
with the you know the four characters
displayed on the screen that he can
enter and there's some communication
between smartphones and the TV sometimes
it's not really precise being with
ultrasound and then I was like wait a
minute it's interesting so I continued
researching on github and I stumble upon
this article and this project sorry the
audio network and another project called
sonic net but again it was all project
based on low-level web APRs and what I
wanted is to learn about those low-level
API by myself so I got interested into
web odium and so where audio is assets
of API that will help you to do many
kinds of things with sounds so the first
thing I wanted to do is to produce sound
and that's where side projects are some
because you can have film and you can
create musical instruments so how does
Web Audio works basically you have nodes
so the first one is the audio
destination node it's like your speakers
and then you have you can have a node
that is called an oscillator you can set
a frequency so for musicians here 440 is
a perfect a a 384 depends on mid year or
anyway so here I can do something like
that I can change the frequency to
whatever I want and I can add new nodes
and process the frequency for my musical
instrument I just needed a gain node
which allowed me to change the volume
right so I can go from 80 percent to two
percent or even silent and so right now
my sound is off because now I know it's
not happening on my screen okay anyway
I'll tell you your bath afterwards
my sound is off because the webpage with
the musical instrument is still open
so if I put the sound on I have this
still sound because if I change on this
page here so my musical instrument is
just creating an oscillator here setting
it has a sine wave and setting a basic
frequency and putting putting the game
at zero and each time I press a button I
just set the frequency at the right note
and I just put the level up on the note
and when I release the button I just
have to put the gain at zero so right
now in my web browser something is
oscillating isn't it crazy right okay
so that allowed me you saw the demo to
to do that so now I was able to sorry to
produce sounds but and so I just used
the Wikipedia page to know the
frequencies and obviously I chose the
right notes to play whatever I wanted to
demo but anyway the second step was to
do detection sounds because if I want to
produce sound here and detect it there I
need to know what frequencies were
edited so again research Wikipedia etc I
stumble upon DTMF do you know about DTMF
yeah so it's the standard that defines
the frequency that you can hear when you
press a telephone key buttons and so if
you look at the data grid on the left
you have the two frequencies it's
because jion's own freaking multi
frequency you have the two frequencies
that correspond to any given number on
keep out of a phone so that's when I
really tried to do the detection so for
the detection you have again a node
which is basically your mic and you have
a node which is an analyzer so the
analyzer node is getting the input and
with that you are able to get basically
the repetition of the different
frequencies and are they really higher
or not so you get a 1,024 value array
which correspond to the frequencies
between 0 and 20 karats etc it's getting
a bit technical and boring but basically
you see what I mean you you get the
information as an array and just have to
process it to know which frequencies are
at right now so that's what I did here
yeah okay and so we'll try the demo with
my phone so what I did is trying to
detect as you can see underlies the code
I create I created an analyzer etc and
in the loop I'm trying to get the
frequency data etc so now if I try the
demo so if I press any yeah of course I
just put the sound back up sorry yeah
it's okay so let's press a few numbers
so maybe 809 six so it's the telephone
number of a manual microphone please
write it down okay so I was I was pretty
glad the first time I managed to do that
the problem is doesn't really work well
and that's where you realize side
projects right it's a professional job
so yeah so with whether you're able to
produce and detect sounds you have a few
sets of api's that work pretty much
everywhere and I include edge and Oprah
and
Safari the problem is more about getting
sound so for that you need the API call
getusermedia to get video but especially
to get the microphone and for this I
haven't tried it yet on Safari but
officially it says that it supports it
starting on iOS 11 so I was able to
produce sound to detect sound and again
what I wanted to do is just transfer a
few amounts of data from here to here to
then create a direct connection from
WebRTC I know the level of craziness is
like that high but it was really lots of
fun so the last part was now that I can
do multiple frequencies I need to encode
that big message and to send it and so I
have a degree in electronics signal
encoding and computer science and
basically when I had the chance to
really choose my courses I just forgot
about electronics and and signal
encoding so I really focused on computer
science I back then it was not really
that interesting for me but because it
was my own rooms my own small garden my
side projects that at that moment I was
really interested in signal encoding
encoding maybe I need to send an email
to my own professor or saying hey I got
it now ok so and when I say I got it
I'm like at the level of the first
lesson maybe so so if I want to send
hello for example from Jones to Janis
what I did is to set up a dictionary and
to decompose the different characters I
once sent so here I want to say
h-e-l-l-o and my dictionary is the four
letters eh L oh so then I have just to
to map every character to its index in
the dictionary pretty simple and then I
make each character which index
corresponds to a frequency so I'll be
able to know an H is like he is like you
know
I mean but to be able to send it
properly what I saw on the few github
projects I I discovered was you need a
frequency to tell the receiver that you
are about to start a message to identify
the sort you need also frequency for
repetitions because when you are doing
frequency modulation like that and
you're sending to elves it's not that
always easy to detect that the L or the
frequency to was sent like twice the
time so most of the time we have a
frequency just to say a there is a
repetition here and then of course you
need a frequency to say the message has
ended so you send it everything to
Jamie's laptop and she can do the
opposite operation with the same
dictionary of course and say ok Jordan
told me hello nice so that's rather cool
or not because I have to send this again
and that is the yarn that is just the
end did he offer the answer just looked
like this so I have to do the round-trip
and I also have to send one or more ice
candidates so I think that is like 300
ASCII characters and here if you put
like two candidates it's like 200
something so the first time I did the
transferring between the two machines
without any optimization the round-trip
was like 10 minutes and I think it's the
time that Raven needs to go from King's
Landing to the wall I mean it's crazy so
that's when side projects are some
because there's a challenge right and I
was like I think I can do better so I
looked at many Google research as always
and I found something about the minimum
viable SDP so if I were weren't really
clear the SDP is the
the big object I'm supposed to send for
the offer and back for the answer and
this page was basically the pimp my ride
of sdp like we don't need that so the
person is describing everything you can
remove from that subject
removing when you have key and values
you can remove the key because it's will
always be like name you better first
name 7 etc maybe you just have to send
the value in the right order and you can
really win some space with that so
that's what I
I tried and I also tried to another
optimization it's to change the number
of frequencies I'm using in the example
I showed you I was using as many
frequencies as I had letters in my
dictionary plus 3 frequencies stop
repetition and start but what if I were
to encode those 1 0 2 2 3 into binary
and change the base to use more
frequencies so that's where the boring
math starts so if I have this I can use
base for to create a number so trust me
it's 929 and then when you have 929 you
can say okay I have like 29 frequencies
so maybe I can change the base and
decompose that and the message to be
sent now is only 1 3 &amp;amp; 1 okay you you
one like two characters no I went from
100 percent to 60 percent so it's like a
big win and so then I just have those
three frequencies to send etc so maybe
we can do a demo that will probably fail
again right it's a demo so let me
refresh and zoom a bit so here putting
the sound here we are trying to send
hello or maybe hell
from left to right with a eh ello
dictionary okay this is not going to go
well okay okay let's try something
different
okay a bit creative yeah anyway so as
you can see I'm using the same number of
frequencies as I have characters in my
dictionary so two three two
or maybe not no it's sorry so what I
also tried is as I said to decompose
what's in the SDP so there are IP
addresses fingerprints that are only
exactly small etc so I started to create
a few sets of dictionaries that are more
efficient so one for s key one for what
I called small ASCII which is like only
numbers and lowercase letters maybe I
don't remember and a few special
characters only four numbers and
especially for it tv4 if you look at the
console sorry if you look at the console
if I'm trying to send an ipv4 for
example whatever
yeah liking the movies okay know the
movies now maybe if one world because my
dictionary is anyway okay so if I try to
send it as ASCII I'm gonna cut the sound
because it's horrible but it will take
like 12 12 seconds to send and I have to
send all those frequencies but if I know
it's an IP before I can just encode that
as four numbers that go from 0 to 255 so
I will just have to send that much
information and it will be only 5 4
seconds so by removing stuff from the
SDP by putting a
specify specific dictionary for each
part and by changing base I was able to
transfer stuff so for now your whole
earring what I'm doing because I'm
between 700 Hertz and 1.5 k Hertz
so who's who's and read who's under 24
years old here okay you may hear one of
the ultrasound sorry but for us it's
like too late so I'm gonna go between it
sounds crazy but it seems like a fact I
read so we are going between 17.5 K and
20.5 k and basically it's the above 18
it's it's officially around ultrasounds
but ultrasounds go really over that the
problem is my laptop mic and speakers
weren't built for that at all I even got
making it like clicking when I was
trying to to do very high frequency and
Web Audio API doesn't allow you to go
above 22 K as I showed so we are pretty
limited
so we'll try 29 frequencies to encode
and add sounds we shouldn't be able to
hear so that's when the problem will
begin because we we are relying on the
speaker's of the Kannapolis so yeah so
let's try to send okay same dictionary
200 people crossing fingers yeah okay
if you don't see listen on its that it
doesn't work so I'll try again and I'll
remove the jack if it doesn't work I
didn't so you just want something that I
can offer you afterwards but thanks very
much it's already listening it's not
okay
that's was almost that right if you look
at the numbers yeah we're missing 819
okay let's do that again
I heard one frequency you too right okay
hey
okay and if you look at the numbers we
are not missing that much so so I'm just
gonna try by removing the jack maybe
yeah it's gonna be big sounds okay no
problem okay so let's try again with my
speakers okay crossing fingers Democrats
please
hey great thanks very much
at devoxx UK at the end the a/v guy was
like oh by the way in your mic there's
like ultrasound going to the base and
maybe it's for that it didn't work and I
was like alright ok
what's nice with that is that once I
managed to optimize everything I am
managed to do it to do the round-trip in
one minute
and for me it was like the main goal and
after that I got a bit bored and I
played video games and went to see some
friends you know and that's what I
really liked with side projects is that
if it's not finished it's okay and I'm
gonna repeat it because we all have a
big problem in this industry if it's not
finished
it's your free time there's no one
paying you to do that
it's okay and the problem I have is this
we all put on ourselves this pressure to
have this amazing list of side projects
that are awesome because because the
recruiters are asking are asking for
that and I can't blame them at some
point because if I were to treat someone
I would like him to or her to to do like
crazy side projects that are really
interesting and smart but basically we
just have to lower the pressure and to
just say okay man or a woman it's it's
okay it's okay
so last point if you don't have dogs or
tests it's ok sort of again I'm still
talking about side projects that you
just do to have fun to learn etc if
you're building the new plug-in library
for for something that everyone will use
we're not talking about that help side
projects but again don't put too much
pressure on you and
for to finish obviously the last part is
sharing I mean I worked on this a year
ago I presented it at a few conferences
and this allowed me to to infect people
with this really good virus of of
wanting to learn more about WebRTC in
Web Audio and maybe signal encoding yeah
good so I really urge you to to try
stuff to lower the pressure to to really
feel free to do whatever you want and in
the end share share with the people that
are not as passionate as you are that
for really good reasons families or the
hobbies don't have the time I mean it's
it's really not a problem if you don't
have the time so I want to finish and
get back to the usefulness of our free
time by showing you about a Japanese
concept so the idea is to identify what
you love what you can be paid for and
what you are good at and if you identify
those three things you have your passion
and your profession and that's really a
good way for I think to describe the you
know job versus work and the fact that
there is a common space I preferred this
description there's what I love what I
can be paid for what I'm good at and the
Japanese add what the world needs
well that's deep and when you have that
you can have your mission and your
vocation
okay and they call this a key guy and I
haven't find it yet maybe you have but
since I discovered that I really started
to to think about more about the
usefulness of what I do in my daytime
email you know daytime life what I'm
being paid for and a bit less about the
usefulness of what I'm doing on my free
time so this was not a story about
waking
your partner husband Hawaii they would
totally be right to be mad at you but
when I think back about the question of
what's the point
well I mean why do I do that what's the
purpose well in less than two to three
weeks something like that
I discovered new technologies like web
RTC Web Audio I learn stuff about
networks Nats I experimented with
ultrasounds with music trying to find
what notes frequencies are I had a lot
of fun challenging myself to do that and
I would say that for a useless project
it's not that bad
thank you very much I don't have time
for question but don't hesitate to ping
me to buzz me until tomorrow evening</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
