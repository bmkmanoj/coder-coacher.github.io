collider in 27 comments with the country
and it has the world's largest and most
powerful particle accelerator but it's
also the largest cryogenic system in the
world and one of the coldest place on
earth so the magnet separated
temperature lower than outer space and I
don't here with me it's just about
micropterus and Java EE as cool as the
LHC that's a lot to live up to yeah so I
changed actually the title to almost as
cool outside for the keynote so um yeah
it is pragmatically cool it's not yeah
this dad works here as at least what the
developers are telling me after the
after the project this java ee lend
itself well to make sense accident it's
perfect so what happened was java he has
a deployment model what basically means
that the infrastructure does not change
a lot so it means if the server gets
released or we get new java then it
changes and because of thin wars is like
the business logic we just have to
deploy the business logic so we have
natural separation between business
logic and infrastructure what means is
that deployment are extremely fast so we
can push to the cloud in seconds or what
as in the session i just emulated the
cloud with a private doctor registry and
it took i think one second and this is
what makes it interesting in my projects
did productivity the really high
productivity and I think these days this
is what matters for activity yeah it's
all about staying ahead of the
competition yes from business-wise not
take no one cares about your physicality
yeah yeah for the developers is actually
really boring because there is nothing
to learn or nothing new actually in
imperfect java ee project you don't have
to know i would say 400 patients and
plain java codes there is yeah I always
told job is boring it to something else
but I mean business doesn't care about
you know excited developers yeah so a in
terms of Java EE and changes and you
happy with the Java EE robot very happy
i would say i mean i'm very happy with
java 7 already so there's not
I am waiting for that for some api's to
come what I'm what I'm really happy that
something happens because it's really a
very important for the image and for
marketing that Java e8 will come I get a
lot of question though you know when
java ee e is a tease out and I ask know
what you are missing so there is no
answer but they're waiting you know so
there is a so there will be some
interesting security of course very
important there will be Jason bindings
also interesting so that their happens a
lot but I think you can be incredibly
productive right now with Java 8 7 or
even job by six so have you had a chance
to look at my profile yes what what are
your thoughts on that I think micro
profile is are very important because
the we don't need oracle to move forward
Java so from this point of view is
really important or the killer use case
for micro profile I don't have it in my
projects because of the separation the
deployment everything is crazy fast but
what you can do with micro profile if
you have unusual project like let's say
CERN so there are lots of frameworks
which you have to use like I don't know
big data processing or whatever what you
could do you can create a micro profile
application server with all the
dependencies though your deployable is
still small and this is supported
actually by all vendors so I think char
the white dress warm calls it i think
hollow jar and the new pyara this is
just deployment outside the jar so this
is a killer use case for all other
projects I don't care I measure the
performance in stock projects between
micro profile and stock application
server no difference so I would still go
with the stock application service
because they are more comment and you
get more answers will stick orbital
perhaps my face my profile is more usual
as a movement yeah I think yeah yeah and
make development developers exciting and
because micro profile is micro it is
easier for new vendors to create a new
service so this is a thing a big deal
boat from the developer perspective I
don't care a lot about this so I cared
about the movement but for me as
developers and right now
no no more problem solver whatever
except the platform problem which you
can do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
