edition of Vox Dei zuri we are becoming
a tradition in Zurich and we are very
happy of that and thank you to the comic
strip guys they made our logo also
that's that's great we will speak about
that and yes so what is the book said
this who is here for the first time okay
any of you nice so the box is up
typically a one day conference that is
born for by developer is made by
developer for developer and our main
target is to share the knowledge and and
our our strong point our strength is the
community that is the developer
community that is around the the box at
the community and as I said that it's
made by developer and it's in it's a
very it's supposed to be a very
technical conference and we are not
focusing on a specific technology we are
trying to be diverse in the in the
number of technology that we are trying
to speak about during the conference
okay and the most important part of the
conference of course is the content okay
so content if thing is king is and this
is I believe we we we I should say this
because I'm the leader of the program
committee but I believe that we put
together a very great content for this
conference and as we ready sate multiple
times it all started just for fun
in his picture is me and jealousy no
Hannah conference 2014 and we want to
organize a devoxx for kids event so we
started organizing that for kids for our
children and for some fun with them and
then we said you know maybe we can
organize something also for our friends
and collegues in Ticino and we have done
the first box day's event in Ticino in
2015 then there were quite a few people
from Zurich and Lucerne there the first
year and they asked a day why don't you
do it in very high also and for 2016 we
have done two conferences and our goals
our focus is always to we take very
seriously the responsibility to grant
the quality of the thoughts of the
conduct like Mario said we want to be a
place where we can really share
knowledge experiences talk freely and
meet smart people that have common
interest like us and we want to have fun
it's a day where we learn a lot of
things but is very important to have fun
for us and yeah and in 2017 let's say
that the the things starting becoming
really serious meaning that we had the
three conferences the the the the
original one in Ticino and and one in
Zurich and then also we have been
extremely pleased of being guested by
the CERN we had more than 1,000 not and
these for the three events and another
important thing is that the the boxset
days are supposed to be both are global
but also local focus it conferences so
we want to also say since we are in
Switzerland we want to put together the
the Swiss community of developers so
that's why we have a model for 40% of
speakers which are
swiss-based and more the 70% of
attendees okay and we also try to
produce our giveaway with social social
fabric so we are trying to support the
the Swiss environment as much as we can
yeah and last year finally because it
will start from that we have been also
able to organize a demux for kids in
Zurich
so also the deluxe for kids event are
covering all three major regions so
language regions in Switzerland CERN
Geneva in Ticino we're already doing
that since a couple of years and the
second of December we have done a three
workshop with 32 kids thanks to the
sponsors really it was a very
interesting experience and a lot of
people there met a new this new
community for the kids okay but so like
we said it's all started for fun so we
were taking it easy it became serious
and sometimes with success comes also
responsibility and we want to take it
also very seriously
and that's why we ask the the comic
strip guys to produce this logo and I
mean it yet really applied all our ideas
perfectly because like Mara said we are
a local and global event all in one we
are really Swiss based Swiss made but we
have a lot of rock stars and also
attendees coming from all over Europe
easily or us all so we try to promote
emerging speakers and experienced
speakers so you will see a mixture of
both that's also part of the role of the
program committee we have technologies
from front and back end all the
technologies and we as with devoxx for
kids we try to support kids to learn how
to use those technologies properly
and they what we really think is that we
can learn from everyone any different
any diversity any different kind of
people can bring something to the
development team and this will be our
main team during the during the day
there are few talks also speaking about
that explicitly and we we really think
that through inclusivity we will all
benefit so we will all improve if we
open our minds if we listen to something
that we don't know if we got out of our
comfort zone like yeah somebody say it
don't matter and and that's why the
music and our motto of these year is we
have developers after all I mean what we
have in common is that we are all your
lovers and we are able and we like to
fight for solving problems so as I said
probably I'm not the right person to say
this but I believe we put together a
great lineup of speaker speaking about a
very different technology I guess also
with different level of the difficulties
of the of the talk so we can have the
aspiring tools but you can also have the
super technical tools so I think that
everybody can find that a good a good
flow of talks that will keep you
interested for the rest of the day I
obviously we have to thank our sponsors
without all of them it would not be
possible to have such a conferences as
such a you to cinema and so nice rooms
we have a lot of recurring sponsors that
are confirming for the third year in a
row here in duty that's great we have a
few new sponsors that's also very
important for us for the future
and we have some friends like you see
here that are supporting us in
frontways and that's always grateful
thank you everybody and I would like to
think that you all shall thank them all
because it's very important thank you
we try to have cheap price and this will
not be possible and we also have top
companies that understood the the major
idea of the event we want to have the
developers coming and so we have few
companies that really sending a lot of
their developers the world developer
team some time and we want also to thank
them I mean it's it's really great it's
really great this is a one great way to
support the conference the more people
we have the easier it is for us and the
cinema is quite big so we have space for
everybody so thank you and compliments
for those code to those companies yes
actually the numbers are changing we're
still selling tickets now but we are at
435 so we have an increase yeah on the
number of attendees that's also very
important for us yeah thank you so this
is the team that make this possible I
want to say thank you to everybody in
the program committees and and the
volunteers that helped at us starting
doing that program I I must admit that I
really underestimated the effort of
leading a project program committee for
a conference like the box eight days but
this year we had 10 times more proposal
than than available slots so we have we
had around 250 proposal for 24 slots so
it has been really hard to select to
select them I'm sorry
that we have to refuse to to reject a
few very good very good talks hopefully
we will make a bigger box at days next
and also again that the volunteers is
it's the the the other team the other
guys that make this possible by helping
us with the logistics and and and I
forgot to change the picture sorry this
is the picture of the volunteers ah okay
yeah but more or less but you will
recognize all of them with the red
t-shirts yeah yeah okay I didn't know
this this may be quickly because the
time is running away what's next so we
are trying to distribute whether the
events during the year they were very
close
now we moved rocks a stitch you know to
October so we have a little bit of time
to breathe and to organize it properly
it will we also include included other
teams and companies in the organization
that will be great come to Ticino for
the fourth edition we are already
planning next year injury so 21st of
March and we are very happy to announce
that there will be the boxed a CERN
again next year the 1st of May and or in
the overflow room now I met him yet he
is leading the organization in turn and
I mean that's that's great again
yeah and I also would like to remember
that we always try to be community so if
somebody has ideas something that want
to do like the tweet wall from Patrick
Reiner this year I mean it's just a nice
addition you will see between each told
there will be this tweet wall and this
has been provided by somebody with his
free time and that's great for us really
Thank You Patrick and thank you
everybody in the community that is
helping us ok so a few logistic things
you can use the Edina cinema's Wi-Fi
also shown will be recorded and will be
available in the very next day so it
often happens to me that there are two
