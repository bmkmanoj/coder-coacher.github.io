talk about Minecraft and AI so I have to
admit I've never played minecraft before
and I'm sorry and I imagine I probably
have a lot less time if I had played
Minecraft right right yes that's true
how do you see you mentioned be
enforcement learning how do you use
reinforcement learning in Minecraft how
do you add anything to Minecraft is it
easy to get going so minecraft itself is
an open-world thing and it's written in
Java and for legal reasons only the char
file you go so they're modding
frameworks which download them char file
opens this up hooks in something and
therefore you can get change minecraft
on different ways the view of some
objects in Minecraft but also on the
backend side so yeah behavior things
like you can here you can define for
example that the chest box is open only
open by the owner of this box this is
done by by the modding framework and
Microsoft was also now the owner of
Minecraft they bought it three years ago
from mowing not was the the inventor of
it and he is now very rich and happy and
everything but Microsoft also invented
project Mountain which is a platform for
AI in Minecraft and it's also based on
the modding framework so yeah I just
looked at the Q learning algorithm so
there's also one tutorial inside of mom
where you start just letting the agent
walking without any machine learnings
just to get a little bit feeling of
what's possible with the framework
itself so you start walking with it and
then there's something where is the
cliff walking example out of the green
for
and an introduction book from 1998 right
right this book well-known book so you
know more about the reinforcement stuff
than minecraft I realize now yeah yeah
right this book and there's also the
cliff walking example and at tutorial
number six there's some note in the in
the header like ah this is a cliff
walking example and then in the troll
itself you have to change the new value
with the reward so the idea of
reinforcement learning is like you're
getting an reward for every action
you're doing so your agent is in the
state doing some action the environment
in this case minecraft gives back in
reward and also some observation and
depending on this I'm the agent figures
out the best move which will be done and
yeah with the reinforcement learning you
have some lava and the lava field so
when agent es steps into the lava it
dies and getting 100 points reward - 100
points reward so it's not a good thing
for each step it's -1 and when you find
some blue block then it's happy and
getting 100 and with the Q learning you
it starts to figure out the boundaries
which shouldn't step in at one point it
finds the blue block goes down and Yemen
with reinforcement learning it
calculates down to the beginning and
I've played around with it so it takes
35 steps for this example I'm f and
it's relatively fast for this get the
highest reward yes and avoid things that
reduce through yeah it's just depending
on on the state
it gets you have spore actions northeast
well west is south yeah for coordinates
in
I thought it's easier with because left
and right it's always more complicated
but yep north east west Laos and
depending on the state it knows ok maybe
on the east right there's lava so it's
not a good point and go on the west side
you will get minus one reward but you
will be alive and at the end it will be
I don't know 37 or something for example
so it figures out the best action for
the next move yep it's on line</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
