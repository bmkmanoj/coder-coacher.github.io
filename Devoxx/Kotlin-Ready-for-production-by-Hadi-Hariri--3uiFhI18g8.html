everyone hello hi there you go right in
so thank you for coming to this talk I
do have to give you a heads up I I think
after this talk there's no break between
mine and the next book and I've got to
run over to the other room because
Venkat is going to borrow my laptop so I
will run out but I'll be around later on
if you have any questions right so
welcome to a stalk on cotton I'm going
to give you a little bit of a background
and then we'll dive in mostly this will
be a talk where we will do a lot of code
how many of you have heard of Kotlin are
using it it's not bad when I started
talking around about Kotlin above four
years ago nobody had heard of it so I've
been doing a really good job anyway so
I'll give you background this was
started in 2010 by us at JetBrains I
work for JetBrains
and we needed a language at the time if
you have some idea a little bit how many
of you is part of jetbrains we make
IntelliJ IDEA and 21 other products that
nobody ever seems to know about so yeah
we needed a language because basically
what we've done is we've got a half of
the products are made on IntelliJ or the
IntelliJ platform and the server-side
products are Java and then we've got the
dotnet site okay and the dominant side
is C sharp F sharp sharp vb.net and tiny
little bit of F sharp and then
everything else is written in Java and
we were getting tired of Java because
jaws were very verbose and we wanted
something that had you know it was a
modern language meaning it had
functional constructs or meaning you
could just say I'm using a modern
language and so we decided to look at
alternatives at the time there was a
couple of them mainly there was a
scholar and we had certain issues with
Scala
the compiler was slow it's not very it's
not the most easy language to tool
so to give you some perspective if
there's about 35 people on the IntelliJ
IDEA team there's around 11 people alone
on the Scala plugin right in contrast to
something like Kotlin when there's about
I think three people on the Kotlin
plugin right so it's not easy language
to tool anyway back and forth blah blah
blah we decided to come up with our own
language and when in any language it was
concise expressive toolable
interoperable pragmatic now we
accomplished all of these goals because
it would be really bad for me to say we
didn't so let's just pretend we did but
most of all we accomplished the goal of
being pragmatic because really it is
about finding issues that we had with
our language finding issues that other
people had with Java and other languages
and trying to address them developed
under Apache tube OSS on github and and
has been there since day one what is it
it's a static language I keep forgetting
to tell people that and it's harder to
JoVE JVM JavaScript and we have been
working on targeting native as well so
we started our project back in September
and we kind of already have hello world
so to speak so but we're aiming that
sometime this year we can show some
demos around that why do we target
JavaScript because every other language
Under the Sun does so we thought we
should have long current state it was
released on February 15 2016 6 years in
the making it's great it's beautiful
because we have 30-plus developers on it
right now at JetBrains
there is no real kind of a business
model around Kotlin per se so you know
we we use it ourselves we've got a
hundred plus committees and we've got
close to 10 products if not more using
Coplin some entirely built on Kotlin
some sharing code with Java so the new
c-sharp ID that we've brought out is on
the intelligent platform but all of the
code written on the intelligent lifeform
on the front-end side is now entirely
written in Kotlin which is quite funny
right we make a c-sharp ID in Java
there's also external companies that use
it
I don't like to name-drop unless it
looks good here's a few name drops that
are using Kotlin and of course you can
use it absolutely anywhere a lot of
people first when they talk about cotton
they think it's a language that targets
Android
no it just so happens that since we're
compatible with Android you can since
you're compatible with Java six you can
so we got a lot of adoption in the
Android Market which is fantastic but
the backside of that is right you know
this isn't an Android specific language
we did we created this for ourselves we
don't make Android applications we make
desktop applications and server-side
applications given that it's similar to
Java c-sharp JavaScript groovy all of
these every language out there it gives
us a quick ramp up time so you don't
really need to you know it's not a
complete move away from what you're
accustomed to it's similar quite a bit
to what you're already accustomed to and
also one of our focuses was
interoperability so we want we've got
you know back when we started this
JetBrains has been around seventeen
years now so we had ten years of Java
code base and we couldn't just close
shop and say we're going to rewrite this
in the next language we wanted anything
that we do to be compatible with the
code base that we have
and gradually convert code base
gradually add code base using a
different language so we have a very
high focus on interoperability and we
still do so essentially that means that
anything that is available on the JVM
you can use today right there is no real
issue there's minor little quirks that
we've already mostly result how can you
use it anywhere so it's completely open
you can use a command line even vim then
users Emacs
really
copy Khan you don't remember copy Khan
copy to consult Malin Gradle Gradle as
you know has now adopted Kotlin as a
scripting language so you can basically
write your Gradle scripts in Kotlin
cobalt which is a flavor of Gradle that
is written in Kotlin and is there is
anyone that still uses it IntelliJ IDEA
Android studio which is based on
integrity idea Eclipse we create a
plugin for eclipse and hoping that one
day the community will pick that up and
NetBeans as well because we also have
started a plug-in for NetBeans
so really it's completely open and in
fact the IntelliJ community edition
which is open source has full support
for Kotlin so there's no difference in
functionality between the community
edition and the full edition ok any
questions no brilliant let's go to some
code you can ask questions I'll just
I'll just ignore them now any really
seriously any questions no cool that's
cool right so let me show you how easy
it is to get up and running I say file
new project called Lin I told you he's
going to borrow my machine 10 my machine
hobby is me it's mine really it is ok
let's go
right so Colleen comes with a very small
runtime we try and keep it really really
small and so that shifts and if you can
using Gradle or whatever you just
include the collin dependency I'm just
using the IntelliJ build system for demo
purposes so here I have my my source
code and I say caught Lin and I say main
and I say main and that's the template
that spits out the main every one of the
backseats out right cool so and now I
can say print line hello I do this
everywhere I go based on the location
and I na can do
because that's really exciting okay I'm
going to put two exclamation marks it's
so exciting
run you have incremental compilation so
the first time is slower then it goes
faster and there you go there is my
output okay
first thing you'll notice there is what
the font oh I thought you were going to
comment my phone no the first thing
you'll notice is yes it's fun that's
what we call a function but I'm not
going to make any jokes about that there
is no class notice that so there you can
just the great thing about Collin is
that you can just open a file and put
functions in it so you have top-level
functions
it's not like you know in Java you need
to have a static class and then have
static methods in Collin is kind of like
JavaScript so instead of having all of
these utility classes that you normally
end up having you know helper
helpers utility class the god class the
other god class all of these things you
don't need that you don't have that
problem anymore now you can just have a
file called helper and then another file
called god helper and then another one
called something else you can distribute
your functions into files I was being
very very sarcastic there but never mind
so that's what you get now I can create
classes of course and let me go ahead
and create a customer class and what I'm
going to do is I'm going to just bear
with me for a second I'm going to create
a customer class that's called it's got
an integer and it's got a property
called name okay now notice that I don't
have any open colon open brackets close
brackets that's that's as simple as I
can do to create a class and then I can
do something like Val custom I equals
customer no new either you know new so
there is no use there is no need for the
new keyword so
got this customer class and I can run
this and I'll just get rid of that and
I'll say print mine custom okay so what
I've done here is essentially I've
created a class that has two properties
and these properties are immutable Val
means immutable
okay so Val means immutable var means
mutable that means that I can read and
write to it now I've also created a
constructor so every time I create an
instance of this class I have to pass in
the two values and then I can just do
something like print line customer ID
there is no get ID or set ID in codling
we have properties you don't really use
the conventions of gathers or set it
okay notice when I print this I have a
customer over here right the pointer now
let me come over here and do this I'll
add a little thing called data a data
modifier and now let me print this and
now I have a nicely formatted customer
where I have the actual property okay
now let's do something else let's go
ahead and create a second customer
customer to customer oh my god did I
just do manual refactoring using utility
only I knew how to use a tool customer
to know new right and now let's go ahead
and say if customer 1 equals customer to
then print line same right if I run this
it's not going to print out the same but
if I change this to 1 it's going to
print out the same ok
so you see that it prints out the same
at the very bottom there okay now that's
because of this data thing so if I run
this now it's not going to print out the
same because they're not the same so
when I add data type it does a couple of
things let me show you what that does in
Java so here we go Java customer in Java
class private int ID private string name
and now let's create a setter I know I
guess I don't need getta getta and now
let's create a constructor and now let's
create override some methods let's
override hash code equals clone to
string okay so let's get rid of that and
go to 32 times and vertically come over
here open that get rid of that
expand just to be fair I mean if we're
going to look count lines let's do it
properly right they got it they got so
that's the difference between Java and
Kali okay we try to make it a little bit
less verbose right now you'll say big
deal any good IDE that's just as we've
seen can generate this for me of course
it can but does it also maintain it for
you no because when I add a new property
I've got to go and regenerate and do I
know that the codes that I've generated
is the standard or is it something that
I've tweaked right so this is
essentially a typical Java B and that's
the idea here is the things that we're
using over and over again to make it
much simpler and easier and faster to do
using cotton okay to get rid of the
gritty details and the redundant work
that you continuously have to do now I
said that this is compatible okay so let
me come over to my main and let's get
rid of this guy over here remove some
white spaces and now let's create an
instance of the customer Java so I save
our customer Java equals customer Java
and one Java right now notice when I do
customer Java I get ID I get name I get
so I don't get get ID or set ID I'm
using it in an idiomatic way from
calling so I can say name right if I go
to my customer in Java and let's go
ahead and create another phone Java
another phone
I love naming stuff so let's go ahead
and say customer customer equals new
customer now this is the calling
customer okay so customer I get a get
name okay so when I'm using calling from
Java I use it when I'm using cotton in
from Java I talk Java when I'm using
Java from car
and I talk taught me I got that right
there yeah okay
oh and if does that look good
because I'm not getting any vibes from
you no okay
so if that doesn't convince you this
does I don't know if anybody noticed but
watch this did you see that it went
great
why because it says remove redundant
semicolon yeah so this is fantastic
because now we can also have arguments
on Hacker News about whether we should
or shouldn't use semicolons and coupling
we don't leave that conversation only
for JavaScript developers in fact
semicolons are optional everywhere in
Kotlin except one specific place but I
won't tell you where that's for you to
discover okay so let's do some other
things let's go ahead and create some
functions right so I'll say fun my hello
world or hell print message right and we
use kind of Pascal notation so I say
message string and then I do print line
message okay and I can have string
interpolation so I can say my message is
and there you go right now if I want to
provide a default message what I can do
is come here a default parameter we have
done in columns I can say default
parameter is nothing so now I can call
message with print line sorry message
with nothing or message with something
okay I can have multiple parameters so I
can do multiple string and of course I
can have names parameters so here I can
say that this is actually message and
this is multiple okay so you can
actually alter the you
and also the parameter name if you
notice actually in IntelliJ we have kind
of this feature if you notice it gives
you the parameter names right but you
can't actually click on them it's a
feature that the ID provides you in
Cortland you can actually name your
parameters now that's good when you have
functions with many many parameters
which you shouldn't but sometimes you
have legacy code and you have functions
with many many parameters you can get a
little bit more insight into what those
things are
okay let's talk classes where's my error
okay so mine so let's talk classes let's
say for example I have a person now I
also have an employee which inherits
from person right issue by default in
causing classes are final so you cannot
inherit from a class unless you
explicitly mark it as open right now I
can kind of inherit from that class okay
with the constructor now what I'll do is
I'll say that this has some vacation
right employee has vacation and days
string days is an INT now we can say
well we'll make another function that's
calculate a vacation base and that takes
a person and then I'll say if person is
employee then print line person vacation
base notice what I've done there it's
also costed right because the compiler
has checked that this is already a
person of typing is already an employee
so I don't need to explicitly cast again
and again you're like okay we deal it's
a cast yes but we don't need to continue
to repeat ourselves this is the idea
here
right to cut down all of that
boilerplate code how many of you are
familiar with the singleton pattern I
didn't say it's good I said how many are
familiar with it
Singleton's here's how you create a
singleton in coupling objects singleton
there you go
right so in JavaScript you know we have
objects right that's about the only good
thing about JavaScript there's objects
and then there there are no classes so
we go through all different types of
inheritance like prototypal inheritance
or prototypal inheritance to create
these hierarchies in Java we have
classes and then we have instances of
those classes in column we have classes
and we also have objects okay so I can
now create an object for example some
value equals 10 and that is a singleton
there's only a single instance of that
object now that's okay if you're going
to create a single term with read-only
you know if you're writing two global
objects that might be an actual issue
but if you want to do it it's over there
for you okay any questions so far not a
single one are you awake
right what else can I show you okay
let's go back to functions
now here I'm printing a message let's
say I want to create a function that
says equal are are the same okay and
then I take a message one here and oh by
the way if functions are fun add two I
take a parameter and I add 2 to it so I
could say that this returns a parameter
return X plus 2 right if it's a single
expression you don't need all of this
you can just do return you can just do X
plus 2 okay
type inference is a big deal in common
so we try and infer things as much as
possible so now I'm going to do a
function and I can do for example
message message to is string and this
one's going to be message 1 ok and we
say message one message one equals
message two now if I use this it looks
are they are the same a and a ok this
sucks
I want to take a string and see if it's
equal to another string and I can do
this in a different way I can expend
classes so if you're familiar with
c-sharp we have the concept of extension
methods in calling we also have
extension properties in extension
methods so what I can do is I can take
any class and extend it with new
functionality so I'm going to take the
string class and say are the same and
value string and then I can refer to the
instance because this is an extension of
that class I can say this this refers to
the instance of that class equals value
okay let's get rid of this so now
instead of writing me like that I can
say hello
are the same as hello okay now anywhere
I have a string I now have that new
function which is are the same let's
make that a little bit nicer is the same
but what I really want to do is
something like this hello is the same as
hello
okay so let's first rename this to is
the same as okay and it gives me an
error it says you can't do this now this
is one of the good things about if
you're doing this with IntelliJ because
I don't even need to know Colin I just
keep pressing alt enter and it fixes it
for me so what it's actually done is add
in fixed notation so in calling you can
have when the when a function has a
single parameter and it's a member
function or an extension function you
can call it an infix notation right so
that kind of looks like a beautiful BDD
or testing assertion framework and one
of the things that we wanted to do with
Kotlin was create DSL and we'll see how
this is actually possible how many are
you familiar with functional programming
you have to be like nowadays you can't
not be familiar with functional
programming it just makes you look bad
sort of tweet some time ago from a
someone from the JavaScript community
that said that functional programming is
this radical new paradigm that has just
come out
apparently 75 years ago is radical just
come out so I have higher-order
functions here as well so a higher order
function is a function that takes a
functions will return the function right
so I can say func and now I can say that
this function takes for instance an
integer and another integer and returns
an integer okay and now I can call this
function with anything I want to and
three for instance right so when I'm
using this function I say higher-order
and now I can pass in the actual
function and you come
Casas as a lambda expression so I can do
X let's say X comma y equals x times y
plus 5 okay so I've created a
higher-order function that takes another
function that takes two numbers
multiplies them and add five to them now
in column notice as I was writing this
it offered me something else in the
completion it said you don't need to put
brackets around it so kind of like
groovy and it is kind of groovy so X
plus y equals five
that's exactly the same thing okay if
the last parameters of function is
another function then I don't need to
include it in the brackets and what you
can also do is make this kind of like
multi-line right and now it kind of goes
away from looking like a function and
more kind of like a keyword how many of
you familiar with c-sharp do you know
the using statement in c-sharp using is
kind of like try with resources we don't
have that in common but you can create
it using now using is going to take an
object that's closeable and it's going
to take an action that's whatever you
want to do with that object and then I
can do try finally this would be object
closed and here I would do invoke action
right so now when I have my clothes ABAB
jecht closable whatever that is whatever
that is something that's closed about
and I say using
closeable there you go so now I can make
sure that any time someone used
something that needs to be disposed of
does that now of course I'd use an
example here that's closeable you can
create your own function that's
something that for example wraps loggers
or wrap some security check or does some
kind of a LP in that
right it allows you to kind of extend
things and in fact if you're familiar
with C sharp is well C sharp has these
words which are called a sink await and
a sinker weight of a way for you to do a
synchronous programming right in
Cortland we have a synchronous
programming supporting 1.1 via
implementation of co-routines but we
have implemented a generic co-routine
machine and then all of these actual
flavors of a synchronous programming are
nothing but functions as part of the
library so a single wake is available in
Cortland but all it is is a function it
is not a keyword part of the language
okay so I can have higher order
functions much like groovy I can say for
example simple single parameter single
parameter for instance an int and
returns an int then when I call it I
don't even have to do x equals x plus 5
I can just refer to the parameter with
it with the word it so I could just do
it plus 5 so that's the convention that
similar to Ruby
we don't have pairs in Cortland but if I
do for instance list off and I can say
sorry we don't have two pools in column
we started with tuples but then we got
rid of them we have pairs we have
tripled anything beyond that you can use
a data plus because it provides you with
more meaning than you know seven values
one after another so I can say tere
Madrid Spain right this is creating a
list of pairs but I want to be a little
bit more descriptive so I can say Madrid
Spain France - sorry Paris - France UK -
London to Eton oh no um to England I was
going typing will not be you okay there
you go so you see that this is exactly
the same as this what is this
that's combination of the infix and an
extension function if you actually click
on two it's part of the standard library
it's an extension on generic function
that takes two parameters and creates a
pair and this is part of some of the
things that we offer in the standard
library such as for example let's say
get capitals I can say you know list and
then map and here I would get the first
of the two pairs right and then you
could do things like you know sorted by
it first which would be the first front
right or you know filter those that
second equals inside EU for instance
could I keep doing that Donna anyway so
those are all things that we part we
provide part of the standard library so
filter again is part of the standard
library so filter flat map you know
sorted sorted by first first or null all
of these things are provided talking
about null if I do Val let's do the full
implementation of something a string I
normally do hello because it's using
type inference the full declaration
would be string equals hello right now
if I do string equals null it's going to
give me an error because null cannot be
a value by default Kotlin does not allow
nulls
right so we got rid of that problem and
then we say oh but you can interact with
Java and then we brought that problem
right back but by default you cannot
create notes if you want to create
something that's not able you have to
add a question mark okay and now I can
say for example string
two boolean first it doesn't make sense
but as soon as I do that notice that I
get a compiler error because it says
that this can potentially be now so I
can wrap this in an if statement
obviously or I can just use what we call
the elevator operator so that basically
means that if it's not null call too
straight to boolean if it is then you
can't call that sometimes if you want to
shoot yourself in the foot we also have
that you can put the double exclamation
mark and you can say I don't care if
it's now just call it now when we
initially created codling we said okay
if you're using Java anything that comes
from Java can potentially be null and
what happened was that the code base has
started to look like a lot of code bases
with a lot of question marks we said
okay now we're going to annotate your
library and so that anything that is
redundant you don't need and then
everyone used their own annotation
library so essentially we said look it's
up to you when you're interacting with
Java if you think that the java value is
can be null view add a question mark to
it if you don't think it's going to be
now then don't have that question mark
okay now let me show you something a lot
of the things that you've seen so far
are things that are kind of typical to
you've seen some of them in other
languages we also have in in one point
one we also have a type a y-axis so I
can say for example customer equals
string or customer name that's not the
same as a new type in Haskell basically
what that is is that you can refer to a
customer name as a string so I can say
for instance fun prints name and this
now takes a customer name okay but that
is that is essentially a string at one
time it's going to be a string okay but
let me show you something that is kind
of unique to Kotlin in which we call
lambdas with receivers
so Kotlin lambdas with receive earth I'm
going to create a class and I'm going to
call it a request and that request has a
string our method for instance and it
has a content type okay now I'm going to
create a function that is handled get
talking like a web web note JSON
expressed yes or any kind of web
framework and that's going to take a
path string and then it's going to take
something special it's going to take a
handler that is not a high order
function but an extension function so I
say it is a request extension function
okay let's call that a get so how would
I use this I would come and say get
index and then here I could pass my
lambda up to that you've seen it it's
basically a higher-order function right
I don't have to put the brackets I can
actually do something like that as well
right now notice something here this
second parameter is not just a
higher-order function it is an extension
function what does that mean it is a
function that belongs to the class to
the type requests what does that mean it
means that that allows me access to
members of that type so essentially I
have access to method something okay now
I don't
what have I done wrong here hold on a
second oh because they're not property
either okay
because they're not vegetable there you
go write and print line content-type
okay and you're like okay big deal but
that enables another scenario that
enables something like this has opened
something actually recent recent let's
open this guy family of you are familiar
with teamcity teen series our continuous
integration tool and you it's got a UI
where you can define your continuous
integration and continuous deployment
continuous build but we've created now a
DSL for it right a DSL that allows you
to define things so what I'm saying is
that that lambda with receiver from
along with extension functions along
with some of the conventions such as
being able to do multi-line to be able
to pass the last parameter of a function
without including it in the braces etc
allow us to create DSL that are
statically typed okay
so here for instance I've actually
extended the default DSL for team city
by creating my own pipeline definition
this is an even part of what we ship
this is something that I've actually
just created down here ignore that
because it's not finding the
dependencies but if you look at the
actual so you can see that this is
imagine that this is all not red you can
see VCS routes steps and then there's a
Gradle step and then there tasks etc so
it allows us to create strongly typed
DSL just like the HTML builders right so
if I come here and I say Kotlin HTML
builders you can see that
I got this damn thing I use signal for
the desktop and you can't kill it types
of groovy builders so you can see that
this is actually HTML the statically
typed right now would you want to use
HTML to statically type maybe not but
it's trying to prove a point that you
can create any kind of DSL quite easily
now one last thing that we also have let
me just switch over here is streams that
you see here so in stream programming
and you're going to go to event cards
now and you can see streams doing and I
want to just call and have streams we do
we used to call them streams and then
Java came out with streams and then it
felt kind of incompatible so we call
them sequences so everything that you've
seen when I take a list and I do filter
maps show texture on it
that is all either loading when I take
any sequence any any list of any
collection of items that I say as
sequence it will convert it into lazy
loading so you also have support for
that there's other things like first
class support for delegation so here for
instance I have you can delegate
properties and you can delegate classes
so here for instance I have a class
customer that has addresses and a list
of address and by means delegate this to
something else so I'm delegating the
implementation of that property to a
different function and we have built-in
functions with Kotlin one of them is
called lazy which means lazy evaluation
so I can just say delegate this to a
lazy evaluation and you get addresses as
the actual work that you want that lazy
evaluation to do and that would return a
list of addresses so this would be
initialized the first time it's accessed
okay
now if you're familiar with algebraic
data types in Haskell some other
languages where one type for example a
boolean could be true or typed false we
also have that not entirely in our case
but we have something similar in column
which is filled classes so when I add
the field kill field keyword to a class
it basically is closing the hierarchy
it's saying that you cannot inherit from
that class beyond what you've already
declared and what your declared is what
appears inside that class or in the same
file okay so we've made it kind of
because people are complaining sometimes
that it's more noisy so you can actually
put those inherited classes in the same
file and then not have to prefix it with
the class name so here I have a class
that can be a success or an error
meaning that for instance when I do a
get page instead of throwing an
exception I can say if some operation is
successful return a success with the
properties that I want in the case of it
being successful if it's an error return
an error with the properties that I want
in case it failed and that's kind of
nice because now I can return different
types based on the result and then when
I access it it tells me where success do
this where when I call it this as you
know when successful do this when I what
is not successful do something else okay
now here it doesn't show you that you're
missing a case so in for instance if I
were to do that it would still work
right because the when isn't checking to
see that all of the cases are covered
but if you use when as an expression
then it would so if I do Val X equals
when then you see that it says when
expression must be exhausted
right so as soon as I add that then it
should work okay there's an else poncho
okay so let me switch back to keynote
and show you some other things anyone
doing Android development okay so then
let's get this line I'll show it to you
personally later so now this is
basically an example of what the DSO
that I was showing you that we created a
library called ankle that allows you to
kind of define your your your layout
views instead of using XML using the DSL
this one is more this one is more
interesting and this is the same thing
that we're using for spring so given
that Colin doesn't allow open you know
you have to declare classes by open
Colin the compiler has plug-in
technology so it's extensible the
plug-in so here what we've done is we've
created a plug-in that finds in an
Android world normally when you want to
look for you know access an element of
the UI you have to do a search text you
have to use find view the name of the
thing you want to access and then cost
it to the actual type of components
using the complier plugin what we do is
we actually analyze your layout and give
you a static type instance of that
object you want to access and we use the
same thing for Spring Framework in that
you no longer have to declare your
classes open if you want to just be used
by ALP dead spring supports spring but--
I mean you if you are the session before
they were getting great support in
spring the spring boots start those
Springs I already support Scotland
they're doing Kotlin specific things in
spring we've got a good relationship
with them cobalt is a flavor of Gradle
that was written in DSL and Gradle as I
should mention in 1.1 which is already
invasive we've got co-routines
data class hierarchies type aliases
deconstructing lambdas Java 8 9 support
so we'll always remain Java 6 compatible
for the foreseeable future however if
you say to us I'm only targeting Java 8
then we will just use Java 8 construct
in the in the bytecode okay next step if
you want to learn more called in
language or trial Cornell an org is an
online IDE there's also a bunch of cones
that you can do on there goes through
the entire syntax you can also download
them offline from github and play with
them there are already two books calling
in action which is no longer in EAP I
just don't update my image and call them
for Android developers is actually like
two other books I also have a course on
O'Reilly which is like seven hours that
covers Kotlin in depth if you're on
slack we've got over 5500 people now on
slack very active community very
engaging very open very helpful of
course I'm not going to say anything
Manama sometimes too noisy No
so to summarize Carlene we really did it
as to create a pragmatic language to
tackle some of the problems we usually
had we purposely tried to do it so that
it has an easy learning curve so that it
doesn't take you months and months to
get up to speed and hopefully you've
seen today they're basically looking at
the code I've written it's very easy to
follow interoperability provides you
with a low risk you can continues you
know to just add segments of calling
code to your existing application and
not have to isolate it for example in
the in the test and okay this is very
subjective but one thing that I found
with Colin is that I can show you
different features and you're like okay
great but it's only when you start to
combine those features together you
start to use it that's where you see the
the whole package of it and so to speak
and it is here to stay because we did
Kotlin as a tool for ourselves and our
commitment in that is that all of our
products now that are new are using
Kotlin and existing products are
starting to use colleen and our bread
and butter
continues to be our IDE than our tools
and that's where our revenue comes from
and we're continuing and we'll continue
to invest in katli and just to summarize
a research Colin are signing they're
spending the morning look at mountains
of boilerplate Java in Android studio I
see why they did it and yes that pretty
much sums up why we wrote Colin thank
