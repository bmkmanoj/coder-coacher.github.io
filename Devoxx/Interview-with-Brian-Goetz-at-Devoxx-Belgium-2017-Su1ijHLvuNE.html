joined by Brian who was in the keynote
with March talking about Java and all of
the really exciting things we can expect
and so in the keynote and yourself and
Mark discuss the new release cadence of
Java so could you tell me a bit about
that yeah absolutely so historically the
way we've released you know Java is in
big increments with releases that take
2-3 sometimes more years and they
generally have a single release driver
and what we found is that this is not
something that works so well because you
imagine some big feature that you want
to work on you think oh it'll take two
three years we'll release it then and of
course it takes longer because
everything does and you find yourself
having to delay things and at the same
time there have been good features that
went into the codebase the first six
months that people have been waiting two
years for and so we'd like to move to a
more predictable release model where
we're delivering every six months when a
feature is ready it boards the next
train if the features not ready it waits
for the next train and it doesn't
distort the decision-making of either
you know thinking oh we have two years
it's plenty of time or at the other
extreme feeling like we have to rush
things on in under the wire and so we
think it gives us an opportunity to
deliver more predictably and focus more
on is the feature ready as opposed to
what the schedule is and and we think it
will deliver things into people's hands
earlier and we'll be able to deliver
things in smaller increments so I think
it's a it's a good thing all around and
what about the support model I'm sorry
the support model so what we're still
figuring out exactly how that's gonna
work there is within open JDK there will
be support for at least the first six
months of each release good until the
next release comes out there's also a
plan for long term support the thinking
is that that would be every three years
would be a long term support but that's
something that you know anybody who
wants to offer support can decide well
we're gonna offer support on every
version or we're gonna offer support for
more than three years so we're still
working out the fine points of how
that's going to work and it also depends
who in the OpenJDK community shows up
and says we want to contribute to the
supporting of this release line so it's
you know it's it's a new model it's the
support model is gonna be a lot more
open than it was and and we'll see we'll
see what happens and we because it was a
keynote and we always have to have some
fun stuff in the keynote project Ambrose
mentioned yes last one we talked about
project Valhalla and this time it was
project number so it's a few things that
we've seen before like the D I'm going
to get the words now D verbosity yes
yeah a very real assignment yeah what
else can we what else is coming yeah so
project ampere is sort of the new shiny
thing that we were talking about we're
still continuing to work on Valhalla and
Panama that we talked about last year
project to hammer focuses on trying to
remove some of the ceremony the
developers complain about so you know
the big complaint about Java is oh it
takes so much code to do anything and
that's you know that's there's some
truth to that and so we've taken a hard
look at some of the areas in which Java
makes things harder to do than necessary
and in particular the things that we do
really often making them harder to the
necessary and you know tries to make
those a little bit easier so a few of
the features that that are part of
project amber one of them is what we're
calling data classes it's a way of
defining classes that are designed to
really just be holders for their data
with less ceremony not having to write
out all of the constructor equal hash
code to string accessors etc which you
don't be suitable for every class but
will be suitable for a large percentage
of the class of people right and another
feature that we talked about at the
keynote yesterday and will talk about in
much more detail on my talk tomorrow is
pattern matching which is another one of
those make it easier to say what you
mean right so I and and and these
features they fit very nicely into the
programming models that are becoming
popular in the cloud which tend to be
message based so function as a service
message based applications like you know
things like based on Kafka actors these
are mostly about a message comes in you
look at it you make some decisions about
it you do something in response you're
done
and the the features that we're doing in
project amber are a really good fit to
making these a simpler more streamlined
easier to read less code and an easier
to reason about I thought that yeah me
too thank you very much Brian thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
