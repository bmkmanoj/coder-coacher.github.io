if DevOps Belgium I'm here with David de
Labarre see and you're talking a lot
about Java EE so I'm gonna dive straight
in there's been a lot of really big
changes with Java EE recently to do with
the Eclipse Foundation could you explain
this yeah so that's great so first a bit
of background so we have finalized a few
weeks ago so that is done so at that
time we also said that we would like to
change the way Java will evolve in the
future so that's why we have proposed a
completely different model and that
model is basically where the development
of Java will be down in an open source
foundation that foundation being the
Eclipse Foundation so the idea is
basically to give the ability to the
Java platform to be relevant for the
next 10 to 15 years so we would like to
change the way the Java will evolve in
the future and what were the reasons for
that change well we have released Java 8
a few weeks ago so I mean if you look
back at Java 7
the previous release was released in
2013 so four years before that model was
working in the past but clearly now the
market expected to have a more rapid
cadence of the released so that's one
thing we would like to basically be able
to release the that new platform in the
in a faster with a faster pace now we
also want well to make sure that we can
deliver on that we have to adjust
the way we define the specification that
are part of the platform so all those
kind of things are basically leading to
that move to the Eclipse Foundation and
do you think the moving the Eclipse
Foundation will allow Java EE to develop
more in line with some some acquirements
that we've seen from the community so
for example the micro profile yes that's
a good point because it happened that
the micro profile project is also hosted
at the King's foundation so what we
might see over time is some kind of
conversion between the two project
because at the end if you look at micro
profile basically it's a superset of
gyri so they are based on on the Java
platform so actually moving to the
Eclipse Foundation is one additional
value that we might get with with that
but yeah so if you look at the micro
profile project basically their initial
initial goal was to basically solve the
question on how we can use the Java
platform to develop more micro services
like
application so clearly it's something
that would be kind of difficult to do in
the old model because I mean the whole
model was very well defined but it also
takes time to have new capability to the
platform so with that new model we think
that we will be able to cope with the
new demands in a morphing more faster
way demons coming from the community and
I do have a question for you I'm sorry I
didn't ask you this before but will
there be any change in the version
numbers with Java EE that's a good
question so that there will be a lot of
change in fact and most of the I mean
most of of those changes still have to
be discussed now the thing is that it's
not Oracle only who will decide and on
how those change basically on the active
side there will be a CMC project
management community will have to decide
on the on the version number something
else the branding because well Java in
itself is a brand but I mean we can't
really move that a vibrant electric
foundation for various reasons for
example today we have a Java 8
compatible application server so we
don't want too busy to confuse the
market with two different things that
would have the same names what we want
to make sure is that what we will have
on directives foundation side right now
the project that is hosting all that
effort is called e4j so what we will
have there the first ways of that so
let's call it for the lack of a better
name
efore j 1.0 that will have to be a
compatible with a java 8 so that means
that if that if or j 1.0 will have to
pass the java 8 t ck something I didn't
mention is that as part of this whole
effort we are also moving the t ck to
the foundation so compatibility is also
one key value that we preserve while
using the java development to the tips
foundation so at the end of the day we
can expect to have more implementation
on the exit side that will pass
and will be compatible with a
specification that we developed there so
moving on to Java EE eight itself no
which is great news about the release
what is it important for developers to
know about Java EE eight so interrogate
for example one of the knighting that we
have done in Java 8 we have added
support for HTTP 2 so server-side recipe
- he's headed to the solid for API so
that mean that if today you take an
existing servlet application you deploy
it on a salad fork container out of the
box it will be stupid to capable so it's
those kind of things that are very
useful because I mean all the market is
moving towards hb2 so if we broadly at
Java 8 it's basically about
modernization and simplification
modernization but for example at cb2 is
a good example simplification for
example we have added as we have enhance
other support for Jason so we have
enhanced the existing json api but we
have also had a new JSON binding api
that basically allows you to do is the
binding between java object and JSON
document something else that was tackled
in a java ee dat security so we are
having a new security ID that allows you
to more easily apply security concern in
your existing java application so
basically we have revised quite a few
API in Java EE to tackle those two team
certification and model modernization
thank you very much you're welcome
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
