drama guy as I hope many of you here
I work in jboss view steam JBoss fuse is
a product built on top of apache camel
that you may know and previously I
worked in Davos AP team this is Merrik
hi so my name is Marek I work at Red Hat
and I work with the cool stuff called
OpenShift and kubernetes and I will be
trying to be the opposite of bitter
today so our roles here are really I'm
under Java guy who knows how to code
Java stuff and mark is the the cloud
guru who is supposed to know everything
about bringing Java applications or any
other kind of application to the cloud
our agenda consists basically of three
steps we start with a simple spray booth
application we gradually bring it to the
cloud and in the end there's a
substantial part about the deployment
strategies so let's start this is a
spring good application and actually my
side project a friend a friend coming
from Austria has recently mentioned that
he needs this for somebody he working in
public administration this is basically
a simple application to schedule horse
rides you can think of it as uber for
horse rides you can order a horse and
the horse will that will be delivered at
a place and you can make right and and
then you give the horse back the benefit
was the horse is is that you can
actually let them go to the place so you
don't
any special AI to send the cars there we
can send the horse just yeah horses are
driving autonomously so to say and
actually maybe the friend who has given
me this project thinks that horses are
the next big thing because diesel
engines are going to get prohibited in
German cities or I don't know so this is
a simple spring boot application that
has just a couple of entities as here
you can see we have we have a horse and
the person that is supposed to ride on
horse horses are housed in stables or
the stables has some GPS coordinate so
so that we can schedule horse from the
nearest stable when somebody orders it
and there are of course rights that this
application is supposed to schedule the
croute end points are provisioned by
spring data there's just one service
that is doing something intelligent and
that's the very right scheduling that is
not finished by the way yet but it
doesn't matter much and there's a simple
that the UI that just just lists the
rest endpoints so this is my application
the customer wants us not only to
deliver the application he wants us to
to run it so it means we are becoming
through DevOps and it's actually up to
us how we run it which tools we choose
and that's why we actually have mark
here mark so what what can you offer in
this situation okay so today everybody
is speaking about containers so I guess
we should go with containers so that the
first step will be to containerize the
application
and once we have a container we need to
run it's on there if you use something
like docker itself it is great for
running on single machine but if you
want to do it on a cluster unique some
infrastructure you need some container
orchestration system and there has been
some kind of battle between different
different orchestrators but today it
seems that the standard is becoming to
be kubernetes Java is to me no not
really
it's a de-facto standard of how you
actually do containers on a bigger scale
kubernetes has been conceived by Google
and two biggest forces behind it
actually it's a Google and Red Hat but
wait wait that's that's a huge thing
right how can I start with Swiss cloud
actually because what should i do should
i order data center or you should
definitely other data center if you can
afford afford it but not really for
today it's very easy to set a setup
there is something called mini shift or
mini cube that actually allows you to
run a single node faster on your machine
so if you don't want to actually order
anything you don't want to pay somebody
to give you some infrastructure you can
do it on your own machine you just
download it from github slash mini shift
slash mini shift it's a single binary
that you run on your machine it creates
a VM it deploys openshift or cube inside
that that VM and you have it running you
can do pretty much everything that you
would be doing in the indie cloud you
can do it on your machine and that's
actually what we are going to use right
wait a minute open kubernetes you said
there's some close relationship there
but yeah am I getting systemd
don't worry about it you don't have to
care about that essentially open ship is
a distribution of kubernetes so if you
do run open ship you run kubernetes you
can treat it as kubernetes if you want
to but you don't have to and you can use
something more high-level let's provide
it there but it's completely up to you
and we will see ok so now let's assume I
have
installed mini shift just right now what
should I do
can you make the font a bit bigger
awesome
can you read it from the from the back
great so what you need to do is to start
any shirt
so mini shift space start now okay don't
don't press return yet so if you would
do it it would spin up mini shift for
you but it will give you the default
configuration of resources which is two
gigs of memory and to one CPU I think 20
gigs of space which is not really what
you want so you need to specify how much
memory how much CPUs you want to
dedicate to the VM okay something like
this right yes something like this
because this is Java so two gigs no good
but it spring boot come on you will see
some cool stuff so give it give it some
resources so eight gigs should be fine
CPUs six yeah that's cool and some disk
space ok let's assume I have started it
because I have started it in the past
because it needs some time to boot so I
just cancel it and watch it started what
should I do now
you can do now oh see Who am I ok OC is
the client tool for open chip and you
see that you are already logged in as a
developer user that would happen as the
as the start command you can also switch
to the map interface oh go to the
browser oh sorry you can do it easier a
mini shift space console
enter there you go this is open shift
this is something that's built on top of
kubernetes if you have some already some
experience with kubernetes you see that
it's a bit more application developer
driven ok there we are
so what will be the next step for us I
want to bring my application in there ok
so do it and how ok go OC OC OC
Oh see space new app - alright and now
you're good rip oh my goood rip oh okay
and this is my horse right service
what's happening now at the bakery your
Wi-Fi is low you think so
it seems so it's there can you stop
using your laptop's and oh yeah but it's
it's it's there okay good so we mean we
just need to be patient or something
should happen already yeah yeah you will
see something here once it happens oh
there we go there we go what happens
haha a lot of magic happens that's why
it took a bit longer and so Wi-Fi so
yeah I guess you had a Jenkins file in
your in your repo right yes I had a
single Jenkins files there okay so
because there was there was a Jenkins
file open shift so there's a Jenkins
file so it provision Jenkins for you and
started to build pipeline based on the
Jenkins file can you switch to your
Jenkins file too much drinking spray my
Jenkins file is right here okay
can you read it at the back can you read
it yeah yeah so this is my Jenkins file
yes it builds with maven and that's all
what it does and actually I have put
skip tests here because I don't know how
to provision a database we will do it
eventually can you go to the web
interface again yes and gold pipeline
pipelines
pipelines ok science ok so there is a
some kind of rates condition back you
need to cancel this one this this builds
I go to build one cancel build and yes
because I feel like that so now we
scheduled a second build and I can view
the lock for whatever that means that
means that you will be switched over to
Jenkins and you will be able to see how
open ship is running the built of your
application inside the Jenkins instance
it was provisioned the biggest
difference between a clean Jenkins that
you would provision yourself and this
one is that we already inserted the open
 plugin so Jenkins and open ship has
a very how to communicate with each
other so they can link things together
so you see that there is something
happening over here there is a pipeline
ok this this looks like usual Jenkins
console so once again you said when the
cluster so my Jenkins file it has
provisioned Jenkins instance for me it
should yield a build but it didn't work
because it was the first build but and I
have to trigger it manually and now it's
just building what was there in the
Jenkins file right exactly but it's
actually very nice it's running the
build with tests and if you switch over
to the web console of OpenShift again
you will see there is a pipeline over
there and it succeeded already means the
visualization of what was in your own
you're in you're in a Jenkins file and
you see that all the steps finished
because you skip the test oh okay but
this is actually not all I need as I
said my customer wants me to run this as
devups and how do I do you said I need
probably I need an image because
kubernetes is image paste right and how
do I produce the image out of this so
you will be producing the image using
something called maven fabricate plugin
and you can switch to the next version
of the oh the junkets for here ah that's
the next yo maybe we just compare what
you changed it's a bit longer than the
previous one
okay what's what's in there let me
interpret maybe maybe I understand
something so I don't understand this
what is open shift that's that's an
object jenkins file is groovy based dsl
and how does 2d as alone what is open
shift what's that
so essentially open chip is the
motorisation of the open chef plugin so
if you are using this object you are
actually communicating using the open
chef login with OpenShift and how did
plugin get in that's what I mentioned
before it's because you provision the
Jenkins instance to open shifty already
injected the plug-in inside the instance
of off Jenkins so it's very smooth okay
so I I can understand this as a as a
cluster client basically right and I can
do some operations with the cluster
using this object that is somehow there
okay and what am I doing here ah here is
new app did something similar as I did
before but now there's not there's not a
git repository but something else what's
this so you essentially deploying a
docker image from docker hub from the
CentOS organization from the registry
from the namespace Postgres 95 CentOS 7
with the latest tag and you are putting
some environment variables in there so D
database server knows how to configure
itself and the image starts and there is
the name which names the objects will be
created for you ok so I start the
database here and I'm using some
hard-coded user password and I'm passing
them here to my maven build ah he should
have started this build to see if it
actually works and it will take some
time to it succeed so
but actually III I may not push it
because I actually want I don't want to
work with kid hump all the time because
my source code is secret and I don't
want to show it to the whole world and I
don't want to pay for github private
repositories is there a way to get a
private repository inside the cluster
definitely you can be by default we
don't open she doesn't provide you with
git repos but it's pretty easy to
provision something like Docs or get lap
which are open source and can run on top
of the platform so if people want to
have get repos hosted on the public
platform and just deploy one of those
okay what else do I need to to start
with a real pipeline you need the
Jenkins you need the source code you
need and in your case when you don't
want to pay for the github repos you
need the host cell posted get hosting
okay so I see you provided some script
does all these preparations for me
including the internal kit repo and so
on and the script is there in the report
that we shown previously so let's assume
the internal git repo is there and I can
push my code there that's right
you read it from the back it's hard it's
gone let's look what happened in the
cluster so these are the projects that
we have created this project one of the
project is called CI CD okay I can see
GOx that's probably the git repository
inside the cluster this is some storage
for it and I see there is a pipeline
that already passed
we have to login again into Jenkins so
you have essentially deployed a new
Jenkins inside that project different
from the first one so here in the output
we should see somehow that the Jenkins
inside the test is communicating with
freshly provisioned database the output
is quite long but here is bring boot the
container
Springwood is starting and somewhere
there we should see some data based
communication I think just just just
believe that it happens this we can say
some selects and so on this means the
database is there right what's next so
you have essentially deployed git
hosting you have deployed Postgres to
back it up you have deployed jenkins and
you run your pipeline through that
jenkins using the gate source code host
it inside your cluster that's what
happened okay I have switched to the
next stage that you prepared for me and
I have pushed it to the cluster and now
inside the cluster I'll just start the
next build and while it is building we
can perhaps show what it actually does
so let's compare the the jenkins file
what has changed there so I can see you
have you've added a new stage yes I did
and at the beginning of the stage you
are you're invoking some maven plugin
what's that actually so let's fabricate
maven plug-in what it does is it came it
helps you to communicate with open
chipped or kubernetes from maven and in
in this case it would take your source
code uploaded over the d platform and
through the jenkins
it would invoke something called source
to image which is a to link inside
opened
shift that allows you to build images
from source that's why source to image
so you see that some you cannot see it
here because there is a configuration
somewhere else a configuration so I may
configure the plug-in to do something
special for me right yes you can look
because plug-in configuration usually
reside inside pom.xml okay and these are
the changes in pom.xml so over here you
see that there is a profile on the top
which is OpenShift so this profile is
enabled by default OpenShift so you can
have different configuration from
different environment then there is a
lot of other stuff but you want to see
the name of is the percent person is
this one what what's that that's how you
generate the name of your image so when
the image is created it will be named
like like like group slash some name
artefact and then attack so this is this
is the docker stuff
when you build a docker image it would
have this name and it will be pushed
over to the internal registry that's
running in openshift so if you have the
images you want to distribute them you
need some kind of registry so open chip
by default the by default has a registry
in there so you essentially run the run
the build you give the built the source
code it does all these kind of stuff and
once finish it will be put so inside the
cluster I'm running a Jenkins instance
that creates that builds an image and
the image is pushed into the clusters
internal docker registry ok yes and
that's how the cluster elements see the
image ok so and this is the name under
which other parts of the cluster see the
image that I have built and how do I
tell the plug-in what's there in the in
the image and it's probably here the
assembly exactly and I assume the
assembly is just to use usual assembly
plugins assembly that each of us action
No here the poor Dan shell that's the
usual that's the usual
docker stuff that you probably know
already okay and except for that we have
added the failsafe plugin to run a true
integration test against against the
running container and this is the this
is to test so as you may have noticed I
have pushed it as you may have noticed I
have triggered a build and the build
succeeded so this is the this is the new
integration test that was run against a
container that is based on the image
that we just built nice good what's next
what do you need what do I need I have
the image I have tested it mm-hmm I
probably want some way to to to see it
working to play with it a bit and I need
a real production okay so what people
sometimes you like it's not something
that you have to do it's a good practice
so you can have multiple stages in your
in your Jenkins file so one would show
you a running application like a QA that
you can click through and then have a
manual validation like click this button
and then I will propagate this
reproduction right so let's look at the
changes in Jenkins file as you said you
have added new stages ok the stage
called stage and stage called production
right in in stage stage I am produce
provisioning database again ok and I'm
taking I am taking and that let me guess
what it means it probably means that I
take the the image I have built in the
previous step and I am somehow storing
it under
you take called stage correct okay and
then I'm calling new app with this new
tech right that's correct
so and also look at the if that you have
there if this one yeah so if the
deployment
DC is a deployment config and doesn't
exist yet
create a new deployment so we deployed
it Postgres database sorry we had a
database already that was the if before
that but now we are deploying just the
service if it doesn't exist and if you
check the else branch of this script
else here nothing to do because
deployment config already exists and the
deployment config has something called
trigger the trigger can monitor images
in the in the docker registry and when
there is a new image for that particular
name and tag it can trigger a deployment
of the application so in the first step
when you run the pipeline for the first
time it will create the deployment for
you and whenever you do the like
following steps following runs it only
retakes the image that was built in the
first step call it stage and the
deployment already is there and it sees
like whenever there is a new image for
this name do the redeployment so you
don't have to redeploy every time single
time just refresh the image when it
comes ok I see would this work on
playing kubernetes no playing kubernetes
doesn't have something what we call
image streams so it cannot track images
in time it essentially when you trigger
deployment it deploys whatever is there
it doesn't have a more deeper knowledge
of what's directly in there in cube in
the in the in the image so it wouldn't
work the triggers don't work those are
open ships Pacific okay so then what we
do okay there's some input input I know
in pull that construct form from Jenkins
files and we just ask the user for
approval if we one wants to proceed and
what we show
to the user is if we want this stage
image to be promote to the production
let's have a look into the into the lock
of Jenkins oh we have not started it
roll the PT it will take some time as
long as it runs can you switch the loop
of interface of open chip
yeah it's still going there so the
progress can be tracked from here or can
be tried from the lock inside as long as
it reaches the approval you can have a
look what happens in the production
State so once again we provision a
database first and then we actually use
the same technique again meaning that we
take the stage Tech and we store the
same image under new name called
production and we create the D
application of the production star
production tag inside a dedicated
production project okay and once this is
ready the cluster or the the lock of
Jenkins ask doesn't ask it just tells us
the new image is there in production and
shows us the URL that we can click in
the lock
so let's look what happened and in the
Jenkins lock it's building all right
it's probably the old version nevermind
did you put a gate I probably haven't
pushed which is my fault and I won't be
pushing because we would lose quite a
lot of time we will see the manual
in next steps again so let me let let me
switch to the next to the next version
of the demo project we are there that we
are able to click through the
application in the staging environment
you have to trust us yes we are able to
promote manually and we are there in
production we have production
environment where the application is is
working hopefully and if there's
something wrong I have I don't have any
choice to to switch back easily to the
old working to the old working state but
actually as we all know there are quite
well established strategies to handle
this day with this one of them is called
blue green and by blue green deployments
and I have a slide
what it means basically that we have two
versions of the application one of them
is is the old one which is considered
stable runs for some time and the new
one that just just needs to be proven in
production we just label these two
states of the application with with two
different colors blue and green and we
have some element we need some element
in the infrastructure to switch between
them so mark what's what's the element
inside kubernetes the skin that can
switch so in kubernetes it will be a bit
different what we would do is to you
the open cheat element which is called
her out so the route is going to be
pointing at at a service service is
something that whenever you do a
deployment it will create let's say a
proxy it has a stable IP address this
table entry point to application so
whenever we have blue or green we will
change the service that our route should
be pointing at and it will send a
traffic to the other one so the the
thing is with blue greens you do that or
that you don't have a split you always
do hundred percent on one side or a
hundred percent on the other side okay
let's check the tree our master let's
check that we actually push too many
shift we have pushed too many shift
let's go to builds and let's start a
build and hopefully now it will build
what we are what we wants to see let's
see yes we can see here the commit
message and it said that it's the blue
green blue color first but how have we
done it on the level of Jenkins file so
let's compare the Jenkins file with the
previous state again here we are doing
some scaling what's the reason for that
you are using Java so and you have only
some limited resources on your machine
so we are effectively once you go
through the staging part we scale it
down to zero which is like idling so
there are no instances of the
application running so we can save some
memory somewhere here we are scaling to
zero and at the beginning we are scaling
to one and the reason is that all
containers are running on this laptop
and we don't want to have too many
running at once so we are idling them
those ones that we create in in these
two first stages and the change is not
related to Bluegreen deployments okay
but now let's see what has changed
really this is in stage which is still
not so interesting the main change is in
production and in production I first
figure out what's the current color and
the current color is stored there in the
route and as Mark said the route is the
element that is able to switch the
traffic between two versions of the of
between two distinct deployments let's
say because I can by default everything
that runs inside OpenShift or kubernetes
is on the internal network so you cannot
reach it from outside it usually can
reach outside from the cluster but you
can go easily inside the cluster so
that's why there is something called
routes or ingress or something that
allows you to bridge the outside world
with the internal world what was the
communication from outside of the
cluster inside the cluster to our
applications okay so now we are going to
work with those colors blue or green we
are running this for the first time so
the new color should be blue for us
hopefully here the tank step has changed
because now we are using the colored
version of the of what off of the image
name the names are essentially freeform
well not hundred percent if you want to
deal with all these security aspects
that OpenShift provides but in dr. world
income freeform like name it Isis so
here in this case I create a blue tag
and I create the blue deployment here
with the new application command if it
doesn't exist if it exists here again
creating the tank would trigger
deployment of the application and roll
of the new version of the of the image
Here I am scaling to one the blue color
the new one and he delete I am deleting
the colorless deployment that I had
previously just to demonstrate the the
production state and Here I am doing the
switching of the route if the route
didn't exist previously I just created
with the new color and if it existed
I'll switch the color to the switch the
target of the route to the new color
right and I'll show the user what's the
what's the URL of the freshly deployed
application so now we see the real stage
right it's asking us if this is good
enough to be promoted to production if I
click on this it will show me what is
staged staged is blue and production
should be still production should be
color less so I change this prod produce
not there
because you didn't promote it in the
first time ah that's why okay so I
should so over here you can see that the
integration between open cheese and
Jenkins actually is on the input level
as well it just gets you directly to the
page where you can do the manual step in
Jenkins directly from the web interface
okay so we are cheating again imaging
that there was a colorless background
white background in the production
originally and it felt our hostess
it's probably that the step before
wasn't done properly I think we must
stop cheating and do the stage prod
properly build it and then the green
blue green should work which will take
us some time do you want to give some
time to questions now that's a good idea
are there any questions in the audience
I'm not sure how it works with the mics
any questions I cannot see the middle
sign because there is strong light no
okay
yeah so OpenShift container platform is
the product if you go into production
I'd say and OpenShift origin is the open
source project that the product is built
from all the development all the
features are in the upstream and then we
productize it in the platform so
essentially if you do go with the open
source you get all the features what you
don't get is the know-how support etc
from Red Hat so we will be on your own
or community based support in the
production Red Hat as the biggest or one
of the biggest contributors to
kubernetes and docker so and kernel so
we know like we have knowledge and
expertise through all the stack from top
to bottom so we can help you there if
you have problems that's the biggest
value plus certifications and you know
courses and teaching you how to do stuff
help you when there you get stuck
feature wise if you go with the open
source version it will be fun like
there's all the features are there okay
I think I we have total bad luck today
the demo are against us so I think we
just stayed we stay with material we
have here in the demo repository and
stop provisioning because it simply
doesn't work so we were here in the blue
green and we had a switch to green
prepared for you that's here and a
switch to green consists just in
changing the back background of the of
the index.html page and when we'd run it
it should actually show us that we have
we have switched to green and we also
wanted to show that we can switch back
to blue but because the blue didn't work
the switch back to blue wouldn't work
either because in the cluster there's no
working blue version I'm a but let's say
let's go let's go to Canaries and I'll
try to reset my my cluster into the
state where canneries may work so reset
the repo and we can show some some
theory we have to aah
we have named this ones when we do blue
greens we are switching all the traffic
at once and there are two well-known
problems with it first the new
deployment must be able to handle the
database schema changes somehow and the
same must hold for rollback so if we
roll back from blue to green back in
force all versions of deployments must
be compatible with all versions of the
database schema which is not always easy
to get but maybe marriages do some trick
that kubernetes or openshift can help me
in this situation well if you are like
if your changes are not compatible you
will not be able to freely move so what
you can do is effectively when you have
incompatible changes like reset the
state move up and then the robux only
after the
compatible changes and doodles in some
special case special ways open shift and
cube they have when you are deploying
the containers you can also add
something called made diplom open chip
you can do admin deployment hook which
allows you to do something in the middle
of your deployment when your containers
would be down you can do migration then
they would all come up again which is
one of the ways how we can help there
but with the blue greens or if you want
to do something more more fancy usually
it's good to be state less application I
have no state in the application out of
it to somewhere if you have the sessions
have some some distributed cache or
something that the basis to be backward
compatible etc most of the things have
been covered years back in 12 factor
applications if you follow those you
will cover most of the problems that you
will have okay and when it comes to
database schema changes you should
definitely read Exxon's book
I mean excellently Onaga that is
supposed to have such next session now
and he has written a whole book about it
and there are many small details in the
book that might you might find
interesting
so let me out try to bring my cluster
into the state that would be able to to
digest
the cannery change and I have somewhere
a script here the deletes or objects
that might be there hanging
so I'm still there as a developer and
I'll do it all deployments and services
and probably this would allow me to run
the build don't do this in production
not fail ok I'm on the right revision
here I'll push to the cluster and in the
cluster I'll trigger the next build you
know pray to demo goods that this will
somehow work while it's running let's
have a look at how we do Connery's
actually so with blue greens all the
traffic or either there or there with
Canaries we are gradually rolling out
the new version at the beginning there's
just a small part of the traffic sent to
the new canary and the rest of the
traffic goes to the original stable
deployment and we are observing the
canary for some time how it behaves and
if it's passing our checks we gradually
increase the amount of traffic that is
going to canary up to hundred percent
and in that moment the cannery becomes
original stable and we can try a new
canary okay well it looks like in the
Jenkins file you just compare again we
are skipping tests so that it runs
faster we are skipping the integration
tests to and probe here
mariko this probe so in in this case
over here it's a it's a health probe
so liveness entertainer's probes are
there directly in kubernetes that check
if the container is still up and ready
if it fails to do one of those probes it
will be restarted or somehow handled
based on the state that it actually is
in so they're like the readiness probe
checks if the container is already up
and running so it will not be connected
to like it will not be allowed to
receive new connections new stuff until
the application is up so you can you
because like I don't know
Springwood I'm not not sure how fast
ping booth is but some java application
servers they have a long startup time
okay let's shorten it because we have no
time i have implemented a special health
endpoint that that is cheating its
returning what we need for the sake of
this demo and in this revision it's
always returning 200 which means access
basically with Canaries it's up to me as
a Java developer to decide how I will
describe how I will assess that my
application is healthy and in this case
I'm fully treating it's healthy all the
time and here father there's a loop that
checks the health of the new deployment
and if it sees 200 for like 20 seconds
it checks ten times and waits for two
seconds it considers the deployment
stable and promotes it to its saints
hundred percent of the whole traffic
there at the beginning we are splitting
the traffic 50/50 to the new and old and
at the end here we are sending hundred
to the new if this succeeded right this
is a hack so this is something good for
demos if you go into production or do
some real work you definitely want to do
something more rigorous how to determine
if your canary is alive so you would be
monitoring getting metrics from our
application and based on that you would
actually make the decision not if you
application rate gives you 20 seconds
200 right that's good for
nice checks that's not good for
promotions okay as you can see the build
failed in the middle not where it was
supposed to I'm sorry about that we are
out of time
please check the demo in the repository
these are basically things we want you
to remember from this application from
this presentation
there's mini cube mini shift for
starting experimenting you can deploy it
on your laptop and if you take care how
many containers you are running you can
do nice things with it this Jenkins
pipeline that is considered a
first-class citizen down shift and it's
unfortunately not the case on playing
kubernetes and jenkins file is powerful
enough to script your own deployment
strategies however you think it out for
you and the source of this demo is there
thank you thank you I'm sorry there is
still time for a QA if you want to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
