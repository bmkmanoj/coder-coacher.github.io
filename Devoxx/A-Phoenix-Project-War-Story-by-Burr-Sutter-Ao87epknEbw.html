this is an element of storytelling
specifically that I came up with it's a
different kind of presentation it's
meant to be fun and light-hearted and
more importantly I want to encourage all
of us to start telling stories to each
other okay so this is specifically my
Phoenix project war story we're going to
walk through it real fast but this came
about because I met a fellow named Jean
Kim and I'll tell you what happened
specifically I did a keynote at a
certain conference it was actually the
Dead Nation conference a couple years
ago in Boston and then Jean Kim was also
there's a keynote presenter and then
after I got offstage and I'd done my
presentation I was walking down a
hallway and several people walked up to
me and said hey I loved your
presentation I said usually like the
demo because my presentations always
involved demos they said no but the
presentation is so great I'm buying your
book they realized they're not talking
about me okay and so I actually talked
to Jean about it and he's actually
seeing this presentation so here's how
this goes so Jean Kim is absolutely
everywhere if you actually don't know
who Jean is I'd highly recommend you
start following this gentleman and
understanding what he's doing for the
world at large he's fundamentally going
out and preaching the concepts of DevOps
to everybody and trying to get the whole
world engaged for an IT standpoint
because if we start applying these
practices to our everyday lives we will
fundamentally build better software
faster and more importantly just create
a more humane environment for Aiki
workers in general okay so the Phoenix
project is a fantastic book if you've
not read it so this is Jean Kim on the
left-hand side here and this is me and I
brought my glasses too so you know might
be the vibe might be it
so he's the real Jean Kim and I thought
of myself as the unreal Jean Kim so from
a comparison standpoint he's been an
entrepreneur he's the king of DevOps
I've been a developer advocate I work
for Red Hat so that really doesn't have
much similarity you know so he's the
founder of the DevOps Enterprise Summit
which is a great conference I founded my
own conference way back when it's called
den nexus of Atlanta he's a world-famous
author
I've written some tweets so you can see
there's not much common ground here how
do people I didn't know why people were
confusing us could you see that why
could you understand why so maybe it was
just a goatee and that's what everyone
confused us on so perhaps we have
something else in common and that
specifically
the focus on the hands on people right
he focuses on hands on operations folks
I focus on hands on developers and this
is the problem that we have today right
developers think they can just throw
stuff over the wall and bounce it off
the operations team head at their head
you like my Harry Potter image there
there's a new one that we have but that
concept has been for pervasive
throughout our industry as a matter of
fact I think we've taken the joy at a
programming when we basically told
developers you never see it run all you
got to just get it to compile and check
it in okay because you never see it run
right the CI system actually does to
build it goes through staging and QA etc
and it makes it over to production where
someone else makes it run it's kind of
like mover back in college and all we
had to do is get it to compile and
that's all the were done with the
project I feel like we've done that
again to ourselves by having this wall
on the separation so we have to break
down this wall and bring these two sides
together and this is super huge and
super important because this is what the
whole team now looks like at least is
how I like to think of it okay so I have
my my Harry Potter manager she loves you
know our my QA manager she loves Harry
Potter she's a big fan my PMO is a big
you know the project management office
they're big fan of Game of Thrones
perhaps the ops team I think of them as
Spock right and of course the DBA has to
be Darth Vader but the point of this is
all these folks are part of our same
team and you have common ground with all
of them as an example as a matter of
fact Comic Cons coming up you can all
get dressed up and go together we're all
geeks together as my basic point here so
just keep that in mind and by the way
the security team here I'm not saying
they're zombies I'm saying they like The
Walking Dead
they're not like The Walking Dead you
don't I mean just keep that in mind so
this is my personal Phoenix project
story and here's how this goes it
actually happened in Phoenix Arizona of
all things so this is where again
someone mistake it had mistaken identity
thought Oh gene Kim said you know I
liked her books I had to go read the
book at that point and I've read the
book it's a phenomenal work of fiction
that talks about how they actually
destroyed a business by an IT software
rollout so they basically rolled out to
production stop the business dead cold I
did this myself okay so this is
approximately about 1516 years ago was
actually a dotnet app at the time I was
actually running the local
our user group putting on a Java
conference organizing Java events and
doing dotnet is my day job I was a CTO
specifically of this small company and I
reported directly for the VP and CEO of
the company directly for this project
and it was one of those things where
they said we absolutely have to hit a
deadline no matter what the scope of the
project is three times bigger than
anything you've ever seen and we were
just deliberate no matter what okay that
was the absolute goal we had to deliver
that thing they were moving from an old
character user interface to a new modern
web application which meant not only
were the people working for the company
getting a nice new user interface but
they're also opening it up to their
actual customers an e-commerce style and
letting people do their shopping online
for the very first time all of this was
happening on a single day we had to hit
a certain deadline with no cutover
strategy whatsoever there was no running
in parallel there was no migration it
was just go so this is how we kind of
went after it because this is
specifically what my boss told me okay I
said we cannot hit the deadline we will
not actually achieve all the
functionality we certainly won't have
any quality right that's your triangle
we won't have all three as a matter of
fact we won't even be able to sleep and
you said you can sleep when you're dead
and I've taken I took that to heart
that's actually a core philosophy I take
with me now everywhere I go for every
project that I take on because this is
fundamentally true you can sleep when
you're dead
so I did think about that and my old
boss does look a little bit like that
potato boss if you don't I mean from
that perspective a little little less
hair but otherwise about same so here's
how we organize our project to pull this
trick off we baste a Colo dude to death
so I was a team leader I was the lead
architect everything at this point so I
had to hire people specifically but
already pulled some people internally
then you had the right skill set we
actually Colo did co-located desks I
specifically moved all whole bunch of
people out of the room and now the area
that I needed my team to be in and I
moved myself out of the office that I
had and into the middle cubicle of all
these other cubicles because that way if
a decision had to be made and a meeting
had to happen here's how a stand-up
meeting looked for us I would jump up
onto the desk looking out over all the
cubicles and ask everyone for their
status and reload balance project tasks
if we had to and I
do that all throughout the day now it
was crazy I'm standing on a desk but my
boss said you can sleep when you're dead
so I met that meant to me
all rules are broken and so all forms of
decorum were broken at that point we
actually built our own servers put them
on everybody's desk
forget the data center we pulled
everything into right where we were so
we could go as fast as we possibly could
go it was kind of insane
now we did demos every week we did it on
burned down chart we invented these
things on the fly we'd heard about agile
I'd been to a few agile conferences but
in this case we absolutely had to go
super fast and we had to be as super as
you know we had to trim every possible
process aspect out of it so I basically
just built a bird down chart with a
spreadsheet and we just went for it yeah
basically went hard okay we demoed every
week and I actually put on the calendar
invite for every demo because I want the
developers did not do the 8020 trick you
guys have seen this before the
developers always 80% done for weeks and
weeks and weeks so I said you're going
to demo everything you turn in as a
feature you're going to demo it weekly
because we had a weekly deliverable the
CEO is invited every presentation he
only showed up once but I got to tell
you one time he did show up from that
point forward the developers hit their
weekly deliverable there was no more
alone no longer any mr. particular
presentation so we hit the production
deadline and we shut down the business
we literally stopped their business
because we had so many bugs in the
system we rolled it out we were double
charging people's credit cards we
couldn't do refunds
they had a point-of-sale system where
you'd walk into a brick-and-mortar store
the barcode scanner stopped working and
this is the best part we integrated with
a bunch of third-party systems too
including a key system to let you in and
out of buildings we locked people out of
buildings we fundamentally watched the
whole thing
five million dollars was in play at that
very moment and of course everybody was
in a massive panic attack so we had to
get super smart and we basically applied
all those same principles I talked about
but we got really we got really crazy
really fast so we understood you know we
couldn't be finger pointing it wasn't
just a business or the executive team or
the development team or the operations
team that you know did the rollout we
all had to get on the same boat and get
get on the same page so we started
rolling out patches
every night we went to Oh daily
deliverable at that point because we had
to start fixing things and I basically
spent time with a business everyday
what's the next most worst thing you
know it's the refund thing a big problem
or the double charge of credit cards a
big problem no because this is back when
you could store credit card numbers so I
actually got up one of our guys who
basically fixed the credit cards
manually on the fly seriously right
would retype the number in and actually
get the right charge associated credit
card refunds we just said we'll give you
a refund the future we just told the
customers back but we've emailed them
later we actually did everything by hand
where we couldn't actually do things on
in an automated fashion it was kind of
insane but it worked and we actually
pulled everyone together and we might
find that top priority item and fix it
okay we did also had bug fix Saturdays
because we weren't going fast enough and
I realized that the developers didn't
have enough skin in the game so
basically we rolled out throughout the
week and if we still had high-priority
items for that week that hadn't been
negotiated the business and things were
still bad you all had to come in on
Saturday everybody and we would work and
here's what I found we only had to do
two of those Saturdays before the
engineers started producing vastly
better code by Friday I'm not kidding
and so I've talked about that a great
length if you ask people to work every
weekend until the code doesn't suck the
code gets a lot better faster okay so we
got we did all that this is kind of the
journey I like to think of from a
perspective of moving in from a
developer moving as a DevOps world the
concept of DevOps is a cultural problem
is a team promise the communication
problem it's how you organize and
specifically how you motivate the people
on your team and I think that's super
fundamental and it is the key aspect of
what it's what it means to be digitally
transformed and become let's say this
feature microservices kind of software
developer you have to have elastic
infrastructure you need some form of
automation rather be kubernetes puppet
chef transyl
you've got to think in terms of CI CD
right maybe a plant like yesterday I did
advanced deployment techniques with
Canary deployments and things of that
nature these are all key aspects of
actually getting ready for being you
know rolling out software in that new
way maybe that might be micro services
do read these picture books they're
absolutely awesome as far as the Phoenix
project goes and the follow-on book the
DevOps handbook also by Jess humble and
John so there's Jon jazz and Patrick
specifically worked on that second book
there
all fantastic I keep them by my bedside
or referred to them often I go on to the
Phoenix project now two or three times
it is that great okay
so let's kind of get close to wrapping
up here do you guys know who Viktor
Frankl is look up the Wikipedia page if
you don't know about Viktor Frankl he's
incredibly famous as kind of an early
philosopher and as psychology person if
you will and he specifically was a Nazi
concentration camp victim he lost most
of his family members in Nazi
concentration camp but he wrote these
kind of statements down because these
were core philosophies for him we were
no longer able to change our situation
we have to change ourselves okay and in
his situation he had a really bad one
but he fundamentally understood you
could only control you okay at the end
of day and so if everything can be taken
away from you the last of all human
freedoms is to choose one's attitude in
any set of circumstances and this is so
fundamental to how I think at this point
in my life and from that experience or
from other experiences this is exactly
the core principle I talked about with
all my children because a tenday it
might suck my rules my responsibilities
oh it's not your fault it's still your
responsibility and all you can do at
this point is choose your attitude and
how you respond okay that's it for me
thank you so much if you have questions
feel free to email me or follow me on
Twitter and I hope you enjoyed this
presentation I certainly enjoyed kind of
talking about this stories this story
and I hope you guys talk to each other
about your own Phoenix project war
stories thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
