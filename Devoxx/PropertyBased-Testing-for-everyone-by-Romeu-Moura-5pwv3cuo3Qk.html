hi so I'm Romeo you can find me at
Twitter and mugs MF just like my name
and I colonize a conference in France
called n crafts which you should really
go come come to France let's do
something so we're here to talk about
property values testing right I hope we
were in the right session so who here
knows what is a property I was half of
you right so for the others for the sake
of this presentation we start with a
really gross definition of properties
which we say that is something that is
always true this is not really true the
more details today but let's keep that
simple right and buy something that's
always true I do not mean a tautology
which is also something that is always
true not an invariant which is also
something that no is always true so to
give a little more detail a property is
something that is always true to your
context right it's not absolute let's
keep this who here's haven't done the
bowling cutter Oh
who here's AB played bowling okay a
little more that's better that is better
so lots of you haven't played at all so
the bowling game the bottom cut is just
you have to do the scoring algorithm of
the bowling game in the program itself
right but the bowling game is you
true-true a ball then you have pain of
frames to Train ten different frames
will have ten different pins in front of
you to try to make make them go down and
you have a treat frame should chew balls
that you can throw to make them to go
down and the number of points is the
number of pins that you can make go down
right
and usually if you know your score is
the sum of of this except when you do a
strike or a spare which are special
cases in a strike you make them all go
down the first ball off a frame and then
you have ten points plus the bonus the
as bonus points to this frame the points
over the next two balls and I spare with
when you take two balls to do this like
five and five or zero and ten and frame
has ten points plus the score of the
next ball so thing is if you were to do
the bowling cutter together here in CDG
classical example based testing using
EEG you probably write it like this
right we have the case where we have no
points then the score is zero we have
the names of the test awful this is not
a coincidence I have the Indians entire
presentation I have made it a priority
to have really awful test names and we
will see why soon so then we will go to
I have some single points and is this
some of them that is my score then we'll
try spare so here we have three and
seven times ten points and one and you
see that we have three plus seven plus
one and one
this is the bonus and we'll try another
espera just do not do the same thing
Anthony will try strike a more complex
strike in a perfect day that if we were
to do this cutter here by doing GG and
try example by example this would be
pretty much what the test will do and in
the end of the day we know that
each one of those tests do not represent
every single possible entry point well
you know that they are there to
represent a more generic phone each
right so quick question today who here
does tests at all
okay well keep your hands up if you do
gdg and now keep your hands up if your
tests today resemble this alright we
have few hands you are lying you are
liars your tests do not reasonable this
your tests resemble this right you know
if you are honest ourselves this is what
your tests look like right today you can
easily generate that tell me this
there's some level caricature here but
you're you are doing some beings were
some photos were you putting things
inside things inside things inside
things inside things that you can make a
call and search for a result well here
is my victory this boolean otherwise I
would put things inside things inside
things to create my written in C there
above equal does that rings a bell to
everyone right right so let's go back to
our simple we will go back to this but
let's go back to this primitivism here
that you are not real real life optional
right what is the problem of this well
that's several but the names are often
right and this is not represent of your
life and this does not represent all
possible case what we just put in some
election area we have put in some people
to represent all the others right and
last night we see what elections can do
right so fingers what I want is not to
do examples what I want is to test all
the behavior here each one of those case
that three cases here those two are the
same thing
those two are the same thing it all
stree are the same thing
what I wanted to test them together
because by creating different tests what
I'm saying is that they are different
things
so right now when I get to this I have
to search what are what is the more
generic thing that is being tested here
well I could just delete some of them
leave three right that would be better
or not so and I and when I get here I
have to read a third document in my name
or read my input in fact understand what
does it represent
and read my output and try to understand
what does it represent this is a faith
weakness at least well examples are very
good I'm not saying you should not do
them when I say Ms who he has never done
BDD or try to do BDD try to do three
amigos right those few people there when
you speak with a business domain expert
that person you have to fight with them
to give you your examples right that
person tries to give you business
business rules it doesn't want to give
you example it doesn't want to say well
when I put this when I put the the
design to the points here and I have
this behavior and then I have these
outputs it doesn't want to tell you this
you want to tell you tell you what I
seen in the beginning he wants to tell
you when I when I when I don't have an
expert and they I don't have in any
strikes 10 my score is the sum of all
pains you you put down when I do have
them time as far as different that's
what the business domain wants to give
you and that's what you try to represent
by an example and fair enough you should
still try to keep taking those examples
from the business because just that that
dynamic of trying to extract the
examples will change the views of the
business rules so that's very positive
you should keep trying should
distract those examples but once you do
we still want to test the business room
so let's improve this who hears her has
ever done paramita is testing a colorful
perfect that's good that's very good if
I in permit eyes testing I could merge
those two together right like this this
is the first shoe I had and then as I
was already putting those his parameters
to my test well it was not expensive to
put two more right it's not very
expensive so what you see here is that
usually I have a valid beef here is
usually people doing parameterized
testing they they have this failure in
my view which is they try to pass the
inputs and the outputs as parameters but
then this is not very different from
doing this separating different tests
right if you were to block this we Forge
the parameters testing but not put every
input and output as parameters at least
one of those is blocked then each test
represents a specific thing in a just
parameters and what is variable about it
right for example I old client I had
formalized integration testing that have
one test for two URLs and HTTP HTTP
codes and say jeez where L should give
this HTTP code this is where I'll show
the middle suit code we could probably
have split this and they and give well
those were actual work this is a test
those were actual work in a list and
another test those words should fail
analyst right but that should be better
so here yes just taking the nominal case
and say all those are nominal and the
behavior is that is the son and the
score should be between zero and three
harlot which are the ball minimum
maximum score in the boundary game
anyway right so
fingers I really have a remark remark
we're gonna do this presentation which
is have a not put the solution in the
test what I did this and and I would
argue that not yet we are almost in the
limit the limit of doing this this is
the most contentious case I can find I
I'll defend to you that tests you have
to roam in the domain of the problem and
not in the main of the solution you code
can can Roman domain the probably no me
no solution use it doesn't usually your
code just speaks about the solution
never about the problem that said but
your test should remain firmly in the
main of the problem another solution and
which you could do several solutions
here that would have failed prop the who
passed this test right thing is once you
do this now I want to have a single test
for the monomial cases and now when I
come to this here was testing these
entries should have this output these
entries should have this output here I
am tested these entries here she'll have
this behavior you see the change we were
from input output input output from
inputs behaviors and that's quiet it
seems like a neat neat picking but
there's a very important change that is
very important split for here because
here although we are not using any
frameworks to do it we are starting the
beginning of what I'm talking about when
we're talking about property based
testing we are starting to specify the
behaviors of a business rule inside the
test itself right because usually when
people come presentations about property
based testing I mean if you go online
you'll search the tutorial about
property based testing you have the
properties that I hate see
tutorials because it's always the same
you have well the sum of two integrals
works right or is associative fayus
those properties are very good I mean
I'm not spitting on mathematical
properties like associativity having a
neutral number or have written it in the
HC thank you
object or having a commutativity or
something like this those are very cool
properties and if you are searching for
them right now do keep searching for
them you feel or not you should look at
them but my point here we feel today is
to dispel the myth that property based
testing is something that a is only for
people doing for FB is not the case I'm
doing this in Java I could actually do
this in Java 6 6 so it's really not a
point second that property based testing
is something for only people doing
mathematical stuff and what I want you
to show it to you today is that your
business domain is filled with domain
invariants and those the many variants
can be tested with properties those the
many varrick's our code of business
rules and you should be testing those
business rules today any or not I mean
maybe
who here is testing those business rules
today with property based testing no all
right so you should so once I started
doing this I still have problems right
the first one is that you have to and
now I have the behavior here I do not
have I do not have to go to the output
and try to understand what is this oh
this is the son of all my inputs what is
this well this is the sum of my inputs
and a bonus right this something I do
not have to discover by reading because
here I have spelled it out I have
specified it into the
itself but I still have to read those
and try to understand if I do not know
the business domain rules and usually
you don't write it is easy in the
bowling but using in a real application
you do not know all the business rules
so if you are blindly try to fight your
way though those business rules this is
better than nothing but it's not perfect
right it's not we could do better and
there is also another very personal
problem with this as I find this really
boring but well that's just me maybe so
how can we do better no fear in the
beginning is strange no don't don't
don't fall to the trap I think that's
something that is not familiar it's hard
or or worse it isn't familiar maybe no
but what I'm saying here basically
assumptions is something that already
exists in g-unit I'm not talking about
anything only things here that my
framework give me is this this right
everything else are already things that
you can find today without anything else
important anything else we just unit you
just important itself assumptions are
when they fail the test is not educated
the test doesn't fail the test is not
executed and assertions are when they
fail the test fails right this is
already current jion's behavior and I
want to dispel another another myth here
is that property based testing is
something that you need and to learn a
lot of new frameworks of things or maybe
even a new language to do if you are
doing Java today in a legacy code base
today you after this presentation should
probably be able in your real code base
to start playing with property based
testing about 20 minutes of investment
so we really should do it right
so here what I'm saying is if you give
me only integrals between 0 &amp;amp; 4
now I'm because I'm not testing
every possible nominal case and just
guaranteeing that if you are between 0 4
and never have a sparrow strike right
this is not good it's just better than
before and that's why I'm try to push it
you should do better with a before and
assuming they know my number of frame is
between 0 and 10 I should have my
supposed to be the sum of my balls and
with sushi beating between 0 300 right
now what I find striking about this is 1
now I have my business domain spelled so
this should help me more than this and
my business to make quickly just by
reading it true I really don't like the
idea of to every test writing this this
is painful right every new test I want
to test my behavior I have to write
those things this is very painful and
that's a good thing that this is before
it was not painful here at all and here
it is what I wanted to show you is I'd
not I'd not claiming that property based
estimate solve all your problems
or that you can test everything property
based testing you know why I don't do
not paint that test themselves we solve
all your problems but most untested code
bases that across legacy code base there
across they real awful code or
atrocities that I see I've done by
people that did not test at all that the
worst of the worst I don't know people
are you notice arrow because if you're
doing TDD right creating that class that
should be 40 classes not 14 foreign
classes it's very very very boring you
play on people laziness
just by doing tdg they are dropping that
behavior away just that one right and
here I get in another behavior which is
I had no problem what I when I created
my examples having those inputs when I
swear this pastor here if you think it's
clear that I have an another thing that
that comes up which is this really
should be another object if I have to
never proper chip create create those
filters and say well yeah I take any
input but you know really what I want is
the inputs between these in this you you
should have value objects and your
property based testing makes the those
variable this that your failure to have
value objects scream at you and that's a
good thing and you do not have them in
not enough to date in your code base so
just by doing them you should start
seeing those things pop up so do so
phase if you look at my next assumption
which takes this together what I'm
saying is if I have a spare then then I
take my score should be greater than
equals this is not my business rule
right I did the same thing here where
the parameter is testing I just put all
my two cases of spares and I said well
it should be greater than my then within
a sum of my price of my balls right did
this is very weak this is not my whole
deal this is not my whole property why
did I do this then I did it because
there is no I did not find a way of
writing this
and not put part of the solution into
the test itself and that's the line
because if you start putting the
solution the test itself what a testing
is not no longer that you're cool your
program has this behavior but the
program behaves like itself
and that's usually true does use a
little told you a program user behaves
like itself right so your test drops in
user fulness so which you can do things
like well it is greater than it's
greater than this then you get a weaker
property you do not create a problem
like this first one here that's just
solved just solve all my tests here
those tests could disappear and be
replaced by it my second one could not
what I showed you is that if if you
started in property based testing
sometimes you have to achieve a limit
and say okay I'll have some weaker
properties and some example based
testing the Chu group which you will
complete each other that's fine that's
fine there are limits to it there is not
a perfect silver bullet that's fine we
should still use it when you can use it
and that's a lot of places so let's get
back to this right because you test
today are not like I said in the
beginning I'm not like the first tests
are shown they are more like this right
does everyone here understand this test
right now if I don't ask
very quickly this it's very
understandable right I mean everyone can
see that this is the single value that
changes anything in my test right it's
obvious me when I'm testing is that when
this value is bigger than the threshold
10
this thing here is true should be
obvious to everyone well in real life
you probably put some sugar into this
right
in real life you probably right now you
are probably just either putting this
into builders or putting these into
fixtures or at least putting comments to
say this is the important thing right
well I'm tactic it's a caricature but
you get my point
in real life you trying to show that
this is the important part because in
real life you have no choice right now
you are creating that objects that you
put inside an object a personal object a
beautiful object and most of them have
made Atari fields that you just have to
kind of feel right so what you are doing
what I am trying to tell you here today
is that what you are currently doing is
already the purest way of doing property
based testing ever because you are doing
random entry points it's just there are
random exactly once they are random at
programming time nothing not even
compiling time you it's like throwing a
dice and choosing this one you say well
this is my random entry here for this
thing that is mandatory way and what I
try to convince you is that if you were
today to start using random inputs here
and here in everything that you do just
saying I do not care about the value of
this right then nothing could change
right nothing should change this test
here was the testing is if the dosage
goes beyond at least four grams then I
should have this alert of I mean I'm a
doctor that prescribes something I will
kill my patient this is the test
right and I created a patient and a drug
in a dosage and back of drugs and a
period a proper form a prescription etc
that's just on to the point where I
create a prescription and in my test is
well that's prescription there is
prescribed the doctor it should be a lot
on alert so if I were to put everything
else beside this here as random the test
shoots to pass and if some day it
doesn't if I if I put random in
everything else in at some point the
test does not pass what does that mean
it means that either there was a bug
that you have not foreseen in your test
and you have to find it or that your
understanding of the business rule was
bad you have a buggy Aitor in the code
or in your understanding of the business
rule and that's the point of property
based testing the point is that property
based testing is a bet it's like an
insurance when you take an insurance
policy you are taking a bet with your
insurer
you are betting every month I'm bettin
that this month I will have an accident
or someone will steal from my house or
I'll have a fire and your insurer is
betting you'd not we will not this movie
this will not happen and every month you
lose a bet and you happy right it is the
same principle you take in a bet around
what you think is true about your code
and the framework is trying to bat with
you that this folks you are wrong about
what you understand about your code and
when it's green it doesn't mean you are
right it just mean I could not have you
this time but I will someday just this
time I haven't
right and this is also true to your
current example base testing when an
example based testing when this goes
green it is only saying I could not have
you this time the problem is next time
you try the same thing right
crazily trying and trying the same entry
point and try to prove you wrong so it
has very little changes or actually
going for proving you fall someday
whereas this will try by changing some
entries and respecting what you believe
to be true
do not try things outside of your
beliefs just try things inside your
beliefs and try to prove you wrong and
maybe someday that will and if I were
first I say if I were to keep this fixed
and everything else random and if I were
to go further and say well I don't want
this to feel fixed you and not what I
really don't want to say that fog tester
is only for I want to test everything
that is bigger than 3 grams goes with me
a problem right and tomorrow he finds
that three and a half doesn't well you
have discovered either a bug on your
understanding of the problem or a bug in
your code and if most later we
discovered that 40 of hundred grams
doesn't yell this then should be fair
you probably have a bug in your code but
that's good if you discover it right so
how we do that how do that today every
property free property based testing
framework I mean if if you don't do Java
that this is a quick check you need
quick check that I'm using here is just
a plug-in that you can use with unit
today so if your code base is using
JUnit today you can just put this and
move and start using it
but if you don't do Java have Scotch
eggs ever outs if what I mean is how can
we do this today
and my point with you is that even if
you do the OP this awful thing I'm doing
and you should not never okay maybe if
you do this awful awful thing here which
means just copying and pasting what I
have already my test everything this
presentation is usually legacy and test
not a coincidence I'm doing this to show
you that even in your current legacy
code bases you can really do it feasibly
and quickly today that next Monday
please do it so even if I were just to
take this and copy and paste it to a
class and say I'll just call random in
anything in everything I do not care
right that stick seconds to do this
literally if in fact we're should just
copy and paste it and put randoms in my
holes in the points that I do not care
about I would end up with a generator
that I could use with each of those
frameworks and I would end up with four
tests that I exaggerated when I do this
we could do with weightless I apologize
but was just to show the worst case
scenario of a test that goes from this
to this to those two lines and those two
lines what they are telling me is they
my dosage is greater than 310 I should
have a little alert but those that this
test is telling me is directly my
business
nothing else and is also showing me that
I have a violation of the Demeter's law
in my code base there is huge
but fair enough the code the passenger
profiles based sob not here magically
our code base your legacy will still be
there but now you have tests that
instead of I get here and try to
understand what you did and what was
important what was not
I forget completely about everything
that is not my business rule and those
tests are testing everything they could
test outside of it testing the business
rule itself so you haven't a test that
is tercer smaller the tests more and
test in tests your business rule I count
that as a win and if you if I were to
execute this you understand that it
would fail that my first test passes and
this one should fail yep pretty sure
because in that specific case here I
have created a code that does does only
take those into consideration and it was
the case our train to Illustrator we
have find surprises right we could find
that pregnant women have different
different rules for when they relate to
read to education or allergic people or
other things right your business rule
can have some complications some
compounding some compromises and the
fingers usually don't know using a
business people don't don't have in mind
all these complications or they have in
the fitness lobules so they ask they
just think that you should know it and
usually when you have an old code base
you have past generations and
generations of people working
they have crossed several different
corner cases and put that into code
right and that code if has a lot of soft
bugs you know things about your domain
because nobody bothered to put the why
they just changed over time
so the code know things about the domain
that your chin does not and that it
maybe even our business domain experts
do not know because the code is older
than the know right who has lived there
that here oh yeah right I have lived a
set so many times and and then you can
use the property based test and to ask
questions to your code as it were
another business domain expert sometimes
it will be wrong because he has bugs but
you can ask it and asking it is a
powerful move because now when you have
when your business domain expert give
you a business rule you can quickly go
and write this as a profit based testing
make it row with your code
ask your code is this brew true and if
it comes up with an exception you can
either ask yourself is my bug called it
do I have a bug or go to the business
case your business let me actually say
hey have you forgot a corner case here
and you have this to to help you have
this discussion write it this is
important you can also use it because
you can ask questions to your code you
can also use it as a very good to to do
characterization testing it gets you
unknown code you have no properties to
test with them sorry
no proper to test with them you get that
unknown code code and you put properties
to say well I think it has this behavior
I think I think we know when I have
entries like this I should have this
behavior so you test what are your ideas
of the code to make a test that mayor
suit yourself we felt understand what it
does we'll have a huge blob it helps a
lot to do this and it should so for ways
of using characterization challenging
your business domain experts testing
from route that given by the business
domain experts or taking together your
correct tests and merging them together
into properties right and with these
four users each one of the Great's you
brings you up with value I usually have
some people have user have four problems
when they I give this presentation so
our answer to you before asking
questions I'll answer those four right
now if I have hey but isn't this less
sure then normal testing because it can
fail some day and oh no way and right so
I already have given the answer to that
this today I have go a far away for
myself which is no no no you are not
testing less the finger testing is just
should to assure that that this behavior
here is true and this behavior here is
to tested right so you're not testing
less you're testing more right that's my
first fear people have there's a second
fear people usually have which is what
does it happen when I buy have Nathan
right and I am gonna do a maven release
and I have continuous integration and I
I do am a for easy Jenkins and the
property based testing just fails it
worked in the death devs machine it work
when I committed but I've tried to
release it fails well if that happens
it's the same situation where you try it
is building Jenkins to do a release and
someone from QA arrives and say hey I
have fun a bug
why do you do today with someone from QA
say hey ever have found a bug even for
release is building a derp
either you say well let's stop
everything or you say well let's just
forget about this right now right I'll
let you choose which one you really do
but is one of those two and you can't
you say that with property based testing
is the same situation right another use
of consideration I have with disease
well Romeo my tests as low a very slow
because what I haven't said here is it
cannot try each and every entry right
you cannot is not possible you cannot
just try even have every possible input
here so it tries like each time you
executed it tries hundred a hundred of
them that's all and each time is x2 to
Hatter to try a different hard ones is
that slow isn't no it is not if you have
a very very good test don't normally
view any test conditions is it it is not
slow but telling you well if you test a
close you should refactor it is not
helping right if I just tell it fast and
slow is because this test site so you
should change the test it is not a
helpful answer so I'll give you a
compromise at the graded view of this if
your tests take minutes to execute of
several seconds to execute and you do
not want to execute at hundred times
make them proper based tests and before
you make them faster make them
profitable test and configure it so each
time you executed it price once
for performance safety will be the same
thing nothing will change each one of
them will be executed one time but now
between each execution of the test
itself things are changing we are not
saying I will have you next time the
next time and try the same emote inputs
I was I'm saying I will have you the
next time I try a different one it's
already better it's not perfect is not
good but it's better than what you have
today right there's a compromise and
then you make it faster please but start
from there do your proper business and
your tests will end up at least looking
instead of hoping like this looking like
that it it's something so go into that
direction so whatever I have we have
seen is properties can be extracted from
a but can be extracted from your current
accurate tests you can do it even of
legacy code base you can do it too easy
for legacy tests you could do it in
legacy languages and you can do it if
you from WFP right and you should and
you should have different tests and you
should have it evolving every time and
not doing right now it isn't the
optional itself
where we get is
sometimes is not that simple sometimes
you cannot change your currents that
sometimes some kind of discovery things
sometimes you you lost in to what you
cure it will have create another file
just create a new one you can start
today just create a new fight you have
no excuse so I have prepared this
presentation usually for 45 minutes and
I could keep going a little more but I
would like to have a change with you
let's put some questions in it can we
have some questions here or do people
have questions at all yeah go for it oh
very good one so let's talk about
shrinking so usually when property-based
essence fail it tells you I had this
input here and it did not work you have
to interpret it you don't know why did
not work right you don't know why it did
not work you just say I have this I have
this input here that doesn't work right
and you have to do that you have to try
to find why I haven't but it published
based test frameworks try to help you
there
it does shrinking what is shrinking as
soon as it gets a entry that does not
work it tried to create simpler ones and
see if they don't work too to give you
the simplest one they can it does so
buzzed by scary things out for any
current one that doesn't work if it has
one big string that doesn't work it cuts
pieces of it and tried it smaller parts
of it to see if you have another one a
smaller one that doesn't work for
example right and tries to find you the
smallest input that doesn't work s1 if
I'd want that doesn't work at all I had
the problem with when I was testing for
integration test I was testing a PL API
calls that passes the body of my REST
API as a random to the
to the server at the beginning I had
like this huge Japanese in Korean
characters strings that was mega decent
because he's random right and and
fingers I was thinking it was a char
char set problem and when I saw was it
reduced it to a very small string and
when I searched inside it it was just no
printable characters that what crushing
my rest api server right so it gives you
something you can work with then that's
a main point of it and if you two need
an example to better document it that
there is nothing forbidding to create an
example but besides it right you had a
question sir it was the same that's
awesome no more questions
right so
I'll show you just the speed of doing
this versus this just Crouch that
performance dubbed and well you have a
starting time for the framework itself
right once you did the test themselves
take like six two three two milliseconds
half a second right it's nothing it's
nothing it's very fast and your business
domain is filled with those when I tell
you when I tell you the this one here I
have lived that in your life this one
here where a totality threshold but you
have those all the time you're filled
with properties when you when ne you
have properties at the inlet level you
have properties that integration level
have property in two and two level this
is system itself has properties you'll
deliver itself has properties there is
no kind of testing that you cannot do
orthogonal II a little small of it for
being a property based testing and you
are currently losing out or not to
entered if I have just small minutes
before I finish I would like to tell you
to try out folders to first is like
random testing about the other side of
the same thing in property based testing
you try you try random things to test
something you're sure off at fuzzers you
try random things for things you don't
know nothing about and the to complement
each other very well should I take a
look at it thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
