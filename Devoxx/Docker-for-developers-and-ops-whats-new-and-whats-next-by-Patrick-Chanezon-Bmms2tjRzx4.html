for coming we're going to talk about
what's new and what's next in docker and
Dhaka Kahn was a month ago so we we made
a lot of announcements who here was at
Dhaka Con this year okay not not very
many so that's very good I I'm going to
do a kind of recap of all the stuff that
we announced they're talking about
what's new for developers for operations
and talking a little bit about the open
source projects you might wonder why why
the title the Tao of docker
the reason is a darker starts to be many
things for many people and recently I
went to give a talk in China at the
Alibaba conference and I've been reading
a lot of books about Taoism recently and
I found some concepts in Taoism that
explained really well what docker is
about so a little bit about myself I'm a
Java geek I used to I worked at lots of
different companies 10 years building
platforms at Netscape a while on Sun and
then 10 years doing a developer
relations at Google VMware Microsoft and
then I've been at for a docker for two
years and a half I'm French but I'm from
California and what's relevant there is
the at Google I was part of the team who
created the developer relations for
cloud then at VMware it was about cloud
foundry platform as-a-service open
source with spring as well and then at
Microsoft it was Java and Linux on Azure
and very quickly I started playing with
docker and then I decided to join a
darker the company so let's talk about
the the Tao of docker so Taoism is a
Chinese philosophy that has lots of
interesting concepts there are two of
them that I think are very relevant to
explaining what docker is about and if
you're not interested in to reading
the daodejing in the text there's this
great comic book version that's a fun to
read and it's a good way to get into it
so the first one is a it's called wuwei
and it's a Chinese concept that means
effortless action so it means action
without action and for what that means
in the darker context is one of the use
cases that we've seen more and more in
especially in our enterprise users is
modernization of traditional
applications using docker so what they
do is that they take all the
applications either in Java or.net who
were sitting on VMs sometimes people
don't even have the source code anymore
and what they do is that they use some
tools to draw her eyes them so put them
in a container put that container into a
registry and then start once it's in a
registry you can start to apply C ICD
and deploy that to a darker platform or
to a container platform and then you can
start to modernize your application so
we see lots of customers doing that and
that corresponds really well to that way
concept the other concept that's
interesting in Taoism is they call that
Geron I'm not sure I pronounce it well
or naturalness which means following the
way the way of the world instead of
fighting against it and you might wonder
what does it mean in computer science
following the way of the world what that
means is were in an era where the
mainstream architecture for server-side
application is horizontal scalability
and the natural way of doing that is
with what is called micro service
architectures with bounded context
container based stateless applications
and no coupling between a different
components so that's what is called the
cloud native architecture model and
docker is a very good platform for that
too
the reason I'm using Taoism as a
metaphor is that the way we've seen dock
used by customers enterprises and
developers devs and Ops is both to
modernize traditional applications
without coding as well as to create
micro service applications using the
container native way an additional
reading for those who are into
philosophy that this French philosopher
called Francois Julian he's inspired or
he's a specialist of Chinese thinking
and he wrote two books one of them is
translated in English it's called silent
transformations and it's about the the
gradual process to transform things and
and I think it applies really well to
both enterprise transformations as well
as transformation of IT systems in the
enterprise and the latest one is only in
French this one is called a second life
and it's pretty applicable to our giving
a second life to your apps by
modernizing them so let's talk about
trends the kind of trend that brought
docker to adoption first the first one
was agile so agile started with XP in
1999 today everybody is doing it I think
the best characterization of it that
I've seen is by I doing Cockcroft from
Netflix who's now at AWS he talks about
lowering what he calls the MTB Amish the
mean time between ID and making stuff
happen so agile is really about making
developers more productive and reducing
the risk on applications by having a
business owner in the loop at all times
and having something that builds at all
times so that you don't spend like two
years planning for a system that will be
obsolete when you ship it so minimizing
that time is what agility is about and
docker is a pretty good tool for
developers to do that the second trend
is DevOps so DevOps is more recent it's
in the past five six years it's a
cultural movement it's inspired by agile
methods but brings the UPS team into it
it's about people processes and tools
so not only about tools so docker is one
of the tools that useful in there but
it's also about people and processes and
the kind of practices that are in there
are continuous delivery infrastructure
as code cross silo collaboration working
in small iteration and having that
feedback loop and measurement between
what you put in production and the
development cycle so having that a quick
feedback loop in there but DevOps also
has an economic angle to it which is in
1999 you were looking at how many
seaside means how many machines the
sysadmin would manage in the windows
world where it was much less automated
and more clicking clicking it was five
in the Linux world it was 50 nowadays in
large-scale
organization that have completely
automated things like Microsoft or
forager or Google or Facebook once this
admin manages between 10 to 20,000
machines and I expect this trend is
going to start showing in the enterprise
and that that has a real economic impact
on the size of the teams the factor is
2,000 there there's a there's people and
process aspects there that's very
important it's not only about adopting
tools there's also you need to change
your organization and the way your your
IT teams are working together and
Hancock from ING gave a very good talk
at Dhaka Khan Europe in 2015
talking about the people and process
aspect how they reorganize their all IT
department asking everybody to become
developers asking people who work on
infrastructure to do infrastructure as
code and to check that code into the
source code repository so that talk is
really interesting it talks more about
the soft aspect that are very important
to achieve transformation to adopt
DevOps
so let's talk first about modernization
of traditional apps so what we build as
a docker is a platform that lets
developers build on their local machine
either traditional apps micro services
offer
party and then the the the result goes
to a CI CD pipeline there it can be
signed and then this darker trusted
registry which has a lot of enterprise
features role based access control
customizable pipeline for going to
production and then universal control
plane all that is part of docker
Enterprise Edition Universal control
plane that lets you manage your your
containers either on-premise on bare
metal of virtualization or in any cloud
provider so that's what we are building
our customers their priorities are
portability so that's one of the top
priority for enterprise IT and we've
seen that that move of enterprises to
the cloud I remember I started talking
about like cloud platforms at Google
maybe in 2008 2009 when we released
Google App Engine I remember going to
talk to potential corporate customers at
that time and they told me no way we're
going to put all your all our code and
data and applications in your platform
because there's no way we can run it on
tram or in another cloud so possibility
now so we are we're eight years later
now today most enterprises have a cloud
strategy and they are planning to use
potentially several cloud providers so
they want multi cloud and they also want
hybrid which means that they are there
are some workloads that they're going to
run on premise and so they want a layer
that gives them that possibility for
their applications and data the second
priority is agility so lots of
enterprises have adopted the agile model
but still not to the maximum and there's
lots of work to be done there and and
now that software is embedded into more
and more aspects of any kind of
businesses like the productivity of
software developers is becoming very
important for many type of enterprises
and the last one is security I'm sure
all of you have heard about the a quick
facts debacle in the u.s. a few months
ago there was one at Target a few years
ago security issues for critical data
for enterprises can make or break a CEO
and so security is one of the top of
mind aspect that CEO CIOs have in mind
and then the last aspect is the
innovation the innovation challenge so
in in typical IT departments 80% of the
of the budget is taken by maintenance of
existing applications and you can see a
list of the market share for different
operating systems going back to Windows
Server 2003 so anybody has any workloads
running on Windows Server 2003 here yeah
a few 2008 maybe ok not that many so so
there are lots of old applications
running on all infrastructures in
companies and most IT departments spend
80 percent of their budget on that and
they only have 20% on innovation and the
business side of companies is asking
them to start innovating more so how do
you liberate some margins to innovate so
that's where the modernization of
traditional application move comes from
many companies are starting to take
their old applications and modernizing
them and the savings that they get out
of that they use that to do innovation
and so we created a program a darker
called the modernized traditional
application program it's a program that
mixes a consulting partner with docker
Enterprise Edition so we provide a
license for free for I think for one
month consulting partners they provide a
free consulting for a month and then
there is a partner for infrastructure
that provides free infrastructure for a
month and the consultants come at the
company for five days on premise they
migrate the workloads and they
containerize them then they deploy that
on Dockery on that
modern infrastructure and then they
measure and the hope is that the
measurement of savings will will entice
companies to just continue doing that
doing more of that so we have a lot of
partners in that program microsoft azure
is one of our infrastructure partner and
a vinod for consulting we have Cisco and
HPE on the infrastructure side and
Accenture on the consulting side so the
kind of impact that we saw is that
basically the these MTA program because
containers are much more dense allows
you to pack more workloads onto the same
hardware even when you are using
virtualization it reduces cost by 50%
and so usually after one of these
proof-of-concept people just start doing
more of that and so the way it works we
take existing applications we have some
tools that our consultants are using so
we had a demo at Dhaka Khan of the of
this tool the docker application
converter that can take either an
archive of your application or a VM
image either a VHD or our VMware image
and then it converts that application
into a container that we can then push
to a registry and then you can deploy
that to a darker Enterprise Edition and
you can set that up into a CI CD and
then you can start to modernize and
break the monolith into different
services or not break it but add micro
services to add value to the application
so that's the big difference with other
approaches that the other approaches
that force you to recode all your
application in cloud native typically
there's a lot of time and effort between
before you see any value and then one
day when you have finally refactor all
your application into micro services you
can finally deploy it and you get the
value the docker
MTA movie is much more gradual and that
you can get the value right away
and then as you start breaking the
monolith and adding more microservices
to it you'll add more business value to
existing applications
so at docker con we had one customer
finish rail who presented how they did
their move with a cost savings of 50%
we had MetLife who saved like 70% on
their VMs and I think they migrated 590
applications and one of the big
announcement was that we have a new
partner both for infrastructure and
consulting in that MPA program it's IBM
so we're going to so we had a
collaboration with IBM for many years a
lot in the open source and in bringing
darker to P&amp;amp;G architectures but they are
also contributing to CI and to container
G and lots of other projects and now
what we announce you that there will be
a version of docker Enterprise Edition
running on mainframe no so not on men
from each running on mainframe or
running on IBM cloud and and the IBM
Global Services is going to do MTA proof
of concepts for customers so docker had
lots of adoption by enterprises they are
doing all sorts of things with it but
the two main use cases are MTA or cloud
native applications so now let's talk
about the platform itself so docker as a
platform for cloud native applications
if you look at the platform itself it's
really a layer that sits on top of your
infrastructure and under your
applications that provide a single API
for developers and operators that
doesn't change so your infrastructure
may change there may be some new cloud
providers new type of resources like
GPUs or maybe new type of devices that
appear darker tries to run on each of
them and will adapt to them and offer
you the same level of api's for you to
build your applications also when there
is new type of applications that are
that are created they should be able to
run on the same platform so the
principles of the darker platform our
independence
that's what I was talking about about
portability so it should be independent
from the infrastructure and from the
application openness so docker should
adapt your existing environment they are
version of docker Enterprise Edition
that are running on either cloud
providers directly or different Linux
distributions it should be able to run
on Raspberry Pi on different things and
it should adapt to the existing system
that you have for logging monitoring on
all that we have a system of API for
that and then the last principle what
made our very successful is simplicity
containers existence is since many years
but they were really hard to use and
docker made them very popular by
providing a simple API to for everybody
to be able to use them so let's take a
look inside of the inside of the
platform at the bottom layer we have the
container runtime so a docker
it's called container G so container G
is a project that evolved with time that
contains the container runtime of docker
that is responsible for creating
containers and managing images so that's
a project that we donated to CN CF and
it's a nearing a 100 right now I think
it's in 100 beta right now on top of
that you have an orchestration layer so
a docker were using a project called
swarm that provides us orchestration
with lots of different features
especially in the area of security like
mutual TLS for every node in the cluster
and secure secrets management and lots
of other features and it allows us to
iterate very quickly and then we have
darker community edition on top of that
so that's the developer tools tools that
developers are using to build and test
their applications so this is where you
find out push and pull docker build
docker run and things like that and then
on top of that were for-profit company
so we build our current reprise Edition
that is targeted towards operators in
the
surprise and this is a set of management
services that you used to put darker
workloads in production so we use a very
well-defined process for improving the
platform and for that we leverage the
the strongest form of energy in the IT
industry which is a constructive user
feedback so we get lots of feedback from
all our users about darker this doesn't
work this should work this way and all
that we improve the platform based on
that feedback and then we repeat that
for ever and when we do that we hear
about patterns that emerge and one
pattern that emerged over the last year
is about orchestration and one of the
and that pattern was that not everybody
uses swarm so there are lots of users
who are using other orchestrators
kubernetes for example is very popular
and and it puts enterprises who choose a
darker Enterprise for example in a
difficult position where they have to
choose whether to use the full the full
aspect of docker platform the full
benefits of it or choose their favorite
Orchestrator so the big announcement we
made a docker con is that we added
kubernetes as an orchestration option in
docker so now the platform looks
something like that this docker
Enterprise Edition at the top which is
the best Enterprise continuous security
and management layer then docker
Community Edition this is the the tool
that all developers are using to develop
container based app and then there's a
kubernetes and swarm in it and so
there's native kubernetes integration
which means that any of the tools in the
kubernetes ecosystem work with darker
now and it's all relying on continuity
and then between kubernetes and
container DS as this open source project
called CRI continuity which is the
implementation of the container runtime
interface that kubernetes the kubernetes
project defined last year in terms of
container G instead of Locker and so
docker con we had
Brenden burns one of the founder of the
kubernetes project on stage and one of
the one of the aspect that was very
clear to the docker team is that the
kubernetes community and the daka
community are very close were one big
community and brandon told the story
about how he had the idea for kubernetes
coming back from the first docker meetup
in Seattle so they did this this pretty
fund selfie with Brandon and Tim from
Google at Dhaka Khan last month okay so
what does it mean for developers so when
you're a developer and you're using
docker for Mac or Dhaka for Windows if
you're developing an application like a
multi-service application you're using
docker compose when you want when you
know that you're going to deploy it on
swarm when you're testing it on your
local machine you can do a darker stack
deploy and you can test locally on swarm
because docker
bring docker has built in swarm and you
can do a docker swarm in it and you have
a swarm of one running on your Mac or
Windows and then you can deploy to
production to swarm when you were
developing that application for
kubernetes it was more complicated you
needed to first install kubernetes on
your local machine there are lots of
open source project to do that but it's
not fully integrated taking compose
files and deploying them to kubernetes
there are some tools to do that but you
need to assemble several tools for that
and it's not very convenient
now with kubernetes as part of docker
sadaqa Community Edition for Mac and
Windows
we'll get kubernetes inside so when you
install it it will just be there we
install coop cut all the the kubernetes
command-line client as well it's all
configured and you can stop developing
with that and I'm just going to and you
can try both with swarm all with
kubernetes it's a choice that you make
I'm just going to show you how it works
so let me see so here
let me make that bigger yes so here I
have I have an application with a docker
compose file so it's an application that
my friend David Gazoo did and it's a
simple application that generates some
fun words and the characteristics of it
is the more you scale it the more funny
the sentences it creates are so it's
composed of a front-end web service
that's called web that's that's an
engine X then there's a back end with a
dispatcher that's a go program that is
dispatching it to a back-end and the
back ends are words so there are Java
programs it's a program in Java we have
five replicas in there for them and then
the the database is a MongoDB in there
and there are some configuration options
in there so the way I'm doing that with
my regular doctor workflow is that I'm
going to do a docker compose build and
so docker compose build is just going to
build all the images on the local docker
daemon that I'm using now that I've
built my service I can do a darker stack
deploy I'm going to call it demo and I'm
going to pass it the compose file and
this is going to create my stack it's
going to create all the different
services and create five replicas for
the for the word service and then I'll
be able to so the word service has at
least one container running now the back
end is up MongoDB is up and when I'm
done I can start testing my application
in there if I go to localhost boom so
this is my application and it's running
and you can see the back ends that
provides some words and here you can see
the IP address of each of the backends
so these are the the words the five
back-end services so my application is
working let's take a look at the logs so
I do a darker stack logs on the on that
stack and I can see the logs of all the
different services color-coded by
service so it seems every everything's
going well there and there I can do a
darker stack yes of demo to see the
different whoops yes and here I'm seeing
all my services that are running and all
that so that's my usual darker workflow
to test an application with docker
compose and docker stag deployed what I
so what what I didn't what I didn't tell
you though is actually what I was doing
there it's actually running on top of
kubernetes I was not targeting docker I
was targeting kubernetes so what our
team has done is that it has extended
the kubernetes api to create the stack
object and if you're using an
environment variable to say i want to
deploy my app to kubernetes when i do a
darker stack deploy it's actually going
to talk to the kubernetes api we created
that that crg in the kubernetes api that
implements the stack object and then
that CRD is just creating some
kubernetes deployment so kubernetes pods
load balancer services etc so if I do a
coop Couture get node you can see here
that I have a local kubernetes cluster
that's coming with docker for Mac so I'm
running a special version here that's
not available yet it's version 1709
kubernetes experimental so that's built
from
a few weeks ago and it comes with a
kubernetes cluster all set up for you
running inside and so when I do a coop
Carol get all there you can see that my
words application actually has been
converted to deployments there for back
front Mongo onwards and that there are
some some pods that are running in there
and then some services for each of them
so that's that concludes the demo
basically today when you're when you're
developing an application that is
targeted at kubernetes in production you
can you can test it in kubernetes on
your Mac or Windows so that's for
developers now talking about apps docker
Enterprise Edition will also have
kubernetes included and that means it's
it's a hundred percent interoperability
with all the kubernetes ecosystems so
it's kubernetes one or eight coming
straight from upstream then the
kubernetes that comes with it
will benefit from all the features that
docker Enterprise Edition has like for
example the secure cluster lifecycle
like the fact that by default when you
provision docker Enterprise Edition with
swarm it's very easy to set up a highly
available swarm with three or five
masters so these masters will also be
kubernetes masters and the cryptographic
node identity that were using to provide
a mutual TLS between the different
services it's also available to the
kubernetes masters the secure supply
chain features that we have in docker
Enterprise Edition the fact that we have
a docker content trust in docker trusted
registry the security scanning systems
that we have all the image promotion
pipeline that you can set up it works
both with swarm and kubernetes the
secure multi-tenancy all the
base access control LDAP integration the
node segmentation that works with both
and the management dashboard exposes
both both suam and kubernetes object and
you can watch the demo of the day 1
keynote we had a 10 minute demo of all
the features of docker Enterprise
Edition with the kubernetes features
there's the swarm objects the kubernetes
object and then some shared objects that
work in both and then all this is
supported and certified on Windows
Server and all major Linux distributions
so docker is now powered by swarm and
kubernetes that was kind of the big news
at a dock icon now I'd like to talk a
little bit about the open source project
so the darker innovation model is really
based on open source so we start with a
set of components in the mobi projects
that that's a project that we introduced
back in Austin in April at Dhaka con
Austin
so mobi project has been very successful
over the past few month and the mobi
projects contained the mobi slash mobi
project which is the upstream for docker
but also all the different component
projects that we then assemble into the
community edition for developers and
docker Enterprise Edition for enterprise
there's like 9000 contributors to all
these projects and 8,000 POS / year it's
a very active set of projects the
different components are the things that
were using to assemble darker so
container D is the container runtime
Linux ket is the the kid that allows you
to create Linux distributions that are
based on containers that were using in
our Edition that we are using on docker
for Mac and docker for Windows infrakit
is a toolkit for declarative
infrastructure that were using in some
of our editions swamp kit is the base of
our restoration engine run see the open
container initiative project it's the
reference implementation of the OC ice
pack and it's used by continuity to
create to create containers
notary so two of these projects notary
and container D we donated them to the
cloud native foundation and there are a
lot of others in there so lots of people
were surprised by the fact that docker
was adopting kubernetes if you're
actually following our open-source
projects
you shouldn't be surprised because we've
been working on that in the open for a
year so it started back in November
where we had a meeting at coop con with
kubernetes maintainer and they gave us
the specification for what would be an
ideal runtime for kubernetes once they
had defined the GRI interface and these
requirements were really what drove the
continuity one-oh effort and that that
is in 101 o beta right now so then we
had a continuity contributed to CN CF in
March in April we did some demo of Linux
kit plus kubernetes at dock icon and
kubernetes and CRI continuity at the
mobi summit in September at the open
source conference in Los Angeles we did
Lib network and CNI demo so what this is
is a docker has its own model called CNM
for networking and then you can write
some CNM drivers that will allow your
networking system to be plugged into
docker
what we did there is that we implemented
a layer that provides a CNI interface so
that's the networking interface that
kubernetes requires for live network
drivers so that means that all the
needed live network drivers become
compatible with kubernetes then we
submitted notary to CN CF in October and
and then last month we showed the beta
of docker with kubernetes support what I
just demoed so what happens when the two
largest open source container projects
collaborate between mobile the mobi
project and kubernetes there will be a
lot of fun projects and lots of
innovation in the in the next year I
expect
and there's a whole community behind it
lots of developers from many different
companies have participating into into
that so a few important ones so Brandon
who created kubernetes Tim Hawkin
he's an alum tell you there are teams at
Google worked with us on CRI continuity
CRI continuity is the sierra
implementation using continuity instead
of docker it's in alpha release right
now for kubernetes 1.8 i think they're
shooting for a beta in the next three
months and then I don't know when the GA
will be continuity itself there's a PR
in darker so that it will be container
d1o will replace the runtime in inductor
itself I don't know if it's been merged
yet and then there's a Ilya who's been
working with us on the Linux kit
kubernetes integration justin on linux
kit so there are lots of developers who
participated in that one another big
change that happened in the mobi project
is we still had our governance for the
project had what is called a BD FL a
benevolent dictator for life so that's a
title that a fun title that was created
for guido van rossum for the Python
project and essentially it means that
all the conflicts would be escalated to
Solomon who would have the final say and
we moved out from that model to move
towards a technical steering committee
that will be elected by the different
projects so that move is happening right
now I think the elections are held right
now for that ESC and then we had a
mobile summit in Copenhagen so three
weeks ago and that was super successful
we were we were expecting like we had a
room for 420 people and we had 600
people registering we need to make it
bigger the next time there's been lots
of content about all these different
projects during the mobile summit we
have a blog for Moby
blood that mobi project.org if you're
interested in the different components
we're going to post a recap of all the
talks at mobi summit and they've all
been recorded so you have the slides and
the recording in there some of the
highlights for me is it covered all the
aspects of container systems from the
classic compute networking and storage
to like new kind of usages there were
three talks about about surveillance
frameworks so one by the Oracle team
with FN one by Alex Ellis with open
fasts and one by Phyllis tests from IBM
about open wisk so all these frameworks
typically run on top of either docker or
kubernetes or both there were talks also
about a new component that's called
belkaid that's very important we're
trying to refactor the way doc you build
is working and it will and bilk it is a
very flexible component that sits in the
middle that's going to use a build the
docker file will be one of the front
ends for it but you can create new ones
for it and also docker images are going
to be one of the targets for it but you
can create different targets so you
could use build kit to build Linux
packages or VM images or whatever you
need or unique kernels another really
interesting one was the one from the
ballina team so ballina is a new project
in the IOT space where what they did
that they took container G and they
changed the the way that image images
are fetched in order to use our sink to
make sure that they don't that they get
only the diffs
of what has changed in one layer of the
image and this is very useful for use
cases when you have very small devices
with not a lot of bandwidth so when we
created the mobi project back in April
the bet was that it were
it would be a good fit for other types
of container systems applied to
different kind of use cases and ballina
to me was kind of the typical example of
that approach working so we start to see
lots of people taking these components
and building their own systems with it
oh another really interesting one was
infrakit so infrakit is our system for
declarative infrastructure management
David who's working on intricate explain
how he's going to so in fact it is all
based on containers and they can run in
your kubernetes cluster or your docker
swamp cluster he's building a horizontal
path autoscaler or infrastructure to
scaler for kubernetes so you could have
your kubernetes cluster when it's
overloaded the infrakit component is
just going to create VMs dynamically and
add new worker nodes to kubernetes and
when the pressure slows down it can
remove these nodes so lots of super
interesting talks at the mobi summit the
last thing I wanted to talk about is we
have another talk by one of my
colleagues Patrick he has a talk this
afternoon at 4:40 where he's going to go
in the details of a container
orchestration explaining when you should
use swarm when you should use kubernetes
and now with our platform like you can
use both but he'll explain like which
one is best for which type of use cases
so what I what I just showed you today
kubernetes integrated in darker it will
be generally available in q1 2018 but
you can sign up for the beta today so
you go to docker comm slash kubernetes
and the the beta should be available in
the next few weeks for both for docker
for mac and windows as well as docker
Enterprise Edition the ga version will
be in q1 2000 2018
so that's it I think I have a little bit
of time for questions any questions okay
I I hate to sit between you and food so
thank you very much for coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
