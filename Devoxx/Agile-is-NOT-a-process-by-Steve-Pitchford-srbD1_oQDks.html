sense
so hello I am Steve Suggs the talk
adjara is not a process so on conscious
of the risk of implicit bias so I'm
hoping to mitigate that with a degree of
transparency it's very much an
experienced opinion talk my reason for
being here my core motivation is really
to help share my experiences of the hope
of getting some experiences from you all
here I'm around for the entire day rocks
all the way through to close up like
Friday
you see me about please come and talk to
me I like to make new friends and really
come forward to hearing from you so I
was given a slide deck in hotel room
last night I thought okay well might be
time I took the slide out of the slide
deck it's my first computer at the Atari
800 XL precursor to the Commodore Amiga
and it's the first computer I programmed
on I thought I can't really delete it
coz also have the realization that I've
actually been coding for about 35 years
this is an early 1980s 8-bit computer
which made me feel very old indeed so
after that a study that asked me
University in Birmingham I'm up early
then went through the whole kombu mat
jungle comm did a little spot of
contracting for a short period of time
before I became a Java programmer meta
logic a few years ago now joined
majestic 12 as a development manager or
even though the starts was managing
myself and in 2016 the came to them
director have now got a team around 15
programmers most of whom are recruited
myself and printed onto majestic so if
you haven't heard of majestic we're
quite specialist firm we map the
internet we crawl the same sort of scale
as Google Yandex Baidu the big web
crawlers we throw away most of the
content we just keep the links what been
out to do is generate one of the world's
largest link maps which shows and from
the information perspective how old web
sites on the web link together and we
sell that over 100 companies ten
languages
largely to search engine optimizers for
other firms now getting on the act the
other motivation for being here and on
the program committee is my involvement
with WM jug I'm the founder we've got a
twitter handle the meetup groups the
best place to get us on if you do find
yourself in Birmingham or diferencia
trip up to berman to speak please let
myself know my co-organizer mark thomas
is also buzzing around a bit if he's in
the room at the moment that he's waving
at the back so feel free to grab either
me or mark if the opportunity to speak
first here so on to the main talk and
the start with an apology and then I'm
going to do a little bit of my agile
journey I like some of the cases where
agile seems problematic and then what
I'm going to do is try to break down the
manifesto introduce organizational
behavior bring together some conclusions
and then hopefully at the time I have
time for both questions and observations
this is a sharing exercise not just a
lecture so the apology and I've always
hated negative similes there's a manager
I think they're one of the most
dangerous useless tools available yet
now I find myself using one I could have
quite easily said agile is not an
elephant could have had a few more
slides describing what agile isn't the
reason that I've gone for this title on
this occasion is because I fear that at
the moment agile is going through a
phase where it's being slapped on just
about everything
next thing you know is going to be added
on to our breakfast cereal so these
agile antipatterns I think do need
identifying and breaking this we
possibly can do as an industry are just
like us all to pull together and fight
the valiant fights on this one so as you
see started an IT professionally in the
late 90s my a jyarei really begun before
the agile manifesto was published
working in SMEs I tend to be a little
chaotic environments
and really in order to start I like to
use this slide I've used it for a few
years now for me the what sort of
represents some kind of opportunity some
sort of feature request that's the sort
of task management things help held
managed owned by the business and for me
in agile the house very much the domain
of the developers the business shouldn't
really interfere with in these more
bounds of course as to how the feature
gets delivered that's the responsibility
of the development team and down through
the middle we have this kind of barrier
that broached in agile context via
communication so soon after it was
released I managed to get my hands on a
copy of Eric Evans seminal work the main
driven design if you haven't read it I
thoroughly recommend it it's on my
favorite textbooks and in this Eric
Evans introduces the concept of a
ubiquitous language and that is a sort
of a Cadbury shared by both the
developers of a site of a system and
also the domain owners of the system
domain experts and for me the evolution
that's described in this book of this
ubiquitous language over time represents
the way nature of the conversations that
bridge this agile boundary facilitating
in many ways of a shared vision I was
also quite lucky in the early days of my
career to get taken around a plant who's
been using the software that I was
working on and this was an incredibly
humbling experience but we managed to
get taken around a very efficient plant
lots of different departments and for
some reason about the blur thought I got
an idea so every department I went to I
found somebody I said well so you're
really the center of the organization
and in every department the eyes lit up
last year somebody who gets it here is
somebody who recognizes how important we
are
and what I've suddenly realized is that
this whole father Ted doodle sketch
about the cows worthless trip onto
YouTube if you haven't seen it
Farber doodle is confused because of
some cows outside that appeared to him
to be the same size of the toy cows in
the room
and I realized that this degree of
cognitive bias is probably debated just
about every organization I've ever been
in whereby people in one team will see
the entire rest of their working
universe from inside their own filter
and I soon became aware that the
development of things like work and also
tended to see these external
participants within the development
process as being both small and far away
about the same time as I was going
through this experience with that Eric
Evans oh there's a pickup in DevOps
obviously not known as such black man
where premillennial we had CBS there
subversion had come out to being
replacing it continuum Hudson back then
build systems were becoming more
sophisticated and it was being phased
out to place by madam and later on after
a long period of horrible instability
get became prevalent distributed build
system so I've had a little degree of
experience of more formal agile as a
developer but it hadn't gone well we
tried to in one of the places that I've
worked at
go for a scrum process and I found
myself in one day in most bizarre
situation of sitting in the circle of
while standing in the circle for the
daily stand-up realizing that nobody
really understood the purpose of this
ritual that we're all just there
chatting about the three questions
rather superficially almost as if we
were waiting for some manner of agile
ferry to fly in and bless our process so
when I became a manager I decided I
swore to myself that I'm not going to do
this I'm not just going to have this
sort of ad hoc stroll into agile scrum
or one of the other systems so obviously
you read up on the idea manifesto and I
thought what we need is a plan so I
thought well what's always worked really
well in the past is when I want to get
from one point to the other point and I
don't know how to do it myself you go
out and get help so we got a consultant
reasonably talented now I was all naive
as a new manager a little bit too cocky
thinking that before I fix the problems
the guys couldn't do now all I've got to
do is take us from A to B with the
health of this consultant will be in the
cache we'll be able to scale our team up
from about five developers infinitely
what I soon realized is that even with
help change is very very difficult
because you start off with a plan a
simple plan a lovely plan you're going
from A to B and it's a nice stroll
through the nice and white background on
the board but it doesn't appear like
that because awesome you have an
unforeseen problem even with health
they're not experts in your business and
you say thing oh not now I've got that
and carry on and lo and behold another
problem and another problem leaving you
with dead ends working back and one of
these things one of things I did quite
early on is that as soon as we got to a
reasonably stable state that was happy
with I got myself a little book just a
little free book from a conference such
as this and then visualized all my
experiences in problems so I could use
it to refer back to and a feeling
monster flick through like welcome to
pop up at the end of it I want to go
through all of it now that'd be a little
bit boring but a couple of those things
that we realized is that whilst it's
great to have multifunctional teams we
can't really lose sight of sometimes the
internal products that we have sometimes
we'll have libraries frameworks that are
produced in-house that they're quite a
bit same degree and respect is
customer-facing projects so just because
there's no direct client customer
relationship doesn't necessarily mean
that there's not important stakeholders
within develop team itself that require
respect the other thing that we realized
is that this easily started realizing
that had internal projects and splitting
the theme down a little bit is that we
had this sort of miss up miss on
misunderstanding of cadence within scrum
we who thought you just had every single
scrum team in the same organization
working perfectly in synchronicity and
soon realize that life isn't like that
so what we did is we just embraced it
and thought hey
team a works that one came team B works
the other cadence will plan the project
in such a way that we'll try to keep
releasing features job stuff back at the
backlog and then just live with the
inevitability that sometimes some people
are going to be late some people are
going to be ill and some projects are
just going to be unforeseeable delayed
so we've had a bumpy ride but a good
right about 4 years ago became confident
enough to start talking about bad all of
this so we think we're doing quite well
at the moment and I started looking
outside of the organization for problems
and started trying to figure out why
we've had some of these issues in the
first place so that we can avoid
replicating them as we business scales
and also where I'm going and doing
things along these lines I can share
some experiences practical help for the
audience one of the things that I think
may have triggered some doubt early is
this whole concept of a manager this
environment is promoted by the likes of
valve and if anyone's read read the
handbook I believe it works well for
them of successful business they're
doing very very well they are American
that's a slightly different employment
regulations laws to European companies
personally I have a doubtful if you can
get a truly accessible diverse workforce
where you don't have a degree of
structure awesomely the boobs is the
policing foot function some kind of
strong HR manager role but I've not seen
their operation close up so I wouldn't
want to condemn it the other
anti-pattern that I've seen quite common
is that for some reason that maybe is
because they both begin with a there's a
misconception that all the sudden
because the go agile there's no rules
anymore no need for roles I heard of one
place where one of my colleagues was
most former college was most most
distressed to find themselves in an
environment where their role as tech are
just being dissolved overnight allowing
relatively junior programmers to make
the decisions that they've been
prevented from doing so very very
quickly that became a huge mess but
fortunately for the organization
themselves they've made a few steps to
be able to revert the process but it was
incredibly costly experience
the other one is this fantastic blog
post by my clay church why agile and
especially scrum a terrible it acts as a
kind of lightning rod for everybody that
hates all things agile and especially
scrum and at first does their thinking
no no no you guys have got it wrong and
it took a few pages and a few pings of
the blog being updated for me to realize
that well maybe no not run maybe these
people are on this website that are
recording these comments hating agile
hating scrum actually have some manner
of point and I started to reflect that
same time I started an MBA and as I went
through the MBA I've started to rub but
there's a variety of our job called
scrum it doesn't seem appropriate it
annoyed me so I started thinking about
the agile manifesto about scrum the
relationships between the agile
methodologies the agile practices and
the underlying agile values now that's
led me to think about breaking agile
down so mention the agile manifesto
earlier this is one of the versions that
people see often I believe it's a breach
of the terms because you meant to go all
the way through to the signatories on
the notice at the bottom the main thing
for me is that the manifesto these are
you know the heavyweights of software
development these are the people that
shaped what most of us do on a daily
life you've got came back who invented
scrum chemstro Burr and Jeff Sutherland
who came up with scrum Martin Fowler who
only needs to seem to put his signature
near a book for it to sell well an
amazing talent Dave Thomas now Dave
Thomas is an interesting guy he's often
listed as one of the original
signatories that's become a critic of
agile he's done a rather charming
conference speak I think it was go
Amsterdam 2015 called agile is dead a
little bit provocative but his main
argument is
that a job is being misapplied is being
used to sell an offer of potentially
inappropriate services and that really
what we should be thinking of themselves
as doing is working with agility also on
this list we have Jim Highsmith he's
worked on adaptive software development
and talks of things such as guiding and
bounds in terms of control mechanisms
and in an agile environment we've got
Ward Cunningham then our how many people
we're walking them here credited with
inventing the wiki but for me more
importantly calling the phrase technical
debt possibly on the most misused
phrases in IT today there is a water
YouTube video where he explains the
initial thoughts behind the phrase
technical debt and I'd encourage you all
to go out the way and have a read of it
or watch of it so for me there's these
two parts three parts really if you flee
the signatories of the agile manifesto
there's this top part here we're in
covering better ways you develop and
software by doing it the health numbers
do it do this work in Tibet Valley and
then there's this second part because
all the bottom sentence does is
reinforce the top one and one of the
commonly used phrases is that over is
one of the most repeated words in the
agile manifesto and what's that saying
is that the things on the right are
still important still very very useful
they're just not quite as useful as the
items on the left so there we have two
elements the agile manifesto so really
what we've got is some kind of look
spectrum
or phrase another way sort of agile
dimensions the thing is what we're
finding when we went through this is
it's awfully tricky to find out where
you are there's not a great deal to
express what proportion of processes and
tools to individual interactions just
that this is more important now as an
older software developer I can remember
when people weren't allowed to fix bugs
because it was against the process
that's becoming less and less of a case
now now Kent back has attempted to
expand this by moving the higher
importance to the left and instead now
introducing team vision discipline over
individuals and interactions over
processes and tools you've got validated
learning over working software over
comprehensive documentation
interestingly as well these new customer
collaboration instead of sorry instead
replacing it with customer discovery and
some of this reflects how the change of
the industry has but now people aren't
just building systems to automate tasks
they're introducing new systems to help
people in new ways they have to go out
and discover their markets there isn't
an existing market which they're trying
to fulfill and the last one is
initiating change rather than waiting to
respond to change to actually in this
shape change in the first place I think
that is quite helpful I think for me it
adds a little bit more structure to it
but the other part is this agile
statement which is quite a strong subtle
statement in terms of how can others do
it uncovering better ways and what
people have come to value the end of the
day this is a group or like say the
heavyweights of software that have come
together it's no great in early 2001 and
they've shared their experiences of XP
of scrum of other agile lightweight
methodologies and they've pulled these
shared experiences these values
they've validated them will be a quite
quickly in peer-review I believe the
original manifest they talked about a
morning's came up and then they've had
sufficient confidence in it to share it
with the whole of the world as an
appropriate way of solving software
development problems so tying things
back to the title of the talk so we've
got processes
that's from what I understand a
transformation of input and output now
pressing the wrong button I'm not sure I
see any sort of transformational terms
of process orientation in any of this
but a procedure what you have then is a
series of steps to count them up for
goal now I must stop doing that there is
no set of steps here person weighted
features statement I see a methodology
Nate system of methods principles for
doing something when I scream next time
you could argue it to a degree when
coupled with the agile principles that
as a kind of pseudo methodology here
person always referred to it's kind of
an umbrella methodology but I think it's
a strong enough statement so this brings
me back to the NBA and the course to
start the first one I did was called
organizational behavior and this is a
cross-disciplinary of area of study
include including soar workplace
psychology and a number of other
disciplines and what they're doing is
that focusing on the behaviors of
individuals and groups within an
organizational setting and in this
field there's a concept called
organizational culture many many books
written about it but my favorite
definition is by Edgar Schein who says
that the culture of the group can now be
defined as a pattern of shared basic
assumptions learn by group as it solves
its problems of external adaption into
integration which is work well enough to
be considered valid therefore to be
taught to new members is a great way to
perceive think and feel in relation to
these problems so going back to the
summary of this agile statement there's
a number of similarities between the
shared experiences that are sharing that
they validated amongst themselves that
they believe the right way to go about
writing software and this definition of
organizational culture by shine I should
say at this point it's a slightly
controversial comment I think Uncle Bob
doesn't like the separation of practice
from culture but I think there's still a
useful base here that there's a concept
that if you have a culture that is
incompatible with the change that you're
placing upon it it will actually reject
it so that they're four wide argues that
need to recognize what the current
organizational culture is in order to
achieve any hope to make a successful
change from an existing perhaps a
waterfall organization into one that
will accept an agile methodology Edgar
Schein is not the only expert there are
many in organizational culture and
organizational behavior one of the
thought leaders is good Hofstetter
who started off studying cultural
differences national international
cultural differences so for example
Hofstetter x' work tell you that the UK
has a higher focus of individualism but
increased shorter determinism when
compared to germany for example so a
little bit stereotypical but still quite
helpful when you're dealing with
multicultural situations to have a
understanding and appreciation of the
different implicit biases the different
perspectives that different nations
have Hostetler went on from that work to
in 200 zuv businesses 200 businesses
primary around the Netherlands and he
came up with a set of cultural
dimensions well-formed reasoned
justified cultural dimensions this is
all available on the web as well as to
his works if you search for Hofstetter
cultural dimensions there's a number of
tools to an eye to examine this and what
we've got is a sort of clearer spectrum
between means orientated companies and
goal orientated companies so a means
orientated company is very much a matter
of being told you are to follow these
several steps in order to achieve your
goal this is what I want you to do a
goal orientated company is what you
achieve that goal however you you want
but this is what we're setting out to
achieve in certainly driven is of a
inward-looking company culture where
people are trying to follow the process
that they've got within their
organization externally driven is one
where they're really open and folks are
trying to serve what the customers think
they need easygoing work discipline hard
to get fired
mistakes are celebrated strict work
discipline if you make a boo-boo go out
the door again open coaches are hard to
get onto that one in a second employ
you're orientated and work orientated to
other ones and what we've got time for
is for me to now hopefully switch to get
off status site
fortunately where I can explore it demo
gods will be kind
whoo so as I said this site has a number
of different tools into which we can now
examine each one so we can then have a
look through there's tutorials
clarifications and we can actually see
that for each of these dimensions
there's not just these two extremes but
a whole set of reasons that justify many
works emasculation all the way through
to D which is the sort of features we
start to think of in an agile
environment entrepreneurial working
smart creative productive trustworthy
new challenges
so I said about the open system so this
is all about welcoming new people about
transparency of communication whereby in
a very open system everybody can work
through the Lumbee value even contribute
on day one in the closed system
outsiders not welcome so I'd encourage
you all to play all that so I went
through this and I tried to sum up my
experiences of a kind of agile workplace
the reason being not just to create
something that's transferable in terms
of trying to define agile in the
cultural sense but when you have an
agile team and you buffing up against
other parts of the business such as
marketing and they have their own
believe there's now a agile manifesto
for marketing that it's important that
there's a degree of this ubiquitous
language we talked about earlier it's
sort of shared expectation as to what
sort of terms mean and what's your
loading of it and what we find is that
or I found is that primaries get
Hofstetter is cultural dimensions to my
experiences working agile will highly
goal goal orientated fairly externally
driven so it's a little bit surprising
you might think that these aren't all
100% totally externally good the reason
is is that if you're totally externally
driven you'll quite happily sacrifice
your clients long-term needs for their
short-term requests as I feel that agile
is all about facilitating a two-way
communication process of helping people
and guiding people from both sides of
the experience and again easy we're
going with disciplined agile isn't about
Anarchy it is about having these
lightweight methodologies such as XP
that do have rules about them they do
have structures they're just try not to
get in the way of software development
so it's not just a matter of adopting
one extreme
saying that there are elements of
easygoing work discipline also elements
of strict laws
I think computing now has got to the
level where whilst not potentially
professionally record they're officially
recognized in terms of doctors and
lawyers and such like we do have a
professional outfit with everyone here
has come to a conference learning the
best way of doing things and also in
terms of employee orientated we're not
employer orientated as agile to the
points of view where people who can't
code or keep making mistakes will be
tolerated forever this is all about
discipline it's about making money so
again there's a compromising these two
last ones are semi autonomous which
means that they depend on the other
factors to a large degree so solid leave
some time for questions and opinions to
conclude at the core of it and this is
not to dispel the practice elements of
agile methodologies I think that from a
company-wide perspective it's helpful to
think of agile as a culture not just a
methodology or process and being a
cultural means that we don't do agile I
wouldn't say that scrum is a type of
agile I would say that we are ajar
there's a quote often misappropriated I
believe to Peter Drucker called culture
eats process for breakfast so in many
ways we could think in fact maybe I
don't deserve its badge on the breakfast
cereal as it eats it for breakfast and
the other thing is that all of these
organizational cultures here the
subtlety of how they're observed these
are living cultures within real
organizations so how can you take a
living culture and sort of freeze it and
take it out of the organization say hey
you're just implementing I don't think
you can instead what we think it's
helpful to think of is the agile
manifesto
the cultural aspect of the agile
manifesto is a template something that
we can strive to implement with our own
organizations but not necessarily
something that's going to be stunt on so
really let's not try to strive to be
agile masters but simply understand the
limitations and the applicability of
this cultural term play to our own
organizations I'll leave the last words
of this talk to Jim Highsmith and the
original signatories in the history
section of the agile manifesto that so
in the final analysis the meteorite
riser interest in sometimes tremendous
criticism of agile methodologies it's
about the mushy stuff of values and
culture with that I thank you
the there will be some agile resources
up there like Monday I promise
and with that any questions or
observations
why would I advise a company not to use
agile at all so my background is
obviously SME software development so
from a software development perspective
or just a wider context and wider
context I've worked in Iceland for
example the frozen food people not the
company and when I was stacking the
shelves and going in the big freezer at
minus 20 I'm just thinking that maybe
you know that is one sort of area where
this sort of sense of empowerment and
gold drift and responsibility may not be
that useful in terms of a software
development context I'm getting outside
the sort of skill area and for me most
web shops now do seem to be tending
towards the agile towards the agile
methodologies XP scrub and whatnot so
maybe somebody else has got a better
perspective on that for me and I think
you've done a gyro fight or something
along those lines where there is an
awful lot of upfront design over a set
of fixed criteria and I certainly
wouldn't be wanting to change any of the
processes cultures methodologies or
anything well no signs that they've
already got nothing else or gonna break
early and get to the pub so I think it's
pub for the clock thank you for time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
