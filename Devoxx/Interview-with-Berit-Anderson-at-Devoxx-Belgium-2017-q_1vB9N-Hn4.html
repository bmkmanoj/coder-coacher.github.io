talking to Barry Anderson who's giving a
keynote tomorrow about weaponized
weaponized
AI surprisingly difficult thing to say
apparently and so we've seen a really
interesting trend it's interesting in in
a terrible terrible way with propaganda
on the internet and elections recently
how does that tie in with your talk yeah
so I first started researching the
technological underpinnings of
computational propaganda after the u.s.
election last year and it's really so my
talk were tomorrow will be all about
that but but also about some of the
importance of understanding the
political and economic machines that are
really driving the future of technology
and the internet because as as
developers and technical talent it's you
don't often get to see that bigger scale
picture or think about the bigger scale
picture as much but it's so important to
understand how the tools that you're how
the tools that you're building will fit
into that to that picture and also what
future implications they might have
right so Facebook for example started in
a college dorm room as a tool originally
and kind of like a hot or not tool right
and and look where it is today because
because of the incentives of the economy
in which it was built its really become
this advertising focused business model
and their drive to increase and and
increase revenue and and to optimize
revenue has really put them in the
position that they are today where you
know they're actually incentivized not
to remove specific users because it
actually adds to their monthly active
user number it adds what they can sell
advertising and so that kind of cross of
incentives where the customers are
actually not the users the customers are
the advertisers and yet the customers
are the ones whose data is being sold
right
it creates just you know a lot of a lot
of you know mixed mixed incentives
generally and it can have some really
really negative outcomes so when we are
using tools like Facebook and Twitter
what we need to be conscious of is users
then is that we're not in control of
we're not the purpose at the platform
we're not the main focus at the platform
yeah so so so Facebook and Twitter and
Instagram are really the outcome of I
would say is one of the key core
economic drivers of the internet which
is Silicon Valley and so in in their
case right the you've to keep in mind
that the shareholders in Silicon Valley
are investors right so as a CEO of a
company of those companies you actually
have a fiduciary responsibility to
maximize profits for your shareholders
every quarter and what that means is
that for companies themselves you often
take a much shorter term approach to
value for the company rather than
focusing on the long term implications
and so I mean what you've seen in
Silicon Valley is that in the last ten
years they've spent you know all of
their time focusing on building monopoly
business models the bigger the better
and then also essentially building in
digital addiction so they're making
their products as attractive as possible
and as as what we're sorry what is the
right word for this they're essentially
building products where you feel really
good using them so every time you get a
like on Instagram or like on Facebook
it's like a little serotonin squirt in
your brain goes off and that's been a
very deliberate deliberate approach to
making products more and more and more
addictive so that users come back over
and over and over again because that
allows them to sell more and more
advertising they can be more effective
as far as targeting users and then and
so that's kind of one one core of that
the other core economic driver of the
internet and technology generally is
China and China is interesting because
they take a very different approach so
whereas companies in Silicon Valley
there's the investors or the stock
owners
actually really the shareholders in
China the shareholders our national
interest so the Chinese Communist Party
and what that means is that they've
taken this very deliberate approach to
their not maximizing profit they're
actually maximizing China's eventual
national stature in San and standing in
the world and ability to compete on an
on a national and global level and so
you've seen a couple of different
approaches to that but a lot of their a
lot of their companies and platforms and
China are really dedicated and focused
on surveillance so watching over the
Chinese people and making sure that they
can control them they can kind of like a
pan Opticon type scenario where they
have the system called sesame credit
right and sesame credit is a credit
rating system but it's based on your
your social profiles your private chats
and conversations what you purchase
online and all of those are you know all
of that information comes together to
inform both your credit score and your
ability to travel within the country so
like domestically or internationally and
what that means is that people are self
censoring right because for example it's
a system that right now is voluntary but
it will be mandatory by 2020 there was a
there was a fellow recently in China who
had been in his private WeChat messages
had been talking referred to President
Xi Jinping as steamed bungee he was put
in jail for I believe it was two years
just as a result of that and his lawyer
was disbarred just for representing him
so you can see that like that very
different approach to because there is
this focus on global domination for lack
of a better word or owning the future of
the internet and owning the future of
technology and has a much different and
I would say much more chilling effect on
the product itself so this is very
interesting because we're talking about
two different outcomes of the
digitalization of the self so one of
them is very economic in the Silicon
Valley and the other one has terrifying
social consequences
economic crisis so what's our
responsibility is developers in all of
this so I think the most important thing
is really focusing on just just having
an awareness of like what are the ways
in which international political order
is moving and changing and the developer
community generally is known you know
for being a little bit less socially a
little more socially awkward so to speak
right and I think a lot of people become
developers because they they don't
really like interacting with other
people that much I'm I'm an introvert
personally so I totally understand that
but we have come to a time in in the
world where globally speaking political
alliances are changing extremely quickly
your company it could be you know you
could be building something right now
where a Chinese backed firm has invested
in your company and in five to ten years
it could be owned by the Chinese
government in fact or they could be you
know trying to kind of infiltrate and
steal your IP so that they can undercut
your company and sell a cheaper version
of that and so I think it's just it's
super important to understand like what
are the economic drivers that will
affect the product that you're building
particularly in the consumer industry
but also in in the in the b2b space so
we need to have an awareness of our
responsibilities as individuals and the
wider the wider system yeah and then
actually it's it's you know so I think a
lot of people are kind of hesitant to
stand up for what they see as broader
strategic goals of their company it's
kind of scary right it's like what if I
lose my job what if I'm seen as just
being a problem Twitter interesting
story about Twitter so they had it just
came out in the news two days ago right
so they've been under a ton of scrutiny
from Congress in the United States based
on their lack of just just general lack
of taking I think the computation
propaganda problem seriously so there
was an allegation from the head of an
editor at RT with the Russian news site
Russian propaganda
that Twitter actually pitched them on
spending a lot of money on the US
election for ads right so that's
interesting it has not been confirmed by
Twitter but it's a now it's an
allegation but what did surface just
yesterday was that this whole problem of
fake accounts and BOTS operating fake
accounts to sway political opinion
within within you know which has
happened in the u.s. particularly and
it's under a lot of scrutiny right now
but it's also happening all across
Europe
so the strategy generally is to it like
look at different cultural rifts and
then use use these BOTS of propaganda
accounts to separate and drive wedges in
between groups of people and create more
kind of cultural friction within
countries and particularly countries
that have been exemplars of Western
democracy so and in Twitter's case they
actually had one employee who you know
raised the alarm about this happening
kind of early on he was only black
engineer on their team and he was
actually fired in a subsequent round of
firing so so it's he was not fired I
should say he was not fired because of
that as far as I know but I think um
spam companies have like have generally
kind of ignored some of this stuff and I
think we're coming to a time we're gonna
see them start to stand up and take more
notice particularly as these like top
Facebook Google Twitter have come under
much closer scrutiny from a governmental
perspective it's going to become more
and more important for them to really
start doing some of that strategic
foresight work themselves and to start
thinking about how will this platform be
used for good or for bad and how can we
do the work ahead of time and listen to
our team and our our developers
especially to anticipate that and and to
make necessary moves to avoid that in
the future thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
