really pleased to be joined by
Christophe from Thomson Christophe
thanks very much for coming along and
joining us today thank you for
invitation so you you had a keynote this
morning I know you had a session
yesterday Dennis I've seen some of your
sessions from this conference and others
as well
always crowd pleasers because what
you're talking about is incredibly
interesting as well so you're talking
about autonomous vehicles drones etc
tell us a little bit more about maybe
one of your sessions today or yesterday
okay so we are enthusiasts of artificial
intelligence mostly and about the fact
that you can actually automate most of
the devices using artificial
intelligence and some probabilistic
robotics theories so that actually human
only needs to show the intention and the
machine will continue obviously this is
a step maybe towards the general
intelligence but at the moment we are
focusing on this small simple tasks that
still can be managed by just artificial
intelligence and that's we what we focus
on our our talks so there's a lot of
challenges towards getting this right
and there's always gonna be some
stumbling blocks when we're talking
about artificial intelligence yeah or
automation as well so what are some of
the challenges you've faced yeah first
of all in its current state deep
learning is a wonderful technology but
it learns relatively slowly the
network's not relatively slowly so
especially in this trial and error mode
we have to wait for a long time for for
the results to actually come up because
usually big networks need to be trained
from two days to maybe weeks depending
on what architecture infrastructure we
have obviously so this is this is one of
probably things that
are maybe a bit problematic but what is
even more is both for drones and
autonomous cars is how we will legally
make them available which is a totally
different topic and this is probably the
society I think it's not ready for that
and this is what we will need to discuss
because technology we will get to its
own yeah absolutely you can't help if
you read the media to get divisive
opposing sides of this where some some
people are incredibly enthusiastic about
autonomous cars and drones and others
are a bit more wary and I think one of
the things that makes people worry is a
worry from a societal level what's going
to happen - for instance jobs sure I
think this is not a place to be worried
the jobs will change but they will not
disappear for sure and I think they will
be much better jobs if the machines will
take over the low-level stuff and we
will be more open to focus on high-level
stuff it will just be a shift there were
a lot of other shifts in the history and
they changed a lot but I think four plus
so I would never worry about this I
think there will always be something for
us unless there is this apocalyptic
scenario of robots taking over the world
which I think we are very far away I
think we're a long way from yes so I
mean I was talking to a taxi driver a
few days ago about autonomous vehicles
and how that's going to impact society
going forward so for instance people who
spend their lives in cars have got
company cars and they're always driving
imagine how much work they're going to
get done by being able to sit there and
be transported from one place to another
and that's not lost productivity time
anymore they actually be able to work so
there's always plusses and pros and cons
in and yeah but if you well the biggest
advantage also most vehicles probably if
you look at it that way is
if you look now at the streets you see
most of the cars in a traffic with one
person inside and then what is even
worse
you see 10% of cars driving and 90% of
cars standing and probably if you have a
car probably you are using it 5% of your
time and imagine that now every car will
be used hundred percent of time because
for five percent when you need it it
will serve you and then for the ninety
five percent that you don't need it
someone else will use a somebody else
there will be much less traffic because
there will be automatic way of schedule
traveling routes and so on so we will
this is a win-win as we can move away
from ownership of vehicles absolutely
vehicles will be a service on your
mobile phone
have you seen car manufacturers for
instance changing design to cope with a
future that's gonna see more car sharing
carpooling as they as we call it in the
u.s. absolutely everybody's thinking
about this I cannot share too much
details but generally every company is
expecting that some of the companies
want to go straight for the so-called
level 5 autonomy so that the car can go
from wherever to wherever but some of
them more realistically target the
nearest future like only going for the
highways for example for the long routes
but generally everybody is expecting
that and is trying to prepare for this
moment so when when we look towards a
future where autonomous vehicles are the
norm as opposed to the exception mm-hmm
have you seen any projections as to what
that's going to do to the number of
vehicles that are actually on the roads
nowadays that's what I already told yes
it will be so much smaller the number
because percentage figures to be honest
I cannot be any precise only my
intuition and I would say it's like 10
percent 10 percent of the vehicles that
currently exist would be on the road
yes probably more people will start to
use this kind of transport and maybe it
will get cheaper so that people that are
now not able to afford their car not
even able to afford probable public
transportation they just have a more F
on this just train is too expensive
plane is too expensive now they will be
able to maybe participate in that also
so maybe it will be even a bit more but
still traffic will be much lower it will
be much nicer times definitely and as we
that's gonna have a really good benefit
on the environment moving forward as
well exactly
definitely I mean that's going to happen
as we move away from gas go guzzling
vehicles towards electric and hybrid as
well but then reducing the number of
vehicles actually on the on the ground
is going to have a massive implication
for the for the benefit yeah and because
it's automatic it will be also able to
find out such a route that to not get
the plainest battery so there will be if
automation goes into that we are saved
if I mean yeah after normal human errors
either on the side of the traffic jam
which are which is still quite a lot
machine will not make this kind of
errors this is something we are sure
obviously in the beginning there will be
some problems if there are both
automatic vehicles on the road and
humans that might be a hard transition
time and we can't get away from the fact
that roads are designed in such a way
that they are shared by vehicles but
also bicycles and also pedestrians as
well and so that's going to be one of
the big challenges from a safety
perspective yes but now for for example
if there is Sun blinding you
you might miss a person as a human you
might miss the person on bicycle but if
the car is equipped both of camera plus
lidar plus radars plus whatever else
then
it will probably much have much better
chance of knowing what's going on maybe
it's even some night vision a lot of
other techniques that can be used and
obviously almost everyone is aiming
towards fusion of all the possible
sensors to get the job done right then
you have also below the map to improve
the precision that the confidence of
what your car sees it can much better
plan its route up to centimeter level to
get proper maneuvers so as a human
this is beyond the possibility all of
these stuff so I'm sure we are going in
the right direction
yes one of the other things we don't
talk about that much when it comes to
autonomous vehicles is the difference
between where on those vehicles from
having them driven by through through
artificial intelligence because
different people drive in different ways
and they were good drivers and bad
drivers and if we can nail down a great
way of driving and we we make sure the
machine is doing that then the wear and
tear on the road and also on the
vehicles is going to reduce as well so
that's going to be another positive
impact oh absolutely yes we are in this
nice position where as designers we can
choose the training set on our own as
you said and obviously it's still
unknown there's a lot of options how
driving will be performed is it the
neural network that will be driving and
to end a rather not maybe there will be
small components first component to
understand the road second to detect
moving objects the third network to
plant the best route and the fourth
network to maybe just choose out of all
the options that the best possible so
and maybe in a beginning there will be
just these three networks and the four
will not be a network but but just an
algorithm mathematical algorithm
handcrafted it is not perfectly sure how
the final solution will look like but
for sure we will use the best training
set and
then the driving experience as a
passenger will be much better so there's
a heap of complexity that we still need
to work out absolutely going forward
what's your prediction on maybe how many
years do you think it's going to be
before we see a majority of vehicles
being on the roads is autonomous that's
an interesting question and to be honest
this is a very smooth transition that we
are going to to look for in fact it
already started because you can already
buy a car that keeps the speed that's
obviously you can already buy a car that
keeps the speed dynamic on your own Lane
the next step is to change your lane and
go over the next car and it will be very
soon on the highway the next step will
be just tell where to go and it's very
soon it's almost there there's already
cars driving test cars of the best
companies are already doing this using
the map by the way which which I do with
my colleagues but then the next step
will be to go into the cities and and
then make the global transportation and
this is probably it's very hard to
predict now but it's still a couple of
years maybe five maybe ten it's hard to
say but the highway automation is very
close I would say it's more or less two
years and I think we will have a lot of
cars already - maybe not a lot of people
will be able to buy them in the
beginning but they will be available I
think yeah so final question do you
think that with the highways that we're
going to move towards almost a two-tier
approach where maybe we'll have
traditional roads that exist right now
and maybe roads that are built almost
like toll roads that are purely reserved
for autonomous vehicles as a first step
just as a trial I don't think so
I think there will be rather the same
transportation network as it is but
maybe there will be like
convenient rules that people will try to
follow that for example but because okay
what I need to mention is probably the
best target now that will give us the
most positive effect as a society would
be to make trucks go autonomously this
is probably something where we need to
focus most because as users well we we
can drive we usually finish our
destination in 8 hours but when it comes
to trucks there is a lot of changes that
needs to be taken it costs a lot you can
save a lot of money as a society when
you can turn these trucks into
autonomous vehicles and then coming back
to a question probably the autonomous
trucks will now be driving on the right
lane and everybody will get used to that
that they cannot go into this lane
because they will be driving like
back-to-front and maybe I don't know
half a meter so because they will be
they will be first of all communicating
with each other so they will know if
something happens and they will get the
speed altogether it will be like like a
train trains without exactly trains
without rails that's that's that's what
might happen and this is where we will
as a society we will gain most and this
is what is going to happen and I think
in the beginning typical passenger cars
will need to adopt that fact that
probably the right train is reserved for
them it will not be probably the
regulation but this is my intuition how
it will look like in the first stages
yeah perfect thank you so much for
joining us thank you very much thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
