name's mark hazel I'm one of the
organizers and I'm joined by Holly
coming through our program lead for this
year then it just welcome you and tell
you a few things to get you going
I haven't been told that there were any
fire alarm drills so if you hear a fire
alarm it's probably real so that's the
health and safety bit done perfect this
is our fifth year of their works in the
UK we started off a bit smaller than we
are right now and year-on-year we keep
growing and that's testament to their
strengths of the developer community
here in the UK and in London in
particular know there are people from
all over the place so it's not just a
London centric thing and we've got more
content than we've ever had as well
we've jam-packed so much into two days
where these hands-on labs running
alongside conference content as well
there's in total coming through the
doors over there over today and tomorrow
just about 1100 plus people I lost count
and I was really tired when I was trying
to do the final count last night stroke
this morning at about 3 a.m. and there
are people from 36 different countries
put your hands up if you're not from the
UK nice I like that so you brexit didn't
do bad things yet
I said that I wouldn't mention breakfast
or now I just screwed myself I apologize
um when kind of we're going through
things I was looking through all the
data a couple of days ago and every now
and then you see something a bit weird
and it makes you go like now I know
we're a diverse bunch within this sector
but 274 job titles here's some of my
personal favourites
let's have Smurfs I know who he is as
well but he's being shy I know he's
looking at perfect so the moral is if
you ask developers for their job title
especially if you are speakers for their
job title as well I mean that's that's
when it gets really quite interesting
and I just want to say when we set this
conference up originally five years ago
it really was born out of the London
Java community with Martine Verburg and
Ben Evans and Dan hardly care and James
McGivern really leaving the the charge
on it and it's a massive community
effort we start off in around September
planning for a May event I was that stay
tuned because we're normally in June and
then in October Manny
Sarkar who's around somewhere mani
starts he's at the back there waving
mani starts making sure that all of the
speakers that want to speak can actually
submit proposals to us by doing an
amazing effort with our call for papers
application and then a heap of people
get roped in for helping us out and
spending vast numbers of hours and days
and nights working on looking at all the
content that comes in and really working
out what's best and it's not just the
content it's also all of the things that
go on under the surface there are apps
being created there's a huge amount of
effort that goes into this so I just
want to say a big thank you to these
people
some of them unfortunately can't be with
us one of them's got a name too long for
my layout so with Lane Cashman for that
and one of those is Holley coming who
joins me on stage today so this year we
did something a bit different where we
had a program a dedicated program leads
and we really wanted somebody from the
community who knew DevOps but really was
big I think we described it as we needed
a geeks geek to come on board and look
at all the content and really curate the
show much like you would an art
installation because this is our party
this is a it's the content as King and
Holly may be stupidly said yes and came
along and did stuff for us and it means
that from a Content perspective we've
got so much this year I mean we've got
76 conference sessions crammed into
these two days there are lunchtime
quickies you should go along to the
lunchtime cookies I know that you're all
hungry but grab something to eat we're
not going to stop you taking a plate in
or anything like that if you want to
these are short sharp quickfire 15
minute sessions the evening boss they're
always great as well so that's a a
really nice relaxed way that you really
really generate the content all together
so there'll be somebody there leading it
but they really want your input and your
your interaction there are some six
ignites and three people actually agreed
to the blind ignite talks today so if
you get a chance to go to these your
laughs a lot
anything you don't get to see goes onto
YouTube so we record everything except
for the boss and a hands-on labs so
you'll be able to see everything else so
don't feel that you are going to miss
out on anything because you can watch it
back in the office back at home I
believe there's an alcohol TV
application even for our DevOps content
as well so if you're that way inclined
you can do it on your lazy boy or
however you choose to hang out and
there's a hacker garden down in the main
exhibition hall as well where you can
just go along you can hack on projects
4-bit patches etcetera so there's loads
to do
so I'd like to tell you a little bit
about how we choose the contents or the
program because this is one of the
things we get asked most often both by
speakers who were perhaps disappointed
that they didn't get accepted or
speakers who were surprised that they
didn't get accepted or attendees who
look at the program and go why is that
there so in fact it's a really easy
system that we use to accept the content
so let me tell you a bit about the
algorithms that we use if only it were
so actually it's really not easy and my
role on the program committee was half
setting the direction and thinking about
the future trends in our industry and
half herding cats and managing labor
we got 645 proposals this year that
generated so much email I can't even
tell you I wanted to take a screenshot
but I am didn't have time because at one
point in my inbox I had about 500 emails
all unread all from the deadlocks CSP
tool so we just it's such a lot of work
and we take each submission seriously so
we don't just look at the submissions
and go well we want to make sure that we
look at the speaker is this a good
speaker is this speaker who's adding
something and when we choose the
speakers as well
what we really don't want to do is give
you a program full of the same speakers
as you had last year and the same
speakers as you had the year before and
the same speakers that you might you see
other conferences we want to mix of the
rock star speakers they're really
established the speakers just because
he's been around for years and
absolutely know their stuff and maybe
the new speakers that you haven't seen
before and the reason for that is
sometimes those speakers are the ones
who have something that you haven't
heard before they've got a fresh
perspective actually we did a mentoring
program this year as well so two people
who had never spoken at a conference
before could submit and members of our
program committee actually then took
that person under their wing and tried
to get them to a place where the
proposal text and the submission was in
such a state that it was more likely to
be
accepted either by us or by other
conferences because it's a community
thing if it doesn't get accepted by us
but to go somewhere else that's great
that's fine and there's at least one
speaker who came through that program
and continuing the theme of feel sorry
for at me and the rest of the program
committee we have so many meetings we
had so many Google Hangouts we had a lot
of late nights trying to choose the best
program and the principles that were
used really to select the program part
of what we were thinking about was every
session here we want you to be able to
go away and be able to do your job
better as a result of having seen that
session but there's different ways of
taking something back so this is William
Morris as well as being a designer of
Flowery fabrics which many of you
probably know he was most known in his
lifetime as being a poet he was also a
translator and he was also a social
activist and a bit of a Marxist as well
and what he said was have nothing in
your house that you do not know to be
useful or believed to be beautiful and
we've applied the same principle to our
program so we've said have nothing in
your conference that you don't know to
be useful or believed to be beautiful
and what does Beauty mean in the context
of a talk really it's fascinating so we
want things that are either you're going
to be able to take away and you've got
new skills as a result of seeing this
talk or your mind has been expanded in
some way and you can think about things
in a different way and by seeing a
problem that you'd never thought about
before you can have an insight into the
maybe the problems that you do think
about every day so I've got just a
couple more tips as well for for how to
take best advantage of the program so
one is as Mark said go to the quickies
they're often my favorite parts it's
hard to go to them because they're at
lunch and you have food and you're
hungry but do do you make a point of
going to them they're so good the second
is take advantage of the minds of geek
track that's where a lot of our big
ideas are we work really hard to get
those talks in and to make sure that
we've got things that are new that you
haven't heard of in
so dude go and so on the minor geek
sometimes some people ask us why do we
do this track called mine the geek
because you know most of most of you
come because your company's paid for you
because you want to come that's not true
in every sense but you look at the minor
geek stuff and you're like hmm how's
that relevant to what I do to work a lot
of the time it's not right now but maybe
next year it is or the year after it is
and we we hope that these are things
that kind of delight you and inspire you
to go and do great things with new
technologies so we're really proud of
that minor geek stuff yeah and we're so
we're so lucky to be in the industry
that we're in and we're so lucky to have
jobs that allow us to be as creative as
we are but I think sometimes you can
forget that when you when you get gone
into a day to day grind and just having
that space to say oh look at all these
other cool things gives you it means
that you go back refreshed and positive
and able to take something something
that you didn't have before
and the last one is even with a
conference as big as this one there
probably will be some points when you
look across all of the rooms and you'll
say nope nope nope nope not relevant to
me at that point don't go to your email
don't go just collapse on the floor go
to one of those sessions anyway I found
that the sometimes the talks I've
learned the most in have been ones where
I didn't realize it was relevant to me
and I chose one at random and then I
discovered something that I didn't even
know I didn't know so now I'm back to
like cool so if you haven't downloaded
the mobile app yet it's probably the
best way to find your way around the
conference in terms of content what's on
on the back of your badge you'll see the
QR codes for the different app stores
it's on iOS and it's on Android and
thanks to Johan vast and his teammates
luan who spent a lot of time and energy
putting it together for us I'm not going
to talk too through it for too long just
a couple of screens so ultimately all
the contents on there you get to choose
how you navigate around what's new on
this as well as that you can take
personal notes for each session as well
which I think it's really valuable and
keep it in there so all of those things
such as notes like oh my god it's really
early and I haven't had enough coffee
but that's just the personal one for me
for today so I'm not going to talk
around that too much because I really
want to get our next keynote speaker on
something I do want to say very quickly
is new for this year is a personalized
DevOps report that you can produce now
how many of you when you go back to the
office your boss says what did you do at
the conference write something up for me
so yeah people amount okay so with this
what you'll be able to do is go to that
will send you an email with all of this
as well but you'll be able to go to that
URL and if you use the mobile apps all
of the data in terms of the sessions
that you've been to if you've rated a
session it means that you've been
through it if you've dropped notes on it
all of that will populate into this and
you'll be able to spew out a nice report
at the end and maybe add extra notes but
also when you go into that you'll also
be able to get next week the links
within YouTube videos so it's quite a
valuable tool I need to say thanks to
Capgemini who put this together for us
they're one of our sponsors and they
said what can we do that would really
help attendees and we came up with this
idea also they've got I don't know if
you've been down there but they've just
got this big blank sheet of paper on the
back of their booths at the moment
that's because they've gotten that
artists coming in drawing avatars of as
many of you as possible so go get your
face on their booth their box Buddies
program Linda van powers span sat down
there this is her brainchild it's about
if you're here on your own and you just
want to hang out with some people
there's a point just downstairs in the
exhibition hall at the bottom of the
stairs on the right hand side go along
the sign up put some notes up and you
can hook up with other people it's
really it's a really great initiative
and Linda spent a lot of time and after
putting it together in our own free time
so thank you for that
there's lots partly right so this is
tonight so this is why I get excited
because there's beer but not just any
beer we brew our own beer tonight you'll
be able to go and call out for a pint of
API
ei may be a kind of system optimization
see what we did there a point of micro
profiler and various other great brews
soft drinks and wine are available also
that starts at 6:30 tonight it's down at
the brew house and kitchen on Torrance
tree which is literally a five minute
walk just down past the angel station
you might times up you will be able to
get an invite by finding people like
Marcus ISIL who's wandering around with
insight invites these from light then
one of our sponsors
counts beta response they've got a booth
here you'll be able to go and grab one
from them and also Roberto Cortez and
John are also here they're speaking in
various sessions today look them up
they'll be giving invites the right way
at the end of their session and it's not
just find them because they're most
likely to be hanging around the hacker
Don thanks to our sponsors I'm not going
to dwell on this for too long but we
keep the ticket price as low as we
possibly can in the most expensive city
to run a bloody conference in the world
it feels like and because we do that we
rely on these guys for their support and
so I want to say if possible can you
give a big round of applause to our
sponsors
clearly it's with bad well negotiated
cash that we managed to keep that ticket
price so low and produce really cool
content and good stuff so that's it
enjoy the conference enjoy it
responsibly if you see anybody in a
yellow t-shirt like that that means
they're a volunteer they're a member of
our crew they'll be able to help you out
so if you've got any issues you need to
talk to anybody go and see one of those
if anybody else that isn't a volunteer
is wearing the same shade of yellow
really apologize because you're going
out really bad tie that's it
I thank you all very much for coming
along and really hopefully you have a
great couple of days and now I'm going
to hand over to our first keynote
speaker accept having having explained
already the many meetings and the many
emails this is one of the hardest parts
of my role because I have to introduce
the keynote speakers and so before the
talk I said how do you pronounce your
name and he told me and I told it back
to him and he said no no no no no and we
went through that about six times and in
the end I just gave up so I apologize to
him in advance and I'm going to
apologize to him again for the butchery
but please welcome Winfred ham singer
who's going to speak on quantum
computing and quantum computing is
definitely one of the the things that
was 20 years ago everybody looked at
this and said this is very interesting
theoretically it changes our fundamental
assumptions about what computer science
means what what the most fundamental
units of computation are but it's a
shame it's not physically possible now
with the application of a bit of
determination and a lot of motivation
it's really getting to a state where
it's much more possible than it used to
be so I'm looking forward to hearing
more about it and please welcome with
