begin so at the beginning I'd like to
take this opportunity to thank the
organizers of devix 2017 for having me
here and for all of you to come to this
talk the following are the lessons I've
learned from having the privilege of
working alongside world-class engineers
on the most challenging scaling problems
ranging from the dissemination of
knowledge and large-scale code bases to
compilers static analysis and providing
fast and actionable feedback on built so
without further ado let's begin very
briefly Who am I my name is Ryan
Sonnenberg and over the last two years
I've had two distinct roles at ruber the
first world I had was that of an Android
systems engineer looking at why the
application crashes why developers mrs.
api's and why things ultimately go wrong
in production the one area of focus that
I had immense pleasure diving into was
the issue of null pointer exceptions and
why we've ultimately reach production
and as a result I went from kind of this
role of reviewing source code making
sure that developers new best practices
such kind of disseminating this
knowledge in a more automatically I
still deep into the compiler and two
static analyzers and as a result I've
walked away with I'm the experience with
a large passion for build systems at
large scales so the title of this talk
is building it over scale and those of
you wondering what that even is nothing
exemplifies is more than this picture of
my mailbox on the right here for those
of you with particularly poor eyesight
this is a desperate cry of help from my
mailman who's written on my mailbox
please mailbox full what makes like a
problem in my mind like uber scale is
you're looking at a system like this
where like this is a full mailbox this
is a system that can't scale any further
and you know that you're going to have
to do like 10 times the number of
letters in this mailbox and like six
months from now so you're kind of like
racking your head for any sort of way to
kind of like engineer yourself out of
this problem and we're going to kind of
look at all the techniques that we can
to help accommodate systems to scale as
a brief exercise we can kind of think
about what is
the scalable solution to my mailbox and
it should be pretty obvious that it's
just email there in a number of reasons
why email is a preferable and a more
scalable solution to the mailbox most
obviously is that it can hold way more
mail other reasons are just like it's
much faster it employs abstraction a
common pattern in large-scale code bases
you'll see for example you'll see like a
hashmap subtracted into like an uber
hash map in the same way mail is
attracted into email I don't need to
know the ins and outs of spending up a
mail server to start up 20 email
addresses another big reason why email
skillful will is like my ability to
write spam filters and to stop that nail
from coming in and then another big win
of the email addresses i don't get
passive-aggressive letters from my
mailman so all in all it's a win-win the
other thing to kind of think about is
that although email is the scalable
solution over mail it's not like a false
dichotomy where it's one or the other
and I think in software we too often
fall into this trap of either everything
has to be automated or everything has to
be done by hand I still mean my mailman
to come and deliver me packages and I
still want my email to deliver an email
and kind of like the amalgamation of
both the machine mind and if you mean
mind is what ultimately leads to the
most like efficient and effective
systems so without further ado let's
depart entirely from the world of mail
and dive into the world of software so
during the course of this presentation
I'm going to be talking about the
following ideas and they all kind of fit
into this theme of a problem that we
faced as we started to bring in more and
more developers in Terre pool the
different processes and systems they
struggle to scale and the ways that we
mitigated these the first category that
we're going to be talking about is the
dissemination of knowledge like how do
you teach people what the best practices
are and how do we do this as there are
less and less veterans and more and more
newbies entering your pool the next
thing we're going to talk about is the
value of kind of like hunting down these
small defects and that they ultimately
have larger consequences at large scale
something to think about is that the
improbable
becomes increasingly more and more
probable as you do more and more trials
and as a result you need to mitigate
these small defects from creeping in the
techniques that we have are two kind of
like provide railings and abstractions
to prevent people from getting defected
in the first place and then additionally
we have the build system and the
compiler to rely on to kind of like
detect anti-patterns and educate our
developers on what the best practices
are in the code base after that we're
going to look at the value of speed on
large scale scale systems and ultimately
what we're going to find is that if it's
not fast it doesn't scale you need to
provide your feedback and you need to
provide these type feedback loops in a
way that is quick actionable and allows
your developers to do the best thing as
fast as possible then finally we're
going to look at what these
methodologies meant for uber the
improvements that we made to our own
systems and ultimately the impact that
we walked away with so without further
ado let's liven so I started here with a
dilbert comic from Scott Adams we have
this like senior developer old Johansson
who's whispering some like technical
knowledge into Wally's year's work the
thing for those of you that haven't read
dilbert is Wally is the worst engineer
at work he's pretty pleased here because
he's going to go lord this information
over all of his co-workers heads the
takeaway from this slide isn't that you
can obtain job security by keeping
information from your peers fact you
should do the opposite of this but
rather the thing to take away here is
that teaching somebody a best practice
is inherently kind of like a human
pursued it takes typically somebody
reading somebody else's code saying hey
I've noticed that you're misusing this
API this way here's the correct way to
use it it take the code review it takes
some kind of process which will
ultimately see doesn't scale as things
get larger and larger this kind of
process works very well when there is
like one Johansson to every single Wally
but when there are 10,000 Wally's to
every single Johansson is just going to
start falling apart it's not feasible
for Johansson to spend all of his time
running around teaching best practices
and there are solutions to do this
besides just word of mouth
so the most obvious way to do this in
the easiest way is to hook into the
build system there are two reasons why
there's so much value in providing like
dissemination of knowledge through the
build system the first one is that it
has the full context of all the source
that you're working on for those of you
not familiar the build system is the
system that turns your source code into
the final application and in this system
you have the opportunity to look at
every single line of source code that's
being written by the developer the
second more subtle reason why the build
system is so valuable to the process of
disseminating knowledge is that you have
the eyeballs of every single developer
when they're working in the earliest
stage of development you have the
ability to change things and you have
the ability to take feedback and allow
them to like iterate it on it very
quickly the thing to keep in mind though
when you're kind of trying to tie
information into the build system is
that there are two types of enforcement
that you can provide typically the build
system is great at providing these kind
of like a uniform repetitive and
predictable types of enforcement and the
more nuanced types of refractors or like
input like oily writing code refactor to
the Android activity lifecycle need a
human reviewer to come in so there are a
number of tools that will let you expend
your builds to kind of like teacher
developers what the right things to do
are examples of these are like the
error-prone compiler the checker
framework you can even pass additional
excellent flags into java sea there's
the inferred Ecker out of Facebook and
there's the checks out tool and all of
these can be used to extend your bill to
kind of like teacher developers or what
the correct things to do are and how to
detect your anti-patterns so you guys
might be wondering like can't I just
like the tech oh my like what what's the
point of diving into the build system
this way can't I just like teach all my
best practices through code review and I
think the answer here is both yes and no
it matters ultimately what kind of scale
you're at and how many lines of code
you're asking your developers to review
the graph on the right is best explained
by an anecdote from one of my very
talented coworkers Tony Cana steady and
what Tony will tell you is that if you
give me 10 lines of code to review
I'm going to find ten errors in the code
if you give me 10,000 lines of code to
review I'm still going to find ten
errors in the code pretty much the idea
that a engineer can endlessly find
defects in increasingly larger and
larger amounts of source code isn't true
it begins to fall apart and as systems
gets larger and as source code gets
larger it becomes less and less feasible
to kind of provide this feedback through
code review alone I think a lot to my
like early days trying to reduce null
pointer exceptions in the app and when I
started I tried going like entirely down
the code review path I wrote tons of
code reviews that had nothing to have
nothing except like at a nullable
annotation like is this malleable what
happens when this returns null and
ultimately the thing to consider is that
I was kind of like doing the work of the
Machine of the of a machine and then I
was not letting the build kind of like I
accommodate and pick up kind of like the
low low that I could do again it's
really important to take like the
repetitive tasks that you're doing in
code review and automate them to kind of
like free up your developers to go and
supply like this more like you want sir
factors and does more like a nuance the
reduced your code could reduce again
like back to the example of like Wally
and the Johansson an individual doing
code review eventually becomes not
enough in a large-scale system and you
need to kind of get more methodical
about it another thing to consider about
getting very methodical in large systems
is that as you start doing more and more
trials the highly improbable becomes
increasingly more probable the question
I asked here is like how often is one in
a thousand anyway and the answer to that
ultimately comes down to how many trials
can do in a single day the graph on the
Left shows the likelihood of seeing a
one and A Thousand event over a number
of trials by the time you're doing a
thousand trials you're ready at like
forty percent chance of kind of seeing
an egregious error and as things get
larger as things get bigger the
likelihood that want to do small things
kind of to bite you actually becomes
more on the right here I think a lot to
kind of like cracks and a foundation and
how a tiny deep foundation are
we made worse as you put more and more
load and more and more weight on it so
this is the thing to keep in mind as
you're getting bigger as you're growing
as you're doing more and more commits in
a single day as your developers are
changing more and more lines of code
it's actually progressively more and
more challenging to stay stable and you
need to get that much more methodical
and that much more aggressive about
guaranteeing kind of like a basic level
of a minimum quality assurance to the
code that your developers are writing it
again I don't think that like this is
necessarily like 5000 solution to like
every single developer shop it depends
on what kind of scale you're at the
number of developers you have actively
working on your repositories and then
ultimately as you bring on more and more
it just becomes more important to become
methodical in this way so like the next
question is like okay we see the value
of kind of like preventing these defects
from getting into the code base but like
how do how do we prevent them and there
are two main techniques that I've seen
that can lead to tremendous results for
like preventing defects the first one is
the like value of like providing
railings and abstractions for your
developers the idea here is that you're
trying to scale up some process that is
particularly error-prone for us it was
onboarding new engineers who are trying
to like spin up new repositories and get
a quality continuous integration setup
and a quality build system going this is
very tedious this is very error-prone
and this process of like onboarding new
repositories quickly turned from like a
once a week task to a once-a-day task to
like a twice a day task it wasn't
scaling a we couldn't keep up with kind
of like cement that like our developers
are coming on and ultimately we needed a
way to scale up the system and the key
to kind of scaling up this process was
convention over configuration it's
tremendously easier to prevent errors if
you ask somebody to follow a process as
opposed to expecting them to understand
the technical implications of what
they're doing the example that we have
here is we provide like a bootstrap
Gradle plugin for other engineers to
kind of lay out their own projects and
if they put their source files in the
project structure that they that we
expect they're able to spin up like a
large scale like continuous integration
setup without actually having to touch
any of the code we kind of provide them
this like ironclad abstraction that they
can then go on and use and we can kind
of like sleep safe knowing that the
building blocks their building on top of
our defect free and they're able to kind
of do these complex things without
necessarily having to understand the
technical details of what they're doing
furthering down on this analogy of kind
of providing these quality building
blocks I literally have a picture of
building blocks here and the idea here
is that you have one group of engineers
building these like defect free rock
solid pieces of abstractions and then
you allow like other engineers to kind
of build these like quality applications
on top of them the thing in the key to
building like quality abstractions and
quality railings is that they should
enable your developers to do more as
opposed to define what they can and
can't do here on the right Nathan Sawaya
is able to build these like beautiful
comic book cos statues without having to
wonder like what if one of my like tiny
little pieces has a crack in them he
knows that what he's building on top of
his rock solid he doesn't have to
understand how to manufacture a base
building block you can just go build
something quickly and easily and know
that it's defect free and by basically
having this guarantee of our basic
building blocks in our systems knowing
that their defect free and don't have
one of those tiny cracks we know that we
can scale and we know that we can scale
without the kind of like involvement of
other engineers so let's move on to like
the second category of how to prevent
defects from coming into the code base
and this is about like pattern detection
enforcement static analysis and DVD
diving deep into the compilers as i said
earlier in this presentation of being
like particularly passionate about like
getting null pointer exceptions out of
our application and the big observation
is that this is not a task for a human
being you'll see this in modern JVM
languages like Kotlin that have null
safety baked into the compiler right out
the gate but if there is a predictable a
methodical approach to solving a problem
it's much easier to
a way to kind of like get man and
machine to work in tandem there are a
number of tools that can actually help
you if you're in a Java world that is
struggling for null pointer exceptions
there's fine bugs there's the eradicate
tool from facebook and there's even the
numbness checker for after the checkered
framework there's a presentation and
here earlier today about exactly solving
this issue again the kind of like code
paths that we've always gone through and
the kind of process that we've gone
through and my own methodology is it's
okay for an issue to reach production
once but it should never reach
production twice if you have these
methodical things and these repetitive
things that are constantly biting you
you need to look and say like is this
something I can automate is this
something I can teach a machine to to
look for and if you can do it you'll
eradicate those issues forever so you
might be wondering how do I create these
custom check how do I teach a computer
to do code review the secret to this one
lives in hooking into the abstract
syntax tree of the language that you're
kind of like working in for those that
aren't familiar the abstract syntax tree
is kind of like an it's a representation
of the source code that you're working
on we kind of have like the code snippet
below and as like a thought experiment
by visiting like all the nodes in this
tree we could very easily build a
checker then made sure that every single
operator is performed only on primitives
and not object like we could say that
like if we knew that like X was an
object we could say you have to use the
dot plus operator as opposed to plus so
like the thing here is like yes we can
teach our build systems and our
compilers to do these very complex and
nuanced things but we're never going to
be able to teach our compiler let like
the code on this slide is like absolute
garbage the variable names are terrible
it's like uncomprehensible and this is
kind of like the key of like you want
your developers focused in their code
reviews on providing the value to your
systems that your machines can't you
want them talking about the testability
the maintainability and be kind of like
all of all all in all design of what the
and you want your machines and your code
review tools to kind of tackle the like
repetitive and boring cases the cases
that kind of drain your developers in
code review and take up there like only
ten errors that they can find them a
single cycle there's a number of tools
that can help you do this one every
single language has their own tools
talking to the syntax tree for Java is
the error-prone compiler there's a
checker framework and if you're doing
Android there's the Android linker which
comes with a whole boatload of custom
checks I've gotten a lot about a lot of
value out of these and a lot of value of
like providing feedback on these very
like repetitive cases a good example
unlike Android is there's like image
views and there's like a Content
description for blind people to like it
will read read out what the images you
can just like add a min check or custom
check that says hey you always need to
fill this out so again the repetitive
the predictable the things that are
always biting you can be translated into
the compiler and the more nuanced things
will always rely on human beings to tell
us that our code is no good so now let's
kind of depart away from like the source
code self and talk about speed and the
hardest lesson that I had to learn is
that if it isn't fast it doesn't scale
we kind of talked about how you can
build these kind of like defect-free
systems or these defect detection
systems to catch a wide category of
issues like we could catch speed
regressions we catch memory regressions
we could catch crashes in the wild but
if it isn't fast it's not going to scale
I've been in the world before where you
have the system that's detecting the
errors in your code base after the
commits land after they've become
coupled to the code base and after
developers have built on top of them and
ultimately if your systems aren't fast
you're going to turn into Charlie
Chaplin below here kind of like running
into your co-workers asking them to
revert things and you're going to end up
in this like endless maintenance cycle
of trying to maintain a system and
ultimately this isn't productive because
you're spending all of your time keeping
a system alive whereas you should be
spending your time kind of building like
that next big system that next system
that can detect the next category of
issues and you're going to
frustrated and you're going get
frustrated the kind of impact that you
have the other thing to consider is that
when you're trying to provide feedback
to a change if it's not fast you can't
act on it you can think back to the
mailman example where like there's only
a set amount of time between when he's
pulling that like piece of mail out of
his bag and it's going in my mailbox
similarly there's only so much time
between when the developer is incubating
a change and when it ultimately land in
the application on master I like to
think is like the kind of like common
expression which is like an ounce of
preparation is worth a pound of cure if
you can stop things getting too in
getting in you'll scale if you have to
catch things after the fact it's going
to be a nightmare and you're going to
get stuck maintaining a system for your
entire career it's really painful and
this is really the value that speed
provides you so you might be wondering
to yourself like well how even do I make
systems fast how do I make them perform
it there are three main categories for
like how we've achieved success for
providing speedin systems they are don't
do a necessary work this one's simple if
you don't need to do it just turn it off
for the example of the mailbox that we
started with just don't don't send me
mail that I'm not going to read this
would be like an ideal world but again
if you're not going to need it and you
don't need to use it turn it off you'll
be away faster because of it the next
category of speed winds is to cache
wherever possible this is the idea that
if you've done in unit of work you don't
need to do it again if I have that
target ad in my mailbox just use the
same target ad don't send me a whole
nother letter finally we kind of have
this idea and this is like the last kind
of like paramount to achieving speed
it's like paralyzed wherever possible we
could always make our systems more
efficient by adding like more Hardware
more cores more threads and you can just
parallel eyes and make things faster so
like let's kind of like dive in to how
this kind of like lens helped us achieve
speed winds on one of the tools in our
systems this is like the cheques el tule
this is like a simple regex pace winter
that you can use to sort things like
file length method ordering and method
names the thing is we were running this
through
a Gradle plug-in and we have to talk to
the Gradle build system to get ready to
run this tool this thing ran in like
about a minute and our largest code
bases and ultimately it ran every single
time somebody wanted to make a change
this constituted about five minutes of
developers time every single day and we
made the following observations first we
didn't have to talk the Gradle to get
this thing ready we could just turn off
that whole process we could call the jar
directly and pass source files we didn't
need Gradle to build the source file we
didn't need class files we could just go
to the tool directly turn off that
entire flow squeeze that like three
quarters of the entire performance the
next idea was that we didn't have to run
this tool on the entire source it we
could cash we could only run it on the
change file list this kind of got us
from like 15 seconds down to five
seconds and then with what we were left
we could paralyze it we could run it on
multiple threads if we had five files we
could run it across like five different
threads so as a result we were able to
take this like five minute coughlin
Oliver developer all of our developers
and bring it down to like a couple of
seconds and when you do the math be kind
of like impact of these kind of changes
are kind of staggering if you have like
a hundred people going through this
process every single day you've claimed
back like eight hours in the most like
extreme way of thinking about this like
you're pretty much like saving lives
when you create Goodwin's like this
you're kind of claiming back that like
wasted time of a developer just sitting
in front of a screen waiting for
absolutely nothing to happen you like
locked up their machine and you're
getting that time back speed wins matter
more and more as organizations scale and
get larger and larger and as you start
squeezing these things out and as you
take these lens of kind of like turning
things off caching and parallelizing you
will see them in your code base and you
will realize great impact let's talk
about like another tool that kind of had
us achieve these kind of San kind of
like scaling wins and this was a kinda
like the okay buck tool this is a tool
out of one of our very talented
developers got em Korell um and in his
spirit
ask you all why does buck always tip
when it goes out for dinner the answer
is that because buck always has the cash
now that we've all collectively groaned
at that statement let's kind of like
dive into what makes like okay buck fast
okay buck is a tool that turns a build
system defined in Gradle and turns it
into buck where this was tremendously
valuable is that buck comes with a tool
called the network cash and this means
that anything that was built on your
servers can be used by another machines
cash this means you build it once and
then you get the cash benefit everywhere
and we're able to squeeze lightly insane
amounts of time into our build system
the other big reason kind of like why
this is so fast is it's just much better
like utilizing the maximum amount of
course on your machine it's fast because
it doesn't repeat work it caches
wherever possible and it exhibits strong
parallelization behavior and the reason
why the ok buff tool is really cool is
that you get the best of both worlds
between Grail and Buck you kind of get
this like expressive dsl and you get to
write in a JVM language and you get like
the fast and the network cache of buck
it's a great tool go look at the github
page of Gotham's we're trying to get it
to a thousand stars so go like it so
like all in all let's go back through
and like sunrise the like key ideas and
the key issues and kinda like the key
points of the stock the first one is
this idea in this challenge of
disseminating best practices in your
developer tool and the key here is to
hook into the build system it's not
enough to do code review it's not enough
to simply tell people what the best
practices are it's not going to scale of
being there are struggled with it you
need an automated way to provide code
reviews the kind of like next big point
is that small mistakes have big impacted
scale as you get bigger and bigger the
improbable becomes progressively more
and more probable when I was an intern
at amazon they had this great expression
that says one in a million happens every
single day here as you get bigger and
bigger and you do more and more trials
it's just going to become more and more
challenging to keep them defect free and
you have to become that much more
aggressive about eradicated those simple
mistakes and then on eradicating those
simple mistakes there's kind of like two
categories of techniques that we can
have
katie's the first one is quality
building blocks of quality abstractions
for other developers to build on top of
that are defect free and then the second
one is kind of hooking into the build
system hooking into static analyzers to
look for the defects and fish them out
before they land into the final
application then we kind of looked at
the value of speed and ultimately we
found that scalable solutions are fast
ones and like with like the final SAT
here and like the final conclusion is
that we've been able to build our code
bases larger and safer we've been able
to go from like a single like every
single repository is one module to kind
of making a large mono repo of like 500
modules and by kind of following these
methodologies by diving deep into cash
and parallelization and providing
quality static analyzers to look for
defect we've ultimately been able to
build larger and safer and like our kind
of like small repos build smaller than
our largest ones it's pretty wild and
it's all the results of these kind of
methodologies so like again thank you
all for coming here like I really relish
and appreciate the opportunity to speak
here thank you for coming again my name
is Ryan sonnenberg you can find me on
like github or twitter at clemson 26 and
then my work email there is ryan
sauntered over comm feel free to reach
out if you've any questions on this
category like i'm particularly
passionate about it and pretty much just
like open the floor to questions if
