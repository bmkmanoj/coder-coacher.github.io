great thank you for joining my session
called 10 tips to become an awesome
technical eat before I get started I'm
going to do the one thing that you
should never do when you speak in front
of an audience and that's apologize but
I will do it anyway
on Monday I completely lost my voice I
was in Ukraine over the weekends and
there's a lot of partying going on in
Ukraine trust me and I had no voice
whatsoever so I will be drinking a lot
of water during my talk but if all of a
sudden my voice sounds like it's going
into puberty just give me some time and
I'll fix it there have been a lot of
talks at the back here today that has
quite a lengthy introduction but since
after this talk there will be beer and
fries I will keep it extremely short my
name is Barlow Mart's I am a hands-on
application architect at ordina in
Belgium we have a booth downstairs so if
you want to get some nachos or some
vodka or on should just come by our
booth and have a chat with us we work in
a I work in a unit called Jay works and
we mainly focus on Java and JavaScript
so devoxx is a good conference for us
and if you have any questions for me or
remarks or any ranting or something you
can always reach me via my Twitter
handle so enough of the introduction
let's get you guys to work have a
question for all of you who are in the
audience
Bob considers him or herself a technical
lead so you have a oh that's really good
then you know most of the stuff that I'm
going to say anyway so now is this
really cool and of those guys and girls
who are technically who of you has
worked with other technical leads in the
past
okay so there's apparently less people
who have worked with other technical
leads than there are technical leads I
asked this question at every comes
friends that I'm going to and exec their
soul is always the same so if I start
talking about technical leadership it's
probably useful to give some kind of
definition or some characteristics about
technical leadership so in my opinion
the technical lead has two functions he
looks for the technical direction of a
project of a products and he also serves
as the go-to person for cross team
interaction for
making sure that the team does a great
job let's dive into some details
obviously when it when you talk about
technical leads it's about technical
guidance it's about defining or making
sure that some guidelines have been set
up and what tools are we going to use
how are we going to deliver our projects
maybe what about patterns are we going
to use etc another characteristic for
the the role of technical lead is about
risk and the requirements here at devoxx
we have probably seen a lot of really
cool technologies we have seen spring
boot using spring boots ooh using
Copeland and we might think I really
want to use this in my in my project
there was a tweet at the tweet wall
right behind me saying ah DevOps is
really great but on Monday I'm going
back to work on my legacy struts
application and all of this will have
been for nothing
some of you might have experienced the
same thing I hereby though laughter and
if you are good at mitigating some risks
you might also be able to define okay
how are we going to introduce new
technology in our existing stack and
make sure that nothing goes overboard
the tool also about coaching most
projects nowadays will have mixed
experience within themes so there will
be junior developers there will be
mid-level developers senior developers
and that makes a lot of sense from a
cost perspective so it's up to the more
senior people to be coaching the junior
people so that they also can become
better at what they're doing and last
but not least it is also about
communication as a technical EQ we'll be
working together with your business and
generally business and technical people
they have a different language they
don't speak the same things I will dive
into that a bit more in detail now the
question that you might ask yourself is
do you really need technical leads it's
quite common in in in small to medium to
large project to have full-time
technically presence but some people
really argue against the role and they
say that a team of well-functioning
developers that they can make the
decisions they can make the correct
priorities and define what is important
to work on at a given time and I hardly
agree with that but even if this this
person perfect circumstances exists it
is it is a very delicate balance it's
very easy to upset that balance and then
you will need
something someone to make sure that the
correct decisions are being made so if
you look at this topic on Google or Bing
if somebody uses being you will find a
lot of discussion on this topic so even
in these perfect conditions you might
say ah everything is also we can discuss
the pros the cons every products we look
for an agreed solution we look to find
consensus but if you ever seen the lego
movie you'll know that not everything is
awesome all the time
you can have really well-functioning
teams where people really share this
responsibilities but your business will
still want like a single point of
contact and who are we going to address
to ask some questions people will still
need to be hired for the team and people
will inform she also leaf so it's
important I believe that the technical
lead is a role and you need to make sure
that within your team everybody works
together to make sure that some of the
responsibilities of the technical eat
are met so as the the the the job title
itself says there's two sides to the
story there's the technical part and
there is the the the leadership part and
I will in the slide you'll see that it's
like 50% of each and that is never the
case but I'm going to divide my talk in
two parts for the technical parts and
then afterwards the leadership parts and
so let's start with the technical part
and tip number one is advocate for
change advocates for change means
installing the the mindset of like
positive evolution
it's like making sure that you can
always become better at what you're
doing now how can we achieve this I'm a
big fan of something called a double Oda
that means observe orient decide and act
this is some kind of a cycle it's
reentrant cycle and in the observation
face you can look at what's happening
within your specific project for example
you might have a bill that sometimes
fails that's kind of annoying and you
make it make certain orientations about
that bills why is the bill failing maybe
there there's race conditions or
something like that and and when you
make this orientation based on your
experience based on what you're
observing you also need to make a
decision you can make the decisions and
say yeah we're not going to do anything
about it because some kind of reason or
you say no I want to continuously make
things better
and
we're going to fix that problem and then
of course you need to act upon it as
well and acting upon it means okay
making assigning the the problem to
somebody and making sure that the
problem gets fixed and that might of
course also be you there cool thing
about it is that this is a reentrant
loop so it's perfectly possible that if
you fix the failing builds that all of
the other builds start failing and then
you may need to make new observations
and make sure that you really improve
all the time how can you do this I
believe that as a technical leader
should be part of the team it's not
somebody who comes visit some teams once
every week and then look so how is
everything going so everything is still
fine at your project yes okay then I'm
out again that's that's not how it's
working you should be part of the team
experience the same pain as the team and
always looking for improvement I mean
Japan they have a saying that all this
you need a dice on state of mind a state
of mind is always looking for
improvement and to things better and I
really believe in this as a matter of
fact I've done this talk before about
other conferences and often after the
talk people come up to me starts asking
me questions maybe have pointers or our
guidance and so this also means I'm
changing your talk while you have
already started so good evening devoxx
welcome to 12 tips to become an awesome
technical eats tip number two is walk
work true failure and success things
will fail in Java there is the official
way of marking something as a failure
called the null pointer exception they
will happen in production on a Friday
evening so um prepare for this
it's not about finger pointing oh it's
it's your bill that broke it's know that
doesn't make any sense
use your energy to make sure that the
problem gets fixed and don't fix the
same book twice because that does not
make any sense whatsoever and when you
are able to learn from this failure and
make sure that you prevent it from
happening in the future again
you're always working two hours
continuous improvement now failure is
one side of the story there is also like
the celebrating part of the story in my
opinion we all have a pretty cool job
and we're doing really interesting
creative things and we should celebrate
that and it's very important in my
opinion to celebrate awesome to
celebrate early so maybe by the end of
the Sprint have a drink with some
colleagues I'll go have some beer do
something something nice
together it's fun it's good for the team
spirits and a night looks also would
like to share a personal story about a
project that I did last year and it was
for for a certain customer here in
Belgium and we worked very hard on the
project and in the end we did a
demonstration to them with the final
product and the customer said wow this
is really really good and I was really
happy I was waiting oh this is this is
exactly what you want and then they said
but we're not going to put it in
production we have new management they
have a completely different vision we
really like what you have done but yeah
that's about it so if you have been
waiting for that moment in time for any
celebration that that's really hard
so celebrate early celebrate when a
feature is complete and it's also about
congratulating the team because you're
working on something together you can
say are we really that good during this
print we delivered all the user stories
that we intended to deliver but that's
not enough it's also about
congratulating individuals so for
example if you have seen something here
at devoxx that can make your life better
make sure that you go to your your
technical lead if you are the technical
detail talk to yourself and just look
out maybe implementing it and if a
certain idea if it delivers then you
should also be congratulating the
individual because this will make sure
that people get more creative and people
really wants to become better at the
team so just a small drink some kind of
team building and you will have like a
happy and a motivated theme and it's fun
part number tree state technical as I
said when you become a technical each
you likely have convinced somebody that
you're up for the job but there's a lot
of leadership responsibilities in there
as well so as a technical lead you
should really try to stay technical as
much as possible which means writing
code which means doing proof of concept
maybe do code reviews and also have your
code reviewed as well because in the end
you're working towards a certain
technical vision you're trying to
establish a technical vision within your
team within your project and you want to
make sure that everybody adopts that
vision now one way of achieving this is
by making sure that they first of all
they know the rationale behind certain
decisions we're doing for example we're
doing cloud native because of I don't
know future strategic
parts of the company want to do that but
also make sure that you embrace your AR
team when you make those certain
decisions because that will make the
adoption a lot easier and what's also
very important when we start a new
greenfield project in general Cobb is
really clean there's a lot of unit tests
we do test-driven development we do
behavior driven development we do all
those kind of things and after six
months we probably need to make some
kind of we need to cut some corners to
make sure that we make this print and in
nine months and in a year things will
become increasingly bad so even if you
have other responsibilities as a
technical lead you should always be
looking at that the evolution of the
code works really really well and one
thing that always surprises me as a
technical lead most of the time I was
confused by pretty women I get that
sometimes most of the time most of us
are really eager to work on on
frameworks on new libraries and start
investing time in that but in general
were less interested in in networking
and security because it's generally kind
of boring deployment we are we don't
really it's running on my machine must
be good enough I'll put it in docker on
and on and and consistency consists of
the code base consisting of what you're
writing and that's really strange to me
because at this conference probably half
of the talks about micro services what
about service about 12 native
deployments so really make sure that you
also embrace this and make sure that
these like non-functional requirements
are met and there's the difference
between implementing and micro service
with the latest spring boot framework
and actually reading like the enterprise
integration patterns book by by Gregor
hope you really need to make sure that
these are addressed as well and with
that we continue to tip number four
always available as I said there are
multiple responsibilities for technical
leads and what I personally tend to do
is I try to assign my time upfront to
certain tasks that need to be fulfilled
so the technical design is about
preparing work for your team making sure
that you have a definition of Dom that
can that stories can be executed and
completed but it's also about talking to
a business because you have a certain
technical vision
and you have this technical vision for
your business stakeholders because
you're trying to achieve something for
someone it's also about project
management it might be that you need to
create Sprint's that you need to define
user stories sub toes etc etc and of
course it's about code as I mentioned
earlier now these numbers and they're
just some personal starting point for
myself it's important that you decide
what his numbers should be for yourself
for your project and that you also
evaluate this so when the project has
been going on for a certain time it
might be that you for example are
spending way too much time on project
management and you're nearly don't want
to do that that's a good time to go talk
to your project owner and say maybe
we'll need a dedicated project a
dedicated project manager and those
things are possible and evaluating on
this will give you certain insights but
in the end be realistic always available
does not mean that you need to be able
to ask to reply to every question at hoc
some questions will be more difficult
some questions will require that you do
a proof of concept or that you start
talking to other teams and just make
sure you ask for some time or maybe
connect some people together you don't
need to solve everything yourself but
when you ask for this time to work on
something make sure that you always come
back to the person who asked you the
question it's a sign of respect and then
as a technical lead you have like the
the power to connect people as well
maybe you can work on something together
somebody asks you questions to really
valid question we haven't thought about
this before let's work and or maybe you
can work on it and with somebody else
from the team because maybe he has a lot
of or she has a lot of experience in a
certain area and things like that now
over time you also get better at this
time management it's not the most fun
part of the role and I get a lot of
questions on this but if you just keep
on doing your best making sure that you
evaluate what you're doing you will get
better at it number five be a mentor for
your team and I have this the violet is
in a couple of soup responsibilities
there is the mediator part because
discussions will happen and in general
when there's discussions in the team is
actually a good sign because it means
that people are passionate enough about
something that they want to do the
effort to discuss it in the end you're
all working towards the same end goal
but as a technically you need to mediate
these discussions you made it in to look
for consensus but if no consensus can be
found then you
will technically need to make the
decision it is worse not taking a
decision than taking the wrong decision
if you not take a decision then the
discussion we'll just keep on popping up
and every sprint you will have the same
discussion it's just cumbersome and
nobody likes that's the mentoring part
is closely related to what I said
earlier about coaching if you have less
experienced people in your team they
will need some guidance and I tend to do
this in a very similar fashion when new
developers come on one of my teams I
will code review every commit that they
do and it takes some time but it's
really valuable and you can it's it's
important that you mentioned why you are
giving certain comments if you explain
this rationale to them they will adopt
it and they will try to do better you
can be very strict in this in the
beginning I think it's it's necessary to
be very strict in that and if you if you
notice that people are not adopting that
you can come even like the the the the
old bad guy in the team and just write
unit tests that fails that make their
tests fail or that maybe their desk
there that classes cause no pointers and
then explain why you did that why you
went to the efforts this will not make
you very popular but in time people will
adopt it and able understand why your
are taking certain measures effective
delegation also very important one you
do not need to make all the decisions
yourself you do not need to be
responsible for anything if you have the
possibility to give ownership to certain
people in your team be sure to do that
you need to stay accountable this is
very important some people will be
really happy to take on more
responsibility and do a really good job
and other people just say this is not
what I signed up for I'll just like to
quote from nine to five and then go home
that's pretty bad it's possible I hope
that's most of you since you're come
today folks are not in that category
so it's important that you stay
accountable matching goals matching
goals is about what I'd like to call and
I need to read it because I forget it
all the time specifically target that's
dynamic coaching what does it what does
this mean it is specifically target it
is about your goal or somebody else's
goal and it's different for everybody
and it's dynamic because it means that
your goal might change maybe some people
want to become a technical eat
then you can start with some rotation
and you can can help the people who
would like to do that or you need to
share my slide back and then they will
be an awesome technical eat as well but
again in all of the previous parts
communication is really key but matching
goals probably communication is even
more important because you're doing
somebody specifically for one of your
team members and they will greatly
appreciate what you're doing
and last but not least when there are
certain discussions and there's no
consensus to be found then you need to
optimize for the group you're working on
something as a team you want to have a
good outcome
so optimize for the group take decisions
for the group and teams that collaborate
well will perform better and add well
performing team members will be more
happy and will be glad to work on your
project so in summary no one to give
inputs
no one to make decisions but also know
when to step back it's about sharing
responsibility and giving ownership to
other people in your team who are ready
for that number six
it's about surrounding yourself with all
our technical leads and this can be done
both on a personal level and on an
organizational level so on a personal
level when you for example a work of a
large customer there will be multiple
teams there might be multiple technical
leads make sure that you have you
network with them find out how they are
making sure that there is a technical
vision without coming across as very
bossy because nobody wants to come
across as very dominant that that's not
something that in general people like
but it's also about their their time
management how are they doing this what
can be learned from this don't blindly
adopt all project all people are
different but learn from each other
that's that's really really important on
an organizational level it is about
order like clearly understood
overarching objectives if you are
working for a government or for a bank
there will be so many project and the
bank has a certain goal or the
government has a certain goal how are we
working together towards this goal and
the same thing goes for architecture is
there an architecture that we're all
working towards for example if you're
doing cloud native development is there
a cloud strategy for the company will be
be deploying on Amazon or will be
deploying on on Cloud Foundry normal web
services so things like that are very
important to know as well and of course
it's also about interoperability the
project that I'm working on right now
isn't in cloud native atmosphere so we
want to do
stateless applications twelve factor we
want to deploy a docker container in
Grenada things like that but we also
need to integrate with the the the
magical thing in the basement the
mainframe so there's a lot of state in
that as well
so it's important that you take account
take into account that this
interoperability exists and then of
course there is dependencies and there
are dependencies by dependencies I mean
dependencies on people so another
personal story that happened to me this
year is there was another project and
they wanted to go to production and they
had a dependency on us so when they came
to us and they say oh we want to go to
production how how's your service are
you guys ready we had actually not
thought about production whatsoever we
were not even close to being ready so
that might cause problems and when
you're when you're working somebody else
that's even worse and somebody else is
blocking you because they can get very
annoying then you're not alone
smile sound a bit corny but when you
notice somebody on the project that
you're working or even in the comm the
customer that you're working for that
that struggles with somebody with
something as a technical lead reach out
to these in maybe in time they will also
reach out to you because the networking
part is also very very important as a
technical leads now there's a tip that I
recently added is thing big biased
fraction those are actually two of the
twelve leadership principles for Amazon
so if you want to know how Amazon is
working towards their the the leadership
part of Amazon these are just pop
published online you can just watch the
twelve leadership principles and think
big is about
creating and communicating a bolt
direction for the project because it
will inspire big results and people will
they will be glad because they have the
feeling is that working on something
really big now when you're doing this
when you are trying to make sure that
people are working toward something
great like these Star Wars guys it's
about thinking differently it's about
creating non limiting options for
yourself
so I'll have a story to story to explain
this
imagine that you you you have just got
on a dog and you really like the dog but
you don't know where it comes from and
every time you work your dog around the
streets when it meets another dog it's
really aggressive it wants to bite at
the walls to scratches wants to really
fight with the other dog and so you make
certain observation you say oh this is
knowing I don't want any of this so you
can get rid of the dog but that's a
limiting option because dog is gone you
might also say okay I will keep the dog
but I'm not walking it anymore and maybe
build some kind of shed in the yard and
it can do its thing over there again
limiting option because you're not
working your dog a non limiting option
might be that you put some candy in your
pocket and every time that you walk your
dog and it sees another dog in the
distance you give it some of the candy
and you can also give this candy to the
other dog in time the dog will change
its behavior and it will make sure that
when it when it sees a dog it will think
oh it's candy time and it will really it
will be able become more happy so that's
not a limiting choice but you can still
decide to walk with your dog or not you
still have options available if you're
really interested about about this
there's a really good book called
liminal thinking by dave gray and here's
a lot of anecdotes and n tips for
working with like this bias for action
it's it's not the opposite of thinking
big but it's about making sure that the
correct decisions are being taken many
actions are reversible so you don't need
to overthink everything maybe an
extensive study is not always needed if
you look at the initial reasoning behind
micro-service it's that they can be
thrown away and we are going to try
something if it works great if it
doesn't work okay maybe we need to
revisit it this is also about putting a
flywheel flywheel into motion if you put
it into motion it will keep rotating and
you will it will rotate even faster
people will see ah this works and we're
doing a really good job so that's really
really cool and then focus on things to
get the Flyway to moved on to focus on
all the things that are cumbersome or
take a lot of time just look for fur for
small successes in the beginning
leadership I need to keep on drinking
because advice might show it will
probably going to fool puberty mode
interviewing potential new team members
I've interviewed quite a lot of people
both to work on on the project I was
working for us technically or also for
the company that I was working for and
interviewing people it can be really
rewarding when you get it right but you
won't always get it right so some tips
on this in this nice movie about
full-stack developers they have yeah
yeah yeah yeah maybe gay party got shot
did not that means it didn't be in
general you have to do me leave my fam
think you may know charge a free top
media 2010
so that's how you should interview
full-stack developers the long day part
is especially true a couple of weeks ago
I did six interviews on one day it can
be a very long day but I think it's very
important that this you know why you're
interviewing here in Belgium some of you
may actually know that the yellow guy is
called boomba I have a five year old son
and a one-year-old son they really like
boomba he's a clown in a circus
and on the the right hand side there is
City Soleil which is also circus and
both are really valuable but really have
their merits but I'm pretty confident
that their actors will not be
interchangeable so when you are doing an
interview need to prepare for the
interview and you need to know why
you're interviewing are you looking for
somebody who will join the team for a
longer time because when somebody joins
the team for a longer time it is
generally less important to focus on the
tools on what what's on that resume um
it is more important to focus on their
mindset do these people consider certain
alternatives are like really developed
with people to be care about what we're
doing and also have they do they have
like an eagerness to learn the tooling
that you're using for your projects on
the other hand if you're looking for
somebody to just increase the bandwidth
and maybe you have a deadline and you
won't make it unless you make sure that
there are more people on the project
then the tooling becomes more important
because there will be less time to make
sure that they learn your your tooling
now very important about this distance
is the book calls by the book called the
mythical man-month by Fred Brooks it's
about how two women are not able to
deliver a child in less than nine months
so again be realistic when you're
looking for somebody to increase the
benefit of your projects I really try to
focus on the mindset of the developer
mindsets like thinking logically
identifying identifying multiple
approaches to to tackle certain problems
now one sip that I really encourage you
to not do is you stack overflow to look
for questions there are a lot of topics
on stack overflow
how you should do interviews for junior
from mid-level for senior developers and
in general all the advice on
stackoverflow on that topic is bad
because when you're looking for
questions it's not something that you're
doing and if you are creating searching
algorithms okay then maybe ask questions
in this direction when you're doing
Crotona database I mean it's not that
important that you know how how binary
search works now it's very easy to say
what you should not do and I also would
like to give some tips on what you
should do and I have a certain way of
always doing it is at the same time I
will try to start by comforting of the
people that I'm interviewing because in
general we also get it and the we have a
tendency to get nervous at an interview
we don't know who we're talking to we
don't know and there's a lot of stake a
lot of things at stake as well and I
always try to do this in in the same
manner I will always start by asking the
same question
and I've not done this talk in Belgium
before but if you ever get interviewed
by me you have a head start but the
first question always asks what is the
difference between an interface and an
abstract class in Java and that's a very
simple question who in the audience can
immediately come up with an answer so
that's most of you but you would be
really surprised by the answer you get
to that question even from very
experienced people and you can but you
can build on this answer you should
first and foremost offer some options
some people like to give a theoretical
explanation that's fine other people
like to draw on a whiteboard that's fine
as well maybe you need to make sure that
you bring a laptop so that people can
code something very quickly all those
options are valid and you can build on
their responses if they have a perfect
theoretical answer for example then you
maybe you can ask a do you have a
concrete example or what has changed
with interface in Java 9 because
everybody knows that has changed in Java
8 but not everybody is able to reply
what has changed in Java 9 and when you
work on this question you can work when
you build on this question you can see
you can ask questions about what people
will be doing in your project look at
their experience the tooling the TAFE
used in the past for example if they
have used spring maybe you would like to
ask some questions how dependency
injection how does it work how does it
work under the sheets do they notice how
do they cope with certain projects
problems we all have seen the B not
found
and also show a genuine interest in what
people are telling it's first and
foremost it's sign of respect and people
will also open up to you they will give
you more useful information to determine
whether they're a good candidate or not
for a certain position and I always like
to ask a bonus question as well and the
bonus question should be something that
you have experienced in your project a
difficult problem that you coped with
and you can you should tell the the
person that you're interviewing okay
this is a bonus question we really have
this problem we've worked in it for a
very long time and then you can say they
will understand what kind of problems
that you're facing within your
application and maybe they have the
experience to solve that problem quicker
and in the future that might be a really
good match now in the end you always
need to stay polite it is possible that
there is not a match between what you're
looking for and what the developer
brings to the table but nobody wants to
send people home with a bad feeling so
stay polite to your interviewees embrace
cultural differences is tip number 9 now
this is a really big screen and that
green dot over there that's bull gym so
in on the worldmap it's like very small
we all go home to to lead different
lives some of us are married some of us
are not some of us have kids some of us
are not and this diversity it's really
valuable because your users they will
also be all different you know you won't
you won't you won't know your users so
it's important that you you value this a
lot and as I as I touched upon earlier
opinions matter it is perfectly possible
that developers in your team won't agree
with you or with each other and they
will have discussions about it
and you should try to embrace these
discussions because it means that they
they want to go the extra mile to maybe
convince you about something or or to
share their experience with a certain
problem so there they're passionate
about it any and everybody in in a
project is working towards a shared and
goal we want to achieve success in our
project or in our products and when you
surround yourself with with passionate
people
the project will greatly benefit from it
so embrace these cultural differences
and also spend time with individual
people to make sure if everything is
going right with with them Howard with
their feelings within the project now
when you're working with with offshore
teams in different time zones it become
it can become more difficult but on the
other hand it can also be an advantage
because work will get done while you're
sleeping and who doesn't like that and
it that has worked on when you're
sleeping but communication might become
more difficult especially communication
with your customer will most of the time
not be possible so but what you could do
as a developer team a lot of developers
before working at night maybe do night
shift maybe ask the offshore team to do
a night shift as well and then you can
work together but that doesn't mean that
you need to be working at night all the
time but it's may be a sign of respect
that you'd like once every so many weeks
or months in different cultures
communication can also be very difficult
because some words have different
meanings at different places around the
world the world of the S is the perfect
example for this a couple of years ago
when I was still working for Flemish
government I was explaining a generic
library that I created for something the
content of libraries not that important
and I was explaining it to to a team and
during the the explanation I asked do
you understand what I'm trying to tell
them I bring it across correctly am I
saying it right and always got response
yes very well done
I finished my explanation and then quite
almost immediately afterwards I get a
telephone call and people saying I have
no clue what you just said what do we
need to do and that's that's not more on
them it's a cultural difference between
what we are here in Belgium are used to
and but you can you can mitigate that
problem you can make sure you can make
this this yes explicit you can ask yes I
understood the problem I and I know how
the binary coupling works or just make
it very explicit this this is also a
really cool when you use instant
messaging
nowadays I believe it probably everybody
uses instant messaging
who here in the room does not use
instant messaging for work
there's two guys maybe should use
instant messaging because there's like
700 people who use it in you instant
messaging what's really cool about
buttons and messaging it is it's lowers
the thresholds to ask questions and you
don't need to ask the questions
specifically to one person you can ask
it to the entire team maybe you want
just something checked say for example
you have certain ID Singh oh I would
like to do this but is this the library
suitable for that um or is this unit
that's really covering what I'm trying
to do because I'm not entirely sure and
you get some immediate feedback and but
it's also a synchronous so you can ask
questions and maybe somebody will look
at it in the future not immediately and
so it will lower the threshold and you
can work together better as a team and
of course nowadays you can integrate
between your CI CD pipeline and tooling
like that so you know when your money or
both has completed successfully when
when it's deployed to a certain
environment maybe you can have like a
notification to your your testing team
saying a build was on would it be
possible to test this specific feature
automatically now it's also about the
preparing work especially with offshore
teams your your preparation might often
be the only means of communication that
they have with the business so this is
about creating like a technical design
this is what we're trying to achieve
making sure that there's user stories
with the correct subtasks that they can
pick it up and work on that as well this
is very important to make sure that
people know what they're doing because
it can be very annoying if you start in
the morning you're very eager to stop
working on the project you look at the
sprint backlog and you see oh there's
like no I don't know when I have this
what's what's happening so make sure
that your user stories are well-defined
that there's acceptance criteria do a
definition of ready do a definition of
them and that people can really um do
cool things on the projects and once
you're that I very I find very important
is that everybody is a member of the
team I had a project manager in the past
and I'm obviously not going to call his
name but he really traded the offshore
development team it was a Polish
developer team like like cheap labor is
like just make sure that they get sent a
bunch of work and and they're
responsible for it and if it doesn't
work out we'll just get more people
that's really not a pleasant way to to
me to work as a technical eats should
really really make sure that everybody
is treated the same way both the good
parts and the bad parts when somebody
screws up and needs to make sure that
that unit that he knows or that she
knows what went wrong and how can make
sure that it doesn't happen in the
future
don't let this video only take away from
my talk but it's perfectly possible on
instant messaging fire that a private
message to become very angry at someone
estimating is hard
do any of you know douglas hofstadter a
couple of you okay there is a quote from
douglas officer about the host of this
law it always takes longer than you
expect even when you take into account
hospitals law estimation is hard when
you do it more often you will become
better at it but you will still get it
wrong from time to time I like to say
that mastering estimation is Alyssa's
journey it's a lifelong journey and it
might set you apart because your
colleagues will appreciate you for doing
correct estimations it will be a sign
for professional stability and quality
work now how can you do this if you work
in a child project often nowadays people
are using or doing a planning poker and
in planning poker it's about defining
some kind of sequence most of the time I
think afib will not chase use but you
can define whatever sequence at you
you'd like and then people sit around a
table and you have somebody who
functionally explains what needs to be
done and then he or she counts on say ok
3 2 1 and then everybody plays their
cards and when the cars plate are all in
the general and in the same order of
magnitudes then you can be pretty
confident about your estimation but if
you notice that for example somebody
places very high cards I know everybody
else is playing low cards that's good
because then you have achieved something
and then maybe the person who played the
high cards they can give some
explanation why they're giving it the
higher score maybe they know something
about the the problem that you're trying
to solve that everybody else doesn't
know there might be networking issues
there might be data based issues maybe
it's a really bad data model for that
typical UK use case and then you can
start a discussion and you will you can
play again afterwards maybe more people
play the hi carton or the person who
played the high card can play a lower
cards now in order to do this you also
need to set a baseline and then
generally when you when you read a child
books or you go to like the scrum master
certified steamy thingy that costs a lot
of money
they urge you to pick one as the
baseline I never quite got that um I
preferred set my baseline higher I will
say that the the the ten points at ten
points will be my baseline and at the
end point story is for example doing
crops on an existing table in the
database because when you're doing
smaller changes you can make more
granular more fine-grained estimation as
well it's my personal preference and
this insert' it's normal if you keep on
playing the cards and it turns out that
the numbers keep on being very different
then there might be a reasoning reason
for that as well and there's two ways to
cope with that you might need to do a
proof of concept some kind of technical
design to make sure that you understand
the problem for example when you need to
integrate your application with a
third-party service and it's it's it's
poorly documented maybe you need to do
proof of concept first to find out okay
this is how it works and even that might
not always be possible and then you just
go to your product owner after your
business say okay we know that you
really want to do this but we have no
clue how we are very eager to work on it
that were very uncertain we play the
very high cards and then it's up to
business to decide whether or not the
problem will be tackled
now as a technical leads you will also
often be asked to work on solutioning
and by solutioning I mean a customer
comes up to your company saying okay we
might want to do this but could you give
some some kind of estimation and how
much money is this going to cost us but
there might not be anybody who already
works on that project and I like to use
the above formula it's just called
three-point estimating it's it's not
something that I invented or something
where you do an optimistic a best guess
and a pessimistic estimation and then
you just used your buf formula to
calculate the weighted mean and when you
do this it's very important that when
you
make certain assumptions that you
document these assumptions because there
will be known unknowns like we don't
know how to communicate with a third
party service but there will also be
unknown unknowns so something happened
and we don't really know what happens
and you need to factor these in when
you're doing this kind of solution
estimations and what I also like to do
is adding a certain percentage does not
need to be 20% and although I use that
most of the time for testing for for
debugging for polishing and for
documentation maybe you have a formal
delivery delivered documentation you
also need to make sure that that's
included as well and because when you do
this kind of estimation it's important
that you take into account that you're
estimating for a team you're not
estimating for yourself for the best
possible time that you can do something
without being interrupted without any
weird things happening in the code this
really something that you're doing for
the team so it's important that you are
stay accountable for that as well
as I said it is difficult and any
estimate is better than no estimate if
it sparks up a discussion then it's
already a success you have a tendency to
become better at estimating when we're
estimating smaller parts of the the
project but we don't need to forget be
the overall bigger picture it might be
enough to get some ballpark estimate and
work with that as well and then of
course share these estimates with your
peers with your colleagues and get some
feedback from them and after the project
is done review their estimates so for
example be an estimated it would take em
20 Mondays and it turned out it was 19
so we did a great job or it turns out
those 42 that might not have been such a
great estimation and this will help you
to become better in the future
interfacing with the outside world I
needed to have pictured kittens on them
so they hear this communication with
non-technical people is different from
communication with technical people I'm
pretty sure that when we go to to the
hallway we can have a discussion about
about maven about Gradle about things
like that that we all understand each
other except like the noodle Network
things from from Katrina I did not get
that but that's just me that's not smart
enough but when you're communing
communicating with non-technical people
they generally don't really care whether
you're using maven or cradle or and
don't you sense but it's about making
sure that you draw some some some
comparisons that you make sure that
there's like you
this language and that everybody
understands so we're closely with your
customers try to detect the requirements
from them and continuously map their
requirements on the technical vision
that you're trying to establish as a
technically I don't think that you
should be the single point of compact
because then you will become a liability
as well another short story that I like
to tell I've been at the project a long
time ago about nine years ago and it was
a pretty easygoing project we had a lot
of mathematical algorithms within the
project but the customers was pretty
relaxed they were satisfied to it what
they were doing and so I was having a
good time but at a certain moment
there's like the fairy tale project the
project that has unlimited budget that
has the coolest technology that has the
best people and I applied for that job
it was with the same customer
governments and actually got the job so
as super happy I was going to work on
the fairy tale project and then my older
customer said oh no you cannot go
because you're the only one who knows
the algorithms in the code and it's like
oh so I've become a liability now and I
will never allow it to have that that
had to happen to me again as well so
make sure that you involve different
people in certain parts of the
application that you have a shared
knowledge of the tool that you're using
so you should not be the single point of
contact but maybe it should be the first
point of complex because in general most
people especially developers they don't
like to be interrupted all the time so
that's something that you need to cope
with as well the magic words no I've
noticed that's a lot of the time I have
a tendency to say yes to everything yes
we can do this yes sure we we can begin
build this that's not always a good
thing because you're making sometimes
you will be making decisions for the
team and so you should be able to say no
when people come to you with unrealistic
expectations like can you build this in
in in two hours of time you should say
no if it's not possible so when the
expectations are not realistic really
say say no and then the last tip of the
day is facility in Asia our teamwork
just a quick question is who is using a
gel in in their projects right now so
maybe scrum or Kanban
who's not using a gel just using
something else okay that's that's a
minority this is not talking about H I
also don't have the time anymore to to
go into detail but when you're making an
when you're doing a project in an age on
what manner make sure that you have a
backlog that you've a prioritized
backlog do Sprint plumbing so that you
can make sure that the developers know
what they need to be doing during the
project use burndown charts
retrospectives to know what went right
and what went wrong an important your
team strengths is not a function of the
talent of of individual members it's a
function of their collaboration Vanessa
T and mutual respect so if you have read
the Phoenix the Phoenix project don't be
Brent but just facilitate an awesome
team make sure to have a good time again
we have probably one of the coolest jobs
out there so just have a good time with
your team members and with that I would
like to thank you for your attention
I've heard I have two minutes left for
questions you might hear I'm quite sick
so it's better to ask it from from over
there not come too close to me unless
you don't fear my germs
