we're at Everett CK in the heart of
London and I'm here with Jack he's gonna
talk about performance tuning and what
you learn so 10,000 performance shooting
tips 10,000 tips to clarify services and
you had time to read all of this
I've time to read a lot more than them
so how do I have a monkey newsmen and I
read a lot of articles as I read
probably 30 articles a month man and of
those only about five or six and the one
that I select the newsletter and I
extract the tips just from all so yes a
lot more than that
but it's you know I liked it and that
there's some repetition obviously
because different people say things
slightly differently bit pretty much
same thing but I would say there's a
good two three values different planning
tips in there Wow
so that's that's a lot to when you pay
for the performance problem that's a lot
to take in
yeah it's the wrong approach what I
learned is what we're talking about is
that it's not the solution that you want
to focus on its steps and analyzing the
problem and honestly once you've figured
out what what the problem is it's a
search away from the solution for me now
I need to know yeah it's brilliant so
you teach people to catalogue as it
where their problems are classified yeah
so I first I'm getting to classify
problem and then I explained all the
tools that they can use to identify
exactly what causes and the rest of it
is it you know it's a modern programmer
a modern develop there is one one record
to use to search the internet or
somebody else's focuses not everyone
knows obviously there's some stuff that
has never been done before but 90% of
what you've done if it's a difficult
issue somebody else has had that and
somebody's talked about it maybe they
don't give you the full solution because
maybe they couldn't
quite right but you know then there's
lots of information out there okay so
how do you go about classifying a
problem okay so what I explained is that
you want to first of all understand what
is achievable and what is not not
achievable what is what is what is
achievable reasonably achievable and
what is an outlier but it's going to be
very expensive to achieve yeah that's
that's really clear I mean we've got
examples of Google CERN and the hedge
funds you know and I can explain so I do
my talk in the pocket explain the
example I gave there which is not very
high concurrency or a very low latency
or a huge amount of data so take huge
amounts of money and resources to solve
again if you need to know where your
reasonable boundaries and I explained
exactly where that is but I explained
was completely achievable with modern
technology in a modern environment where
you know it's like in your company
anywhere from two guys up to 20,000
slides to arrange yeah what what what
you can achieve so that that tells you
what's reasonable to do and then the
next step is if you have a problem
knowing what the target is so it is a
target within the reasonable achievement
area or is it outside each machine have
your metric the metrics come look all
right okay so so so you actually you
need to know coming if the target is I
need to respond to this 100 milliseconds
and it's taking 200 seconds you know so
there's a problem and you need to know
what the target is good if it's 200
milliseconds and target is 500 a second
my problem so that's that's the target
you need to know you need to know what
what is it that I'm expected to achieve
for my application what is it that's
reasonable to achieve in my application
as long as it's reasonable
but any expectations you know there then
the next step is apply the metric check
so that's what you want and then a a
very detailed flowchart from the Oracle
guide which I referred to navigation and
it's like it's a huge flow chart you
know the size of this if you print it
out and you can actually read it yeah
and it tells you exactly what to what to
look for which metrics to generate all
that
that's one slider okay okay so picture
we do there I just give him the
reference for that one because that's
not one my talks about my talking about
them what I do is I look at the most
common problems people had over let
people have explained what that these
are the problems so they look for
surveys oh that's your most common
performance problem memory problems and
and I've accumulated all those travelers
will the top coming problem and I give
you the tools and the techniques to find
the cause of those produce all the time
Kennish common problems and then at the
end of my talk here doing all right you
can put right at the neck the next step
is just searching for the solution and
once you got the problem the solution
will be here that sounds like a really
good conference talk because you
pretended people with this framework yes
and and I'm I'm really not looking at
the outliers so we have a lot of talks
and a lot of our conferences which are
focused on the outline because that's
really interesting to know how you
manage to get one microsecond latency
using a you know hardware whatever it is
or or you slipped out the operating
system and met done thread affinity for
you to your quarters with your threads
and all that's really interesting
yeah but like there's a hunger companies
worldwide that move those techniques and
there are more programmers who can do it
but now our companies are move back and
I think that's more on matching service
and most of the 10-million Java program
we need the technique I'm talking about
which is all the common problem so
that's I like to repeat that kind of
kind of
tool sets so that I'm addressing what
most people the problem that most people
have rather than the really interesting
problems that everyone wants to hear
about but they can't actually use those
segments anywhere very good make it
through it replace it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
