each cache without his element so we're
going to talk specifically about the
each cache api's has they've been
reworked for version 3 and the way I'm
going to do that is I'm going to use
simply the pet clinic application from
the Spring Framework and what we're
going to do is I've already turned off
all the caching using each cache 2x and
I'm going to replace it with caching
using the H cache 3x and so the
different way you can interact with the
edge cache both at the configuration but
also inside your application and then
we'll move on from there so the
application is pretty simple you have a
home you can search for owners if I
search for some owners and I go look
into my IDE
I see that I have hibernate queries that
are emitted and if i refresh or research
again I see that I have more queries
emitted and so the first thing we're
gonna do is we're gonna move the find
owners to cash the result of the search
so in order to do that I did a number of
limited modifications to the application
itself one of them is I know have each
cash 3 1 3 1 3 on the classpath and in
the application the property's one thing
that I did is that I made sure that we
see one logging only and for the rest we
will see hibernate in debug so that we
can see the queries that pass by it's
gonna be a demonstration for showing
that caching works when you don't see
them anymore and I've got each cache
logging on info because after all that's
the whole point of the session is to see
what each cache does so from there what
I need to do is I need to go into the
application and I need a cache manager
bin
so I'm simply going to inject it using
the FBI's cache manager
from each cache and the way I'm going to
build this cache manager beam is simply
by using the fluent API which we provide
for configuration so I'm going to do a
new cache manager and that's not the one
I want I want the one with a builder
okay let's you study imports for
readability and on my cache manager
builder for a moment let's be basic and
just add a cache it's going to contain
owners search so that's the way I name
my cache and then I did a cache
configuration so for this sorry I would
have found that later so I need my
configuration here and what I'm
specifying is the key type the value
type let me close that so that we've got
more space and then sizing the cache
which are all the mandatory attributes
that you have to specify when you want
to create a cache the key type and the
value type it's because each cache 3 is
the first version that embraces generics
but not only do we want to help you at
compile time but we also want to help
you at runtime making sure that your
cache never contains stuff you don't
expect and know that I have my added
cache I can simply I can simply build
the cache manager true so that it's
initialized immediately and I can return
it and that's it I would have been I can
work with so know what I'm going to do
is I'm going to move into the service
implementation where I want to use that
bean
I'm going to inject it and once it's
injected what I want to do is I want to
get the cash on it so it's the owners
soft cash and I have to repeat here the
the key type and the value type in order
to make sure that I'm talking to the
expected cash and the reason this is
repeated is also because with Java
generics and the fact that they are
rarified at runtime if you don't have a
concrete class instance to work with
you've lost most of the time and so that
gives me another search cache which I
wanted as a field there that's it now of
course what I really want is a cache
that contains a collection of owner and
again by doing that we're hitting nasty
Java generics because of course it tells
me that the types are incompatible and
so I'm having to cheat here and that's
unfortunate but that's what happens
whenever you have multiple levels of
generics which is the case because here
the value is our collection of something
so let's go over this and what we want
to do is instrument this method find our
number last name so that we can get
cashing working so the first thing I'm
going to do is I'm going to extract to
extract what the p+ e returns split that
into the Declaration and the assignment
and replace the initial value by my
phone of search cache on which I do a
get with the list with the last name and
if that result is null then I have to go
to my repository then I have to make
sure that I update the cache properly
and I
find any reader in my owners so let's
see if that works we stopped in a tear
on the application we now see that the
cache manager has created a cache so
that's what we expected
we can find owners if I find owner I
have the same result as before I went to
the database but of course if I go back
I've cleared my logs
and I search again except with the same
string come on look this time well yeah
of course I have the heat because of the
query that used all capitals but
otherwise you see I'm no longer loading
the two owners from the database they're
properly loaded from the cache so a few
things first of all these put methods
for people that were familiar with the
previous each cache API is from the 2x
line you had to create an element which
was a wrapper for some kind of metadata
on the mapping as you see it's gun so
that's why each cache out of his element
you no longer have to interact with an
element and the element into X are the
number of problems being mutable being
the biggest one because you could
effectively change metadata which would
then be overwritten by the cache anyway
so that was a bit of weird construct but
now it's gone and you no longer interact
with that it has one downside which is
that you no longer can do per mapping
expiry on insertion but we'll discuss a
little bit the expiring contract that eh
cache provides and you'll see that it's
possible to emulate the same with each
cache 3 so by the way this is actually
an interesting question what I did here
is I'm now permanently caching the
result of a search and so if I were to
click on a user on an on an owner edit
it and change the last two digits of the
number go back here
so if the owner again nothing has
changed so that's a bit unfortunate but
that's the problem you get with caching
the moment you copy the data elsewhere
you have to work to make it consistent
again and making sure you don't grow out
of out of sin completely so one one way
of doing that which is pretty direct is
just to make sure that we use expiry on
the values we put in the cache so that
after a while an entry a mapping will
become invalid will be cleared from the
cache and you'll have to hit the
database again reload and read out the
content of the cache so here what we're
going to do is we're going to use time
to idle no sorry time to leave that's
better
time to leave of 60 seconds
so if you use static imports it reads
better so that's just the simple thing
to do in order to configure one of the
predefined experice that ships with the
H cash three you have a time to leave
expiration so that means any mapping
that makes it into the cache will be
valid for sixty Seconds unless it is
explicitly removed or evicted but
otherwise it is valid for sixty Seconds
I'm not gonna restart the application
wait 60 seconds to show you it's expired
trust me of course one thing we did now
is we did the whole configuration using
Java but you may require the
configuration to happen in a different
format because you want to externalize
it and you know that each cache add each
cache to X add an XML configuration
format so what we're going to do is
we're going to replace this
configuration with the matching XML
configuration because eh cache 3 also
has an XML configuration format although
like the edge cache to API it's a
completely new x SD that breaks from the
edge cache to X 1 so the way we're going
to do that is simply by creating an XML
file
and I have a template to cheat in order
to have to get all my declarations and
so what I'm doing here is simply
declaring a cache of course I need it to
be named the same way as the other one
I want my expiry time to leave unit are
seconds 60 of them and I want a heap
size of 10 and the benefit of using XS
these that you've seen it flew pretty
much from the keyboard because the IDE
can help you show you what's needed and
and then it goes very quickly and that's
the strict equivalent configuration as
the one you find here so it is a gain
cache manager that contains a single
cache it's a lie I forgot two things
which is the key type needs to be string
and the value type Whitney which needs
to be collection that's not strictly
equivalent so now what we can do is move
away from the Java configuration and use
this XML file I'm going to use a cache
manager based on an XML configuration
and XML configuration I'm going to do a
get resource and that's my
each character XML file and the one
thing that you need to pay attention of
is you saw that we were using a build
true with the Friant pattern here if you
use the configuration XML configuration
way of building your cache manager you
have to call you have to do the
initialization but otherwise start the
application and we have a working
situation as before the only thing you
see is that we're loading an XML file by
default we lock that an info so that you
know which configuration file has been
loaded in each cache 2x it was really
important because we had the concept of
default config file we no longer have
that concept but we still believe it's
important for you to know exactly which
config file gets loaded in case you've
got multiple switching back to the
application
I again search my owners as usual the
first search properly hits the database
and if I start again
I no longer have a hit but I still got a
result out of the cache so we've just
moved away from programmatic
configuration to XML configuration now
one of the features we had in each cache
2x was the ability to use the disk so
that you could store a larger number of
mappings on the disk and potentially
also when you restart your application
still have these mappings available so
let's do that the only thing you need to
do is know that you have more than one
resource so multiple deals in each cache
you need to specific specify them inside
a dedicated resource tab and what we're
going to do is we're going to use the
disk I have enough disk space so one gig
of data is way more than enough for the
example here but that gives you an idea
I mean one gig is obviously small but
that's discs so you can grow pretty much
as you want and in order for this to
work there is one thing you have to
specify which is the place where you
want the data to be in and that's it
one thing before we get started with
that you see here I'm using the
classical property substitution style
and that's a new feature from each cache
three one three it is not only allowed
here in this field but it's effectively
allowed in any location that accepts the
dollar and the curly brass braces
characters and so that means pretty much
anywhere you've got text so we could use
that for the key type it's a bit we have
to use it there but it didn't cost us
anything
but it also means it's not yet available
for numbers um if you believe it's
important for your use case please drop
an advice on the mailing list we're
ready to listen to that it's it's not
that it's very complicated to do it's
just that the initial use case which is
for directory pre evident was not so
clear for values and and things the only
place where it would be forbidden is at
the alias level here because we're using
XS d IDs and these prevent the usage of
dollar and curly braces and at the same
time if the name of your cache is a
parameter that starts to be really weird
so let's restart the application
and then I'm getting an exception what
the heck happened well guess what I was
expecting that the message as you see is
no see Eliza phoned for type java.util
collection while you're moving away from
the heap you're going to disk there is
no option there is no magic in eh cash
in order to put stuff on the disk we
have to use some kind of serial form it
needs to be a blob of bytes we can't
store anything else we can no longer
have stuff there that's under the
garbage collector can be moved around
etc so in order to do that each cache
provides a number of default utilizers
for some of the common types long floats
strings and it also provides a
sterilizer for everything that
implements serializable but here what we
have in our cache is a collection and
the collection is not serializable by
default so we have to tell each cache
how it can serialize this collection and
the way you do that is by implementing
the serializer API interface the
serialization interface is a generic
interface which provides three methods
and we'll start from the bottom it has a
civilized method that takes a T which is
the object who you want to serialize and
returns a byte buffer which will then be
used to store that data wherever it
needs to be stored it has the invert
method read which takes the byte buffer
and we expect you to return a T and it
has a performance sensitive methods
equals that allows you to implement a
smarter equality if your serialization
scheme permits it if we work Java 8
compatible which we're not yet cash 3
still Java 1 6 so that it can work with
the maximum number of applications out
there and this would be a very good
candidate for a default method in the
interface and the idea here is that
instead of having two fully digital eyes
this value before relying on Java
quality you can maybe look on
at the first few bites and already know
that stuffs are not equal or in the
opposite that they are equal so writing
a civilizer is not very very exciting
and not something that I wanted to spend
time on here so I have one that I wrote
I'm delegating to the default Java C
Eliezer from eh cache
it's called compact because we do some
tricks in order to reduce the space of
civilized objects but pretty much what
I'm doing is I'm transforming the
collection into a novelist which is
realisable of flat owners which is my
own type just a struct effectively and
instead of the entity from from the
domain model from the application and so
the only thing I have to do in order to
make this work because the string here
is not a problem
that's realizable and we even have a
custom see Eliza for it is I need to
specify my sterilizer there and that's
it and now I can restart my application
and show you that it works um when we
looked at making serialize a a feature
of the each cache API we didn't knew in
advance but we realized in the end that
this is kind of a killer feature if you
have very very performance sensitive
sterilization problems and you really
want to use much larger caches outside
of heap because this is where you get
the chance to be better faster because
the smaller your representation is the
faster we get to copied and the most
performant your serialization
deserialization is well the less time we
spend doing that so here my application
is started I'm going back to it finding
my owners again first time I'm hitting
the database as expected and the second
time I'm no longer editing the database
there is one more thing happening here
which is the fact that you've got
multiple tiers in the
- you've got the disc which is where we
wrote the mapping when it was put the
first time but R is also the heap and
now there is the search result I've
looked up once has effectively been
copied on heap once and every subsequent
access I do - it comes from the heap so
you're no longer paying the price of
this realization from the disk and this
consistency between the different tiers
is part of the smartness of eh cash
that's where the complexity happens but
it's also what provides if you manage to
get on heap a hop a hot set size that
matches your application you'll get the
most benefits out of the cash while
still having the capacity of holding
much more data in case you've got a
weird query coming in that requires a
less frequent access entry however one
thing we've seen is that I restarted the
application while it worked but it had
to load if I don't want that if I want
to be able to keep the values between
application restarts I have to add
persistent true which tells eh cash in
case the cash manager and the caches are
closed properly that it can keep the
data for the next run of the application
so I'm running the application once
hitting my search hitting again no more
database access and what's interesting
is now if I stop and rerun I will no
longer hit the database at all even
though I've restarted the application
yay it works so that's also one way of
when you restart a large number of nodes
which may have some reference data
cached on them you do not want all of
these nodes to at the same time hit your
database load all this reference data
and so if the reference data is pretty
much static which is not the case in the
example here but could be in your
application then that's a good strategy
to have instead of loading it from the
database from the system of tackled from
a web service who knows you
just read it from the cache from the
disk so that's it for features now let's
be honest I'm not very spring friendly
so far because we ended up having to
write a whole bunch of code here which
is really really plumbing code so let's
move back to something which is much
more spring and use annotations so here
I'm saying that the method is cashable
and the cache is own of search if I do
that it means I no longer need this line
I no longer need this guy no longer I
mean that night that line either and on
the application side effectively I don't
need all of that because there is
caching support in spring boot enable
caching that's what I need and I just
need one last thing in my application or
properties what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna use the fact that we have
full-blown J cash orgies at 1:07 support
in each cache by just changing this to
using the G cache support inside spring
and so I'm good to go
I can stop and rerun our crap exception
again what's happening this time cache
owners search specifies key value types
use get cash strain class class that's
actually something which is about to
change in the first maintenance 3ds of j
cache but currently what the
specification says is that if you use a
get cache method with just the name of
the cache then the cache can't be typed
it must be using object object as the
key and the value types and if you if
not you have to use the specific method
that requests the key type and the value
type they're about to relax that in J
cache one one but what happens
here is that the spring code in the
method here effectively doesn't pay
attention sorry where am I
there doesn't pay attention to the
parameter and the return type and even
worse than that it effectively does not
use the string it uses a key which is
compounded which can be even expressed
inside the annotation so there is no
direct reference there so what we gonna
have to do is we're going to have to no
longer specify the T here and here move
to object but keep our serializer
because we know that still are the
values that gonna end up there so I'm a
bit cheating there I'm no longer as type
safe as I would like to be but that's
one of the prices to pay when you use
such a high level integration via
annotations and I also need to delete
that because otherwise I'm going to have
a failure from a good reason for a very
good reason actually it's because I just
changed my key and value type and each
cash will make sure that if you change
such fundamental cash configuration
options it will tell you that whatever
it finds on this is incompatible while
here what it will do is it would say oh
the cash is not persistent and I see
files on disk I'm just gonna forget
about them delete them and start the app
and so I'm back in the application again
hitting the database and if I go back
here I no longer hit the database so it
works
it's just that what I did was move away
from a very explicit very dependent on
the eh cache api's configuration system
to something that is completely
transparent and potentially through the
G cache usage allows you to switch
caching implementations why would you do
that I don't know but you can
and I've got two minutes left let me
show you a few more things that you can
do here first of all you've got a fib
support so here again the idea is to use
more cash content but outside of the
heap so it's not under garbage
collection so you can grow that I have a
MacBook Pro only 8 gig of ram but
technically this is the kind of places
where that's the highest we tested 6
terabytes and it works of course I would
not recommend having such a small heap
you would still want to have a hot set
that makes sense but that's a way of
getting a whole lot of cash content for
no added maintenance cost on your JVM
because it's not the GC doesn't touch
that it's all maintained by edge cache
all done for you this technically
doesn't use unsafe also so we have safe
on that front but we've got other unsafe
uses in the edge cache so that's one
thing and then of course the next step
would be to move clustered but I won't
have time in a minute so I'm just gonna
open up for questions on the API is or
on the education general cool yep yes
this is no valid configuration what
happens if you do that though is that
you have to pay the serialization and
this here is a fan mostly the
digitalization price each time but if
you have an efficiency réaliser it's
it's one way of doing
caching with the smallest impact
possible on the heap of your JVM I'm not
gonna try to launch that it's not gonna
work but I can show it that way
which one you don't you know I didn't
write one okay
sorry you tried to launch too quickly so
I'm going through the database as
expected clearing the log there so that
works and it's pure heap caching there
is that the reference is not kept on
heat yeah yes yeah
avi pass the exact same requirements as
disk because you're moving away from the
heap so we can't just pass around a
reference to your object we have to
compete that's where I stand up Java
limitation I would say okay let's see
