little bit for some people because I
think it was a room next class a little
bit more time so I try to finish in time
maybe hurry too fast please raise your
hands and spot me okay my name is Papa's
widow my Twitter handle here
and I'm happy to be here and heaven on
my agenda I might have a few points only
a few points first short that you
touched about myself when I start with
some formation of why I like Kotlin why
I like the Java EE and what comedy is
because calling me is not a project that
Java EE or Takada he I just invented to
turn to make to show that it's easy to
use cotton together the shopping even
three and the biggest part will be some
high scoring so I don't know wholly want
to talk about Syria to start to show it
to you life I work for a huge company in
Switzerland and huge companies usually
have huge display past and this one the
talk business if you repeat what I show
you today
it's not all for it I am a software
engineer I'm hoping for CSS insurance
company I work for a lot of open source
project I working as an agent coach so I
have an teaching suite or coaching suite
the two teams or two teams in our
company I'm in the past time that sure
one day you become teaching in the
Technical College so it's a lot and
that's meeting back today at conferences
to Train I hope you understand
everything and are writing articles and
books my first book in English will be
available soon and I'm a community
leader organizing the Sun for the
contributors host projects
I remember the board of the Jerusalem
tokens was used in the eastern line of
cefoxitin seriously okay and this is my
book well I hope being available in the
third quarter this year it's about
cognitive development for writing full
stack magnifications was caught them and
two reacted by the way all the slides
will be available to download so at the
end the last slide the secure code and
there's a link so
take pictures there you can down
everything I start this talk with the
buzzword bingo too much like passwords
when I need people and I tell them my
big monolith they look at me and I own
know you need the money right so one of
them I bet by default today's we talk to
people every time too and also they tell
you all the problems in the head we can
salsa gives micro-services all your
problems are okay let me start we might
be services when you start going micro
services you have different types of
problems when you talk to some people
they start doing our services until
today I had absolutely no idea what the
difference is between micro service was
now the services all such stuff and of
course if you talk to people about
software development and having third
sentence it's about power
just because it's cool well it is they
show you why and if I tell the people
that I work with charming
even more Abed as I only know said son
such a wood and heavy fragrance so
bloated he catches also huge metre long
time to start and oh my god and that has
not to be the case often is a case if
you do not know how to use it in a very
distant manner why toddler in my opinion
content is a very pragmatic language
it's statically typed it's object
oriented it's comfortable to Java you
can use any Java library available and
if you know Java it's very easy to learn
there are only a few differences the
using writing cotton feels natural after
a few days and of course a very nice
thing is it does not only compile Java
byte code to compile Java code even when
you are using inside of content our
streams and whatever so you can use them
on a language Aslam as it streams and
compiled 2006 bytecode and run this one
out identification survey
company and often few companies to not
update everyone certification summary so
maybe you're a little bit behind and
another my thing which is relatively new
it's it's compilation to Java but
usually we call it transportation so it
translates Java bytecode there is a
cognate Otis or the Cochran code to
JavaScript so you can write client
applications and content to and you can
compile to native code so we have one
language which complies Java byte code
to JavaScript and to native code to make
applications Windows limits even to
Ohio's applications and our interesting
fact is to compile to nature's it uses
the LLVM compiler spec there you can
compile to web pack so he can run
compiled code inside your browser but in
my we need the biggest positive point
for coupling is it's not invented by
people who invented languages it was
invented by people will design tools so
the tween so-called is very good often
you have a new language and it needs
time for all the tooling to support
these languages including was at the
same time so you have very good support
of course in J and see the NY to include
Eclipse command-line everything works
if you look at cotton so the Texas
a little Java this is the main function
as you can see here the felt differences
did you start because it's fun to
develop consciousness cotton and you do
not need a class around it
so if you write a main function just by
the name foundry it will not be to read
it to the class and the sacred poem you
see is here we have some time to tie
this behind the name of Samaria
whereas this case enables a parameter so
first the table so parameter then echo
that's a type and if we look at the next
rose oh no that's not to Java 10 which
was heard recently but here you do not
have beautiful we had five event equals
administrate the compiler looks over the
string so he knows event is of type
string it is it's very very tight even
if you do not buy strings there and very
means is add value and then it is a you
do we cannot change it so we cannot
reassign something to event if we quite
that far peanut for variant then we can
really sign some other string to event
last line here is a print line for print
line we do not need to import it like
Java Java you can do the static import
or you have to write all the stuff down
system.out.print one here is just a way
and as you can see you have the template
string and it's also template spring you
can just use your variables use the
dollar sign develop before the print on
the dollar sign just escaped that's
basic quadrants of tux
oh that's right recognized is no city
code you can party city code on it will
work but usually your IDE will tell you
it's my mess
so you can't watch any quality little
not neutral if you if he try to create
classes it's comparable to drama it's a
class t-bird then the name of the class
and if you want to write properties for
the class in Java you would write for
example private string name etc
semi-live right it can turn Ascenta
whatever here it just provides a
properties inside as a constructor on
class desertion this will automatically
create get up you can specify will type
the Constructors you can even specify
contractors optional arguments and here
it will remain only get us if we create
no setups because it's be specify the
properties as well for value if you
would use var for some types of
properties and recreate a set of ours
and when you look there you have this
plane spectrum up here public is not as
safe it checks all the possibilities at
compile time so it is and every time
it's a suture we say that the name is
never not same as age but here is a
company where everyone works at a couple
can we maybe Paulo and to protec on that
the company can be null you have to
provide this explanation part there so
that means name and page cannot be the
company can be nice and if you want to
access company later you are forced to
do an eye check it's all driven by at
compile time a very huge difference to
Java is and if you add Java in Java the
clouds you can extend that class
everyone can extend that class if you do
not want anyone to extend that class who
made that has finally because it's open
by default in competency other way
around concocted is closed by default so
you cannot extend a Content class if you
want to allow someone to extend a class
we have to specify the own fever in this
case open class person now anyone can
extend the class so this is very
important for Java EE you will see it
and very nice we have data classes very
cool feature here I write data class
person was the same as it was he before
I was named age company and that could
be done and it automatically do has a
constructor for me like this is Java
class so I can use a constructor here
provider data and the data class will
have of course get us for it it will
generate a two string method for me so
if I just print line the very end it
will print this here the name of a class
and authorities facilities so I had a
very nice readable to straight method of
course he will implement
and hashcode as well automatically other
compiler and it does a very nice feature
of data classes is I can copy data
classes I can create copies and similar
to cloning but different because it
really creates a copy of it and if I
call copy I can optionally provide
arguments and specify which where you
should it change that's a copy so in
this example I had what were you this
name age and company is mal and selected
one for name and age was copied and
company was set for the specified value
so the copy hunch is a really nice
feature you can even use it for Java
and no it's not a deep copy okay you can
have default values she has money a
small difference here you can specify
default values for example here let's
write down and if you do this you do not
have to specify that value and it's
enough to specify this too but you can't
specify the previous could you put an
error so you do not have to write all
these constructors on your own just
specify your properties and sandwich
properties are optional and specify
default values for the meal works for
parameters and you can use named
parameters so as I started before I have
my name and my age and here I have the
same but we'll named parameters if you
use many parameters it's you can use any
other unite we were forced to a specific
order and if you have for example a
constructor or if we have a method of
calling which has several into
parameters or several parameters
ever that sometimes is hard to read
because I need to know which what was a
third end in another part so you can
optionally use named parameters and you
know at any time in your code which
parameter means what we've seen string
templates my first example the string
template it's important to know that you
can call access properties so for
example to output the name I can use
Burma custom name and bottom about age
and will produce something like this and
sometimes if you have prepared it's easy
for the compiler to know well the very
end the property ends because here is
his base but sometimes your public
something together with no space and
adding more points also quite should be
printed so then it's not sure for the
compiler for the name of the variable
the name of the property ends then you
can pack them in these like curly braces
and if I will do this here it would
he'll just use a print line and here
just normally print print house but pain
like this but it's very useful the
second part is my favorite to do it on
his own and you have to tell them then
we have of course multi-line strings so
if you cut something together like HTML
whatever you can use three Kadesh parts
to start and end multi-line string
swings and you can even use street to
place inside of multi-line strings and
you can use of align it here at the
first row if you do not even have some
space
but of course says a remark that helps
you to trim the leading space and
prevents other spaces
we have citizens citizens in the
language you have much to live the
citizens on your own
in Java you create some instance
variable and if you create the object
you have talked a lot to synchronize etc
and here you do not need it you just
write object person controller class if
you say object it it isn't seen and
caught them make sure that has only one
instance and when there is only one
instance it does not make sense to call
some get instance over error method so
we use the signal like a class the
static methods for example here I have a
safe method and I just called person
controller but safe person control this
big P it's a ceiling so the instance is
available on the class name makes it
much easier this is everything you need
no more cell phone ization a very nice
feature of columns co-routines they are
pretty good I think about 20 years or
more
Google teams are a threat if you work
with the parallelization and often work
the threads to paralyze your work and if
you do this well after bed is very
expensive to spawn and with the
goroutines you can work in parallel but
not necessarily the Spence so you can
spawn for example of how with thousand
co-routines do we do this misreads your
computer will die but you can expose all
the coab routines or a million doesn't
matter
it moves a little bit like and ojs will
you know snow je s heads up please
that was no chance so many but in notes
is you have only one sweat we have some
kind of it it seems that everything
happens a parallel but we have only one
thread it's the same as coroutines
they share the sweats so they are very
lightweight and therefore are very fast
they are easy to use
I just use a Haitian keyword and I can
specify a sweat pool here and here we
create the list of ten price services
and I call price lowest price the price
method ten times ten different prices as
it currently and later on I can use on
the list some buying method I can
provide the lambda lambda
the curly braces who I just say it
motivate and this number I do not have
to specify a variable name if I do not
specify a very early name like a Java I
have the default period in a bit I could
write for example job and the arrow and
plan job dot wait we'll wait why the
variable name I have it that's all you
have you can very easily create builders
with cotton there are already a lot of
builders for example the HTML beta like
this so you can create HTML page content
using the keywords here and the good
thing is it's compile time safe if you
misspelled title it will not collide so
everything is checked as compile compile
time is what I'm saying is why they are
taxes no and you can create your own
types and videos for example if you want
to create SQL types a experience I think
there is one opinion or other stuff
please do so
there should be another boat covered for
the first parent I want to talk a little
bit about Java EE and why I think today
Japanese is a really cool Java EE I say
it's something like library management
as a service before I was using Java EE
in other projects I often had problems
with a class pass a class pass a we
netted a buoy to your project for
example Sigma yet another language for
your project set has a dependency on its
own to swallow that transitive
dependency and at the time you have two
different versions maybe of 12 on your
class class or three or four different
versions of Java then you can't have
them
crazy things have been depending on
which dois wins at runtime so you have
to keep track of it and you have to make
sure since you have only one version of
that library of every library in your
class pass you can do this with your
village to lubbers introduce excludes
and so on it is hard sometimes it's hard
and with if you focus on Java EE we have
only one pensee only the Java Java EE
dependency so even if it's katakana it's
still valid and this is only the API and
some vendors of the application service
I have to follow Phil's aap line and
 all needed libraries for example
they ship the how it's called here
jax-rs
and so on and all such stuff but then
you have to take
good that says only it's a correct
version of the class pass so you do not
have to take care of it
attend careful so well dependency with
cotton we need a second dependency for
Concord standard library but literally
everything we need today and it's ready
to use companion that means that every
the ven work of Education server
provides ready containers for daughter
even I am attorney time provides
containers this Oh clever tea and also
stuff to invite flight by Yamaha fish
and so on so you can rely on these
containers and your own container
usually happen two lines of code you say
ok I want to use the play on Michael and
I just copy my bar fight because it in
for a directory and you are done you do
not have to take care of installing Java
it's a container and so the implication
server startup scripts and so on it's
done personification so then if you look
at the layers of the image you have your
application menu has application server
Java Runtime operating system usually
there are much more layers between them
it's very simplified but the pub thing
is that replication is on top and it
should be as small as possible so only
your 4 or 5 no other dependencies and
that's important because to change your
application a lot if you are maybe 50
team and each one commits merely four or
five times a day you have a lot of bills
and if you create images huge images on
every bill because it spends a lot of
time doing this and so it's important to
to make sure that your application which
changes on every village has its own
layer and all the other stuff agenda
frequently and frequently not so often
has their secret layers and if you had
more dependencies for button all
dependencies please create a secret lair
for that because for example if you use
frameworks or whatever for your project
and they usually do not change ten times
a day but your application may change
ten times a day so please crazy secret
lair and another nice feature is this is
dominant so if I'm not satisfied with
magnification serve this in North or
maybe updates becoming slowly causes an
annoying bug which is not fixed fast
enough for whatever I can choose between
different types of application service
and this is only a selection they are
much much more and most of them are will
be closed or have all source
possibilities okay what do I need my
company company you won't find it
it's just a just a creation I put
together cotton and Java EE and then you
have some issues if you want to use
cotton together with Java EE because
Klaus is our final by default and
applications of us want to extend your
classes able to read proxies and you can
create you can mark your classes as open
but if you do so everyone is allowed to
extend your class and if someone is a
lot of excess of your class someone they
do it so it would be cool if it can stay
final but those applications well that
looks like Norman klas therefore we have
a plug in a plugin for the compiler and
this makes sure that all classes which
have this intentions here our made open
at compile time so your IDE looks at the
source code as you know how the classes
close nobody can extend it and then
compile time to make these classes open
so then at runtime your application so I
can extend them in creative process and
that's a very nice feature so your
teammates are still not able to
extension classes saying with
constructors if you have a class with
resources we will create one later
it needs a zero argument constructor and
if we create a zero argument constructor
anybody then use it same story and same
things as well in forward the no one
content and just configuration
specifying for example annotations and a
compile time it will be
sure that's a class with this
annotations has a zero argument let's
watch oh those are the two biggest
issues from cotton to use with Joey and
combat soft
okay enough slice from the first moment
that's do some live coding and see how
it works all together as cloning is
always my risky I hope in turn in the
work I vote my co-pilot over everything
whether if not you can just laugh or
maybe you can shout the solution to me
and let me show first what I would like
to trade with you I would write would
like to write to services what is a
handle service into various cubed you
call it and it just answers with hello
in your name but to make it a little bit
more complicated
it should talk to another service to see
how one service talks to another service
in this case a type service so they have
a service ask the times for all the time
because he could do it on its own just
for and then the monster back to the
user
contains hello the name of the user the
time and my it's a host name to see this
getting later because I want to scale of
three hosts so that we can see in the
output that the answers coming from
different hosts the Heather service will
be available from the outside the time
serves not only from the inside
and of course you can do this what I
show you today was common and Hawaii
you can do this Java Scala movie and EVM
language next you to that we do not have
to wait too long I prepare dancing I use
docker for my presentations for all
those containers dozen and I want to
create a perfect out with three nodes
and taka can do this on its own you can
$10 please create a mission sir Baca
mentioned create used to drive a little
box box and name the note
MGRS as a name and that means pas
commission will you use the litter box
driver which talks to the to the box as
a background in which you hate in
instance of a visual emission it will
install the operating system the
networking stuff SSH the keys and also
to our stuff for me and I have to do
nothing just wait a few minutes and I
can use different drivers I can use
drivers for Google cloud and Amazon for
digital ocean whatever and if I use
Albert Wireless for this services in the
Internet of course I have to specify my
credentials and then will create
same running instance on Amazon it will
install the operating system networking
as a stage is heresy for me absolutely
seamlessly I had to
nothing that's quite nice so I created
one note with a name MGR and then I
created three notes per surname note we
were one to enter three completely I
have four more stuff and you can look in
to the manager there will be a manager
info connotes the differences from the
manager you execute every command the
manager manages the whole class manager
never connect to the node to start some
services order okay and you look into
the manager when you initialize swarm
swarm is a proper internal cloud you say
initialize then you specify the external
address and this we created out now we
have a cloud running one node
and then there's a nice tool is called
visualizer
this is a baccarat command to execute it
it's a docker container I already
started it and if I open it in the
browser this is what it looks like
smaller of course at first only this one
here it's a really nice tool to
visualize on your notes then you can
join all the other motivated I created a
manager decorated three four nodes and
to want to connect them all together and
it worked out so you can ask the manager
for a joint token as far as education
against a cloud he tells you the token
then you log in to the note and then you
paste the command
mommy's focus won't join mines my scope
and the top here and the public address
of the manager to just paste it there
the complete amount is written to you so
if you ask the manager
it just pasted presidenta and done you
note we connect the manager authenticate
to the manager and be part of swarm
independently of version node is it can
be one who was on the error okay you can
verify everything there are commands to
list the nodes token on LS for this
talking in full force at the time it was
IP addresses if you like
and you have it when you end up in this
you so we had one manager and three
notes together in one swamp okay before
we now can create and create around our
services we have to write them and the
prep time only 15 is left okay
so I make a very short here my son just
switch
I think it's better not to to code
everything now because at the end come
to it in 15 minutes so I really go walks
through the code is human at first
created the time service the time
service has two classes we use Java EE
and when we use memory boy
why okay that we started to DJ maybe it
was annoying what's changing this
resolution no stopped asked me to stop
it
I did it to our webshop just before so
that's why I sound a little bit that's
right
view all yeah presentational wonderful
okay so if this case I want to provide a
restful api and I want to use Jax is
Jackson is built into Java EE so I do
not need additional dependencies I have
to configure it here in this case here I
have one class because I have to extend
the education class objects s and hey
you see x10 is not and that one extends
keywords stumped by a column it has no
difference between a class to an extent
or interface will implement to just use
the colon colon has annotations like
Java and trucks a s needs to consider in
application path in this case I named it
API that means when all the resources
are prefixed in the URL this API
so it starts with HTTP host name slash
API slash
everything else and that everything you
need to configure taxes and then I wants
to implement a resource this is a time
this was again it's a class extent
nothing it produces plain text when
individuals anything except for her
who's this case just plain text and the
path is time for the solve a complete
pass this slash API slash time and here
and specify a function
I couldn't get time it's a fast returns
a string so the return type specified
as a function equation before and we
can't get dr. s dosent this method will
be called when it get call is done to
the time this was and the only thing I
do here is local time now to straightly
and Harry can see you can just use every
Java class Java API Java framework
whatever and just use it there's no
special syntax or whatever translucid
classes and called functions there's one
difference which let me show you the
same example so what we have now is an
answer to a get request to slash API
slash time which may return then it will
date and time when we need talk a file
and his show will slice two lines you
just say please from pile my toe which
is provided by an Toyama company and
copy the time service four or five to
speak on so much that everything you
need the second source
say hello service it says again it has
to be configured search access has to be
configured it's exactly the same so
there's absolutely no difference but the
resource itself is of course different
again we have the clasp we have produced
plaintext there was this example I cut
the past annotation here hello Jillian
/ad I sketched at all
and here we specified that when it get
request comes in please execute this
function because function say hello I
want to extract a parameter from the
request so I use a pair of annotation
just from chat says so it will extract
the parameter and provided to me in my
name variable which is of type string
and I will return the string as a return
type at the end okay so then I want to
call it as a service because ahem
service internally codes the titles
therefore I need to type service and
here I can use again jackass and this
means I created value so it's immutable
time service of type web target here and
specify the time because here it's some
some problems was a time difference then
I just use a Nightbird access a new
client and as a target time service 8080
API time ok so I created the time
service a reference to the time zones
and every one every time to say
that is called I use the time so a
center request is a get request and to
come back I expect a string class job
traces attacks that's because in Compton
we had those sprinklers in Java we have
a straight class so now we have two
spring classes but here the because here
we are using Jack says they it wants to
return in Java string class and that's
what you do here that you just ended but
Java at the end so okay not the cotton
string class in Java string class for
the hostname I just used in a tetanus
can load loads hostname and then I reach
on a string say hello name from the
parameter new line time from the time
service at the third line is all stay
and that's heresy and when we then take
a look at the proper file it's the same
if he has a backup file only that we has
helped us here and that's everything we
need to build
and first let's do
we pray to wrap up assemble
okay and if we take a look we can now we
use a direct Bieber we can create now
the docker image with talk a bit we take
it
my friend is my username popping up like
my vagina and it's time service and the
docker file is okay to tell my son as a
type service of folder so directory now
we create the pocket image done the same
with the hello image her hands are
basically
hello service territory and take it as
hello service oops
so now we provide a free agent
we compile services we created two
dimensions so because the time service
is not available from the outside the
hell is own should then should talk to
each other and you have a very nice
feature your focus wall it's called in
network and overlay network you can
create as many more day networks as a
light and that's important when we start
our services we give our services in
name because if we run three instances
also times where it's on three different
house how can we find them baccala finds
of us
so if we go back here to the hello
service we see that we use no host name
we use the name of the service
boca has an integrated dns it knows
where all the instances are running and
in searching for an instance for um for
bodies according to this instance and
that it works with time services hello
service must under the same network
mobile to send missions the missions can
be anywhere out the world just the same
network and we can create a network with
the commas token network create drama
overlay on sandbox overlay needs mentor
it's on top of the real networks and if
you have the note one who will Club
antennas on one of your missions they
are more together in one network and
heavy command is executed as a manager
so I have to connect
manager I do this by talking mention SSH
to the manager and I'm there I pencak
want vodka that will create my store I'm
overlay boxed and it's created this is
just a Heche as a convocation I can do
poker Network s and here I see there is
a new network and it's available it's a
whole swarm now I can start my services
start this vain talkers who is create
please use a network first and the name
should be time service the name will be
used fine for TNS and please use an
image my prototype service we just
created
thanks executors
and while it closed the dimension
started it
let's look at salut it's a second
service because the second service
should be available from outside so we
need a port many use this copy this
paste it again press enter and if you
take a look at the visualizer Paradis we
will see one hello service advertisers
the green dot her means that they are up
and running and to cover here around his
redmond color and it's the same for the
same service to see the image tank and
updated and so on everything is there
okay
because he's the same on the command
line so he runs a manager cleaning
stalker service LS for list books
because this and this for this and we
have a list of our services we see that
it's replicated and we see that we have
one replica running of one so we won't
want we have one okay let's test it we
can use curl or Sabrosa or any other
thing I have a nice command-line utility
it's got HTTP so I make an HTTP request
to http this is a public IP address of
the master contact 181 / api's - hello /
what stays Bucharest I press ENTER and
this is the answer it's okay and as we
can see here on the lower right corner
it expected the name Otto said you are
look it has an actual time and this is
the host name host names on docker are
always measures ok but also spots and
also is called the time service and that
works but when we develop applications
today off we have some kind of scaling
and often be it's difficult to test all
these gaming features we need to go to
service to test all the scaling stuff
with a head of poker and aa swarm and
VirtualBox we can do this locally we can
test all the scaling features locally in
our computer therefore we can just say
bogus' service update well because three
palaces that tense poker now I want
sweet instead
censors execute the commands always from
the master oh that's both my computer
not very good
this is a master as a manager okay
and now let's take a look here is a
visualizer and now we see we have three
instances of Health Service money and
talk about searching for notes with
capacity so he is looking at all the
hosts how many containers are they
running how much memory does is and then
it's starting
then containers for nodes which has not
lost so much to do this - the same is a
time service cross dancing time service
boom
here they are so it's pretty fast
it is a start-up of of the application
server inside the containers pretty fast
now let's test it
HTTP pod and if you look at the host
name it starts with p21 this host name
stands for self a this host name is d1
again b27 ad1 recall has something we
have automatic load balancing this was
part from one body already built into
this one so you can't test the scaling
however your database behaves that you
have no crashes notarization issues with
your application so it's a very good and
from time to time you need to take some
of the notes off to have the operating
system or whatever so you have to tell
you since you want to take it off and
there is a drain comment so you say no
cannot update as a bility drain manager
in this case i wanted to raise a manager
let's go as a manager we have one
container we exceeded this commandments
which beg fast the container was killed
no more containers of the manager now we
have only two hidden services party 1/3
doctor recognizes and then it looks
around two hosts and it will start at
third one and averages so token always
twice to fulfill our expectations or our
moves we defined that we once we will
because and he takes care of it and if
you want as a manager to be available
again must note after you do some stuff
then you can send it changes again so
that is the bhagavad in my opinion to
serve flow using pragmatic language
using easy API swallowing like using
things like talker makes your basic
writer very nervous and code you have
fast built times because you have only
few lines of code you do not build
ascetic charms on have you built only
small war files you talk I let reproduce
will be deployments he has the same
initial deployed in your local measure
for testing when your test servers
integration service production service
and so on and it's very easy to scale
it's not only a production part on your
testing measures Romany Road machines -
so you can easily test all the scary
stuff on your own mission
and I my opinion you can be very fast in
this stuff so we can focus on your
business code and you do not have to
think too much about all the technical
stuff around it because am I on my money
with business code and not was doing
technical type stuff so I need to focus
really on creating more business go back
way the less I have to spend on all the
other stuff
