London in devoxx UK and I'm talking to
you Matthew a data scientist is giving a
talk later about R&amp;amp;D visualizations so I
asked you about some concepts instead of
ask you about your chocolate epic ok so
we chatted about data science unbox and
about what that involved and I wondered
if there was what the first thing you
encountered when you were studying data
Sciences the first thing that I
encountered well I started studying data
science back at Iowa State University I
was working on double degrees in
computer science and philosophy with a
minor in economics and I found that I
had a tremendous interest working with
data I guess I kinda have to take a step
back and mention that I was also a
professional software developer for
several years before I went back to
college to essentially get my computer
science degrees and finish up a few
other degrees as well so while I was
there I found that was very interested
in working with data I found that the
machine learning and the artificial
intelligence focus of my degree was the
most interesting parts of what I was
doing so I really wanted to essentially
become a data scientist or data science
consultant but this is before the term
data scientist even existed so as soon
as I got out into the the job market
again with my new degrees and I started
working as a consultant I read this
article that talked about the emergence
of data science and the data scientist
and I'm like oh my god that's that's
exactly what I want to be doing
so I took my consulting like developer
consulting career and kind of spun it
into a data science consulting career
instead so now I do data science
consulting I do education in the data
science space I do a lot of work with
are I'm working with Python as well
machine learning artificial intelligence
cognitive services you name it all the
interesting stuff what's the most
interesting thing that you learn about
it that's quite a wide question I'm the
most interesting thing you learn when
you start on this journey um well when I
started on this journey I think the most
interesting thing I learned about was
neural networks
I found neural networks tremendously
interesting but at that point in time
when I was studying them in college
there were certain limitations to them
we didn't have deep neural networks yet
and so the fact that they were kind of
using a very simplified version of their
model of the brain was of interest to me
but as they've moved further and further
along and we now have hierarchical deep
neural networks they're finding that the
the models in the way that they do
feature extraction and the hierarchical
organization seems to be mirroring the
way the brain may actually work so both
the neuroscientists and the computer
scientists working in very separate
spaces seem to be slowly converging like
with the neuroscientists and their
predictive coding model of the brain and
the the data scientists or computer
scientists with their deep neural
networks so I find it tremendously
interesting a new collaboration yeah yep
oh it's brilliant so in terms of things
that you've learned and neural networks
and what is kind of coming up for you in
basic science oh it's the next thing
that you need to learn about or you need
to keep on top of um well for me I think
the deep neural networks is where the
most interesting stuff is happening
right now
um all of the big breakthroughs in the
last few years have all been involving
deep neural networks and deep learning
of some kind prior to that it was
essentially ensemble learning like when
you combined a series of relatively weak
classifiers or regression algorithms
together and had them kind of do a
majority weighted vote or some kind of
aggregation on their predictions that
was very powerful but now with the deep
neural networks foreseeing breakthroughs
in areas that that most people thought
would be I think several years out yet
for example in the last few years all of
the speech recognition and our mobile
phones has gotten really good and that's
because of this latest kind of a set of
breakthroughs with the deep neural
networks same thing with computer vision
had all sorts of breakthroughs in terms
of pattern recognition object
identification and a whole slew of other
video or image based deep learning and
other areas as well - in terms of
medicine some really interesting
breakthroughs in terms of diagnostic
medicine especially with like detecting
brain cancer with MRIs in a using deep
neural network models and stuff so very
interesting stuff coming out in that
space I think that's probably where I'm
most interested in continuing to study
but as far as the the general population
I think just getting to basic data
literacy or data science literacy
starting back in school is critical so
that students coming out of high school
and in college actually are able to look
at sets of data know how to work with
data and to be able to extract knowledge
and potentially actionable insight from
these data sets and then to not so
easily be lied or persuaded of things
that are
incorrect when someone is
misrepresenting data to them which we
see happen all the time through politics
and through the media so basic data
literacy and then for software
developers I think learning how to take
these data science downs are these
machine learning algorithms and apply
them to solve business problems to
create real value for businesses in the
real world I have one final question
sure and how do you display solicitation
how do you make that accessible and
interesting for people because I I find
data nice interesting yes yeah makes per
day my people be fed eat you know
looking at large data sets and looking
at the validity of data and outliers and
you say statistics people and they just
go I'm completely not interested yeah
well I thought about this problem quite
a bit because though one of the things
that I do is teach courses through
plural cite and I have an interest in
educating children about how to use data
science to solve you know questions of
interest I think the first thing you
have to do is tell stories with data
data is generally boring unless you're
you know data nerd like we are and so by
being able to tell stories using data
makes the the data tell interesting and
compelling narratives that essentially
engage our interest and keep us
interested in what we're learning about
there's a big movement to kind of gamify
a lot of spaces that are generally not
considered interesting so I would really
like to see somebody create a video game
that essentially teaches basic data
science principles in a fun and
interactive way as well to in fact I
built an open-source tool called data
Explorer which that was the main purpose
of it was to allow children high school
students and college students to take a
data set that was interesting to them
stuff they wanted to work with and learn
about and then project it into a two
dimensional space based upon the the
dimensions of the underlying data and
then tell stories our communicate to
their their peers what they learn from
their data set by asking basic questions
and then getting responses back so
hopefully other people will continue to
move that ball further forward and come
up with much better things than I did on
my free time so
of course hmm forget it make it do it
