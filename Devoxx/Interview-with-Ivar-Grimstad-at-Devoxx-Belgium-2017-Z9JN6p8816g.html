talking to Java EE expert Ivor about
what's your take on the recent change so
with Java EE moving to the Eclipse
Foundation well first of all it's I'm
very positive to it we have this
struggle with the Java EE
last year and with a move to eclipse now
we we can avoid that situation again
there are more companies willing to
contribute now and there are no barriers
anymore so it's actually up to the
community now just to show that we want
to have this technology we want to drive
it forward and yeah it's it's getting
more open it's it's an open source
foundation we're moving to so yeah yeah
I'm super positive and how do you think
it's going to work now we don't have one
central management unit yeah that's an
interesting question because I mean you
can say anything you want about how
Oracle has managed Java EE but but they
have done it even though maybe not at
the speed we've wanted them to do but
that's gonna be a challenge and I I
think other companies need to step up
now and
it's going to be an interesting time I
had to see how were that will work out
because I don't think we have seen
anything like that in the industry
before I suppose it's going to disperse
now there are lots of different
stakeholders in a way I don't have to
say that they have more say than they
used to
yes and if we look at the example of
Eclipse micro profile for example these
vendors have shown that they they can
cooperate and they can produce things
and they can do things together even
individually but doing it as a group and
so they're kind of setting an example
for how Java EE can or e4j can move
forward if they follow up on that trend
so so that's such a good good good
example to look at look at and so you
yourself have been elected on to the the
day CP yes and so how can the JCP
influence the changes to Java and Java
EE well for Java SE nothing has actually
changed
it's a Jason B there is the governing
standardization body there for foj it it
will possibly be different because
Oracle has a strong influence on the JSP
and this has kind of been a stopper for
other companies to to contribute as much
as they probably would have wanted so I
think with e4j these standards are going
to move forward probably without the JSP
or unless they J's be actually changes
something that makes it more attractive
for the other companies to contribute
so we don't down and up in the situation
where Oracle controls everything again
and and as you said I I am elected in
the executive committee community in the
JCP how also is elected in in the PMC
for e4j and and that's kind of a
surprising thing for me at least because
I'm the only individual there you have
all the other vendors represented and
and me as an individual and I'm actually
the the first leader of this PMC and I'm
not sure why they selected me for that
or if it's just picked somebody who is
no threat or or a can't do any harm you
know in the beginning and and take over
afterwards I'm not sure how they were
thinking or if it just I I kind of
reached out to the community take
somebody who is well not seen as as a
bad guy in the community but if I put it
that way
well that's what you think you know you
never know that's really cool thank you
very much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
