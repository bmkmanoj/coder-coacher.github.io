let's go back to generations and let's
see what I'm good doctor meant to be in
the years before penicillin was
discovered there were few diagnosis and
drugs and procedures that were available
so a good doctor knew it all did it all
from setting a fracture draw blood
perform surgery a good doctor meant to
be self-sufficient independent autonomy
was the highest value that you could
have but fast forward to today knowledge
has exploded it has to replace the
individual we no longer can know it all
so we need a specialist now cooperation
is the new high-value to become a good
professional now we all have to be part
of a team to behave like a pit crew
member I know that the abstract said and
talked about diversity we are going to
talk about diversity but my aim today is
to provide you some knowledge to improve
the Team Dynamics regardless of the
composition of your team even if it's
very emotional or it has a lot of
diversity in it so my name it's shell
I'm from Mexico that's why you hear the
weird accent I live here in Switzerland
I work for canoe I'm a Java champion I
love to travel around the world in
different conferences that one is
retreat I'm also organizing
part of the organization team of jaikrit
J Alva bustled one so how this talk came
to be actually last year early last year
I encounter some headlines really
interesting that got me wonder
but headlines like this make me try to
look back into the source and I found a
very interesting paper that mix that
matters in this paper conducted by the
Boston Consulting Group in collaboration
with the University of Munich they found
obviously positive correlation between
gender diversity in team management and
revenue from innovation so they actually
found out that four of six types of the
diversity had a positive correlation the
ones are missing our age and academic
background so why well it turns out that
if you have a very homogeneous team with
the same background you will get
redundant ideas group thinking and it's
not surprising for me that women bring
disruptive innovation how big was the
impact of having more diversity in team
managers gender diversity in team
managers it turns out it increases 11%
revenue if that doesn't convince you I
don't know what will
but 11% increase comparing to those who
had less gender diversity in their
management teams so at this point we all
should be asking well or should be
thinking let's increase diversity in our
companies it's not that easy
for example there is a lot of empirical
data or ideas that have shown that
intelligence groups sometimes perform
less effective there's less
communication so I went back to
different papers I'm that kind of person
and in 1998 the new idea of similarity
attraction paradigm and home Ophelia
bassists appear this means that we tend
to fall in love and we work with people
that are like us we are always looking
for a place to belong to we are looking
for a tribe to be part and if we form
close-knit groups with a veil of our own
language our own culture and Outsiders
will consider this blinken's we will
consider more well we are not going to
trust outsiders so there was less
performance per communication as I said
and people were saying no it's good that
we have very mature news groups and we
should not risk adding different kind of
people in 2005 another idea appeared and
scholars proposed that there was enough
good things of adding people with
different backgrounds ideas and
knowledge because they were sort of
inside suddenly your pool of skills and
networks exploded you had more ideas but
with more ideas you need to reach
consensus and to reach consensus people
start noticing that they need to have
constructive debate was higher so we see
two very different visions both of them
with significant empirical they
so how do we obtain all the benefits and
try to avoid the drawbacks the answer is
really simple improving our Team
Dynamics plenty of companies have
invested a lot of resources trying to
figure out how to create performant
effective in good teams for example
Google has spent two years studying 180
teams and after almost 300 interviews
and analyzing 250 different attributes
for teams they realized that how the
team behaves is more important that who
is on the team and they found out five
traits that all successful the most
successful teams are gold shared and
those are Dallas I need my notes for
this one because I always get it wrong
oh sorry
so these are the fifth five keys that
all teams should or successful teams
just share and they actually develop a
questionnaire - from time to time ask -
the goal teams and measure and see how
are you doing so the question that they
have to ask is can we risk when we take
risk on this team without feeling
insecure or embarrass can we count on
each order to do high quality work on
time does the team have clear goals
roles and execution plans are we working
on something that is personally
important for each of us do we
fundamentally believe that the work we
are doing matters I really hope you have
a positive answer for all these
questions if it's not that's not the
case
I think you are in a specific point in
time where you should have we need to
improve conversation
with him your team of the five keys the
most important one for me is
psychological safety so I went back
again and studied so what psychological
safety
well psychological safety and Trust are
related but trust it's about how I
interact with another individual
psychological safety it's about the
environment in itself so this is how
secure do I feel when asking questions
requesting feedback pointing out errors
and proposing new ideas if I feel safety
then in my team then I can do all these
things those are the five factors that
can improve psychological safety in all
teams leader behavior obviously how the
leader behaves will influence how other
team members will think that it's an
acceptable behavior it's important to
notice that a leader is not a person
with the most outer key a leader is the
person who can influence a topic so you
will in our teams I may have different
leaders or I maybe even a leader in
certain topics it has it doesn't have
anything to do or it shouldn't have
anything to do with Authority invitation
to input feedback think that is very
important and consider it is when you
request feedback you're putting yourself
in a vulnerable position because not all
feedback is going to be positive so you
are inviting sometimes not so very
constructive comments and this is also a
very important one when a leader is
suffice or makes explicit that he is
fallible
he is also vulnerable then people are
more open to share their own experience
trusting and respectful interpersonal
positions as I said I really it's my
belief or its how do I believe that
feedback is going to provide if I feel
comfortable in my team my team has a
good state then probably the feedback is
going to be constructive practice fields
this study used operation rooms as
examples and for example she said that
there are some hospitals where the
director surgeons the leading surgeons
had this open doors policies so all the
nurses felt really safe at going to the
surgeon and talk to them ask questions
and he or she was going to be open and
easy going and answering questions or
clarifying doubts practice fields in
some hospitals when they have to improve
introduce a new procedure there's some
hospitals who actually run the entire
new procedure from beginning to end
without the patient in the operation
table others do not and she noticed that
sometimes there will be surgeries
performed where all the teams all the
team members are completely strangers
before that day are even the first day
that the surgeon is conducting the new
procedure so really next time I have to
go to the hospital I'm going to ask if
they know something about psychological
process the safety and practice fields
organizational contact supports is this
is about how do we access resources do
have all resources available for us to
do our job to all the teams or member
teams even the ones remotely have the
same access to the same resources when
we have a poor transparence policy we
can reduce that doubt about our
insecurities about resources not being
allocated equally the fifth want
emergent group dynamics this is
something that we have to be aware in a
lot of companies people will take some
roles play some characters sometimes you
will have the father the mother they
could send the black chip and while
playing these roles you will get a
different kind of communication maybe if
the conversation is started by the black
sheep of the family
everybody's going to be in a different
state so it's important that you
acknowledge that this may be happening
in your team and consider the impacts of
that behavior what happens if you have a
psychological safety environment well
turns out that I feel comfortable going
with my team members and ask for help in
time this is important because what
happens obviously I will assign a task
we're working on it
if we don't interact with other teams
then we're doing our best
and suddenly the time for integration
comes and our model doesn't work of
course we're going to get feedback of
course probably we'll get help but we
already lost a lot of time as I said I'm
going to request feedback more often if
I feel that always is going to be given
in a positive constructive
wait going back to the operation room
example there were nurses that said the
surgeon really dismisses you treat you
horrible so they didn't see the
incentive to speak up and say I think
this is not the right dosage for that
drug in our hospitals where there was
some a better environment they were able
to say you know what I think we're
making a mistake I think we haven't
considered it so again I will prefer to
go to a hospital while they have this
kind of environment because those kinds
of errors are life or dead innovative
behavior and innovation if you have an
environment where people are more
willing to participate then when you
introduce something new there were there
is going to be less resistance to change
and if they are part of a creating
process they will own it and if you have
a positive environment where you can
exchange ideas then innovative and
creative solutions will emerge naturally
creativity I love this crowd creativity
a form of free self-expression being
empowered is crucial for innovation I
want to share another very good study
the secret of great teamwork the authors
have been involved in the last 15 years
in nine different projects globally they
they I think they process 300 interviews
and more than 4,200 service with teen
managers and leaders
and they notice that tree of richer
hackman's enable conditions are still
valid what I say that they are still
valid because Richard had - start
working with teams in the 1970s so after
40 years of research he came up with a
list of enabled conditions so they
revised them and see they're still valid
they still pick up three of the enabled
conditions and they added a new one but
what I want you to keep in mind it's
again we're not talking about the
individual we are talking about
something there has to be part of the
team as a whole why are they enabled
conditions compelling compelling
direction so we are now living in a
knowledge economy I'm being offered
similar products by different providers
so now in order to be successful we have
to offer an extra value and that extra
value is directly related to the care
and interest that all the people working
to deliver that value is putting so now
each of us have to decide how much can
love care attention we put to our laver
and that's an import interesting
distinction when people change their
mindset from work to labour phrases like
this is a labor of love can happen so
that's when we add the most value to any
system to any product to any company
strand structure we need to define
as I like to say usually we have three
problems or three ways of saying things
either you prevent problems you correct
problems or your incentive good
situations so strength structure means
that we should create accept live with
norms that prevent destructive dynamics
encourage good behavior supporting
context this was in the psychological
safety this is about how do we access
resources and the transparency to see if
all the resources are distributed
equally as I said the four one was the
addition of the authors of this
particular study so they notice that
what is different from when Richard
Harmon started to do his research to now
is that we have more distribute there's
a lot of digital communication happening
now we can have teams from all around
the world in different time zones so
they say there are two corrosive
problems right now first of all we still
have this behavior or this idea of us
versus them and it's even more clearly
because now I have to work with a team
in India or a team in Finland and the
other one is that there is an imbalance
in communication so information
sometimes doesn't flow correctly so
that's important that the leaders or the
team or in self the mean the members can
reach a common understanding a sure
belief that they are eight
this is to show the five factors and the
enabling conditions for both studies as
you can see there are a similar ideas
there shared concepts both articles or
world studies talked about how the team
was instead of who in the team was but
for me I thought even if I have the best
environment even if my contributions are
respected and welcomed I as an introvert
because I am as a I'm an introvert how
does that actually impact my team
dynamics so I wanted to have a look
about personality traits and personality
dimensions out there you may be familiar
with different questionnaires
personality questionnaires or test like
myers-briggs the big five in my case I
chose ocean and you will see why it's
the five factors is why Brian dr. Brian
L R little I like it because it can be
first it's useful for different
countries and different cultures and you
have a valid and reliable assessment a
scale for measuring the five dimensions
and well we if you really want to talk
more about it I can go really deep into
this topic the dimension is personality
there are five I just want to make clear
that this is a spectrum and you may be
very familiar with cars junk definition
of introverts and extroverts as I said
we don't have pure extroverts nor pure
introverts
Carl Jung said that that was part they
will be in a loonie Hospital if there
was the case so again this is in a
spectrum and I'm going to talk about
every single dimension the first one its
openness to experience this is how
willing we are to try new things people
that are really hide on openness to
experience they prefer try novel ideas
people who are very low they prefer
routine when you describe or the people
when studying this describe its mental
agility vulnerability because trying new
things means that you are going to fail
and you are willing to try and
intelligence etc conscientiousness I
love this one
this relates of how willing we are to
delay gratification how well we organize
how once a procedure has been defined
how how much ever we're going to put to
make it happened this is the most common
I think probably you have heard a lot of
time introvert yes introverts
yes introverts re introverts are do they
really have a lot of stimulation neural
stimulation so we they will try to be in
quiet places extroverts on the other
hand they are low in the stimulation so
they need to recharge by being with
another what a lot of people so they are
always the the party introverts are more
reserved thoughtful and we don't speak
too loudly agreeableness while
extraversion and introversion it will
it's about how much interaction and
seeking agreeableness it's about my
predisposition I'm going to be amicable
I'm going to make concessions how do I
interact with the different people
neurotics I particularly don't like the
description of people hide on the narrow
neurotic scale they have really bad
reputation so people that were hide in
the neurotic scale were regarded as
awkward pessimistic moody
but now the mindset is changing there
are there are really good studies in
particular one by Korean Burton deskey I
think it was the downfall of extroverts
and the rise of neurotics and the idea
behind it is that because neurotics
under-promise and they over deliver
because they are very anxious about
their impression that are they are
making towards their teammates so they
will try to keep quiet but at the end
deliver what they are supposed to do and
because they are very mindful of their
impact in orders they will try to do
better job I can also tell you about why
leaders may want wide way you want
neurotics to be leaders on your team it
has to be with ideas and how do you
actually let people interact in the team
as I said I had two reasons why to pick
option one is because the validity and
reliability of the scale and the other
one was because there was an interview
from infill queue with dr. little and it
was about software development so I said
yeah let's see so we all have or at
least I have in my team someone that is
willing to try every single life
to framework they are always thinking
about using the latest red shiny toy and
sometimes it works you always have these
teammate that it's willing to create new
processes this costs about code
formatting come up with the template of
commit messages and if you deviate from
procedure there well the first one to
tell you new agree all net a well
extroverts
you really want extroverts in your team
because you that's the people that are
going to nurture the team spirit they
will organize meetings events they will
open new communication channels in your
team's agreeableness you really want
people sometimes low on this I really
thankful of my teammate that it's
willing to say take your red circular
button and redo it because it's not the
pink circular button that we agree on
and neurotic as I said they under
promise over achieve and because they
are always thinking about things that
can go wrong maybe you want them to be
in charge or have in mind about
dependencies patches security they will
be natural at that we are different so
probably if you have fixed introverts in
your team they will know they won't be
overly excited about team exercises
probably they don't want to participate
in a lot of meetings so mind the gap we
are different we are who we are but
sometimes because of love and work we
have to act out of character like for
sample me being here and we can do it
but it takes at all the concept it's
free trades and contrary to its name
it's not free it actually takes at all
it's very expensive so if we continue to
do it without having a restorative niche
we run the risk of burning out the
restorative niches it's a place where I
can get out of my free trade mode and
relax in my cases after it is conference
I will go into a very quiet place and
probably and the rest won't get any
answer for me for perhaps three or four
hours or he's lucky monosyllabic answers
so I think our I hope that I have shown
you that diversity in a team can come in
different dimensions not only the really
visible ones gender age academic
background country of origin but also
because we have different personality
traits so we can compost teams better
but only if we are really willing to
work on our team dynamics and what I
show you were tools to make it happen
regardless of its composition that's it
thank you very much
don't forget to vote for the session as
I said we are part of canoe and we
brought the boat in machines so please
bow it and tweet do you have any
questions feedback okay yes I always I
always have folders materials but this
is a really interesting idea have you
heard about the dragon children Oh China
this is about the zodiac it's tough to
be that dragon children are going to be
the best so people plan to have kids on
in a specific year and because they
believe they are going to be the most
intelligent the most successful and they
have tried to analyze or search this
because the the researchers were saying
if you had a lot of kids in this year
then they're going to be competing with
resources resources are going are going
to be the same even though China
government tried to prevent or build
some extra resources for in those years
so they said no they have all odds
against them being successful because
there are less resources for them but
then they get better grades and I said
well of course the professors are also
biased they have to grade them better
then they came to the second level of
education it was graded by computers and
they were better they asked the children
do you feel better I mean do you feel
more intelligent do you think by being a
dragon child you are like the best of
the best and they say no they measure IQ
no later on they notice that what it was
actually happening is that expectations'
of their parents were out of the roofs
so they were trying to do their best to
meet their parents expectation so my
message for you with this story is spam
more of your teammates but make it
explicit and maybe we are going to be
surprised maybe they're going to meet
our expectations</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
