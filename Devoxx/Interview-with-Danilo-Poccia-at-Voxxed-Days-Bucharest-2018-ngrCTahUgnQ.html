joined by Danilo pochi appacha and from
Amazon Web Services and they like thank
you very much for joining us I know that
you're on a short schedule running off
to the airport now and that you
literally just came out with a session
so the session that you just was serving
us without functions is that correct
several it's beyond service beyond
function so tell us a bit about what you
covered this morning yeah so I'm really
passionate about severus technologies
that would be to create these small
functions that are executed in the cloud
and then you can link these functions to
events like if a user is calling and web
api or a document or an image has been
uploaded to the cloud you can trigger
your own business logic it's really a
different way than building love these
old-style big monolithic applications
but you can distribute your business
logic in small functions and Link the
business logic to the data that triggers
them what main use cases is saying from
this at the moment sir who's who's
really adopting this this kind of
approach so web application on mobile
backends there's lot of adoption like in
in the US that's postel they have a
website and then they move to a complete
severus architecture and they themselves
describe how they are much faster in
adding new features and the overall cost
is reduced or we have customers like
still in the u.s. does fannie mae it's a
federal agency they monitor the mortgage
in the US and they use service function
that can spin up very quickly to do
Monte Carlo simulations and run data
analytics on top of their data so what
they love is that they can spin start
from 0 to 1,000 concurrent functions
like even 1,000 servers in a few seconds
and then they can scale down in a few
seconds transparently so there are major
cost implications - serious cost is very
important but I think that when you
adopt this approach you discovered
you're also much faster and agile in
adding new features so you don't need to
think a lot of boilerplate code for
managing availability or fetching for
example when the last bug on the inter
was released a few months ago I think
after a few hours we just posted that
the lambda platform was patched and
ready to you so you didn't need to do
anything on your code fantastic so in
terms of other things that you covered
in the session this morning you you
probably covered off some important
points that all developers need to know
or any key takeaways for anybody looking
to get into more of a service world yeah
I think the one number one key I think
is think event-driven in your
architecture so try to link this beauty
of logic to events and events are really
good in a distributed architecture
because they are immutable data so in a
distributed architecture in middle data
is much easier to manage than some
global state so think of your
architecture system where you receive
events like a new user has been created
a new order has been inserted then you
can store this information like a time
series and then you can trigger your
logic every time you receive an event so
you have a history of your business
events and then you can link your logic
to that and probably the number to that
is more technical it was my final part
of the presentation that I literally
squeezed inside is if you need to build
a new API think of graph QL because I
think graphical as a platform for API is
much more flexible that they will style
a REST API and that's why we also
created tools like app sink for that and
I think it's really a good way to design
a new API that it's easier to manage to
evolve and to integrate with the clients
in an efficient way right thank you very
much for joining us anybody watching
this interview will also be able to see
your session from this morning uploaded
to YouTube and safe travels thank you
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
