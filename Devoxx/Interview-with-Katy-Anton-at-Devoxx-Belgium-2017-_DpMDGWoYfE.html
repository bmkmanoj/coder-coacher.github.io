talking to Katie Anton a security expert
so we were just chatting earlier and you
were talking about the importance of
integrating security throughout the
whole development lifecycle can you tell
me a bit more about that yes so we can
add Bolton security in the project
anymore we have the integrated security
and make it part of the software
development cycle so it's important to
consider security from the beginning by
thinking of the Rakosi curity
requirements to be used when writing the
code you can do it for security using
unit test code review even when you
commit the code into the repository this
is a place where you can add extra
security checks into the procurement
hooks and then have checks for security
once the code is into the software
development the main branch into the
your repository have checks for static
code analysis or functional tests
depending of your software you can
actually integrate those tests and make
them part of your continuous integration
and then continuous delivery so what
kind of tests can you write check that
your system is secure I know that's a
very general question but what what is
the typical test okay so first of all it
wouldn't be what do we test for and one
of the things that we recommend as part
of the u.s. top 10 proactive controls is
to use the auspice vs as a guidance to
the for the security requirements this
is a document that helps developers to
choose the appropriate level of security
and from there to extract the
requirements and use those to generate
the test cases so this is the what
should I test for then when it comes to
the actual how to test them you can
use tools like ours up this is a free
tool you can combine this make it part
of your continuous integration for the
dink Jenkins but you can also combine it
with other tools developers are familiar
like selenium so you can combine them
and use it as generators from a sphere
SBS with tools like Waze up to this for
your security on a frequent manner so it
should be part of your general test
suite along with tests that the photos
code is functioning properly yeah it
should be integrated it shouldn't be a
separate topic as it were yes it should
be part of the software development
cycle which it can't be separated any
more we can test for security at the end
of a project or project phase because
it's too late and by that time in most
of the cases developers have moved tone
the pod for the product is in production
so it's wait away so we start we have to
start testing for security earlier and
any experience was have you ever seen
that work have you ever seen that
properly integrated into the software
development lifecycle is it a difficult
thing to get companies to adopt this
approach is it difficult to change
people's minds mindsets from security
someone else's problem well it very much
depends of the security maturity of the
companies I work for the record they are
a world worldwide company my personal
experience is that the customers from
America are more mature they are open to
implementing security into the software
not as much on the continent yes
so in vertical we have tools like you
can actually test for security while
writing the software so plug-ins for
ideas like IntelliJ
Eclipse and visual studio and this allow
the developers while they type the code
to actually has a small to actually do a
security analysis for that file once the
code is committed then what we usually
recommend is to have the developers test
their code we actually provide a
playground area for developers which is
called the sandbox and that's where they
actually can test one module or the part
that they are actually working on once
that developer has finished that new
feature functionality and is part of the
main development branch of the main
branch that's when they can pass the
entire application through a static
analysis so most of the companies that
are with us will come because they want
to have compliance for different from
different regulatory requirements and
they want to have a state of the
compliance and to measure that one in to
measure the progress so that'll be the
stage where you would pass it save your
entire application and pass it through a
full static code analysis and some
companies then go further and prior to
deployment they actually do a dynamic
analysis this to test gives you a
different perspective of the software
the static hose looks actually into your
code the way it is written and can find
certain type of laws the dynamic looks
into your running application and that
actually you can actually find out of
how a certain vulnerability can be
exploited so they're complementary
and we're usually recommend to have
those</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
