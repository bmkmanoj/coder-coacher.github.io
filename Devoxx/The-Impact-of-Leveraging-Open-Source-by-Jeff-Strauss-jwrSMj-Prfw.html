was pretty great so we'll try I don't
know how to follow up that these
keynotes this morning but we're will get
ourselves started so this morning this
is this is clearly not a technical talk
but it's important to a wide array of
developers and technologists all over
the world we're talking about open
source licensing my name is Jeff Strauss
I'm from st. Louis Missouri which like
if you look at the United States and
like kind of put your finger right in
the middle I'm basically there I own a
company called they're on a software I'm
involved with an event called the Kansas
City Developers Conference and among
other things I am a lawyer sorry but I
don't practice law anymore so it's okay
I'm like I say I'm a lawyer in recovery
I'm I'm trying to to push some of that
aside now importantly while I am a
lawyer I'm not licensed in Europe
obviously I'm licensed in the United
States specifically Missouri where I'm
from but we're going to talk about open
source licensing and a lot of those
issues transcend transcend borders
transcend the communities transcend the
industry so when we talk about different
kinds of open-source licenses we'll be
talking about sort of contractual issues
rights and obligations and how we use
open source software with our tools that
stuff is relevant whether you're in
Europe the United States or elsewhere
now importantly I am NOT your lawyer so
I say that because first of all I don't
want to be disbarred even though I don't
practice law anymore also I keep in mind
that we're talking about general
concepts here okay we are talking about
how how you can learn more about how
open-source works different types of
license and principles we're not talking
to specifically about your situation
because I every situation is different
right this is more so you can think
about things the right way and think
about how you will work with your teams
and with your legal counsel if that is
relevant for you now why does this
matter why do we care about this why are
you here
right this is a Java conference there's
tons of great technical
content you're here to talk about this
why because it impacts everyone right
I'm actually not from a Java background
I'm from a dotnet background I'm a
JavaScript developer but in the
JavaScript community or in the dotnet
community I should say for a long time
there's a lot of pushback around a lot
of big enterprise type shops like Kevin
said not to use the word enterprise as
much anymore but an enterprise large
shops there are you know there are a lot
of companies that in the past would have
a knee-jerk reaction right open source
we don't do that we can't use that well
that's impossible today right certainly
in the dotnet community where I come
from that's impossible but in the Java
community we still have things like
spring and hibernate and tons of open
source projects throughout the java
community that we all use in our
projects on our teams day in and day out
no matter how large or how small so
these are things that were used to
checking the box and saying yeah I know
it's open source I have a license I
agree but do we even know or agreeing to
or what it means when we accept and
bring an open-source library into our
projects so going to start off with a
couple of definitions we're gonna say I
wanna make sure we're all on the same
page now to make sure we're thinking
about this the right way for starters
what is open source what does that even
mean I think we all in our head have an
idea of open source software but it's
not necessarily a complete picture a
full picture of what it means to be open
source software right open source
software is effectively just software
that is licensed for use under an open
source license what does that mean well
to be an open source license we're to
talk about several very popular licenses
a little later in the talk but to be an
open source license it has to satisfy a
certain set of criteria okay
we're talk about these each in turn free
redistribution source inclusion derived
works non-interference
non-discrimination what do these things
mean what does it mean when we say that
we are that we have an open source
license an open source software
first off free redistribution we we have
a saying in the United States we talk
about people talk about you know free
speech rights a very big deal First
Amendment stuff it's part of our core
part of our Constitution and oftentimes
I talk about open source software
I mean it's free people oftentimes
interchange the term free software
open-source software or like the Foss
community free and open source software
but when we say free we mean free is in
free speech not free isn't free beer
right we mean free information
it means the free sharing of ideas the
reason and where a lot of the
open-source community comes from and the
ideals behind it or that there's a
there's a general idea that among the
open-source community people like
Richard Stallman who are at the
foundation of the free software movement
that if you have software executing in
your environment on your machine you
should have freedom to see all of the
information right you should have
freedom to understand how it works see
what happens what's happening and and
redistribute it as you see fit because
it's executing on your machine so the
idea here is that if you have software
executing on your machine you should see
all of it you should be able to
redistribute it as you see fit it may be
free like free beer it may but as we'll
talk about it it's not necessarily
source code I think this is one of the
most obvious that people know when you
think about open-source software we're
saying its source code the source code
has to be readily available for viewing
by a consumer by a user so if you
incorporate open source software into
your project you have the right to see
the code right you have the right to
actually pull down I don't even know
what this does but you have the right to
pull down the source code it doesn't
always have to even be freely available
but has to be readily available and in
the old days I guess it was even okay to
not have to be freely available for no
charge there could be a nominal charge
to acquire if it's a large library as
long as it's reasonable as long as
there's no barrier that prevents someone
from being able to see the code and
importantly it obviously can't be office
gated and that goes beyond that goes
beyond you know just saying obviously
the compiled binaries but things like
obfuscation so in the JavaScript world
for example you know the you there's all
sorts of tools to uglify to obfuscate
your JavaScript that is still sort of
readable but there's there can be no
process required by the user to have to
try to decompile or or uncuff ID
obfuscate the code in order to see
what's going on it has to be clean clear
original code now derived works is an
interesting
because it actually has a couple of sub
components for starters it means that
you have the right to modify the
software not only can you take it in use
it and freely redistribute it right you
have the ability to make changes as you
see fit
you can modify it and moreover after
you've made modifications you have the
right to redistribute or to distribute
your modified code we call it derived or
a derivative work now there's when we
talk about licenses a bit we're going to
talk a little about about copyleft
licenses things like GPL if you're
familiar with are great if you're not
you're you will be what is a derivative
work and what is distribution is an
important consideration because a lot of
times licenses like the GPL have
restrictions on what you can do with
your derivative work and can you say
make it closed
once you've incorporated something that
is open but your task question wasn't
mean to actually distribute because not
everything is distribution taking in
source code and building a project and
then using it just even if it's not only
you using within your organization is
not necessarily distribution so a lot of
the considerations of we're using open
source are we getting into trouble when
we start using this tool well are you
distributing it this is become a major
consideration with things like software
as a service right let's say that you
are developing something up in the cloud
and you are creating some form of
service so you have an API you have some
other call that other consumers are
using but they're making calls into your
service into your product which is
sitting on some server it may be in a
data center it could be in in a server
room in your own business it could be a
server or a virtual server that you
control somewhere in the cloud but it's
something under your control
and what happens is you spit out some
sort of response you haven't under most
under most of these licenses you haven't
distributed software because remember
it's about whatever is working on your
computer whatever is happening in your
environment you have the right to
so the code that's happening up in the
cloud the HO code is happening on the
remote web server isn't being
distributed at all right however there's
a couple of caveats first of all how
often does that really happen in today's
world I mean maybe you're only running a
clear service but it's possible that you
have a lot of things happening up on a
server summer but you're still sending
something down to a client you're
sending a mobile application down you're
sending your rendering HTML and you're
sending JavaScript you're still serving
something up to an end user it might be
on a mobile device it might be in
browser so there's still oftentimes code
say a JavaScript of the web application
that's still being distributed so it's
possible even within a single
application package a single overall
project it's possible that some of your
code is being some of your application
is being distributed and some is not
that's I'm going to think about when you
decide whether you're concerned about
the software you use and what you
incorporate in your development process
this one has Leia attack the slide after
this I've never been really fun of
because I can't quite figure out how to
present the idea but non-interference is
kind of an interesting one
non-interference effectively says I use
this because a lot of times even though
they're like even old icons a lot of
times the example is different operating
systems different execution environments
so an open source project cannot like an
open source license cannot require you
to only use this on software that works
within a certain environment on a
certain OS you can't say you can use
this software and it's free for use
under open source license but only if
you are developing for something that
will run on Linux or another open source
operating system that's not then that's
not open source it can't be you can use
this software but it can only be used if
it's distributed digitally you can't
create physical media and ship I mean to
the extent we ever ship anything on
physical media anymore you cannot ship
it in physical media you can't interfere
with the technology stack of their
execution environment or the form of
distribution okay and lastly
non-discrimination I was really happy
yesterday we were walking around we got
in yesterday my friend John and I got
into town yesterday we walked around for
lunch around the harbor area kind of
where the newer hotel is and there were
signs everywhere
for for a Harry Potter and they're
playing like a live Symphony kind of
thing I guess and so I was like oh I
have this slide that's good because then
at least those references to Harry
Potter so you cannot discriminate with
use and what that means is you cannot in
any way dictate or confine the way the
open-source package is used by others so
for example a less dramatic example you
a big FinTech company a big financial
technology company creates some library
that is really useful in financial
calculations or whatever they do and
they decide to take that component and
make it an open-source library and
open-source tool set and they say anyone
else is free to use this so long as
you're not using it on financial
software because that competes with us
not allowed right you can't discriminate
in use and the only reason I the reason
I use a golden work for this or at the
Harry Potter reference is because the
open source definition even says even
for evil you cannot even limit use for
evil purposes so you know in a super
geeky Harry Potter world if if Voldemort
gets tired of his Death Eaters and he
says they're not getting the job done
and they're not finding all the the
muggle-born wizards or whatever I'm
really a nerd I'm sorry and decides all
right forget that I'm gonna write my own
open-source application that will just
go out and not create drones it'll go
and find and take care of the the
muggle-borns for me terms of license
can't prevent that even though it's an
evil purpose now interestingly just
because he does that doesn't mean he's
not going to Azkaban right so keep in
mind when we talk about intellectual
property we talk about licensing we're
talking about really about contracts
we're talking bout rights and
limitations and how we use property it
has nothing to do with say like criminal
law and again I'm not a European
attorney but I'm pretty sure you know
committing genocide against muggle-borns
is probably against the law where's it
in law whatever and just because the
open source license doesn't prevent you
from doing something doesn't mean other
laws don't apply right you got to keep
that in mind said before about free
software
free as in free speech not freeze and
free beer so you can sell open-source
you can sell it and make tons of money
make tons of money on open-source
software the problem with that and the
challenge is so can everybody else right
so I can create something and I can sell
open-source software to all of you and
the next day you all can turn around and
resell it without loyalty to me because
I'm not allowed under an open-source
license I'm not allowed to demand
royalty so how does that work right how
do we do that how do we make money off
open-source when everybody else can
immediately compete everyone gets my
code everyone sees what's happening they
can try to make it better and they can
try to compete directly with me well
there has to be more going on than just
the open source library or the open
source software itself so take for
example I think they're actually out I
wanna make one other point before the
next slide when I talk about commercial
software a lot people use these terms
interchangeably at least in the States
commercial commercial software I think
of as being software you're paying for
right as opposed to free as in free beer
proprietary free proprietaries closed
source as opposed to free as in free
speech freeze free as in free
information so something can be
commercial software and it can still be
open source and not be proprietary so
presented I would say so now I think
they're a they're a sponsor I believe
but take someone like Red Hat I think
they are yeah and Red Hat has Enterprise
Linux the kernel is open source there is
actually nothing that stops any of us
from going getting that software right
the kernel of Linux of Red Hat Linux and
selling it ourselves
however they have a couple things going
for them right they have brand and
reputation they have support if you have
a right and under their Enterprise Linux
Linux you know that there are patches
and they're security updates there's all
sorts of things going on with this
they'll let you know that yeah ok I
could go download some other or some
other distribution of Linux and that's
great but if I have this I know there's
something else that's sort of like a
makes me feel a little more comfortable
using it even though I could buy it or
get it for free somewhere else another
way this happens is with consulting
services so you have open source
software you put it out there you sell
it someone else can sell your software
and that's fine but you have special
knowledge right you have the ability to
maybe help people integrate your
software with our systems you can
provide training depending on how deep
in how complex of a product it is you
have the ability to provide something
beyond simply the software that makes
people still want to come to you because
if someone goes and buys you know vite
if I sell you of my software and then
someone buys that from you and they come
to me and say hey I bought this thing I
know I didn't buy it from you but I need
help with it I may not offer those
services all right so when it comes down
to is you have to think about like OSS
plus plus alright how do you take if you
want to sell open-source how do you plus
plus and how do you say you have to have
a value add you have to have some way to
say I've got open source software
everyone else can use this but I want to
put it out there I want to keep it open
source I want to put it out there and
allow other people to have it but I
still want people coming to me to get it
I just want to make a living off it and
sell it it's got some definitions so we
talk about what makes something
open-source and kind of what we can do
with it and we talk about a bunch of
licenses or specific we talked about
four of them there are a lot of
open-source licenses the open source
definition I mentioned one a little bit
before I talked I said open source
definition the open source definition if
you're not familiar is basically
controlled and run by the open source
initiative these guys have a really nice
website with a lot of information on it
access to a bunch of valid approved open
source licenses and they also they also
maintain sort of not only this open
source definition some of the things we
were just talking about like what is it
to be open source but they have also
they have like a great FAQ to give a lot
of answered questions answers so the
quote about not even for evil right you
can't discriminate even for evil comes
from that FAQ a lot of good information
now there are a lot of open source
licenses to be an open source license
not only do we have to satisfy those
those lists of non-discrimination and
non-interference and source code
inclusion all that but
a license actually gets reviewed and
vetted by these guys they're the ones
who maintain and say yes this satisfies
all the requirements to be a considered
a legitimate open-source license there
are a lot of them we're going to talk
about four but those four and their
variants make up something like over 80%
of projects on github so it gives you a
lot of coverage from just these main
four and we're gonna kind of go through
an order from what we call a permissive
copy a permissive licenses through
copyleft licenses and a copyleft is
things like the GPL and were going to
talk about that towards the end of this
section of the talk permissive licenses
are basically everything that are not
copy left copy left which we'll go into
more detail shortly
basically says you use this thing and
you use it under an open-source license
so it's an open-source product or
project but if you do redistribute and
use it in some way your derivative works
must be distributed under GPL or under
whatever other you know that that same
license so under most copyleft licenses
and this is where businesses and teams
get into trouble is under a copyleft
type license you might be trying to use
something that's open-source
incorporating even a small piece into a
much larger system that you're
developing and now under the terms of a
copyleft license it's possible that you
cannot make your resulting product
Copiah tarry at all you have to
open-source the whole thing permissive
licenses are the licenses that are not
that now we're gonna start at the most
permissive and work our way through
first off there's the MIT license I
really is MIT like the Massachusetts
Institute technology that's where it
comes from the MIT license has been
around a very long time and it is the
most permissive license it's it's I'm
fairly certain it is the most common
license on github everyone uses it and
most people who are not really deep into
the GPL side of the community love the
MIT license me as a lawyer
I like the MIT license I don't I
wouldn't say that I love it because we
talk about Apache it does things that
MIT doesn't really do for us but the MIT
license look at this slide don't read
this like don't read that but look at it
in the sense that for a legal document
its
short like we lawyers are nothing if not
lovers of words lots and lots of big
words and lots of commas and semicolons
separated lists of all sorts of stuff
that nobody else can understand or read
right this is a very short simple
document and that's the MIT license now
there's only a couple things to really
worry about here the first paragraph is
basically giving you a non all-inclusive
list of all the stuff you're allowed to
do with the software that's licensed
here the second the second little short
paragraph is about attribution if you're
going to take this open source software
and then distribute this software
somewhere else you need to make sure you
give attribution please include this
license with the software and use when
you redistribute it and please give
attribution appropriately don't remove
somebody else's copyright notice don't
remove the information of the people who
created the software in the first place
and as a general rule police don't do
that anyway right don't take away
somebody else's don't take away
attribution of somebody else's work
that's not an open source principle
that's in an electoral property
principle that's as an infringement
principle give attribution for the work
that somebody else has done that you are
using and benefiting from the the if we
go back one the the all-caps is another
way to think about lawyers when we
really want you to see something we
shout at you and I can't I can't read
that stuff I find that actually a lot
harder to read in all caps but the point
is they want to make sure you see it or
maybe they want to make it harder to
read actually and they pretend like they
want you to see it but what that whole
last thing was as a warranty and it
basically said everything's as is there
is no warranty as an Express disclaimer
of any warranty about the software
that's really all MIT has that's simple
you can use distribute modify change do
whatever sell etc etc etc the software
please retain attribution and keep in
mind this is a zhe's bsd there's also
from an academic institution it's from
from Berkeley University California
Berkeley it's the BSD is the Berkeley
software distribution which is like an
OS distribution from they kiss far back
to the late 70s or early 80s maybe the
license itself is not that old because
actually the open source definition and
the idea of open source software is a
newer idea than the more general idea of
like freeway or free software and
so as a license none of these licenses
are more than about 30 years old but BSD
I think may have even come into effect
if not around the same time as MIT maybe
even a little bit earlier BSD has the
same two core principles but BSD has
actually at least three different
versions the older ones were longer and
they've gotten progressively shorter
there's and we they have a bunch of
different sort of names but the simplest
way to think of it is there's a four
clause and a three clause and a two
clause version the two clause is
basically equivalent to the MIT license
so if you open see something that is BSD
but it only has two little numbered
sections one of those is about
attribution and the other one is about
the disclaimer of warranty the as is it
is actually than the newest version of
the license the most recent it's not a
say the most commonly used
I'd say the three clause is probably the
most commonly used the four Clause the
original one had well this is actually
the three clause one the three clause
one has an idea of non endorsement this
is in use frequently you'll see it a lot
the non endorsement provision says that
if you're using our software under this
license you cannot in your promotional
materials in your advertising in your
whatever else you cannot use our let's
say I'm the author of the software I
have a brand I have a logo I have
information my name you cannot use my
name and likeness in a way that makes it
appear as though I endorsed your product
right or suggests that your products is
good because it uses my software without
my consent
you cannot basically act like think
think something like like hibernate or
like spring or something the java world
that's open source you can't take that
use it and say well you know our
software is good because it uses this
other thing that you trust is good or we
sell written by this other author you
trust is good here's the problem first
of all that may be not not true at all
right that component may be good but you
may be horrible right or your software
made full of bugs well the problem here
is to the upstream author is now you've
sullied that person's reputation you
made it look like this software they
have plaster everywhere a software built
using XY and Z and this software is a
mess
so now makes XY and Z look bad that is a
requirement of the three clause BSD
license which is fairly common now the
four clause which used to be ubiquitous
but is not anymore is this advertising
provision the advertising provision
seems like a great idea at first but it
sort of takes the idea of attribution
and goes way past anything that turns
out to be reasonable the advertising
provision in the for clause bsd says
when you put out your advertising
materials your promotional marketing
material marketing materials for your
product that you have created using this
software this open-source software you
need to make sure that you give
attribution to all of the author's who
contributed to help make this software
possible that sounds nice open source
packages live a long time and have lotsa
contributors and those lists get very
long very long very quickly and I don't
know what the like what a comparable
periodical or a magazine would be in the
Java world but like in the Microsoft
role in the.net world you look at
something like the MSDN magazine buying
a half for a full-page ad in that
magazine is not a cheap thing and all of
a sudden you had situation where half
the page was just listening people who
contributed it was a major problem
so it became onerous without a lot of
value the cost ended up outweighing the
benefit so they removed it stripped out
of the bsd you will still see the fort
claus bsd with this provision in the
wild so you have to look for it and then
decide whether you're willing to deal
with that if you see it there's a good
chance you're not um both of these
licenses came out of the academic
tradition they both came from a place
that was from a time when everybody was
happy and building software was about
research academia nobody was really
saying oh it was too expensive for
everyone to have computers these were
this is anyone the computers were giant
things and a lab and you won with punch
cards or you were developing in early
early compiled languages
and there wasn't a huge commercial place
and there wasn't a lot of issues with
things like patents and stuff like that
so the MIT and the BSD license our
licenses over copyright now there's a
whole no talk about intellectual
property that kind of Dell is probably
way too deeply for for a non United
States crowd because it gets into United
States law too much but at its core
level think about copyright is the
creation of a work you authored to
something like your code a patent is
about protecting an invention patents
have very real value the MIT and the BSD
licenses do not license patent they
license copyright you have the right to
use distribute and share and incorporate
this code but not necessarily any
patentable inventions or novel works
that are within it so then all the
sudden this starts happening where the
trolls come out of the woodwork here in
Europe throughout the United States and
we live in a very litigious society in
the United States which I'm sure you're
all aware and patent litigation has
become a huge thing so there was no good
answer for this in the MIT and BSD so
what happened as a passion came along in
a pantry had an open-source license
before there was like a version one and
what they called a version 1.1 of the
apache license and that license said
that a lot of the same things that we
see MIT and bsd it was more academic in
nature the when the patent start with
things start happening they threw it all
out now apache 2 is not a simple
language it's not a or it's not simple
language in the contract apache 2 is not
a nice easy thing that you can see on
one screen on one slide it's got a lot
of definitions it's got a lot of longer
it's got a lot of longer terms and and
it's it's not as easy to read for a
non-attorney however very importantly it
includes patents the apache license is
what's really popular people like me
lawyers big corporate counsel we like
apache
because it's not to say don't use MIT
but
like a patch because we get a little
more protection and assurance when it
comes to having something spaten to bowl
still be licensed to us so we don't take
in something and then find out someone
tries to patent it and that's like what
we aren't allowed to use it anymore
so the apache license grants you not
only a license to use the copyrighted
work but it also allows you the
opportunity to use the patented work or
the patentable work but comes with a
catch as we call a poison pill or a or a
a termination clause termination
provision which says and this if you've
been following all the stuff about react
or facebook over the past several months
this may sound vaguely familiar it's not
exactly the same with the apache license
says is okay you get a you get a license
over the patentable work however if you
wish you to patent litigation back
against other authors other contributors
and you try to effectively troll other
contributors to this to this product
your patent license terminates so we're
all sharing but don't take our goodwill
and decide that now you're going to turn
around and come back and sue everybody
make lots of money off something only
because we license it to you so if you
institute patent litigation against
other contributors upstream or down the
apache license goes away or at least the
patent portion of it does if you are
following the facebook thing in the
reacts thing first of all the good news
is they've taken a step back and they
they've kind of ceded to public pressure
but with the react license as a quick
aside is what they were doing was very
similar they had a license that said
were issuing you all these licenses all
these things but if you sue facebook not
just for this thing that we patented on
something unrelated if you were to
patent litigation or try to make a claim
against something else if we actually
infringe on some other intellectual
property you own and you try to sue us
for it we will take away your react
license so it wasn't limited to just a
single set of things there wasn't
limited like one library it was we're
giving you license to use react however
if something else comes up down the road
even if we face book are the bad actors
we can take we can take your license
away
so it was different people didn't like
that
it's Apache GPL is way different for all
these others GPL is a true copyleft
license I always say like free is in
freedom
it's one of their many logos and that
kind of chuckle addicts I think what
sort of sort of I mean free is in it you
can argue it's the most free because
it's a copyleft license which again
remember we said earlier means that if
you use this GPL library and you mix it
in with this other stuff other libraries
or your own code and create some derived
work from it and then you redistribute
that you can do that that's great it has
to be GPL alright that's not true of
these other licenses right you can take
something that something that's under
MIT and you can mix it in with your code
and you can distribute it you can make
you a totally proprietary and close
source your derivative work can be
closed source that's not true with a
copyleft so on the one hand like yeah
it's the most open and it's the most
free but it's also the most restrictive
it's the most problematic in the maybe
in the in the corporate world it is the
hardest to use it's a bunch of different
versions of GPL so I said we were only
talking about four different licenses
and that's true except I already took
BSD and turned into three licenses
because there's the two clauses three
Clause the four clause GPL there's a
bunch GPL there are at least these four
that you need to know about unlike
things like Apache Apache had an old
version 1.1 and why are we talk about
wizard before all the patent license
stuff but you don't really see it
anymore
you really if you see Apache it's gonna
be the Apache 2 license with GPL that's
not true at all so there are a lot there
are a lot of open source projects still
using version 2 of the GPL license
version 2 of the GPL license didn't have
all the patent stuff didn't have some
other more modern things that would come
into the open-source lexicon the open
source community and importantly as a
result had a lot of kind of sort of
compatibility issues with issues with
other software and so GPL 3 was largely
created to
to address that problem it was largely
created to address the the compatibility
issues and bring the patent stuff in but
you will still see GP to GPL two out
there LGPL which I'm fairly certain is
the lesser general public license
although I've also seen many times
people say that it's the library general
public license I think that's wrong but
I've never definitively been convinced
because it's used so much that at some
point like well maybe it does mean that
because everyone says it anyway the LGPL
is actually a little easier it's al it's
like almost a copyleft there's a copy
left as a weak copy left it gives you
some wiggle room it says that if you
take this library and you incorporate
into your project but only through like
dynamic linking you're not actually
modifying the source code of this GPL
library you're not statically linking or
or or intrinsically combining it with
your own code you're just using it you
know making a reference that's okay you
still want your distribution you still
have to distribute the GPL three code or
the LGPL code and you still have to make
that available under the license but all
of the other portions the derived work
that you've created you don't have to
worry about it's not copy left with
respect to that but if you start mixing
the code more tightly you could have a
problem the a GPL is actually goes the
other direction and it's probably the
most extreme of all the licenses and
it's for me a very hard license to
justify use unless I'm really working on
something that's strictly supposed to be
in the open source world forever because
with a the a stands for a Ferro I don't
really know why but the a GPL which is
the affair Oh general public license is
a license that says that it closed the
loophole so if you remember a little
while ago we talked about what is
distribution what does it mean to
distribute and if you're just executing
code up here on a server somewhere but
you're just sending responses back and
you're not actually distributing
anything out to an end user and in
client then maybe you're not
distributing software the a GPL closes
that loophole purposefully that's his
reason for existence says even if you
have a service that is entirely
executing in a remote environment that
is not being put on someone else's
machine it's still GPL and you still
have to make that service open-source
and you still have to make the source
code available
and distribute under a GPL so that's
pretty that's a pretty tough pill to
swallow for me a major we'll talk about
GP a little while longer because there's
a lot of concerns it's not that people
can't use GPL and in an enterprise a
corporate environment but it's but you
see it's harder right now you see how
it's more difficult to use because if
you're trying to build for praia teri
software and you're worried about having
to take your entire you know you spend
hundreds of thousands or millions of
dollars or more on some huge huge
product and you put it out there you
don't want someone to come back one day
and sue you or say you're suppose to
give us a source code right so there's a
lot of concern compatibility is another
area that we have to think about when we
think about whether we can use GPL and
when you hear people talk about GPL
compatibility we're trying to answer
this question can code under license
whatever be combined and redistributed
with code covered by the GPL the answer
to that lawyer say is all the time it
depends the answer that is it depends
and it depends on what the other license
is right the question we're asking is is
this other licensed GPL compatible is
license X compatible with GPL and the
reason we have to consider that is
because the GPL says not only must you
distribute your derivative work under a
GPL license and and have it be open
sourced but you can't combine it with
other stuff that necessarily places
other restrictions on the end-user so if
I combine software some other licensing
terms just because I'd combine doesn't
mean those licensing terms go away and
if the terms of the license X add
additional restrictions of limitations
on the user of my software I don't even
have the choice I can't even use them
together in the same project or I
wouldn't necessarily be violating the
GPL license so a couple of examples of
that are Apache with the old version the
GPL version 2 because GPL v2 member
didn't have all the patent stuff didn't
have the patent license Apache 2 adds
the patent license while adding more
rights is great GPL doesn't care GPL
compatibility doesn't it doesn't ask the
question are you letting the user do
more you're letting the user have a
license over the patentable works that's
fine but on the other hand Apache also
says if you do
this other thing then your license
terminates now you've placed a
restriction on the user that does not
exist under GPL which means if you take
a gplv2 library and try to build
something with it and find something
else is under the Apache License you
cannot use them together in the same
project without violating GPL by the
same token the old version the for
Clause version of the bsd which has that
crazy advertising requirement can't work
with any GPL because no GPL license
requires that but the other thing that's
really important to remember is that
even if it is even if it is compatible
let's say we have something that's a
three Clause of BSD and we have the GPL
version three and we have the Apache and
we want to combine all those things and
those are all compatible with each other
just because they're compatible and I'm
allowed to use them the end result still
has to go out under GPL it doesn't go
out under Apache or under BSD whatever
else it still has that's that's the the
that's the crux of the copyleft idea so
what were asking what GPL compatibility
is am I even allowed to do that can I
even mix these three things together
okay
so so what what do we do with all of
this what do we do this information how
do we now use it because now if we
decided we are going to either create
open source use open source both of
those things we have certain things we
have to consider first of all about
contributions if we take something and
we decide we are going to have open
source software ourselves as an
organization we are going to share some
of our code into the open source
community do we accept contributions or
if we bring something in and we see
something we think we make we can make
it better
we bring in open source library and we
in our own team decides to make
improvements do we want to make
contributions back right do we wanna
submit a pull request we want to make it
better or do you want to keep it to
ourselves there's no obligation to make
contributions there's no requirement
that we do that and there's no
requirement that we allow contributions
from others right other people are
allowed to take our open source software
and make modifications we don't have to
suck them back into our project they can
fork it and whatever they want but if
we're gonna have contributions we have
to consider clas and CAS CLA is the more
commonly seen term by CLA is a
contribution License Agreement
which most larger open source
repositories will require you to have if
you're gonna submit a pull request back
in or if you're going to accept them
you're probably gonna have some like a
CLA which basically says yet will take
your contribution but you're licensing
your work back to us like you're giving
us the license necessarily by making the
contribution you're licensing your
authorship and your rights and
everything else okay and that's not
necessarily too troubling but if you see
a CAA it's not the same thing a
contribution assignment agreement
assignment basically means transfer so
contribution assignment agreement says
we are actually transferring if we're
submitting these contributions back to
the project and you own it it's yours
all right we now we have the license
right we may take it back under an
apache license that mighty license
whatever but we've actually transferred
ownership of our work we've actually
given it back to the project if you're
in a big organization you think about
that and be aware of whether that's
gonna be acceptable or not if you decide
to make contributions surprise this this
slide actually surprises me every time I
see it it's like all right a lot of
people have asked over time is there a
concern about surprise liability if we
use open source and then we put it out
into the into the ether
is someone to come back after us if
something goes wrong someone's using
software could be three four links down
the chain do we have a concern well the
good news is probably the good news is
no no I mean it's as is right the open
source software is as is almost all the
all the open source licenses we've
talked about and most if not all of the
others say this is as a software you
just claimed a warranty you use it do it
if it's broken
feel free to fix it but don't come back
knocking on our door sending us letters
from your attorneys that's great if
you're the author it can be a concern if
you're the consumer so always keep that
in mind because there's no warranty on
the work you gotta think about the GPL
risk in the first place this is mostly a
question of how are we distributing what
are we doing right are we even
distributing software in the first place
because I keep going back to this
example of our what does distribution
mean but if we are doing something where
for the most part we aren't distributing
software
if what we're doing is executing
something on the server running an API
whatever internal problem is something I
didn't mention earlier an internal
product so something that we develop on
our team but never leaves the walls of
our company and there could be three
hundred people or three thousand other
people who are using this product but
it's strictly internal which means not
only not not people outside the
organization or not even contractors
right employees of the company use this
tool receive this tool
I haven't distributed anything right so
if that's the case you'd have to worry
about the GPL risk because the
requirement to open-source your software
the requirement that you have to say ok
while I create a derivative work and now
I've distributed it
well that that arises when you
redistribute your derivative work so you
may not have a lot of GPL risk it just
depends one of there's no license one of
you just found something on Stack
Overflow or on a blog Zoe I don't know
it's just out there I need to solve this
problem my boss told me to solve the
problem today but it really had to be
solved two weeks ago I just found out
about it I wonder a lot of pressure
here's this snippet of code there's no
license on there at all there's nothing
about it great I can just use that no no
no no no you can't no you can't because
somebody created something and if
there's not some form of license
somewhere just because they didn't tell
you you can't use it doesn't mean that
you can because it's still copyrighted
the reason we have licenses is because
when somebody creates something when
somebody creates something they're the
copyright holder they're the author
unless they allow you through some sort
of transfer assignment work-for-hire
situation do you have work for hire in
Europe with employers maybe so where you
you create software in the course of
your employment it part of the work it
belongs to the employer not to you and
that's what some sort of scenario like
that the author is still the owner and
without a license to use it you can't
use it you're technically infringing on
their rights so no license is not the
best license no license is bad it's bad
consideration if you're going to use
open source software is think about how
do i how do I take care of security if
it's Red Hat Enterprise Linux I'm not
worried well maybe I don't right I mean
I don't think I'm worried
and their support if something goes
wrong if it's I don't know an analogy in
the Java space I'm sorry but like in the
dotnet world we there's a library I use
it a lot as an example is like something
called Auto mapper that's kind of a nice
like left-to-right copy to offer things
like your classes and data objects and
things and it's written by this guy
Jimmy Bogart he's a friend of mine a
couple of hours and he's a great guy and
he does a great job but it's his and may
have a million downloads a month or a
year whatever but like he's the dude in
Austin Texas who wrote this thing so if
something goes wrong how good is this
support you need to know what you're
using when you're using open source
software is this from some large
enterprise that decide to open source
something or is this some dude in his
basement in his spare time moonlighting
that creates something really awesome
but that isn't mean you're gonna get
great support or for that matter what
happens if it dies because what happens
if Jimmy just gets bored full disclosure
I use auto map or on a lot of projects
all right but what if he's just decides
you didn't have time for that anymore
he's the lead architect at a big
consulting firm and what if he doesn't
have time for it who's in take up the
reins is there is there some sort of
chain of command do you have confidence
that this this thing you're using is
still gonna be taken and control because
you're building a software that you want
to survive for a long period of time
and you don't have to rip something out
because like a component you used stops
getting support altogether hmm you
really have a few minutes time at tell
quick story is important what is your
long-term strategy I had a client
actually prior to have the screen just
turned orange now I really am but we got
like four minutes so I had a client who
was a startup that built sentiment
formulas several years ago a
photo-sharing kind of cloud based app it
was a really cool thing we were brought
in just to do sort of like a WPF like a
windows-based uploader type thing that
would sync with his cloud-based services
it was fine and all the some one day
Shutterfly came along and Shutterfly
wanted to buy him for many millions of
dollars this guy was a serial
entrepreneur he's made many millions of
dollars already anyway but the problem
was and it worked out okay because we
thought about these things and were able
to give the answers but the first thing
that happened with his counsel his
lawyers and the lawyers were Shutterfly
was they call people like us as his
vendor as his developing
developer arm right
and they said what do you got in there
so you gotta think about what your
long-term strategy is or is this
something will always be internal it
something to try to acquire it are you
gonna sell it down the road and
distribute it even though you're not now
you've got to always be thinking ahead
because you're the way you weigh the
costs and the benefits and the risks of
using a given type of open-source
software it depends upon not only what
you're doing today but what you're gonna
do six months and twelve months in two
years down the road so you got to keep
that in mind all that being said I'm not
telling you not to use this stuff all
right sometimes I can sound like an
alarmist I'm not actually at all because
using open-source software it does save
us time and money we're not reinventing
the wheel right that's great that's a
wonderful thing open-source does a lot
for us but the problem is we have to
think about teamwork and how do you make
that happen
how do you get everybody on board and
how do you keep track to make sure we
don't do the wrong thing because the
last thing you want is to find out that
some new developer even an experienced
developer decided that they needed to
like click a button and move on so these
they click the check box accepted
something without ever looking because
they don't really want to deep trouble
with that and now six months later you
find out you have a major problem
because you've incorporated some a GPL
library into your software and now it's
too late to do anything about it
right so there are tools out there they
like like black duck software is really
well known there's a bunch of tools that
audit your software I mean I won't
support one over another but there are
there are tools out there that can help
you audit your software and see what's
in there they can be alarmist my concern
with things like those tools is that
sometimes they will go out of their way
through their blogs and through their
through their notifications that you
need to be concerned and sometimes you
don't so a simple thing for a smaller
project or smaller team that I advocate
is use like a thumbs-up and thumbs-down
create a simple list know enough that
you can say hey we've decided as an
organization that MIT and BSD is fine as
long as it's not for clauses apache2 is
great we've decided that for this
project in this one and this one LGPL is
fine but all the other GPL licenses are
not have some sort of list and it's not
on that list we don't know we need to
ask the question but you need to give
people the opportunity all right you
need give people the tools and the
communication I keep going back to the
keynote right before me but with
something keval in time that was
communication communication among teams
sharing knowledge right how we're trying
to actually
to make good software well you have to
allow people to do that you have to make
sure everyone on your team has buy-in
understands the risks understands what
they can and can't do and if they're
under a deadline they need to solve
something and they at least know enough
to check and say was that thing a GPL
then they look and they say okay maybe
I'm part of the team and so I'm going to
take the time to see what the second
hitting Google was maybe I can at least
look there and see if there's something
that works better for our for our team
that can save you 80% of the time just
to give people the tools in the
communication so they all know why this
matters so your team knows why it
matters and what they can do about it so
the takeaways what I want everyone to
kind of think about it's just having
have a plan right which is to say
whatever and that plan is different for
everybody
but know what it is that you're gonna do
as a team right invest in that include
your team in the decision-making process
and invest in that process take the time
to solve the problem now right take a
deep breath and have a way that you're
gonna handle open source considerations
in your organization and make sure
everyone's on board make sure everybody
gets to have a say make sure everyone
has a stake in the process and get to
talk about what works or what doesn't to
the extent that you can and if you do
that you can stop worrying about those
kind of the kind of nooshin we go and
what we really want to be doing every
day which is like making awesome
software and just solving problems and
stop worrying about is something and to
come back and bite us down the road
again my name is Jeff Strauss this is my
email address that is the largest I've
ever seen my face on a screen and that
is just horrifying if you want to
continue the discussion at all feel free
to reach out to me Jeff at Jeffrey
Strauss Jeffrey are ey2 syllables not
three and use the hashtag OS s impact
it'll make sure I see it and I can
answer questions
I'll also be around and at least through
through middle a day tomorrow thank you
