joined by Britt and Android developers
so you talked about Android architecture
what's that like a Java conference on
Android we do use Java but it's totally
different thing you know to write
Android apps it has its own complexity
and its own challenges that you just
don't get on other platforms or like on
the server side for example so my talk
was about addressing that I had a room
with like I think less of half Android
developers there so I'm very used to
talking at Android conferences and this
was my first time talking in a non
Android conference with the majority of
Mellinger developers but I didn't want
to give like a little bit of the idea of
what it is to develop for Android some
of the best practices some of the new
features that are that can help us
develop good Android applications which
has been a challenge and this is
something that Google addressed not too
long ago and just a few days ago the
architecture component library became
stable so this component is something
that I wanted to to talk about and show
but moreover I wanted to talk about the
architecture itself and what it is to
architect you know in my experience
there are many right answers of course
for everything but in my experience what
it is to develop a well stay stable
maintainable Android app in terms of
architecture I got many developers
attendees of course we approached me
after the talk and said that many things
make sense a lot for server-side
development and architecture for example
so it gave them some ideas and some
stuff to think about and like the
similarities were interesting for them
so maybe I can convert some of them to V
Android developers which is which is
nice so that was interesting maybe maybe
I have to admit that I haven't used
Android mice I haven't done any Android
development so I'm afraid I am in the
camper I need to watch your talk and
learn a few things
no but that's okay I think that part of
what I've been trying to do in my talk
is to I did talk about like what it is
to develop an Android app and how to
architect it but I think that anyone can
like learn from it a little bit of fun a
little bit understand what I'm talking
about even if you don't understand the
challenges you know very very deeply and
maybe to give you an appetite - I don't
know mommy yeah
then I'm sure you can enjoy it also oh
and I know that I would I know that this
is a ridiculously open-ended question ok
so maybe what are a few examples of
clean Android architecture so for me and
what I've been talking about is and
actually many things have what I've been
talking about are actually right now are
in the official documentation after the
Android like I said so Google started
with an Android architecture project you
can say it has which became stable just
a few days ago which is amazing and I've
been working on it for with them for a
few months now so it does contain the
new components like technical components
and the framework that can help us out
with many challenges challenges that we
face but it also comes with guidelines
like how to architect it and this is a
lot of what I've been talking about so
mainly what we do what we love to do is
to divide the app or the way we actually
see the app to three layers so when we
try to not overcomplicate stuff so we
only have three layers for now and one
is the presentation layer for the UI it
knows UI it knows the view it has to be
really really really simple and stupid
though like take a field take a string
present it take a color present it
that's it that's the UI level and on the
other hand we have the data layer which
is a very much objective way to
represent the data because we work with
data from network services or databases
or many other places which are which
doesn't have to be our app so we don't
don't even have the control over them so
we have that data layer which we work
with different entities then on the view
and on the view layer entities and we
work with repository patterns we have
that and in the middle of it we have the
domain layer which has oh the business
logic it is combined with use cases so
all of the features of the tasks that we
want to do in the app or they're like
get the users or get tweets or save a
photo of these things or like each one
of them is a use case which are on the
domain layer and the demanders job is to
actually talk the talk between the data
layer and the UI level layer and to like
to be an adapter for the different
entities for the view model entity and
the data data model entities
so this is kind of it in general and
then I used and down on my talk I
explained that and I explained like how
do we do it actually implement it in
Android with the new Android component
thank you very much
sure thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
