to see you at this time I hope that you
can get some sleep here so sleepy and
wellness you're ready to start I'm
trying to start so let's start honestly
as an open source developer what is the
first time that you used to think when
you think in Microsoft this is the first
thing that you do just like what yes yes
I am in Microsoft working to Microsoft
let me just continue and about me I'm
just caparas I'm from Mexico yes those
that we have now so worried about those
this great wall I have been working as a
Java developer since now I think that it
will be like 10 years or more so I'm not
a dotnet person not Microsoft Technology
use cloth but now now talking about
Microsoft now Microsoft change there is
a one of the profits that I'm java
developer and I working with Microsoft
and as well another thing that I would
like to say it is that Microsoft is now
working with a lot of deeply deeply
engagements with Nokia's communities and
linux projects as a contributor but I'm
not here to talk about this at least not
now I'm here just to show you a demo
and as this is I say that this is first
and foremost a cloud and DevOps
demonstration and that's all and I'm not
here to explain it what is DevOps I know
here to explain what what are the DevOps
event benefits why you should do it why
you should not do it and why why you
should have it and why you should not
have it I'm just create this demo
because i was attending a lot of
conferences and on in all the
conferences talk about on all the talks
talk about that why do it why not do it
how it looks like but it never choked
with how really looks like and I just
decided to create it and let's and show
you today to you how it looks but
results of course some explanations why
cloud and why devops because it's a
natural fit it's it's a i just was
looking for the fur more a key points at
least for me for why do it this cloud
and DevOps a join and when is the
business at agility of course because
all of us we want to just a has a
functional software as soon as as soon
as possible with weekend and the other
is a automation why because both of them
allow us to have this a this a sorry I
and little nippers they enable to us
this this a all or cold all our
infrastructure as goals and although all
the things that we can recreate and undo
it automatically both of them talk about
that and flexibility flexibility because
now we can choose between how we can we
implement or or cloud partners or all
chloro or or DevOps practice and then
finally agnostic yes agnostic because
DevOps and cloud partners and patterns
are not related or not directly related
with a band or not with Microsoft enough
with amazon not with whatever there are
not because there is just like a
different thing the technology than the
concepts and then this demo is about
that continuous integration and
continuously leave a deployment and of
course as in other this morning i was
listening in a talk a while how we can
measure these these things and of course
it's the deploy elite team that that we
can measure and then a dead time to
recover from a fair and we can do it a
24 times faster than the teams that know
are doing this combination between
clouds and between DevOps and of course
it's a another thing that we can do that
we can measure about this is a time
about that we that we can deploy it we
can we can deploy more more easily and
more fast and as well the other thing
that is another just concept it's about
the continuous deployment that is just
this practice is just about that
releasing a good built into final
product for our users and that's soon
and and it eat it the clouds and the
devops combination will avoid allow us
to to deployed two hundred times hi then
if we are not doing anything of the of
those practices and okay but
this is just the oricon things that I
will talk and now I want to talk to show
you how exactly does as I look this is
about the demo just like show you how
exactly it and what we have and as we
see in develop we have just a
development cycle with a step sorry
using eclipse and committed a little
magic github repository then we are
using a job in in Jenkins that with this
we are creating the built the test and
weird package java application and this
is the plane in open shift left and then
we release with this a this package we
are release it to i should close in a
docker container and that is deployed in
ubuntu and exactly the flow how what is
this war file it's about this first the
developer i mean i will a commit and
push to my gift code repository then it
will start this job that is first a as i
said before it's a jinking joke that is
deployed it in opening shift it will be
first it will be the first step will
build then we will run a test then we'll
with package and then we will get a war
file and this war file will be published
in open ship then i'm using a this
orchestrator that is a visual team
services and with this i will copy this
war file directly to the my machine that
i have in in a shoe that is a and 12
machine and then i will run a docker
image district docket image is just a
tomcat and then i will run another
comment that I not will run it manually
it will
run automatically and it will deploy
this war fall in another in the
container that in the previous step
deployed and this is exactly the war
flow we will do it and then a few time
and I just want to show you how who
looks the job in open shift this is the
job that we that I have and this is
connecting directly to my repository and
this is just a built and they pose wilt
steps in this job and this is how it
looks I will show you later and this is
the docker configuration or natural this
is my machine I have a one built in
machine that has 12 then I have the
doctor I have an interface this is very
important and in natural we have like
this kind of extensions that this time
is dokis extension then the name of the
machine is darker and you can see that
is not showing too much details but i
will show you later and it just to show
you how it looks and then this is
exactly the configuration in the docker
machine and then this is the BSP
configuration that I'm running and the
image first and then I run it a i'm
running the image and then I build it
the image and i'm running a toker common
and that's all that's all that I that I
doing with a help of these tools but now
it's demo time i will show you first i
am using yes you can see this this is
total is hoodie and i want to show you
this machine this is yes this is a the
azure portal this is my machine and this
is the IP address
and then as you can see i will open this
connection that is directly to as well
this the first day the same machine as
you can see the the the IP then this is
BS TS where I have my dis orchestration
and configure then I have devils and
then i have the those are the steps that
I must I will show you the steps that
are not previously I I talk first when I
commit to my repository start this step
that is a cue a jinking job that means
that triggered the job then it will
download the the artifacts and then I
will polished these artifacts and to get
it then this is my openshift account I
me as you can see I'm using the the free
account that is everyone can use it and
I using this this domain and this is my
application I just using a template that
open she has and this is my Jenkins that
previously Jenkins job that previously
show you and just is the same and those
are just a two different browsers that I
want that you see that it's not running
actually because I don't have anything
deploy it now then let me show you can
you see yes I that you can see
and this is the machine that I already
have as you can see I just have one
container can you can you say nice i
have just one container and he said
jenkins that was created seven weeks ago
and the last time that run was 12 days
ago and is in the port 80 deployed and I
that's all that I have now then this is
my eclipse I was recording a video just
in case that Wi-Fi doesn't work I just
as you can see it's just java web
application this is just a JSP page i
will write hello from the torque in the
box i just will say i'm using actually
i'm using the this is just a tutorial
that I fork from get go just a simple
application but you can use it whatever
you have application that you have i'm
using the plugin with jet cup to commit
directly to to my repository and you
said talk one ok and I'm going to commit
and push then we'll set okay and then we
i will go to Jenkins just to see if when
it starts
it's a start now and as well if I check
it in BST s in bills I will see that
this is one building progress okay let
me open it you can see that is here okay
is running and it finished the built but
then I need to go to releases because
there are 20 steps one is the will and
the other is they their release and
where is it here release 31 that is it
running and then I will just run it
again my daughter PS command and then
why have it another container as you can
see is here it's here okay and runs
eight seconds ago and is in the port 88
this is important because since you are
using our I you are already used day oh
I am ready used a port 80 now we we need
to use a forwarded to another port and
this is 88 and then is easiest and now
what happened if you want to deployed
another container you can run as you
know whatever continuous you want but
first I you can automate this step but i
would like to show you manually but how
it looks this is a the steps to their
release first as you can see i have the
Ronin image come on and then not run
docker common
this Renee doc recommend it's here it's
just this is available that I have for
the container name and this is another
variable that is help me to forward the
ports that I am doing and I will since I
have three different environments the
testing stayin in production I'm just
using out the test environment I can
change it they bury the battles that are
configure i will change it for 89 i will
change it for 87 and then you say okay
then i will save change let's eat save
now and then i can run it again import
87 against a
and then just check if it really starts
okay here is the other it already start
and then we just need to wait that the
built and the release finished it
finished finish the build and then I'm
going to release and check it if I
really finish this France and again I'm
going to check my it's not it's not
deployed yet it said that is run I is
here as you can see there is my second
that is in this port 87 and then I will
check it here with 87 and that's all
this is pretty important about the ports
because at least when I was starting to
work with the with it the containers and
in the clothes when you work in your
machine and you have your your daughter
machine in your own laptop it works fine
but then when you have this another
piece that is the cloud you must be very
careful to configure all those keys and
all day SS l keys all the TLS keys and
all the ports and now at the beginning I
show you the how is it structured the
this machine in the cloud in Azure cloud
and I using a security group and in this
security group as you can see I most to
have all the ports that I'm will be use
it because you can you can deploy it and
you will not find at your deployed and
you release will run fine but i think is
that you will not allow it to see it as
you know because you most
to configure this room and then i will
show you the the next few slides then
what is the conclusion of this or the
conclusion at least that i have of this
this name first is that it it will be
built very fast if you do the correct
steps as well and i'm john i know i
don't know you but I'm sick about that
this tutorial that they'd said that this
step on this step and then when you you
try it if not run and then you decide to
do it manually and then it will not work
and you are not doing properly this a
they both DevOps practice and then it
will help you to catch the box if you
automate all those a integration and
deployment and then and then you have
very quick the software working and your
releases will be very low risk but as
well another and I think that is the
most important at least for me and I
want to tell you that day that you can
use your clothes providers it doesn't
matter whether you close providers as a
compliment to each other and you must
use it you're the tools that you have in
your hands because why because as I
developers it happens a lot of times
that you want to configure by yourself
configured by hand all the things and of
course this is fun and this is a better
if you want to learn and understand
exactly what you are doing but the other
thing is that if you have a clock
provided and dayglo provided i already
already have those templates you should
to use it because his quick is the
quickest a
a way to enable whatever you want a name
and then there is no there is nothing
wrong to use those templates even open
chief it has distant place you can use
it as well once that you already done
with this kind of a workshop demo
whatever then you can do go in details
you can use a start to work in the
connect directly with the with the with
your machines that you already have
deployed open shift has those clients to
that is not beauty that there are their
own to look in there in their years that
they provide to you for free you don't
need anything that as I sure has a your
credit card to start to work in that at
least not with open ship you don't
necessarily has to use a BSP this time i
use VST yes because is the true today i
have but of course you can do exactly
the same and i'm talking about this part
you can have the these three steps that
are in the middle you can you can use
easily you can use it a Jenkins instead
of BS TS just to continue to work with
all all open source but there is about
the the options that they closed that
you're CRO provided are over to you and
actually me suggest that that that you
should use it in this way to do ought to
get a functionality more more more fast
and then as another thing that i would
like to say is that why why why can
complement it because most of the time
if you want some specific for example
a configuration or template and probably
open ship doesn't have or probably I
should those in half you can take
whatever or even a muscle that they
probably they have they have my
different things that you can use it but
not necessarily you must be buried with
one cloth you can use it whatever
clothes you want and then and these tips
little tick tips and tricks that as I
said before take advantage of your
subscription then take care of your
configure your security rules because
this is I I have been running a lot of
workshops and the people as the step
that you will be stuck will beat the
security rules and the second it's the
security configuration I think that
those the tree of of the the trillest
ones are of course the most complex and
the most easily steps to be a stock when
you are working with cloths and of
course this is this is a problem but but
you must have learned about data I exuma
suggest that please don't look at the
tutorials and copy paste the comments
why because when you do that you must
copy the error that someone else a pixel
later than it ends this blog and then
you will start to look it in another
blogs and then it will be like like
crazy to start to to find this a
solution and then you will you will be
disappointed because because you are not
you will thinking that you are not doing
the correct steps but it's not about to
do the correct steps is about to read
properly and don't copy paste day the
comments that are in in in the blog post
and then there is a sundress or
resources that that
we like to show you oh no i don't i want
to show you what I can't okay this is
one of them this is a reportedly then is
a demo that I already show you it's here
all the steps that you can follow and
all those an introduction what is what
you will need how to do it every of
these steps you can follow it if you
want it and then another I think that I
would like to to mention as a result is
if they the report that that puppet labs
are released that here you will find a
lot of good facts about DevOps and about
how many times you will increase your or
at least the average of the work that
are using this a DevOps strategy it's
better or why and why you are more
faster and why you cannot be more faster
I think that the time goes so fast and I
was so fast but I think that is it's
everything for me and I don't know if
you have some questions I would like or
some feedback good and bad and but if
you have a place a write me and I will
answer your questions and thank you for
coming and enjoy your evening</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
