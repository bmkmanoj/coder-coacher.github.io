yeah we are huh nice I'm here with Matt
and Josh so you gave a talk about we're
not progressive web apps apps robust web
apps well not only that but cloud native
yeah okay reactive robust progressive
web apps have you got any more buzz
words you'd like to micro-services
factor factor yeah yeah anything else
web pack okay so that's it thank you
everyone everyone has to know thank you
bring it they're dead yeah it wasn't a
terrible talk do you think it sir it
wasn't terrible so even the back end
right well yeah I mean yeah what did you
use to build the back end
well you spring so I wait we've we've
both been spring users for more than a
decade you know and I remember when the
back end was more complicated than the
front end but now I'm you know older and
my brain just doesn't work as well so
now so when we do Veda up there work for
this talk I volunteered to do the back
end because I knew the front end would
be dramatically more complicated and so
he did that right and there was tens of
thousands of lines of code hundreds o
but angular has like a code generator
built in to it CLI so it makes it pretty
easy to build them and you don't have to
write a whole lot of code and I can
almost type as fast as Josh so it looks
kind of cool you know it's like generate
type a lot yeah and everyone's
intelligent templates right do use live
templates to make it faster even yep i
typescript is such a beautiful language
but then and this was a fun talk because
it's the first time we've done he did
the whole back-end in Kotlin yeah
alright and spring reactive and then I
did the front-end typescript but they
looked very similar yeah I'm a language
perspective so you know I don't know if
the audience knew that we were switching
between languages they're not because
it's see it's a double arrow verse of
the thing
right yeah that's the difference equal
0-0 Kotlin single arrow javascript
jscript double arrow you should have
just used one of those webpages maybe
pretend to be hacking so you just type
in all the words suddenly if you use one
of those before
it's bit I would have no point if I had
that that's Lily I'll show you good you
just built a web page to automate me
so that would be Josh this whole talk is
just texting typing yeah that's all I've
got
don't take that away I'm sorry come on
Oh so how is it robust well we said
robust on the back end oh well in the
back end we built it so that should
services fail or disappear they can be
load downs to other nodes we can do win
juice graceful degradation through the
use of circuit breakers we used reactive
programming reactive the reactive
paradigm to support the idea of back
pressure so we can't overload a
particular consumer or a producer so
basically get flow flow design flow
control you know a lot of things like
that we talked on we talked about and
then we also supported observability so
you can surface information by the
application in an operational context
and then on the front end we use rxjs
which is a reactive library for
JavaScript so that you know it talks to
the backend using reactive you know
terminology as well and then it also is
a progressive web app which is in
particular angular it can be any web
framework or even the server-side
frameworks but you know it's got the
ability install the app and then it's
got service workers in there that can
cache the network requests so that
allows you to basically work offline
yeah so your app doesn't really need a
back-end as long as it has grabbed that
data at some point and then we added
security so yeah it was production
worthy you know it was like it wasn't a
toy that's put that way but as you can
imagine that took a lot of a lot of lot
of things a lot of check boxes we had to
get through before we can get to the end
of it and stick the dismount and say
look it's done it's pretty you know
production it's good thing we had three
hours yeah well I'm looking for checking
it out although I'll probably have to
watch it really slowly because you're
both type so fast whose part especially
at the end of it he had some broken
fingers okay
like what happened that all that angular
again thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
