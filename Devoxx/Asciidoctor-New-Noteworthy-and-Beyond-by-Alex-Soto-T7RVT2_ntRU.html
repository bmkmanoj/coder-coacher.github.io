this session about asciidoctor and
documentation obviously I'm not done
Alan I mean he has hair and beard and
obviously I don't have any of this
suddenly he could arrive at time to give
the talk so I'm the backup guy and I'm
Alex Otte oh I work in Red Hat and I'm I
mean the MENA contributor of asciidoctor
I've been in the community since the
beginning and my twitter is Alec so Toby
we just think that it's the best way to
contact me because if you send me an
email I will it will take for me like
two weeks to answer it so if you send me
a Twitter then I can answer any question
you have really quickly so everyone
knows what asciidoctor is who don't know
what is a ski doctor you don't know what
is okay ask a doctor is a tool chain for
parsing and converting asciidoc
documents so they can be published in a
variety of formats like HTML either F or
for example a pop or DePandi's a slight
these off lights are produced by
asciidoctor
and if you know it it's you can think
about like mark down but a complete
solution that you can write anything you
you have in your mind like documentation
for your projects but books for example
my book I wrote testing Java micro
services with ending it's here for
meaning we wrote it with ASCII or skip
talk and ask a doctor so now I think
that this summarize a lot would ask you
doctor is is that the more I work with
ask a doctor
the more I love writing the commentation
very nice one to the 402 these gorgeous
I mean that one of the key points of
asciidoc and ask a doctor is that we are
trying that you enjoy or writing
documentation but also the default
output it's like okay I can
the flock would and put it for all my
customers without any problem having to
deal with style sheets and so on so far
so Oh
I mean asciidoctor studied at 2012 and
we still they have a low in fact notice
that the issue was opened on 31 so the
1st of December said yeah it's a good
day to open an issue of 2012 yeah and
there was like two thousand sixty two
comments so you can imagine that there
was a lot of feedback and a lot of tries
and you know one logos and so on so far
but finally we get it and this is the
model yeah it's always created by marion
lara and as you can see it's an a that
obviously is for a ski talk tour and
then you have this equal because if you
know any of the document right and buy a
ski docked starts with the equal sign
and weights sorry right and then this
the both versions with a strong
background with white one so finally we
close the issue about the logo and now
anything rated with louis will we will
open another issue but of course this is
the logo but we introduced a lot of
changes in the latest versions regarding
the processor the first thing is that
everything that I'm going to talk here
it's nothing specific to a ski doctor
it's about the asciidoc format I mean
that asciidoctor is the processor on a
ski dot is the is the format so
everything that I'm going to cover here
is just using the ascii doc format
because asciidoctor has some kind of
extensions that you that we implemented
things that are missed on the ascii doc
format
the first thing that we're going to see
the X River style which it's used for
doing references between a paragraph and
a section and this is how you can refer
from a part of another section which is
just say refer to and do this last slice
and then with the reader and you put
there the ID and ID is just the title of
the section that you want to refer and
notice that this foreign keys by default
ID is foreign keys with the menus in the
middle and all within the lower case and
now when you do this you will get
something like this you just configure
xref style call on full in the top of
your document and then you have
something like refer to section 3 that
one which is foreign keys of course you
can use a forever style short and then
you just remove the title of the section
just something that is knew it before
you always get it the title in the
reference output and now you can choose
to just the title without setting the
xref of style or the full rule full
version or the short version there's
something it's new also regarding
translations the community is just
awesome they provided us like 28
translations of the levels that are a
static from asciidoc and asciidoctor
we'll see an example but basically we
are this I know all of them but not that
it's really funny that there is for
example Japanese Chinese which are quite
I mean at the community on the on there
that provide us a translation for this
there is also a Catalan Dodge well all
one Spanish
Romanian yeah oh I mean that there is
translations and basically these
translations are done with this way you
create a file which this file is in you
need to send a pull request to today
locale attributed menus and then they
put the Lang there but a doc and then
it's something like this you said when
there is an appendix caption in this
case this example of friends is appendix
when you have coach caution caption is
about this ability semen and and so on
so far so you just need to provide that
the photo labels that that you want to
be replaced at generation time by
asciidoc how so we've improved advance
the tag filtering when you want to
include something this is an example
right this is a class and probably what
you want to do in my indoor document is
do something like look this is an
example of how to in this case create a
recursos copy this is a CD I pinned and
notice that you put tag name and name
and then you put some important tag name
you put another content like in the name
of the bean and then n name before the
in the last release you could set I want
my file to contain everything that it's
between name so your output in the in
the HTML would be something like import
Java eggs inject name and then name X
that's all what you get in the output
but you couldn't do anything else and
colory
we improve this so for example you can
exclude all tags so if you put include
the window X dot Java and between
brackets as a configuration set tags
nothing you get all the file we thought
I mean that excluding all the tags from
the source file also you can exclude by
name so you can set everything that it's
between name just take it out so in this
case you are you see that there is no
name and there is no import but how so
you can say something like include
everything and that's a really
interesting example because when you
said include everything it means that
get all the tags and put all the content
but notice that if you do these
with the previous version of asciidoctor
you get the comments the a slicer slash
tack : : name you get it there on the
output but now ask you doctor is my
enough to say okay you know that these
are comments and these comments are
something that if you said that you want
to put everything you don't want to put
out your output so remove this comment
there's something that that so comes in
the last version also we are giving
stronger SBG as a support basically we
are including that you can set this
files as an image as an object or as an
embedded so you can put something like
image diagram out interactive and this
means that it's going to create the
output as an HTML with an object type as
a BG XML for the data of course if you
change the install in line what it does
asciidoctor is read the file and put the
output as an embedded content inside the
HTML tags but since we improved this
support of of files we even integrate it
better with diagrams I mean that
Durham's processor are like processors
to create diagrams from ASCII text right
and in this case this example of
planting your mail which is one but
asciidoctor support a lot of these tools
so you can do a block with this quantum
UML which says the content of this of
this block is going to be a plant from
your mail format and the output is going
to be a size of G file with inline so
it's what's happening if I generate this
it's like if else activity theorem but
you're going to generate is this the
output so an inline diagram for ya
really fashion look and really easy to
work with of course from blood is like
that in this new version we fix a lot of
bottom basically the community yes start
working a lot because that's I mean that
asciidoctor is it's starting to be used
everywhere we went to some examples but
they start providing a lot of bug fixes
so they're like 120 bucks fixes for the
next release so that's better for all of
us and one thing that we created that
it's new is the asciidoctor bespoke this
poke is like rebel GS for creating a
slide in HTML way like this one but yet
arrived but the engine instead of being
rebel is bespoke which is another one
that it contains in our opinion a clean
API to work with so how to use
asciidoctor we spoke well you just
create an ascii doc document notice that
the first thing is the title of the
document and in this case is the first
slide and then for each subsection which
is that two equal symbols
it's a newest light so you do this and
then when you render this with
asciidoctor spoken then you get an a
slight similar that the one I'm using
and one other thing that it's really
good is the we create some kind of
metadata for bespoken so you can create
some kind of in this case we mark a
slice faith this is a metadata and then
from your spoken files you can set
remark means this change in the CSS
output or on the HTML output or
inserting something the CSS file and a
slice means this and fitment means this
so what it's just putting this thing on
top of a section title you can get
something like this
it's just I mean that it's like it's
like it's like this this meta data
properties for modifying the output
which is great this is something also
new for us a doctor as performance it
has been something that we have always
taker and one of the questions that we
get is why it's implemented in Ruby
because we know that Roo is not the
fastest language to to reuse but in 2012
github started to create a project that
then was called asciidoctor which they
wanted to render simple ASCII dog
documents they relay on asciidoc dot P I
which is Python which was the Python
implementation and they rely on this but
this they give us some problem with
security with performance and so on so
far so they started a ruby
implementation and then Donnellan was
was investigating some of these markup
languages and they see that giffgaff was
doing this so is the start a really hard
pushing on implementation for ruby so
this is why it's in Ruby because github
started in Ruby the whole thing is that
github loves ASCII dogs so they they
always provide support for the Lara's
asciidoc and asciidoctor enjoin and for
like 2013 the more of I mean like more
than 5 million repositories can use
ASCII dot for writing their own
documentation one thing for previous
version to this one we improved the
speed by 35% and from asciidoc python to
asciidoctor
with ruby we speed up or 100 times the
performance and I know that you might
think that this is not I mean that so
important for documentation but for
example dan is working with a
company which they render it 5000
asciidoc documents and privately they
did with the python implementation and
it took almost one day to generate the
documentation so of course yeah if you
want to render one small file then it's
okay but if you are doing it I mean
taking or giving a lot of important on
your documentation then it's important
the performance and things of
asciidoctor now they are rendering with
just five minutes so when they pass from
one day to five minutes which is great
then the co system is growing there's
always new improvements for example
currently one of the best improvements
is like that
the darker image which we are working to
that so they can be lighter but of
course improving the deco system means
more and more downloads and you can see
that this summer we arrived like the two
million and a half download another set
is exponentially every month there is
more and more and more people moving
from I don't know what to ASCII talk and
just you can see that what I mentioned
that all the ecosystem the JavaScript
the Java and gem which is the Ruby
implementation it's improving year by
year and improving the distant load so
we mentioned one of the most used
asciidoctor ecosystem project is ascii
dr. j sk dr. J brings asciidoctor to the
JVM and it's a pure Java API than
Minaj's JRuby underneath and we wrapped
all the Ruby API so you can use the
asciidoctor
gem without giving any thought and this
this project started by me so like yeah
three years ago
and I based on the proof of concepts
that under a sawmill inj some Pollard
did in the past and then I just took
this proof of concept and let's say that
I put it like like a product let's say I
predict product does this nowadays I'm
not in the heat of a skillet or J
because there is Robert Panzer which is
doing an awesome job doing things really
awesome so when you start working with
us see dr. J you don't have the feeling
that there is Ruby behind this is the
ecosystem this ask you dr. J but then
there is the implying so you can use and
for generating documentation there is a
greater plug in IntelliJ plug-in limp up
converter Java doc doclet I made one
plug-in and this is a ruby extension so
and in this case what they are doing
doing is that I create my own custom
macro which is when I found issue : 48 I
just read that Yuri issues attribute and
then I substitute the ID with this URL
this with Ruby and this is how you can
do it the same we ask you dr. J DSL
notice that this is a groovy DSL where
you said asciidoctor extensions and then
you define the extension just their own
place so you don't need to create Ruby
files or Java files of course you can
write extensions with Java and then
register it as Java SPI but in this way
you have everything in place asciidoctor
j GS was a project that was started by
William Grasset and basically what this
person is doing is trans pelling ruby
code from opal to JavaScript opal is
like this it changed all the we code to
JavaScript code and one of the new
futures is on the escalator Diaz is that
now in the past
asciidoctor GS was not 100% future
compatible and now it's
100% comfortable so and everything that
you have in ask you dr. Rubik or you
also have it in the JavaScript and again
the Elector GS allows us to have an atom
package brackets extension big book also
uses for rendering the books
Doug gist asciidoc effects and also
respond for Chrome and Firefox to
preview the asciidoc documents from the
browser directly this is at the same
extension that you saw before with Java
and this is how it looks with JavaScript
so you can write extensions with
JavaScript directly and this is an
important improvement as well things of
the of ask you later yes this is the
atom previewer and the syntax
highlighter and everything and I and
this has been a really improvement I
think that if you want to write ASCII
dot documents you should use atom with
this video stock plugin because it's in
our opinion is the best one which takes
better all the syntax highlighting and
the output of course there is some
improvements like like for example the
performance of generating the preview
but is I mean there are improvements we
are working on this but but this is
something interesting to take a look as
well so the option which companies are
using this in the or move to ask doctor
in the last six month the first one is
fedora fedora decided to move all the
documentations from Doug book yeah XML
who likes example to ask you doc I also
read had a lot of products and Red Hat
are there documentation is in in ASCII
dog like hibernate or or Korean or Forge
they're using ASCII dot Java II said
when started with CDI and bit
validations to be to be using ASCII dog
and now the Java EE Java 8 is moving all
the tutorials and everything to ask dark
Springwood
if when you go to the spring page and
you know that you can you
go to starting guides and then you see
the examples and you can download and/or
clone the project on your on your github
repo then I'll switch I all these things
are done with asciidoctor on ask you dr.
J mogul Vogue alia that creates has
really interesting tutorials it's they
are all them writing in ASCII dog Kronos
- and also the G hipster a mini book is
writing with asking doctor and ask Ian
ran red with asciidoctor
so what to expect in the future
this one is the semantic version just
check that we released one version every
six month basically when we can and this
is something that it's not so good in
terms of bug fixes so what we want to do
in the in the future is just using
semantic version so you can release when
there is some bug fixes then we'll
release the mineral version some bug
fixes worries I mean your version
instead of releasing like big chunks of
features every six month also we are
going to work hard on having semantic
HTML in the beginning the project takes
the asciidoc Python output as a
reference so everything was or is in
HTML 4 so what we want to do is move the
follow up with to HTML 5 so we can use
the semantic tags and this means that
you will be able to customize the output
easily or more easily in fact we started
working with this Jakob route stark
creating a template with HTML 5 so we
need just improve this and emerges to
the upstream house of the validation
this is something that always all all
people ask us that
hey I run the S key dog there are some
failures liked and include that it's not
found but the you know the built never I
mean that asciidoctor not never fails so
the build never fails and what we are
starting working is with excellent that
excellent
a tool that where you define your
grammar with some examples and so on so
far and then you try to compile this
grammar against
sources and then it gives you some
errors you can see here we created some
examples in this one we get one rule
with it's called Ling macro X which
basically well it's called insecurity a
rule sorry but basically will it does
its checks if all the HTTP
I mean HTTP includes our using HTTP and
if not failing this is the code and this
is what you will do you will do text
link all the adult files and if it first
it will I mean if there is some URL it's
not an HTTP it will say in this line
there is an illegal link to an unsecure
URL and they will fail and you will said
there is a mirror this is an improvement
that the community are trying to give us
and the final thing that probably nobody
hears have heard this before is isn't
taurah and taurah is a new open source
project from append device and basically
will impact the future of asciidoctor
and because tons of asciidoctor of
static site generators that are using
asciidoctor are correct are working but
they are not they're a suit for real big
projects and when i said this is that
unter is an open source a model
asciidoctor documentation tool chain and
were and and it gives you some kind of
workflow for technical writing teams to
create Manoj Collaborate earn remix and
polish documentation site and that
difference of all the sites or the
static site generators is that it came
from ability of personal content
repositories and this image I think that
summarizes really well unlike most of
our static site generators and Tara does
not assume that the content easing is
all in one place so you have several
modules server we get repo in this case
which can be get lab or github or even
local directory they clone everything
and then it says ok I'm
to take the branches where the
documentation is maybe you're you have
2.0 to zero and then you have another
brand with 3.0 at zero and at that time
you just want to create the
documentation for the version 2.0 2.0
and not for that 3.0 to zero so it's a
really good way to maintain the
documentation update across all the all
the brushes that you release and finally
it generates the assets and the asciidoc
pages and this is done by just using
this playbook ml file which basically
you said where the dimension will live
then the title and then you can set
where is the content you say the content
is in github the content is in this URL
and I want to generate for these
branches not I mean that I want to
change the condition for 2.5 3.0 and 301
and in case of the last example you said
I want to generate for all the versions
that have b2 and whatever and this is as
I said open source and you can go to get
clock get lab comm a slash on Torah and
you can clone the repo and then start
using it we need to I mean that we live
with the commentation we try to always
improve the commentation this is the
manual we receive it a lot of pork was
improving this recommendation with new
features with clarifications with things
that were wrong and in the future we
want to move this to Endora because now
this this repo contains all the
information from asciidoctor GS from
maven from asciidoctor J so we have all
been documentation in one place so what
we want to do is move this to aunt Ora
so as collector J will have its own
documentation maven plug-in mahjongg
documentation ask a lot of GS the term
documentation and then we don't or we
will bring all together and put generate
this output and Turin asciidoctor is the
future I mean that we are we both
projects are going to work together to
improve how
you write documentation thank you very
much hope that you enjoyed this new
features that you are going that going
to improve how you want to write the
commutation if you have any question we
have one minute or I will be here so I
can answer it do anyone okay well make a
review one you can come here to any for
any questions thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
