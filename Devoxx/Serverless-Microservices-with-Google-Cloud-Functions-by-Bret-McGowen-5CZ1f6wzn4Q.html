could not handle how awesome Google
cloud functions are so it's not the
first time that that has happened but
welcome my name is Bret McGowen I'm a
developer advocate at Google on the
Google cloud platform team I work in the
New York City office I you can reach me
in here Twitter on Twitter at at Brett
mcg so we'll talk a little bit today
about serverless micro services with
Google cloud functions and we'll talk
briefly about what is serverless briefly
about what micro services means in that
context and then we'll talk about most
of this about Google cloud functions
we'll do some live coding demos I'll
walk you to some slides should be a good
time so first we'll talk about micro
services I'm not going to like dwell on
this too much since I'm sure we're going
to hear a lot about this this week and
it conferences before but just at a high
level we're going to take our monolithic
application right and the goal here is
we want to split it out into micro
services for a variety of reasons so
some components have different release
schedules some components some services
are created by different development
teams and maybe they won't use a
different technology stack sometimes you
want to iterate more often you want to
release less often there's just
different needs of these of these
services right that's just kind of the
idea behind micro services but with that
comes a little bit of overhead you have
to have a whole deploy process for each
service and even if it's automated
there's still process you have to input
in place you have to understand how all
that works there's just overhead so a
good way to address this is serverless
and what is serverless obviously it
means there are no servers well of
course that's not true there are
hundreds thousands of servers running it
it's just abstracting this all from you
so the idea is you don't have to worry
about managing your infrastructure you
don't have to worry about managing your
runtime you don't have to worry about
patching your OS you just can deploy
your service and it's scales
automatically for you and it is managed
by someone else so you can focus
on writing your software and there are a
lot of definitions to what is serverless
and maybe what's the line between what
is a platform as a service what a
serverless
and I like to think of it as sort of the
shrinking point that you that you think
about scaling so if you just have a
bunch of virtual machines in the cloud
your scaling point tends to be virtual
machine so it's your enterprise level so
all the machines in your enterprise
that's your scaling point and if you
maybe make an acquisition or you have a
new department that moves into the cloud
that scales up your resources and then
you start moving into things like
containers and so maybe you can
containerize your application or service
and then if you kind of shrink that
scaling point down a little bit more to
a platform as a service which either can
be one application or potentially one
function but I think about serverless
as scaling at the function level when
micro services were all sort of at the
service level and that's where you do
your scaling that's that's the
definition I like so we're not going to
do a lot on what a service but just to
kind of give you like the philosophy
that I like so let's talk about Google
Cloud functions so this is a service
platform for building micro services
it's right now you write them in nodejs
and Google cloud platform I know I know
no js' more languages are on the roadmap
but right now no js' and there's a few
reasons we started an ojs one we have a
great relationship at Google with nodejs
we're on the node.js board and maybe
most importantly our engineers on the
chrome team created the v8 JavaScript
runtime engine so that JavaScript to run
very very quickly in the browser and for
years we've been we've been tuning and
squeezing as much performance as
possible out of v8 and nodejs uses that
v8 run time to run node apps and of
course NB a-- npm has a huge library of
functionality and modules that you can
include in your application and get a
lot of functionality out of the box that
maybe is already written
so now let's we're talking about cloud
functions and their types so there are
two types there are background functions
so these are things that respond to
certain events in the cloud so right now
in Google cloud we support
cause storage events and then also
pub/sub events and we'll talk a little
bit more about what those means later
and then secondly we can support
webhooks
de xira HTTP endpoints and once you
start talking about web hooks and HTTP
endpoints you can do things like respond
to a file that's uploaded in Google
Drive or when a new email comes in you
can respond to the attachment that's in
that email or maybe respond to the text
that's in the email you can respond to
calendar events you can hook into
ecosystems like if this then that which
opens up a whole world of things you can
have a function respond to like your
nest thermostat temperature goes up or
down or use something like stripe and
there's a payment event a payment a
credit card payment event has occurred
you get a text message and so on and so
on there's a whole ecosystem of these
things that cloud functions makes it
really easy to plug into so let's dig
into an HTTP function and what that
looks like so at its most basic level
it's only three lines of code which is
pretty cool so this is the node way of
creating a function and exporting it so
other libraries and modules can use it
we just say exports hello world equals
function hello world request response
and then response dot send so hello
London I forgot to update that to say
hello deadlocks but anyway so this is
the this is the minimum that you need to
do a cloud function and the request and
the response objects are strongly typed
or at least a strongly typed as you can
get in JavaScript which means if you've
done web development before you know the
request comes in with query string
parameters or JSON body or maybe forum
post values right and the response is
what you send back to the user and you
can do things like set a status code 200
to say everything is fine and then you
can actually send the text or the
message back to the client so the
requests like I said it kind of has
familiar concepts to you and cloud
functions will actually parse those so
if you have a request that comes in with
query string in query string parameters
in the URL or in the JSON body of the
request cloud functions will actually
require parse those out and make those
available to you
easily so like requests are queried
property name request up body name so
you don't have to actually parse that
JSON for you it's really nice and then
the response like I said before you can
just set the status codes in a response
all the normal things you might be able
to do in an HTTP world how do we do we
manage dependencies in cloud functions
the same way you do in any node.js
application through package.json this is
pretty similar you're probably seen this
before in other development environments
where you can kind of pin a library to a
specific version and major version a
minor version and so forth so alright
that's just kind of set up the
background let's kind of does it again
and do a live coding example to walk you
through this so I'm going to make an
HTTP endpoint just a basic hello world
alright and I'm going to attempt to do
the impossible which is I'm going to
start from nothing an empty directory so
wish me luck
so first we'll create an index J's file
now let's open this up and let's say X
whoops exports dot hello world equals
function request response and response
dot status 200 everything is good oops
dot send
hello dev ox but you know what I've
actually never liked hello world I'm
from Texas and we don't say hello say
howdy so let's say howdy world and howdy
dev box much better all right feel good
about that so I can go ahead and deploy
that but let's do something maybe a
little bit more complicated so let's add
a dependency here if you've done any
node.js before you know I can say npm in
it and it just this is an NPM thing to
create a package JSON which contains our
dependencies so this is not cloud
function specific so name howdy world
sounds good version
well not exactly let's say zero point
zero point one just barely functional
entry point that sounds good test like a
new good developer and skip that
keywords I will take credit for this
and I want this to go out on the
internet and become super famous so I
will license it and make an open-source
is this okay yes all right so now let's
take a look at our package JSON so this
is what it looks like we don't have any
dependencies yet so let's add one so
it's a NPM install Google Cloud debug -
- save so this does two things one it
installs the Google Cloud debug library
like locally in this directory and this
workstation and then the - - a save
means it will also add it to the package
JSON so if I flip back over to package
JSON you can see it's added this line
here automatically Google Cloud debug
and it's pinned it to version 0.9 point
0 so let's actually use this in our
application so require Google Cloud
debug oops and let's say I want maybe
this parameter to be customizable so
instead of always saying how DD box will
be able to pass in a query string
parameter so let name equals request
query name or if we don't give it one
then let's do dead box as a default and
we'll put it here name so now if I Pat
if I if I make this request and I pass
in a query string
it should say howdy whatever I pass in
and then you can do whatever you want so
I'll say mood equals request query -
mood or happy let is weather bee-utiful
equals false because I was outside today
and it is not and I will say if is not
if the weather is not beautiful then I'm
going to console that error
bad weather always know always breaks my
live demos all right and other than that
I'll do a console dot log I made it this
far with no errors right and then I pray
we get to that point all right so
there's a couple of things you can do
one
can deploy this live but the we want to
use like our natural workflow so there's
actually a cloud functions emulator so
I'm going to run that so functions just
called functions functions deploy from
this directory how do you world alright
so it created a local oops actually and
I want to trigger this with HTTP so we
talk about those different kinds ones
that are triggered by storage events
pub/sub events pub pub sup this with our
messaging cue system in google cloud but
this one is just going to be triggered
by HTTP so we can call in a browser we
can call it from the command line we can
curl it and so forth so you see that it
gives us a local endpoint so I'm going
to curl this and it should say howdy
devoxx and if I give it a name equals
Bret just howdy Bret okay so we feel
pretty good about that so let's do a G
cloud so now we're actually going to
deploy it up into the cloud so G cloud
functions deploy how do you world and
then there's a couple of ways you can
deploy your functions into Google Cloud
one of which is you can point it to like
a git repository that exists or
bitbucket or in Google cloud we have our
own like get get solution called Google
Cloud repositories or you can just
package up the coke the codes on your
workstation right here so we'll just do
that so I need to give it a stage bucket
so what this means is it's actually
going to zip up all the source code that
I have locally on this workstation
and put it into the binary blob store in
Google Cloud and we call it a bucket so
it's going to it's going to zip up all
of my code and put it into the bucket
that I define and I have one here just
called functions source and we want this
to be a triggered by HTTP all right so
while that is deploying I do want to I
want to go back to the to the idea that
we want to use a normal workflow um so
I'm in Visual Studio code here and
Visual Studio code has some pretty nice
debugging tools for nodejs so we just
want to be able to use those so I'll
just set a breakpoint and
and then add debugging configuration
that looks good just take the default
and I want to attach to a running
process so we're going to attach to the
locally running emulator of cloud
functions so we've got cloud functions
that runs in the cloud and we've got the
local emulator that's designed just for
your development purposes but the ideas
your functions look the same like on
your local workstation as I do in the
cloud so it's easier to debug so let me
start this and what was that in point do
I have it yes so how do you world an
equals me all right and it hits that
breakpoint and this is your normal
debugging experience I don't if you've
done a lot of nodejs before this is
actually pretty nice to be able to step
through in a real debugger I know you
all in the Java world take this for
granted but but but we it's it's nice
and new for us so this gives you all the
normal debugging things here so you know
we can add a watch for whatever
variables we want we can poke around in
the request object see what primers have
come in and so forth so let me step
through this that all looks good and if
we go back to the command line you can
see how do you me so one thing I do want
to point out is that Google Cloud
functions will automatically map your
console dot error and your console
dialogue so these are the normal like
JavaScript node way of outputting things
to the console it'll automatically map
those to the cloud logger so you get
like one place to look and all of your
logs from all of your cloud functions
and actually from all of your Google
cloud platform project products so I do
want to say point out real quick when I
did that deploy what do we what do we
get with cloud functions right so with
my three lines of code I mean I actually
added a few more but at the minimum
three lines of code what happened when I
deployed that live into the cloud one we
get an HTTP endpoint with a fully
qualified domain so we can hit that
endpoint from anywhere in the world it
dynamically creates an SSL cert so we
can do all of our traffic over HTTP as
we should it gives you all the nice
serverless things like no worrying about
infrastructure scales like for you
automatically it's really really nice
and a lot of things that we do
have to worry about that we don't want
to as developers so I mentioned that it
Maps all of our logging to what we call
stock driver logging Google cloud
logging and then also error reporting so
a lot of times the way we find about
find out about errors in our application
is either someone goes spelunking
through the logs and dig through all the
error messages and tries to figure out
what are some common patterns or a user
or an end user reports it to us right
and that's that's terrible so error
reporting actually is kind of uses
machine learning essentially to watch
your error logs constantly and if it
sees certain patterns
it'll elevate those and it can send
those to you in an email or just to the
UI in the dashboard so that's pretty
nice so let me I guess we never actually
hit it in production so let's do that so
here is the deploy screen and you can
see it gives you a whole bunch of
information I'll just kind of walk you
through this G cloud functions command
real quick so I can do G cloud functions
list this shows me all the functions
that I have in my account so here's the
howdy world one that we just added so G
cloud functions describe how do you
world and it has a few things so one I
mentioned like I said earlier if you're
deploying from local local workstation
it zips up your source code so this is
actually where that zip file lives so
you need to know exactly what version of
the code you're running and then here's
the HTTP trigger so if I do a curl on
that I should see howdy-doo box oh and
one thing I didn't do is I did not add
oh good comminute mmm howdy world and
then like any good developer I'm not
going to do a pull request I'm just
going to push right into origin/master
and if you don't like it you can deal
with it I promise my code is good yeah
that never flies so I deployed it live
and then yeah so we can we can hit the
end point either by curling it or we can
actually hit it in the browser so let's
do that
let's put in that URL hope you can read
that I'm going to say another name
equals
super devoxx all right how do you sleep
for dead box so I do want to show you
what that cloud debug package does that
I just added so it enables something
called stack driver debug and whoops let
me click the wrong thing since I just
pushed my source code up I can actually
browse so I have here how do you world
so here's the code that I just pushed up
make that a little bit bigger so we can
see it and you'll notice it actually let
me click here as if it were a breakpoint
well isn't that curious because so I'm
going to click on this line seven here
this if not weather is beautiful and I'm
going to refresh and you'll notice it
highlighted that line would why is that
is because it's actually treating it
like a breakpoint so it's not a
breakpoint in the sense that it doesn't
stop your application from running like
you'll see I I still got my response
back from the server so instead of super
dev ox I'll say mega super dev ox so
just getting crazier and crazier so it
hit this to hit this log point we call
it but it's pretty cool because you have
all these things you can take a look at
name happy mood falls you can look at
the request object you can look at the
response object and I'm doing this all
in production without having to redeploy
without having to add a ton of
breakpoints and a ton of log points it's
super super powerful and in fact
stackdriver debugging works not just on
google cloud but anywhere you can run
your application code so if you're
running on premise if you're running it
on AWS you can actually debug this live
and of course the next question people
ask is like well doesn't that kill your
performance and it actually doesn't so
when you don't have sort of let me
disable this log point so when you don't
have any log points set there's
essentially no discernible impact to the
performance of your application when you
do have a break point set a log point
set there's a very minor hit but it's
essentially the same amount of hit as if
you were doing a console dialogue as if
you were outputting some kind of
variable so it's really really powerful
for hunting things down
in production without having to I mean
we've done this before right where
there's some weird edge case in
production and you think you haven't
narrowed it down so you add a bunch of
console.log or a bunch of printf
statements you redeploy it you wait for
that to happen you realize okay I've
made it a little further along the chain
so but I still don't know the error so
let me add some more print apps and do a
redeploy and every time you do to do
that in production there's overhead and
that's risk so it's really awesome to be
able to actually to be able to set these
log points in production and stackdriver
debugger is super cool like I said you
can run it anywhere in this case I have
my source code uploaded to Google Cloud
but you don't have to you can point it
to github for example you actually can
do it all locally like right in your
browser so that no source code actually
gets uploaded to Google Cloud or to
anywhere so it all happens right there
in your browser maybe don't do it with
like a you know 100,000 line JavaScript
file but but that's pretty cool as well
so yes and we enabled that production
debugging in production with just one
line of code so that was this require
Google Cloud debug and with that we
automatically got stackdriver debugger I
love stock driver debugger if you can't
tell I use it all the time so now let's
talk about background functions so these
are things that are triggered by events
in the cloud and the two events we have
in Google cloud platform right now are
cloud storage which is for binary files
and then pub/sub so first we'll look at
cloud storage so how you deploy it very
similar to how you deploy the HTTP
triggered one that we saw a second ago
the only difference is you give it a
trigger or you give it a bucket to
trigger on and again a bucket is the
blob storage term we have in Google
Cloud so anytime a file gets uploaded
deleted edited replaced so forth
you'll get your cloud function will get
triggered and here's what that code
looks like so here we're going to
analyze this image and the function
signature is slightly different there's
a context and then there's a data so the
context is how I can report back coming
back up how I can report back to cloud
functions whether my function was
successful or whether it failed and then
data is actually the incoming data from
the event so in this case think
case the file change event from cloud
storage oops
and so what is actually in that data
does I'm not going to go through all
these fields but basically there's a few
things the resource state exists so if
this finally been deleted that event
would say deleted and so forth content
type image JPEG and media link down
there we'll use this references here in
a second that's if you want to if you're
uploading a file and you made it public
this is how you would reference that
file the other cloud event we have is
pub sub so pub sub is our publisher
subscriber message queuing system in
Google cloud platform it's fully managed
it's really really scalable for any sort
of incoming outgoing
a lot of people use it for IOT for
example to stream thousands and
thousands of events into into pub sub
and anything that's an HTTP anything
they can make an HTTP request can be a
publisher and can be a subscriber so
it's a really nice way to connect all
the pieces of your application you
trigger it similarly instead of a
trigger bucket you give a trigger topic
so when you publish a message in pub sub
you have to associate it with a trunk
with a topic when you subscribe to pub
sub you subscribe you listen to a topic
so what this means is any time something
comes in under football news I will say
this is the soccer form of football
then my cloud function is going to
respond and here's what it looks like
again very similar we have a context so
can report back success or failure and
we have the data that contains the
actual data that comes in in that
pub/sub message and pub/sub is like
completely customizable by you so
whatever is to JSON whatever JSON you
put in there you'll have access here to
under message so have team name fight
and footballers they exist in London and
they're currently ranked number one in
the world so how we might we put these
up how might we put these together if I
have time to do this live demo but so I
say upload a file say this photo of an
adorable raccoon cloud functions would
get triggered I will take that image it
will send it to the cloud vision API and
we'll turn back some kind of response so
here cloud vision API says this is
99% sure that it is a raccoon and then a
bunch of other different confidences so
if you know what Google cloud vision API
is super cool I won't get into the
details but just at a high level it does
a bunch of things like label detection
which is what it just did
so it's you give it a photos you label
this photo what is this a photo of is it
a photo of a raccoon or a cheetah or a
person face detection OCR can extract
text from an image explicit content so
it can tell you if your image is adult
or violent it can detect if it's a
landmark famous landmark and what the
landmark is you can detect logos image
property is a whole bunch of stuff and
here's what the code looks like so the
analyzed image function we had earlier
we're just going to require a Google
Cloud vision library and then we're
going to call vision detect labels and
then we're going to give it that data
media link that I referenced earlier so
that's is this is the URL so the vision
API can pick up that image and run
analysis on it and then we're just going
to iterate through all the labels and
label it the description and then the
confidence score so it'll look something
like this
so I took this photo so it is 92%
labeled a confidence label it's black
81% than this stage and and so forth so
I am going to ask you to do an
interactive demo normally it's rude to
text during a demo but it would be
pretty cool if you can text this number
so 3 to 4 60 20 20 55 if you have a us
number it won't work
but I think if it's otherwise you should
be good and I'll show you what this is
about to do so if you text this number
and I kept it up here at the bottom and
text text how you're feeling about devic
so far how you're feeling about the day
the weather Google odd functions my
awesome shirt whatever whatever you're
feeling at this moment text it to that
number so if I text it for example
deadlocks is such an amazing event it's
going to go to Twilio Twilio provides a
web hook so in that web hook I'm going
to pasted the URL of of a function that
I wrote just like a row 1 you know 10
minutes ago
exact same situation so Twitter's going
to call that web hook
and interweb in the cloud functions the
cloud function is going to run so
instead of passing it to the vision API
it's going to pass it to the natural
language API which is similar it's a
machine learning back API from Google
that does a lot of things it can analyze
entities in your in your text it can
analyze sentiment so that's what we're
going to do it's going to send you back
an emoji whether you're feeling happy or
sad based on your sentiment it's going
to stream this all into bigquery which
is Google server this big data analytics
warehouse tool and then it will send a
response back to you with the
appropriate emoji so did anyone try it a
couple all right anyone get a response
all right good deal
so let's actually take a look at what
people send I know that's dangerous
but all right so all right awesome sure
thank you howdy but traffic is messy as
this morning keep hanging in so let's
look at what this looks like so this is
just this is just a what came back from
then from the natural language API so
we've got a this huge JSON blob and it
has a bunch of things like it says
grumpy is an adjective
I'm not going to go and this is not a
talk about natural language API but as
you can see it gets really is a huge one
is someone text me like a giant novel
okay come on come on but you can kind of
see it's basically breaks down all the
entities and everything in your message
and then it gives you a polarity so
negative 100 so where negative 100 is
extremely negative like I hate
everything and 100 is extremely positive
so I love everything so now we're going
to run a query to see whether people did
whether people in general wrote positive
or negative things so polarity is all
right and 28 positive to 8 negative all
right everyone is feeling pretty good
overall
let's see what's another query we'll run
anyone text any emojis all right just
one well let's see if this let's see if
this works
so what this is doing in bigquery just
so you know it's actually going to live
on the fly parse all that JSON every
time rizona clothings about bigquery is
you can give it literally billions of
rows and you can do crazy string
manipulation because it splits up your
query into tons of jobs and runs them
all in parallel so you basically could
run full text full JSON parsing over
literally billions of rows and get back
responses in like 30 seconds a minute
things that might normally take a normal
sequel server hours or days so let's run
this it's not really designed to work
over tiny all right so we've got a few
emoji so we've got the sweating emoji
the I think that's a kissing heart emoji
the laughing tool crying emoji and then
the sunglasses emoji so thank you for
doing that I appreciate your interaction
so what do we cover today a little bit
about what a serval is what our
micro-service is I want you kind of
threw some nodejs
development processes how you can use
what you normally use locally and then
also debug on the cloud we walk through
the different kinds of cloud functions
and yeah we talked about the college
functions we'll take your your functions
scale it up and scale it down and manage
it for you so as a developer you don't
have to worry about any of that that's
all I have so called functions is in
alpha right now if you want to sign up
this is a special link it is actually an
invitation-only alpha so if you just go
to college functions and sign up you
will not get in you have to know someone
luckily I am someone so if you want to
take a picture of this I can like
photobomb your your URL but if you want
to know more cloud.google.com slash
functions and that is all I have thank
you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
