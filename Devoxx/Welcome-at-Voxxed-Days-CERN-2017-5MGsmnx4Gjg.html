and they started then so hello everyone
and welcome to Vox if they serve hi Josh
so after several months of preparation
the day has finally arrived
we're very happy to have been here to
host Vox if they serve and I hope you
have a great time in have a great show
here so as some of you know Vox today
the spin-off of the Vox conference
we're not the largest development office
in the world the devotee Vox devoxx
ground and Vox today's is a one-day
event organised by local community and
sponsored by the devoxx team so if you
have heard about TED Talks you can think
of devoxx has been Ted's and Vox ed is
being TEDx so in the penty organized
events a lot of communities but now
before delving any further into details
about the reparative talk for this let's
watch a video to try to better
understand how oxidase came to CERN
quite literally
step it over there carrying the banner
all right so now I'd like to invite on
stage
Steffan Jensen from the vox belgian mike
hazel from devoxx UK and Mario Fusco and
Federico from vaak siddhi Zurich so
welcome guys
so without these guys this event would
not have come to be they are the main
reason for his take place in fact I went
to Zurich last year to join as a speaker
for a quickie talk there and I
questioned these guys why there was a
Vox today's Zurich why there was a Vox
days Ticino but nothing in this area
right there's nothing in its corner
where it's boxy days Geneva writes so I
invited them to come over there's a gear
for sure let's go to some tomorrow no
problem so that they have Lee took the
train to come here in the morning we
showed them around go to others go to
the center as well the cyclists
psychotron and then basically at the
lunch
and on the spots we decide let's do Vox
if they sure in fact next year they
decide exactly at that time so that's
some what about this yeah Stefan I think
first of all this is the epicenter of
science right so everybody feels really
at home I'm very excited about it and I
think the the moment you goddess was
like yeah we can probably arrange going
down on the ground with the speakers and
when you said that okay anything else
it's just the T exactly I go an event so
for me that is the motivation all right
it's very very easy to convince a few
other rock star speakers or actually
commit so that's great I'm a bit
overwhelmed to be honest with you I mean
there's so much history just here on
this spot Jerry was telling me who's
spoken on this spot before and that made
me a little nervous because I haven't
got anything as interesting as they had
to say but I mean I've been running
around for about four months now just
geekly at home kind of every now and
then jumping up and down in excitement
about this very moment now so and so
much energy and commitments gone into
this from everybody Jarrell in
particular I feel like with Skype best
buddies now because I just hope that you
will really enjoy what's been curated
all of the speakers that have come in
today
who I know are super excited about
coming and talking to you so enjoy your
day really I cannot believe that a mere
I was saved right now to Federico
look we're at all the way from internet
and now we are here I'm very happy and
yes we did the box earth day Zurich two
days ago we are here and we will do the
next one in Ticino in the first Saturday
of May so of course everybody's
welcoming field you want to attempt
thank you Mario
and yes it's really amazing to be here
in this place really we got inspired
many ways with one slide in particular
at devoxx with the picture of atlas in
at that moment we thought that drow we
started thinking and everything just
went through perfectly so enjoy the day
the talks will be great leave the event
as a community event contribute as you
want participate then give your
feedbacks
next year so now we covered the German
Cantone the French one they tell anyone
foreign when they shouldn't even insured
for the home unsure language we have to
copy we have to cover it as well
so thank you so much for all your
support guys and in particularly Stefan
is Valen Marc because they got all these
rock star speakers here so Justin here
stuff you guys hear that they got even
from us yesterday we lost just like I
imagined so thanks so much Stefan from
devoxx UK and Marc for organizing all
these speakers to come here today
all right so it's just talking about
skills so it's casually in fact often
back of your badge so you have here the
full schedule for the events we're gonna
have two parallel tracks one right here
minor detour into the largest room okay
and the other one is the constant
chamber so for those of you who've never
been to CERN the council-chamber is just
a nice quarter on the other side okay
just keep walking one minute walk you'll
be there all right and there's also the
digital panel on the main area where the
coffee was which has directions if
candidate loss of where the menu item is
and where the council-chamber is okay so
there were however some last-minute
changes okay so tree shaggy
unfortunately had to cancel her talk but
we already found an excellent
replacement secret so Mario Fusco
another Java champion rock star speaker
offered to talk on her behalf so we'll
talk about how to apply the classic Gang
of Four is on patterns in a functional
way using lambdas and then in the
afternoon
also ribbon ring I've had to cancel his
talk he got sick so we're gonna have
instead a panel with Derek Stefan
leaders the head of computer science
computer security sorry at CERN also
Audrina verbal of the speakers then of
the luca the cofounder devoxx for kids a
mosrite to bite down hard occur so
you're gonna be in the castle chamber
okay in the last session of the day and
then of course at lunch time six quick
sessions from cern engineers so we're
talking about things such as how the
cern protect themselves from security
threats from the outside also how to use
java on the accelerator complex of the
LHC here at cern about big data observed
so seriously cool topic so if I left
recommend that he have a quick lunch and
come back quickly to see these talks
they're gonna take place as well on the
merit Orion and on the council-chamber
two parallel tracks for the CERN talks
and just to finalize some quick
practical information so the official
hashtag for the event is VDC seven teams
of oxidizer and seventeen so please do
tweet your impressions in there and
pictures of the events our twitter
handle is vox at cern in case you don't
follow it already please do

of the talks throughout the day over
there and of course the food so right
after the keynote there'll be some nice
breakfast nice croissants
Porsha Cola all the Swiss goodies over
there in the common area outside so it
just makes sure you grab one over there
all right
lunch will take place in the circle
cafeteria so the one I go to every day
the famous restaurant one we have three
at CERN so they'll be both a vegetarian
and non-vegetarian option so if for
those of you have the voucher just go
downstairs grab a lunch and one more
thing we'd like as well to announce that
tomorrow thermal hosts for the first
time the first edition of devoxx wickets
CERN so we'll have 72 kids coming
tomorrow at the Sun glow of science and
idea square will do several workshops to
them you're gonna teach them how to
program how to do electronics in a fun
and practical way using robots such as
the Nairobi TC over there Dewey knows
minecraft you're gonna teach him how to
do HTML pages so Susie cool stuff and
now onto the keynote so Derek will tell
us a little history about our universe
isn't that right Derek that's right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
