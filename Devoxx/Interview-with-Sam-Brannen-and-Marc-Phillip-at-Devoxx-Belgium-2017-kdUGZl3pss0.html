talking to salmon mark developers the
day unit five is definitely a platform
and so exciting we've got J unit 5
released people are using it and what
kind of features can people look forward
to well there's a lot of changes right
coming in from from Janet for the basis
is basically the same like annotation
approach you know for tests and stuff
like that but we have some new features
we can use with with Java 8 rights to
land expressions and method references
so for things like asserting an
exception instead of having that can
expected exception annotations like that
you can have it in a little lambda
expression and similarly for for
timeouts stuff like that and maybe want
to talk about dynamic Jess is also a
major point I would say so all
extensions are actually composable can
implement mobile interfaces for
extensions we use those that's a major
major change to what we had enjoyment
for yeah and actually the kind of the
programming model meets the extension
model a bit more and in Jane advisors
he's mentioned there's more options were
extending the framework and developers
can use that on their own for things
like dynamically deciding whether or not
a test should be executed we call that a
conditional test execution and
developers could have like special
annotations that say um only run this
test on Mac OS or only run this on Java
9 or Java 2 and stuff like that so
there's lots of things that are much
easier to do with jana 5 and it would
have been done would have been the case
yeah definitely so JUnit 4 is still
backwards compatible to Java 5 so it
can't use any of the new nice features
and now we have lots of new api's like
super Sam Manchus mentioned the third
throws way connect check for an
exception given a code block and this
code block can just now be a lambda
expression right and lots of places
where you also use suppliers like for
computing area messages only when we
need them because most of the times the
test will pass right and then you
shouldn't be able to have to display
that area message so that makes sense
yeah
and another thing with land expressions
right so in Jena for you could have
liked a parametrized test right so have
a different way to run different ways to
run the same test but with lambda
expressions we have something even more
powerful called dynamic tests with Jane
and Jupiter so you can have a test
factory where you create like a stream
or a collection of tests on the fly and
you decide programmatically with those
tests made up like the actual code
that's gonna be executed as the test
body and the test name and things like
that so we definitely have some some
more opportunities with jelly myself
when you so I have to say a dynamic
environment but I want to validate
different parts of the environment so
I'm using a unit for say okay one of the
reasons I'm asking these questions so
sounds like it's got a lot of leverage
so a unit and how can people get the
most from it the most it's a good
question right yeah it's uh so I would
say basically you know start off with
your unit testing like you normally
normally would but if you have needs for
something dynamic maybe you're pulling
stuff from like the database or like out
of a CSV file or something like that you
want you might want to take it take
advantage of these dynamic tests and
things like that
I'm also the extension model is much
richer than it was in June of four so
maybe the average developer wouldn't use
that so much but maybe for more of a
senior level developer in your team and
you want to provide some common
functionality for tests within the
ecosystem of all your applications then
you might find the essential model much
more powerful you want to look into that
yeah you can now combine things you
couldn't previously combine easily like
spring and parameterize tests for
example so all the extensions really are
meant to be used together and I think
that's where the power comes from but we
are aware that most people will have
some large test Suites written in Jane
at 4 or even Janie 3 for that matter and
so we provide a gentle migration path so
we could write new tests in Jane in five
try it out see how it feels and then
migrate all sold tests one by one or and
that's not even the migration tool which
is not written by us but by someone else
or from the community to migrate all the
tests so that's lots of options there to
just try it and doesn't hurt
we hope yeah and actually getting back
to the first thing you said you said the
Jane 2/5 platform right so actually
there's no a platform it's not just the
testing framework Jane and Jupiter's the
new testing framework for programming a
program model an extension model there's
actually an underlying platform now so
people can write different testing
frameworks like there's already some out
there for like Scala and groovy and
cotton and stuff like that like spec C
and inspecting some other things so
along those lines we also have support
for running Jana three tests and Jana
for tests and JT five tests or any of
these other testing frameworks all at
the same time on this new Jana platform
so that's also another big plus for the
community
thank you famous okay thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
