know this but I have a special surprise
to start things out
we had a UH we had a very special thing
happen at JavaOne I went and nominated J
hipster for a Dukes Choice Award and I
packed it all the way here oh and so I
brought this for Julian and Deepu and
it's pretty heavy so I don't want to
take it home so we'll set it right on
here and you get to take it home
congratulations to J hipster and you
guys thank you alright so today we're
gonna talk about angular and react and
we'd like to start off by by asking a
few questions but first we'll introduce
ourselves
Deepu onto the ring okay
Deepu i mad cow I love JavaScript so I
would like to call myself javascript
evangelist so I currently live in India
I'm originally from in sorry I currently
live in Netherlands I'm marginally from
India so I would like to call myself a
programmer with the soldering end
because I'm originally an electrical
engineer I become programmer
accidentally probably like most of you
I'm the co-lead of Jay hipster it's a
very popular Java development platform
currently writing a book about it with
Sandra Kumar and it's available for
pre-order front packed check it out if
you're interested I work for severe apps
we build DevOps products I was told that
we are giving huge companies run for
their money
I'm very honored to be here with Matt
I'm gonna go all Undertaker on him so my
name is Matt rebel I'm a hick from the
sticks I grew up in the backwoods of
Montana no electricity no running water
had to use an outhouse had to wait for
my dad to warm up the seat and stuff
like that when I was a kid I'm a web
framework aficionado I like web
frameworks I like to play with them all
I like
and source have been doing open source
and using open source for about 15 years
now I work for octa as a developer
advocate acht as a company that
basically has authentication in the
cloud or user management in the cloud
I love Volkswagens buses and vans if you
have a similar obsession with
Volkswagens I'd love to talk to you
after and I also am a java hipster I
work on the Java hipster project as well
so what about you we'd like to hear
about the audience and what your
experience is so how many folks are Java
developers that's almost everyone except
for that guy how many people consider
themselves web developers it's about
three-quarters of the room who likes
JavaScript it's only half okay it's like
I asked that question five years ago at
devoxx and it was like 10% so we're
doing better than that
how many people like typescript okay
that's a little more than JavaScript
who's a fan of angular yeah baby and
that's about half the room how about
react yeah not as many 25% okay and any
fans of UJS it's another popular run
okay that's that's only like 10th and
even though you put up two it only
counts as one okay so how many people
are Java hipsters how many people have
used Jay hipster just curious about that
okay there's only 10 or 15 yeah good you
know so today's agenda we'll be talking
about the history of angular and react
just to kind of show you how they came
to be and and then we'll talk about
learning I'm give you a little hello
world example with each and we'll talk
about our favorite and not so favorite
features of each and and then we'll have
the actual Smackdown right we plan on on
getting down and dirty there and then
we'll give you a bunch of statistics and
pretty graphs give some information
about how the to compare and then we'll
finally give our recommendation at the
end ok so before we start on to the
let's quickly see rise of so-called MVC
frameworks
yeah so after 2010 there was a huge rise
in a mr. frame-ups also called mvvm
frameworks and before that we all know
that we used jQuery for pretty much
everything right so those are I think
the first one which kind of had a
framework for building web apps and
stuff like that
followed by backbone and knockout J's
but they didn't make it that big
but then came angular and it becomes
like so popular so client-side a medium
you know became a thing so Angela was
released in 2010 react followed in 2013
so they are kind of huge now and they
kind of made the SBA's and you know a
mediums the thing like that even Java
developers started alright and they
became very popular and they're still
popular today which is rare in
JavaScript land right these things have
been around for you know 17 years now so
but what it's given rise to is what they
call JavaScript fatigue all right
there's a new framework I gotta go learn
something new but I think a lot of this
really subsided in 2015 like because of
the rise of frameworks like angular and
react they got popular enough and
stabilized enough that people didn't
feel like they needed to learn a new one
so I don't feel that this is really as
true anymore but let's see what you
think how many people feel a little bit
of JavaScript fatigue too many
frameworks it's about half the room so
it's still there so the history of
angular it started out as angularjs in
2009 by mieszko hevery and basically he
was working at Google and I don't know
if you know this but he worked for a
company that got bought by Google and
they had angular as their way of
building apps and basically what
happened was that he had built this
system which allowed you to actually
build apps without any JavaScript at all
it was just meant to be an HTML
framework that built apps and JavaScript
was the powering mechanism behind making
it happen
so he was working on a project and
they're using GWT also known as gwit
from
and it took three developers six months
to develop it and he was really
frustrated with the process he was
probably frustrated with Java being you
know the language of choice for
everything so he was like I'm gonna go
and try it with my framework and he did
and he was able to write everything by
himself in three weeks that had taken
three developers six months so it was
very successful out of the gate at least
for implementing what he wanted to
implement so the big thing that happened
with angularjs was it got super popular
and at its peak the whole team said hey
let's rewrite it and let's not make it
backwards compatible we've known a few
other frameworks in Java land that have
done that tapestry is one i'm struts did
it right when they went to struts - and
we all know that's a terrible idea
angular seems to be kind of surviving
but it often kills a framework when they
actually do that and don't make it
backwards compatible so that happened in
2014 and then it took them two years to
actually release angular - last
September and then now we have angular 5
we'll probably have angular 6 in January
next year so don't call it angular 2
don't call it angularjs it's just
angular now so with angular it's pretty
easy to do hello world with angularjs
you would just basically have ten lines
and an HTML file you'd have a script tag
to pull everything in and then you know
you can manipulate things from there
well with angular it's basically using
components which is a decorator you know
it as an annotation in Java LAN but it's
a decorator in typescript and it the
selector matches that HTML tag at the
bottom and then there's a template for
your HTML or you can point to a template
a URL to an external file and then you
have an export class app component and
that's just es6 there's nothing specific
about typescript there and then once you
have that you can you can load it with a
module and then you can actually
bootstrap that module mad it's like
three fuzz four hello would I know it's
not as cool as angularjs in that sense
but hey you know what you do use angular
CLI and it makes it a little easier
write an angular CLI gets you started I
do think it's kind of unfortunate that
you need 10 to 15 files just to get
started but that's the way the world is
with with angular nowadays
so for react was originally created by
Jordan walk in 2011 and Google I mean
Facebook has been using it internally
for a while and then they deserve to
open-source it in 2013 in me it was it
was said that it was inspired by angular
as well as by xhp its HTML components
library for PHP within a year it had
huge sites you know implementing it
because of the the no performance gain
on scale which was promised by react and
which was delivered by reactor focus so
people like Khan Academy New York Times
Airbnb of course Facebook Instagram they
all started using it and and now if you
see there are a lot of huge sites using
react including watts of Facebook
Instagram like you know like Netflix and
so on right and they've done a good job
in their versioning right because
they're like hey where's version 16 so
that means we're you know way better
than angular they jump from point 15 or
point something to point like you know
point 15 like do it I think the most
interesting thing was Jordan Wright the
guy who started this is his Twitter
profile and if you actually search for
him on Google Images he's not there
either and you go to get hope he's got
the same picture you go on Facebook and
you can find him yeah all right so he's
the either a Anti Google as far as I can
tell
apparently Jordan is not a function or
an image so let's see a hello world with
react so basically you are import the
libraries then you just say hey react
Dom render this for me on this element
that's it met seven lines yeah there's a
great video from Eric Vasanti if you
want to start learning reactor it's very
good so you can you can try that if you
like so are you ready to rumble all
right so we're going to take the
smackdown term from the WWF in the in
the US I don't know I asked deep about
it and he heard
in India so I assume like a lot of you
folks have heard about it as well
yeah it's it's but it's also kind of
fake yeah really live that very lately
no right it's these big guys and it's
entertainment they actually made them
rename it from WWF as a Federation to
entertainment right and so even though
we're doing a Smackdown we're not
actually hoping to put each other down
and actually you know do that so we hope
to do a friendly comparison of
techniques and and see what you guys
think as well so we we hope to take this
little pull and this little sticker here
and I'm gonna write on the back and
we'll see what you guys vote for and
then we'll see what we vote for and
hopefully at the end we'll come to some
sort of conclusion but we're not
promising a conclusion we're just
promising that we'll have votes and
we'll see what the crowd thinks do you
know if the kid I used to believe that
Undertaker had nine legs yeah yeah so
let's talk about react to a Sangalo okay
so we're gonna get you to vote yeah
already you're voting arms ready to go
here we go so the first thing we talked
about was was with CL eyes you saw with
angular react has something similar with
create react app it generates an app for
you and allows you to get started with
yarn start pretty easy so with angular
CLI use ng new app name but this
generates pretty big application it's
got tests it's got external templates
and stuff like that in it with with
react it's only got three dependencies
in it so of course it's faster and
slimmer and smaller of course it is and
that's right that's why the create react
app if you use it you get basic app
basic dependencies but if you want more
there are some templates like if you
want type script that's template for
type script but of course it is not as
powerful as languidly it doesn't have
all those cool generate component and
stuff like that you see that command at
the bottom you can use ng generate or
you can just use G and generate
components and services and pipes and
stuff like that so that's built into the
tool that's pretty slick
I'm also uses typescript but by default
and if you want to do just es6
javascript with angular good luck
because it just isn't that much
documentation out there
how to do it the only person that I know
that's actually done it is Venkat and
you guys know that van cats amazing and
he probably had to learn that all on his
own right instead of actually reading
documentation to do it so if you're
gonna do angular I recommend just
sticking the typescript because it's
well documented yeah for reactivity zo6
by default but as I said Lee can also do
typescript and you know they also have
their own like Facebook zone flow which
is it syntactically it's very similar to
typescript so you can also use that on
top of es6 for static type checking but
if you use minimal with angular CLI 225
lines of code all right a lot less so we
kind of win there but what do you have
you have that readme file they have a
1,500 line readme file with create react
app so it's it's a readme man it's gonna
read me so it's documentation that
developers are gonna read right if it's
anywhere else besides readme probably
not gonna read me but you'll read in the
readme so but then we did some checking
right with lighthouse which is a tool
for Chrome that you can see what your
progressive web apps core and
progressive web apps or web apps that
can work offline right they have service
workers and stuff like that so angular
didn't do so well it actually doesn't
have this built-in by default so it only
gets like an 18 and development and a 36
in production versus create react app
has it in there by default was to be
good because it's the official P so with
angular CLI you should know this if use
in 1.5 which just came out last week and
you try to use the Service Worker stuff
you do npm install at sign angular slash
service - worker it actually will fail
because they made a critical mistake
when they release the CLI that they
forgot to actually upgrade the Service
Worker dependency so it'll say hey this
doesn't work so you have to do 1 0-0
beta is 16 so now you know so now we'd
like to talk about our favor angular
features but at the same time I just
want to see from the crowd so how many
people like dependency injection yeah
it's a good number how many people like
the angular CLI ok not as many but still
a good crowd what about the generation
of components or pipes or anything like
that
kind of use it a little bit the
directory layout and the structure of
everything okay so I love the dependency
injection as well
I love angular CLI before the CLI
basically all the QuickStart guides at
Google had were copy and paste ten files
and try to do this yourself and they all
use system jazz and even all the angular
seeds out there still use system jazz
and we all know web packs better maybe a
little more magical but it works really
well and that's kind of the new hotness
and JavaScript land as a Java developer
the thing that really appealed to me
even with angularjs was like controllers
and services and just the separation of
concerns that way
same thing with angular 5 and above as
you know you still have components you
still services it's kind of easy to test
things how to separate them the two-way
binding and typescript I've grown to
love and I think ionic framework is
pretty cool in the sense that you can
take everything you know with typescript
and angular and produce mobile apps the
web pack waiting is new and a little
tough it seems weird that my front-end
takes longer to compile to mydaq backend
it was never that way before like that's
a new ballgame
the searchability angular versus
angularjs and all these stats we gather
right are we getting just angular or we
get an angularjs included in that since
the name is so similar and then who went
through the 2016 last year release
candidates and tried to use those so a
few of us need to go and like have beers
after and like you know be be happy that
we made it through there because that
was so painful they would break things
between release candidates you don't do
that you just called a beta and then you
can break stuff right so that was
definitely painful and not well done and
then the testing infrastructure it's
pretty verbose now that I figured it out
it works ok but you know mocking stuff
and creating new providers and stuff can
be a bit painful No
same for react I mean before I tell you
what my favorite and no not so favorite
features are any react
fans or people who use react here
okay ready for outnumbered man oh yeah
like ten yeah okay fifteen at least for
those ten how many of you like j6 none
oh we got five yeah there are few okay
how many of you like the one way binding
okay
how many of you like the state
management of react with red X and stuff
like that and not bad so what I like or
love about react is definitely like one
way binding I like one way binding most
of the times virtual dome which is very
good like it improves performance
compared to angular this is a killer
feature of react JSX most of the times
it's good it lets you do all your normal
JavaScript stuff that you know you don't
have to learn any new expression
language syntax or anything you can do
normal JavaScript flexibility react is
extremely flexible because it's just a
small library you can do use it with
whatever you want so you can mix and
match whatever you like you can create
your own I know framework and stuff like
that and it is component base so
everything is a component you can
compose them you can like you know use
them together it's possible in angular
as well but reacting in react it's more
natural it's it's it's and you have down
the opponent's sorry yeah ends amount
and dumb component so like dumb
components doesn't have to know anything
they're they're so simple and they still
work yeah and I don't think in angular
you can do everything in angular smart
yeah there's no dumb component and of
course react native I mean I mean there
is nothing in angular that can react
beat react native react native is
actually native right it's more so than
it's not using Cordova or anything like
that so it's definitely a pretty cool
and things I don't like one-way binding
I like one way binding most of the names
but not when you are dealing with forms
and stuff
no like because you have to write a
binding yourself or everything which is
kind of annoying at some times in
angular
it does it for you so it works so unless
you run into performance issues that's
good so here of course you have to do it
yourself and the dependency fatigue
since the react doesn't offer much in
terms of entire framework you have to
choose your own parts for say routing
state management and stuff like that so
when you come
to that you have a lot of options and
that just causes fatigue like a paradox
of choice right yeah things two minutes
too many to choose and a JSX
it's a love-hate relationship it's good
most of the times but not so good
especially say stuff like commenting in
j6 it's like viewed so you are in a
JavaScript file lot like have a web
designer that you station actually
working yeah yeah you cannot give that
lecture
those are pain points as well like and
to me yeah as I said too many options
for state management career like small
backs too many and no official style
guide so that leads to no people coming
up with their own style guides and
everyone doing like what they like and
like you know stuff like that though
there is a style guide from Airbnb which
is pretty popular but still there is no
official style guide like the angular
guys right which is cool which which you
know which keeps the community like in a
uniform state and it's easier for
beginners to start you know
understanding and working with something
rather than you know finding a different
way of implementation for everything and
like getting confused so that's a good
thing about angular and that's a bad
thing I don't like in react so there's a
there's this project called to do MVC
that you might have heard of where they
basically took a number of different
JavaScript frameworks and implemented a
simple to-do list the reason for that
was just to show you you know with the
30 JavaScript frameworks that were
popular in 2014 or 2013 through 15 how
to do the different things and kind of
compare them in lines of code and stuff
like that so that project actually
hasn't been updated since January 2015
so I wouldn't recommend looking at it as
a reference implementation for the
various frameworks especially since they
still call angular angular 2 and there
just hasn't been any commits on it for a
while so hacker news PWA is the new like
to do MVC and they even say that on
their site so if you look at their
implementations of angular and react
you'll notice that interactive on
emerging markets which means slower
networks which means people like me when
I'm on a 2g connection when I'm in
Europe I like angular better because it
renders in six seconds now it's still
not in three seconds which is what
you're supposed to render in but it's
faster than react by 0.2 seconds they're
mad I think you just pick the one which
you like they also had this which is
react of course and it's faster than
angler
in three seconds yeah yeah and they also
have pre-act which is like no react on
steroids which is technically it'd be
compatible
that was like react on a diet yeah the
difference against steroids so it's like
buff and it's yeah that's what you want
right so it performs better and it's
lighter so tell me about pre act versus
react like there was a licensing snafu
right yeah I think mantle reacts author
wrote the licensing thing many people
were you know we're not comfortable with
the react license they went for stuff
like pre act or inferno there are so
many you know frameworks out there which
are like 99 or 100 percent api
compatible with VI
so they are like drop-in replacements
for react you can take a react code base
and you can just no cop I know find
replace the imports and mostly they work
so they're good and info no and pre
actor pretty we're pretty popular and
they're still I think used especially
because they are lighter because they
don't have a lot of stuff that reacts
react does for compatibility with you
know different browsers and edge cases
they don't do that so they're slightly
lighter and for some use cases they're
faster so and for those that don't know
basically Facebook had a license for
react up until about a month ago that
was you know pretty open but if you did
any patent infringement then basically
you couldn't sue him if you were using
react and so what they did is they came
out with a blog post I said hey we're
sticking by this and then like a week
later they were like nevermind MIT and
we believe that it was partly due to
WordPress being like okay fine we're not
gonna use react we'll use something else
in WordPress runs a lot of the sites
around the world doing more than half
the big yeah so so that kind of changed
the mind of Facebook so now at MIT all's
good so before we go further one thing
that we have to keep in mind when you
compare react with Angelo is it's not a
fair comparison because angular is a
full-fledged a medium framework whereas
react is just a view rendering library
it's just a V in the mvvm so in order to
compare them fairly we have to consider
react plus something like products and
react are you know and call them react
and friends so then it becomes a fair
comparison is it's a point to match so
that it
you know simple so what you're saying is
angular is awesome it's got everything
right so we're kind of winning there but
we haven't actually got to our points
yet so yeah so let's get the
similarities out of the way angular and
react are component based they're both
client-side mvvm frameworks for building
spas single page applications both
support server side rendering which is
becoming more and more popular it's
support in spring boot for both angular
and react time and and I think you can
use node on nashor and if you want but
basically the new Twitter mobile does it
with react and basically what you're
doing when you do server-side rendering
is you just render that initial page and
then all the JavaScript interaction
after it happens
and so server-side rendering is still
faster than rendering you know
everything in the browser so a lot of
you know companies that want to have
fast SEO and fast sites are doing that
and I would encourage you to look into
that as well
where we're considering you know maybe
some options and J hipster to do that I
know you guys aren't but I might do it
so both require a build tool like web
pack our system J's for optimal use both
have comparable performance there's
certain things that you can do wrong in
both of them but they're both backed by
big companies and used a lot within
those companies I think one of the the
big differences I don't know if we have
it on the next slide is that Facebook
uses it for its main site right Google
doesn't really just angular for its main
site but at the same time there's not
much on its main site but but Google
does use it for adverts which is one of
the major money mean it's there I mean
they're an ad company right I mean they
both are which is funny right and
finally they're MIT license as well yeah
and one more thing is most sometimes
both are like you know painting you know
no you know what
both are a pain in the ass yeah candy so
it's time to vote no I am NOT into this
too you know so I couldn't find a pen so
I'll just use since J hipster guy has an
angular tattoo we'll do face up if it's
angular and then we'll do face down if
it's react okay and then we'll have five
across here so technical
differences they have regular Dom and
angular virtual DOM and react JSX and
react HTML and angular dependency
injection so how many people like the
angular way of doing things
okay how many people like the react way
of doing things I'm gonna win all these
yeah I definitely it's by us crowd crowd
the my my favorite the biased ones so
with with angular it uses not really
javascript in HTML it uses expression
language in HTML and you can do turn
Aries and some stuff in there but you're
not gonna actually have you know two
curly braces and then write a JavaScript
takes you know function in there or do
anything like that you're just gonna
have you know little expressions so if
you're familiar with JSP if you're
coming from Java you're probably pretty
familiar with how that syntax works and
in react though it follows HTML in J's
so that's called j6 so you can pretty
much write most of the JavaScript stuff
within the JSX which looks similar to
Istomin but it's not actually HTML and
it was very controversial when it first
came controversial and i think now
everybody in the react community they
just accepted that and it's i think
except for the few pain points i noted
it's it's good most of the times because
you can write how much your job and your
JSP come on yeah but not quite yeah it
works it works
so regular down versus virtual Dom you
know the Dom nothing is quite crazy
there yeah typescript based yeah but but
on the virtual Dom but the virtual Dom I
think view also uses the same thing and
it makes them very fast when it comes to
a huge page like you know page loads and
like where you have a lot of components
which I think still is an issue with
angular with the regular dumps right
right but we have lazy loading and we
have ahead of time compiling right
because it is a big framework we need to
strip out other stuff you're not using
so that's our äôt kind of comes in you
don't help you don't need that in react
and the state management you can do
one-way or two-way binding just depends
on how you have
you know your ng-model configured in
your HTML page so it's a pain when it
comes to state management redux because
like I mean sorry react because react I
know by default doesn't give much in
terms of state management there is a
basic state management but to do
something actual you know proper in a
actual app you have to use something
like redirects or mob X and when it
comes to that then you have you again
get this you know two warring factions
like within the react community there is
a faction who likes red X there's a
faction who likes you know mob X and
then again they get a lot fragmented so
that's a pain when it comes to that but
in my experience red X works quite well
I haven't tried mopix myself but it X
works quite well and the philosophy of
you know the flux pattern it works quite
well when you have a lot of state going
on and I mean technically performs
better than having two way binding and
you know stuff like that okay we got 20
minutes left we're gonna have to zip
through these I just want to do it J
hipster demo so philosophical
differences MVC framework versus view
rendering library angular yes react
you're closer yeah I think I can I get
the draw for that no okay maybe I mean
you probably have more people than
actually use react object or injured
with functional right no object-oriented
angular functional react so angular is a
very opinionated framework promotes
object-oriented design and offers
everything required to build an SP a
react is just a view rendering library I
mean it does promote functional approach
but you can do object-oriented as well
and it doesn't provide much options when
it comes to other cool features like you
know routing or whatever in angular but
of course there are a lot of libraries
to do that but you have to choose them
yourself and isn't there this thing with
with react where like if it's developed
by Facebook it's cold yeah that's kind
of happening in the reactor mmunity
seems to love everything from Facebook's
so usability less flexible angular more
flexible react how many people like less
flexible
maybe I should awarded that differently
okay who likes more flexible okay fine
what you win one yeah so often results
in more code for the same task that can
happen with angular so which one is
easier to learn for those of you that
have raised your hands how many people
know both angular and react okay we have
about 10 out of maybe 200
what would you say which one was easier
to learn you've learned more I learned
both oh of course
compared to angular to react was easier
because react the number of things you
have to learn in react is less compared
to angular but but then again with react
it's not just for yet then you have to
learn several acts right you know stuff
like that so yeah I would say they have
comparable okay let's ask this we won't
like compare the two directly but how
many people that used angular found it
easy to learn or no angular okay how
many people found react pretty easy to
learn yeah I won that one I told you won
that one
so which one has a better ecosystem and
for those of you who use them it's
pretty obvious like you know with with
angular there's like ng bootstrap
there's there's all these other projects
that you can use to basically pull in
functionality and I think with angularjs
it was bigger right it was a huge
community there was something for
everything and so that did hurt when
they broke that but still there's still
a lot out there so if you're familiar
with either one if you're an angular
developer and you think the ecosystem is
great raise your hand if you're a react
developer and you think the ecosystem is
awesome raise your hand you didn't get
as many on that but that's that's that
that's okay that's beautiful because
because technically the react echo
system is huge compared to angular
well in what deeper ad on the slide
earlier was that the ecosystem is not
that big right for angular and I was
like what it's huge write up an angular
developer for awhile and so I went
looked on NPM search and typed in
angular and I was like seventeen
thousand three and
95 packages but right a huge yeah but
react
there was 41,000 packages so so almost
three times as many so they certainly do
have a little bigger ecosystem there but
but angular of course is easier to start
because you don't have to choose all
these things you have everything packed
whereas in react it takes but most time
to start be hard you have to choose all
these additional components libraries
the red X are all those stuff and then
you have to decide so yeah so yeah
angular is so the best way to compare
those not to actually talk about these
different points but it's to look at
some code we do have a Anglo support in
sorry react support in J hit stuff so
let's quickly yeah I think mirror your
displays or you can do it that way yeah
I could do that that's easier and so
what we did is we basically took there's
a there's a react branch in J hipster
it's not merged into master right now
but if you wanted to check it out you
could go you know clone the project from
github and then you check out JH - react
and then you're on NPM link in that
directory and if you do yo J hipster and
another directory then it'll actually
create you know a react application in
there or it won't create a react
application but will give you the choice
creator AK application so that's what
Depot is doing here we're just gonna
accept all the defaults we're not going
to explain what they are but it's
basically you know my sequel H to H
cache may even all that kind of stuff
and then he's going to choose angular 4
on one and react on another and we'll
kind of look at the differences between
them so we did this last night and we
put it on github so we'll give you links
at the end we also deploy it to Heroku
and so there are running instances out
there that you can look at and we'll
just run it here locally and then you'll
be able to see like the actual code we
can dive into that as well and the
biggest reason we're using his laptop is
I don't know if any of you know this but
I have a MacBook Pro pretty fast if you
compare it to a top-of-the-line Linux
laptop nowadays it's not that fast the
way that these ones do Java and the way
they do NPM install what I've seen
comparing to Josh Long's laptop is his
is three times faster than mine so it's
kind of you know one of those things
that if you do this a lot presentations
and stuff you might
get a Linux box so I have one ordered
because they are a lot faster for this
kind of stuff and so what we did after
we got these built is we brought them up
and then we did lighthouse testing on
him because what lighthouse allows you
to do lighthouse is a Chrome extension
that you can install it allow you to
test for progressive web app support
that allow you to test for performance
and allow you to test for accessibility
and then we thought about doing like zap
testing zap proxy from wasp but the
problem with zap testing is a lot of
times it's server-side stuff so we
figured if there was anything in one it
would probably be in the other and we
didn't want to make J hipster look bad
in case there was a bunch of stuff there
but at the same time here's what the
code looks like so this is the react app
pa6 so that's like the so you have an
entry point here which kind of
bootstraps everything then you have your
app main app tsx where you define your
structure and stuff so if you look at
the same for angular still not finished
they're going yeah it's got everything
now ok it has more dependencies there so
I'm gonna start this up so you could
actually probably use the same back end
for both right and just do darn start
different ones maybe no because it
brought to this day dat yeah yeah yeah I
could do that actually but yeah they run
on the same port for breaking them at
the same time right let's quickly take a
look at this so
ah okay I know I know I know what's
wrong I know what's wrong it worked
yesterday yeah okay no no but but I do
know what's wrong but just to warn you
if you don't choose internationalization
with react right now that actually looks
like that so I was like no I'm just
choose the default all right that's
always support right now so there you go
you fixed it
what'd you do to fix it the local
storage part I think there is a bug in
that so I can fix it so yeah so we have
like a home screen you can see that a
useful management the the react versions
a little bit right-leaning right it's on
the right side of the page where angular
is a little left-leaning
yeah that's probably not so funny here
yeah so you have some basic pages here
so this is pretty much this is your act
very reactive ocean so yeah let's
quickly take a look at the end location
because we don't have much time so then
we will go into the comparison you might
want to pull the one up on Heroku cuz
that I still go in there yeah yeah we
could do that as well devoxx - JH -
angular and then Heroku app comm know
no don't look at our slides did I go to
the last one there oh we didn't we
didn't put the reading would put them in
yeah no mind I'll just start it yeah
look at there yeah damn this thing is
still building so it's not a laptop
I did notice this last like lightning
fuss it must be angular so when I was
deploying to Heroku like 3:00 in the
morning usually like day hipster apps at
least from the US they take maybe a
minute to start so sometimes they won't
start in time um but for some reason it
was starting in like 20 seconds and I
swear it was the react app but I was
like that shouldn't have anything to do
with how fast a J hipster app starts
right spring boot no this was stuck on
the web back wheels hope IIIi don't like
about its web pack but that is benign
look I would blame it on Anglo you blame
it on web pack no no on Anglo that's
only difference on the left it's got all
the features all right react doesn't
quite have all the features so we still
have to add those I mean stuff I mean we
do have like user management metrics
health configuration not audit log CPA
and stuff like that so it's cool because
you can can you know look at the same
app developed with the two different
languages kind of evaluate so that's
what we did we ran some tests so what we
wanted shows they're almost identical
the generator that's now when we see the
no comparison you see like how they how
they perform you'll see the difference
is in the performance right
so like I said we generated apps with
both we used a hipster because we're hip
and if you compare it angular CLI and
create react app there's just not much
there so we gather statistics for
performance accessibility and lines of
code and PWA scored both so when react
started it didn't score very well at all
but I had some time yesterday so I added
PWA support to that branch so they both
get a 91 and basically the only way to
get better is if you put it on HTTP so
we just tested it locally but if we
could remember those Heroku URLs you
could test it there and those are HTTP
and what I've seen with J hipsters it
gets a hundred so we're doing it right
as far as PJ's are concerned by the
performance we got a seventy-five and we
have to the 75 was like once in 15 tries
most of the time it was 40 and we had
the same thing with react but one time
we got 66 and so what we found was there
must be something that lighthouse is
doing to talk to Google or something
like that to get its information because
we're running everything locally and
we're on conference Wi-Fi or we're on
hotel Wi-Fi and it's really slow to
happen in that internet connection speed
is affecting like the score and so it
does tell you in the in the report that
it prints out like you know don't really
trust this but this is what we think is
happening you should be okay but you
know don't trust us so I think there's
some communication going on in the
backend and if you're on a faster
connection then I think this would have
been better accessibility that both you
know do well for accessibility so if
someone's using a screen reader it
should be able to read it just fine and
interact with it both have best
practices the lines of code though is a
big difference right there's 3,000 less
lines of code in the react version I
think that's partly due to the 126
typescript files versus 55 there's half
as much but it was tool it's also pretty
large because we also have another
library for that which does a lot of you
know utility stuff outside of this code
right but there's also I mean one of the
things that you mentioned was if you
generate a new entity we don't quite
have that energy generator working for a
react but still the when you create an
angular component you'll have the
component you'll have a separate CSS
file and you'll have a separate HTML
file so there are only like thirteen
files for an entity where doesn't react
to the six
and when you even compare the code it's
like double the code for angular
compared to react so you could put the
HTML from angular into the component
that is supported but that's not how a
lot of people do it so we keep it
outside of there yeah and angular is
more test yeah because I'd invite you
know fistful so it's you know it's kind
of unfair to compare those in this slide
is obviously out of place there so so
that one so it's more so now we have a
bunch of pretty graphs and we don't want
you to look into these too much because
pretty graphs are pretty graphs and
they're just a survey of developers and
we know that sometimes these surveys can
be biased or that stats can be biased
and they're not surveying everyone and
maybe not everyone's given proper
answers so it's just kind of fun to look
at these and laugh for the most part so
popularity trends this really doesn't
tell you much except for some time last
year and maybe around Christmas everyone
stopped searching and Google Trends and
but this is a cool site so hot
frameworks calm has a listing of top
framework so when you go here first
it has about 10 or 15 frameworks at the
top and you can toggle them so you get
down to you know less ones there's like
asp.net probably JSP is why not enough
spring MVC is in there but they're doing
it wrong because angular should be read
actually be purple but you can see that
obviously they think that react is is a
hot framework more so than angular
github stars
we believe that Facebook has an internal
policy that whenever they release
something all the engineers have to go
star the project because their projects
always have the most stars NPM downloads
react has a CI system at Facebook that
downloads it every day so they have a
lot more downloads autre done with the
excuses but everyone's using angular on
the web but this is one of those
ambiguous things that we don't know if
it's angular angularjs it just slips
core projects you can never trust the
these comparisons when it comes to
angular because both at some point was
called Anglos right and it was the most
popular one at one point the only reason
people went to react is because they
didn't want to wait for angular 2
yeah pretty months at some point so in
the US if you search on indeed calm and
I've asked friends that you know look
for jobs and they found a lot of mine
indeed calm and so I went and just did
this you know yesterday and said okay of
the jobs in the US who's hiring for
react versus you know angular and I
threw polymer and view in there just for
the heck of it and there's a lot more
companies hiring for angular here in
Belgium there's a there's three times
more for angular than for react so in
the US you know might be gaining more
traction stackoverflow tags looks like
most people are having problems with
angular yeah it looks like trouble so
who wins will ask once more this says
angular ones right I thought three two
one I thought this is react do you think
Olson that was to react come on let's
see one few wins
yeah just kidding but they are wedding
right I mean they are getting and it
also has a really small library so it's
being popular for mobile phones as well
but our recommendation is basically if
you have a lot of state react Facebook
is one of those right there changing
stuff all the time with their little
icons and it's pretty good if you if you
want to go scale like if you have a
really big huge application then react
is better if you're familiar with how
you structure a job application MVC
framework does it angular makes a lot of
sense I think that's why it's been more
popular in this community and if you're
looking at Facebook
don't go use angular if you work at
Google you spry use you know angular if
you work at Oracle you're not allowed to
use angular I know that for a fact I
work there and if you like flexibility
react spray gonna you know help you a
little more than and if you don't want
that if you want things to just work go
tango you know if you don't want to
choose and build your own framework this
angle you just recommended them build
their own framework know if you don't
want to build their own framework okay
go angular I said if you don't want to
don't build on the framework you don't
tell them please and so we also looked
at some other opinions out there
so these are recent you can go read
these blog posts and they're very
in-depth about you know the technical
differences there's one from Yuans here
about you know angular versus direct
versus view this was just published in
August and so I'd encourage you to go
read that we'll publish these slides and
we'll give you a link at the end where
we publish them and then angular verses
react the deal breaker so some good
comparisons there so we learned about
the history of react and angular we saw
how to do a hello world it's definitely
easier and react but you know not all of
you are doing whole world I mean I'm an
example programmer by trade and so I get
paid to do hello world but not everyone
does so maybe I should switch to react
and start doing it more we talked about
similarities differences statistics
often they're called lies damned lies
and statistics so we saw some of those
but really the skill here is not knowing
reactor angular it's the ability to
learn an ability to pick up on a new one
we both feel that these aren't too
difficult to learn if you find the right
learning resources that react video that
we showed you earlier we didn't show you
but we pointed to is a great resource
where it's basically an hour and after
that you feel like you kind of know
react angular somewhat similar and
there's you know Pluralsight courses
there's a there's courses on egghead io
that really show you how to do things
there's great tutorials out there so we
encourage you to not be afraid of you
know a new framework creeping up on
yours but be more open mind and be
willing to learn you know from I myself
was an Anglophone boy for like click
eight months ago I was like doing the
gesture angular 2 migration I was a huge
angular one guy then I I learned angular
2 did the migration for that now I
started learning react so that I can
migrate gesture Toria and then I found
that they're there they're quite similar
in a lot of ways they're quite different
in a lot of ways but they both have
their values it's not like one is always
good and one is always bad it they both
have their values and I myself have used
both angular and react in production for
actual real world applications and not
angular 2 angular 1 it was very good and
now I am working on a production
application with react and so far it has
been good and I have seen angular 2
applications production as well so
definitely depends on your use case
don't you
wrong tool for the use case if you
choose the right tool it should be okay
I mean if you have a very small
application even maybe choosing both
angular or react might not make sense
maybe you should go with you which is
very light right now there might not be
a best tool I think that's what we've
all learned as you know developers is
you know there's several not just one
and so we have a buff tonight for J
hipster at 8 o'clock if you'd like to
join us in buff 1 we do have some
t-shirts after if you'd like to come up
our sample apps are up on github there
will post this presentation to speaker
deck and if you want to contact us you
can get on us on our websites or on
Twitter so there's a there's a special
discount on the day hipster book if you
are interested you can check this out on
the we'll post the slides with this so
and I'm really excited that Depot is
actually writing a book now because I
have the je hipster mini book from info
cue which you can download for free off
online but now he's not changing
everything every two months so this was
released like two months ago and it's
still up to date so now that he's
writing one he's a little you know less
feature happy so thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
