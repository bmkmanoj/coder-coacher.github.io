and fuzzy
about bringing on writing recognition to
your web app with body milk component so
if you have any questions during this
turn in action feel free to post them on
the official divorce application we will
try to answer them at the end of it so
me on you are we are working at my
script it's a french company for in 17
years ago in not and we are building
some on writing recognition technology
so currently we can recognize text matt
shapes and also music on the text field
we can recognize more than 160 language
in more than 20 different scripts what
we call scripts it's latin script arabic
chinese russian whatsoever and we build
our technology forum on for many OSS
like Windows Linux Mac iOS Android and
also for linux light clinics so maybe
you already use on writing in the last
OD 88 you can just write your address
with your finger world by a letter by
letter and once you write it gets
recognized and you don't have to use the
GPS battle to enter your your address
where you want to go so this is my
secret technology and with this core
technology we also have a sever one we
which allow you to use on writing with a
rest our web socket calls so I'm Talmud
wit and I'm the team have the team
leader of the cloud 30 hi everybody I'm
unstable I'm a software engineer in the
P Alvin's team as a P album like
eh I'm the feather of my sleep web
component for your convention we start
to show you our web demo portal it's
important to know my sleep and waking
recognition it's not an optical
character recognition system it's a live
recognition we capture all the
coordinate and sometimes time to time
stop of your drawing so I take an
example here
so I lo get recognized concei so how it
works under the hood are we trying to
expect very briefly out of car
technologies working so first of all we
have different free processing steps the
first one is baseline correction we try
to detect house of you which invisible
lines of the user follow while he was
writing and once we detect the best line
when you rotate all the inputs as if the
user was was writing following lines on
the paper so this is the first
pre-processing treatment we also have
line extracting so we try to detect big
big on smaller blocks bigger on smaller
blocks and we attached the smaller one
to the bigger ones and we put them all
all the bigger one after another as if
the user has right on the ribbon we are
transforming a 2d problem in a 1d so we
remove everything one other pretreatment
pre-processing is a smoothing as we
capture the input with electronical
devices they are whole sampling whatever
the quality of your stylus is it's a
samples a little or a lot so you can
have cascading effect if you redraw the
writing so we smooth it in order to keep
only the most important points of every
user input so we also have other prey
pre-processing treatments it may vary of
your language or what we want to detect
and also the power how we can use on on
a small MD device we can do less than on
laptop for exam after that comes the
first
important part which is a segmentation
if you write with recursive scripts all
later several letters could be at that
and be berated with in one stroke flow
for example gives the user right then
without putting a spin trap so we try to
detect is the most important part of the
input cut it on then recompose in order
to have capital character so here pen is
a split in six characters and we will
recompose the three first ones to make
the letter P and during this whole
composition faith we put a probability
on it so at the end of the segmentation
we have characters with probably it is
that it is a character or not so here i
will have the three first stroke with
maybe it's eighty percent accurate that
it's a character i will he'll also maybe
this truck alone with a probability of
fifty five percent i don't know so we we
have character candidates at the output
of segmentation then we have we have
some neural neural networks which take
in input several characteristic about
each character's and we train those
neuronal networks with samples gather
from native speaker all around the world
native writers sorry around the world so
we train them and we reuse them in order
to put a property on each character so
on my previous example I will have to
have any i have put p with a certain
probability e with a certain probability
an extra then comes the language
processing part we grab copies from all
around the web in order to know
to know a language and to make our own
writing recognition more accurate so for
example if you start with by writing
your tea honey most probably after that
you will have an a because if you are
writing in English tea you write T most
frequently than dead so also at the end
of this phase we have another
probability that our recognition is
accurate or not and at the end we have
some dynamic programming who is
calculating and try to know if we have
reached the required accuracy accuracy
if we are we didn't reach it we we can
remake the segmentation character
classification and language processing
with different parameters and then we
can loop certain times depending of what
so user hath in order to have the most
accurate on writing repetition and
that's how we start from x + y + 22 /
text so this is a billy use this
technology in our server part we have
some rest on web socket head points so
on top of them we build some web
component to easy using on writing
recognition in the web app so we decided
to do that for helping people to add
unbreaking recognition on their web
application to do that we decide to use
a web component why web component when
web component is a set of standard baidu
PVC 34 create reasonable element in your
web application and we decided to use a
polymer because polymer is a driving
force a lot of tools around the web
component and
it's easy easy each type of weather
element so that's why we decide to use
this to technology so now we will talk
about our demonstration one with our mat
my script Matt web component and another
with my script X the web component so
let's start so if you want to use our
component first of all you have to add
the oil dependency so here it's my slip
mat web so what I will try to do we try
to make a very simple quiz with one
question how we ask the user to
factorize the matinee mathematical
expression so as maybe you you know
where we were student well if you have
to write some equation in a word
processor you may have to use that taken
it's you you have to learn attic with
this on writing I will just have to
write and I will have a latex as output
and i will use the static output to make
a comparison with the expected result so
to start I will how we had some some
recognition and components so I add the
oil dependency now i will grab them
yep
and we also provide a template wait a
little bit while back so I create an
index file so what you see currently I
just have some style a title on the
various div to where I will place
questions the expected result on the
results and when it puts an input zone
so first of all I will had some the
dependency to web component GS little
this is monetary if you want your page
to rock in all browser if you don't
replace the web component polyfill it
will only work on Chrome actually or
opera then I will have I will had my
mask with Matt element so it comes with
two key attributes application key on a
schmucky it's some key you rub on how
deaf bottle you have to register to have
it on users or several or several right
points so right now I grabbed the
dependency oh yes sorry but how should I
place it I will grab the dependency how
will the dependency here egg so
so I will stop this is the dependency
and here I add the the tag for the
custom element so let's see my heart put
so hydro start Polly cell as a web
server but you can use whatever whatever
you want so here I have a non writing
zone and i can write magnetic molecule
expression only once i right it gets
recognized on top so now what I want
it's to to show the question on to to to
compare the user input with the expected
result our I can achieve that we expose
our tire on our mice with matt weber tag
values attributes here we are interested
by the result one which will give you
the results in different formats who you
can have litec net amount of symmetry
and we also some fire heavens every time
a new results arrive or every or every
time the user delayed on scratch on
trash everything he writes previously so
i will bind the result event and try to
compare it with the expected result how
we can do that so we add an event on the
web components ready in order that our
web component is loaded before accessing
its property here are the questions
we're under them with Khattak it's a
latte grande or a javascript library and
we bang the my script matt webb result
and every time it arrives we extract the
litec result and we compare it with the
the answer on if it's very we put it in
green if it's in great in red
and if user click on delete with Russia
riffing let's see in action so yeah it's
pretty simple if I write three I got a
recognition from the server my my script
Matt result get fire so I get two three
I compare the three of the expected
result on it works you can hear it's
more complicated so that's it and we
also have a component working with text
recognition on that you want to play so
we try to show you our my script text
web component in a demonstration so for
this demonstration we asked a simple
question what's the favorite animals for
human being and we try to respond with a
our component and we try to interact
with a paper element provide by polymer
polymer so so I have vada ji-sun where I
put the dependency of my element I have
to download the dependency of my element
by typing borrow install
waiting for okay it's okay now we have
create a template to be quick for this
special presentation so I named it index
file so into in this demo we are we have
a steel we have some icons flag to
change language of our questions in this
demo we have a paper input to interact
with our mess cube text the web element
and we have the web component TS so
first i have to grab the dependency just
like an import
exactly
so you can see a link that could change
our language so when the US or Chinese a
section with our sentence what's the
best friend of human being it's a paper
input like i said and i will had an
input method just like that one line so
in my javascript code i have the
interaction with my different element of
my page here we listened the web
component reddit event we listened the
master tex web result event to set our
web paper input component with our first
candidate result of recognition so i
will show you the documentation of my
component so it's very easy to to read
you have properties so first candidate
it's interesting for us to get the first
candidates written by the unready no can
challenge I we will like to I'd buttons
you know to hide the result of our
component for this demo I will show you
and we would like to change the language
here we are a result because we are
reserved and event just like that launch
a web server placer
here we are so it's our demo so here we
can type / result and each interact with
this element directly so now i would
like to hide simply hide result area I
just I have to tap type I'll result just
like that and here you are so Allah I
would like to try to to write a shiny
symbol for this question
missed me are we try we are not some
lettuce Chinese writers oh so the thing
important here is to to show you the
context of of the language it's
important for our recognition system if
you are in in English you can't find a
sample that's why we would like to show
you the data yes if you are in English
you you want to have some shiny symbol
as output but if you are in Chinese you
may have some lentil symbol as an output
as a Chinese people uses of some Latin
character but you will have most
probably some shiny symbol has output
so you can try those demo by yourself on
your phone your laptop or tablet or
whatever you want so just go 2d mode
that web service is that mess with that
girl and you will be able to try those
demo live right now we will read the
question but if you you want to go
deeper in our technology you can go to
our death butter it's a depth at my
scribd com we explain all your
technology and the different SDK we have
that you can use online on our server we
also have some Android or iOS libraries
on the car techno so what the question
what what does the most popular use case
for my script currently we have two very
popular use case we are used our size
three the one I told in car in the
automotive industry more and more people
are interested by handwriting
recognition as a scientist said it's you
you get more focused on the road if you
write then if you have to talk to enter
an address and also if you have to you
to use a pedal so a lot of car
manufacturer are interested by on
writing recognition when you have to
write a character by character we are
also used in a telephone in a mobile
phone sold in NASA when you write light
in it's pretty easy to write it with a
keyboard as it is a have less than 40
characters I would say and but if you
have to write Chinese Japanese or Korean
you have to know more and more
many more characters or you have to to
to no opinion opinion methods so pinion
methods you have to combine three or two
Latin character to get a Chinese one so
as Ian the eyes for a sign language
people like to use what we call input
method so it's a it's a keyboard
replacement inside the device so they
can write symbols with only your strokes
are under on the last one it's maths so
you can download my script calculator
it's a free app which are used which are
you two to make some mathematical
recognition like we are demoing here in
a web component but you have what we
call type settings so the capability to
edit your mattox expression and to solve
it in hat so we we have many you scare
the run Matt in education particular
year for example in the can academy up
here the answer for students in the
mobile hat it's a my script widget which
issues actually we also have another
question we don't use Travis CI not yet
what longer a long way to do you support
I don't have them by head you have to go
to our website many many of them as a
them I it's Arabic French Russian over
we we we have a lot of language we don't
have all the Indian language that's the
part which is missing actually is there
any more questions three minute left yes
its linguistic part in the in Chinese
it's pretty more easy than in the latin
language if it was so the question is
the accuracy area with a Chinese
character as connected can rephrase the
question in Chinese it so you can write
a phrase with on these three characters
it's not a series of letter like in 19
so the language stick part it's it's
less important than the ricker the
character recognition part which is its
which is a very really big challenge for
the Chinese the Chinese recognition as
we have to to train and learn
very large set of characters thank you
for I attention and so there is the
awesome goodies here so you can come and
grab one if you want Thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
