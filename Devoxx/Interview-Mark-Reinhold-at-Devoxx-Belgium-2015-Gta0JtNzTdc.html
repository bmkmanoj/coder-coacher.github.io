the pleasure of being joined by Mark
Reinhold well I think you're very much
you're testing with this trip any time
and obviously mark doesn't really need
much introduction except for marc fitt
job group to the keynote yesterday
speaking about the latest upcoming
version of java so i'm going to jump
straight in with that okay um can you
give us an overview of what you were
talking about yesterday over your book
okay so so the big feature in Java 9 is
is the module system we've been working
on this in project jigsaw for well for a
long time now key benefits of modules
are reliable configuration and strong
encapsulation two things that you do not
get on the classpath we've applied the
module system to the JDK and the
platform itself so you can choose just
the parts of the platform that you need
and of course you can also use it on
your own code so that you two can escape
the class map on the subjects of the
module system I know there's been a bit
of a panic from ultra and the ecosystem
about the fact that modules are going to
break things I don't use the word job
apocalypse but there have been but
that's been some hyperbole it's fair
there's certainly been some high purple
yeah what would you think it would you
say that it isn't any problem for people
so we are we are taking the opportunity
in modular izing the JDK to basically
pay down a bunch of technical debt you
know among other things we've we've
cleaned up a lot of things the JDK grew
up is this monolithic system where
anything could refer to anything else
we've gotten rid a lot of a lot of
battery so we can have a clean set of
modules but also in especially in order
to further our goals of improving
platform security we are going to hide
most internal api's behind module
boundaries and this is a fairly you know
strict thing it's not just a convention
that's actually in in language and be in
terms its access control you know this
is the same mechanism that keeps private
and at the private will prevent you from
accessing
a class or interface in a package that's
not exported by the module that defines
it so most internal api's will be
encapsulated in that way that we do know
that there are some internal api's are
extremely popular son mis gun safe is is
the is the standard example and and the
sum of these internal api's do things
that you would be extremely difficult if
not impossible to do outside of the jdk
and we know that some important
libraries and applications depend on
them so those AP is we will leave
available in jdk nine they'll be in a
special module which is going to be
called JDK unsupported just to make it
very clear that this is unsupported
stuff but they'll be there if you want
to use this it's at your own risk you
know you're playing with with a sharp
knife right yeah so you know you can
still do that our hope over time our
intent over time and we've already done
some of this is to create public
supported api's that provide much of the
functionality of you find and things
like some misc unsafe but it but in a
safe controlled insupportable way and
eventually libraries that you send miss
Gunn save today can migrate to that
sundus gun safe will event will
eventually go away once those things
have been defined and adopted basic
evolving it's awesome yeah we're we're
yeah we're moved we're moving it slowly
you know with sensitivity to its Kurt to
its current use you the the less calm so
other categories internal api's are well
there are things that people use just
because it was convenient you know son
mis base64 decode or well okay come on
you can do that you're on yourself there
are plenty of libraries to do it for you
that's just going to go away ok sorry
deal with it um and we've done a lot of
analyses of existing bodies of code and
in in one of our presentations this week
we have a graphic and it's this the
usual you know long long tail power
distribution where some this gun safe
and basics before decoder that are at
the top and there's this long tail of
little things that are that are used by
some code we found you know some tar
files we found on maven central and and
very
its products but the use of frequency is
very low those are just going to go away
too but there's always an escape hatch
if you really if you have an existing
system that you can't change and you
really need to get it running online
yeah you could there there's a
command-line flag you can use that will
let you force one of those internal
packages to be exported no matter what
so go back to using this so well you
have that access to the command line
okay but if you have access to the
command line you already have godlike
powers so that's okay I'm flare in Java
nine away from obviously more Jill's
other big thing hit don't think people
Oh is there anything else oh he's franca
it's mentioned a shell flash people is
kind of a sleeper see triple oh yeah the
rebel the rebel is great Robert field
the guy behind that did a talk I think
yesterday there's a lot of discussion
about that I think people are actually
kind of quietly excited about that ya
know the repple is ultra cool I've
wanted a rebel and java java for years
i'm an old list guy and Lisp is all
about the rebel so being able to type in
Java expressions and different to
developers well I I agree with the
characterization characterization sort
of sleeper feature you know something
big like 'i'll and our generics or
modules yeah that's that's a big out
there feature I think the repple is
something that people who know what a
rebel is will you know are immediately
excited about it people who don't it
might take them a while to learn about
it and realize oh oh it was actually
pretty cool a lil analogous to parallel
streams into eight people kind of as it
caught on more people started talking
about it yeah thank you babe it'd be
more of a kind of kind of a ground swell
type thing yeah fucking a heads over C
Java 9 is there significant things
happening but its first lead over 10 is
a bit more of a develop gonna be a bit
more developer oriented release car we
don't work I'd like to think that every
release it is a developer oriented
release in terms of I mean more kind of
the interval developer where's Davin 9
is probably it's very much motivation is
not going to affect everyone oh it will
instantly what you thinking well it so
as I said in the keynote it is true but
modules are in by their nature a
different kind of feature
than something like land or generics
which are easy to understand in the
small and it's easy to take some
existing code and use Janeiro up add
generic saddle add lambdas to it in
small ways and get going with it fairly
fairly quickly modules are are
addressing things at a larger grain so
and you need to think more about how
your entire how your library is going to
be used by others or how your entire
system is is composed and assembled and
it will it's going to take longer to to
adopt and we you know we understand that
the adoption of Java 8 is the fastest
we've seen in many years because lambda
ins dreams were just very compelling
Java thing yeah yeah many a lot lots of
people skipped 7 99 will not will we did
not expect it to be adopted as quickly
as a you know and that's okay so in a
sense I guess I'm agreeing with you okay
you know it assuming we get we get value
types done for 10 that will be do you
think about it in some ways things if 10
could be you know that's peering into
the future hey what you know it sir it's
certainly it certainly then it's it's
certainly the next big thing we would
like to do value types and and and
having having generic types / primitives
it's going it'll be a big improvement
for for for memory footprint and
performance I that value types
and my guess is they'll be a bit
different from lambda lambda is
something that every everybody could use
and of course we also use throughout
throughout the jdk libraries value types
are something that many people will
benefit from without changing their own
code if we get value types right and
then and then we upgrade all the
standard collection classes and various
other other data structure types in the
JDK there will be immediate benefit to
existing applications without any code
change whereas in your late late landa
internal use of lambda didn't
necessarily help existing code that much
yeah but internal use about value types
definitely will you won't need to be
using value types yourself in order to
get the benefits of course you can and
you'll probably get even more benefits
elsewhere in Java I know there's a lot
of talk about time in the OT this Java
one and is this an area that excites you
for the future of Java or they are you
kind of thinking about Java in mobile um
it's an interesting area but I guess my
brain is so full just just you're trying
to keep the JDK and se I on track you
know I definitely have contact with
people working on IOT type things both
inside and outside of Oracle and yeah
they're definitely exciting
opportunities especially when when you
can take a modular jdk nine strip it
down to just the three or five modules
that you need plus your app and put that
in a small device yeah that's definitely
something we're aiming to support yeah
the IT IOT stuff is evolving Academy in
its own way and it's it's just ah yeah I
don't I don't have a lot I don't know I
don't have time to pay deep attention to
it but we're definitely trying to help
out there where we can and in other
areas of Java I did crowdsource a few
questions last night for developers
thanks for their kind of would be gettin
a and it's not I'm chance it's right now
phone does whore nothing kerman still a
priority for java now
are they going to be so energy being put
into this so not nas horn from my point
of view is it is largely done okay right
okay you see as a complete thing yeah i
mean we're oracle is still investing in
it we still have a few people working on
it we want to keep you know improving
performance here and they're improving
its connection with java and other
languages on the JVM in nine attila
sogeti is is going to integrate his
Dinah link API which is internal to NOS
or now but but we're going to make that
a jdk specific but supported api in nine
and there's been some other other
performance work along the way but you
know at this point it's it's a it's a
necklace script six compliant
implementation that performs pretty well
and and Breno for a while we had a big
team working on it and now it's i
wouldn't say it's totally in maintenance
mode but it's you know it's heading that
way and it's the natural life cycle of
most kinds of poignant parts of the
system came back very long time now back
to the kind of very early beginning days
of java or it was even Java I was okay
went to how did you first become
acquainted with james gosling because
you've worked together obviously for a
long time so i actually knew James in a
slight way long before Java even existed
when I when I was an undergrad south
when I was an undergraduate and this
would have been a long time ago oh yeah
just last week this would be the the
early 1980s when I was an undergrad
James was a grad student at Carnegie
Mellon University and he had written his
own implementation of the Emacs text
editor which originated at MIT but he
wrote his own because well he was a grad
student and who knows maybe he was doing
the usual grad student thing and trying
to avoid writing his thesis anyway he
wrote this thing and it ran on on the
UNIX is of the time you know solaris
from whatever
i ported it as part of a part-time job i
had my university i ported it to vac CMS
you know into this and you know we would
exchange emails over what was then
called the ARPANET avoiding yoga study
exactly y would exchange emails about
about probably the problems i found and
you know I occasionally made suggestions
you know what you wear today I would
send somebody a patch or do a github
github pull request to you yeah you know
at the Larry walls patch tool do you
think it exists right sighs how I would
describe the changes i had made as best
I could and sometimes he would integrate
them whatever so yeah so I kind of knew
James before he was even at Sun and then
you know years later you know I went to
MIT did my my PhD there I had a postdoc
job in New Jersey that had a limited
lifetime java kind of appeared on the
scene i looked at it i downloaded one of
the early the one of the I don't know 9
beta 1 builds or something it only ran
on solaris sparc side to go find his
lair spark machine you play to those
look well it's that's kind of
interesting and as my as my post
post-gig ran out my thought well hmm
yeah maybe I should go to California
work on John you know I came out to
California I interviewed it a bunch of
places including Oracle ironically but I
always had my I kind of kind of said on
sun if they would hire me to work on
Java that seemed like the thing to do
cuz it's it's just did you ever look at
any of the other languages in the early
days of Java oh no Sarah followed by
JavaScript when it was became trendy
well their job and drive JavaScript
didn't really follow Java it came around
the same time and they're all the
branding piggybacks on Java Sea oh wellz
the branding of javascript javascript
was originally originally called live
script and sun sun sun and netscape
agreed that it could be called
JavaScript and the reasons for that I
can't really discuss but you know it was
done
have you Alex any of the other day vm
languages like really thought oh that's
exciting I'd like to kind of play in
folk this closure pleasure well yeah I
mean as an old list guy it's a list
right and I think Ricky is has done some
marvelous work in coming up with a a
really a clear conceptual model of how
to write code that that that scales well
Union not taking the pure functional
approach of total immune ability but you
having controlled mutability so you can
have and have efficient data structures
but being able to reason about systems
in the large basically as if they were
functional and i think it's a it's a
really interesting mix and of course
it's a lisp so that makes it even nicer
but i realize that's not a shared shared
tastes that's okay too one final
question as obviously architects in your
title we're at devoxx and you know the
conference like all this year's I sexy
the one dominant trend has me my career
services you have you been paying
attention to that a bit yeah sure oh
this is something that job it developer
gonna stop pushing beautiful oh yeah
they already are and many of the of the
Java technologies were already have fit
very naturally into this I mean you look
at rest we think we've got Jersey and
other kinds of rest frameworks that do
that stuff very well coupling and kind
of getting rid of trying to get rid of
that that too and you know you can you
can imagine a a large server box filled
with you know tens of thousands of
docker containers and each one has a
small custom Java image in it that only
has you know six modules plus plus your
application then it's doing you know
rest calls with JSON over an infinite
band network and yeah that's
microservices could work pretty well
thank you so much for joining it every
day thank you enjoy the rest of the
conference thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
