I'm going to talk about security for the
masses so this is my first completely
non-technical talk which is the first
for me it's only got one code example so
this is going to be a new one for me so
I'm kind of stoked about it anyway my
name is siren and I am the head of
security for a medical company in Sweden
so I flew all the way out here just to
hang out with you fine people I got a
four o'clock this morning so I've been
drinking coffee basically all day so
this is it's been a long day um I have a
Twitter which apparently everyone is
supposed to know like Twitter is
something that's important that I barely
never use but it's there in case you
care deeply about my Twitter I also run
a very small user group in Sweden so if
you happen to be in Sweden come to my
user group and you can hang out we have
free pizza and free beer and we talk
about security a lot so that is my one
plug for my user group that you know is
in a different country
yeh I have worked with security for
eight or nine years now something like
that so I've been doing this for a long
time I have a ton of certificates
that prove the fact that I can take a
test and pass the test so they don't
really say much about me but I have both
the CISSP and the offensive security so
I have both the technical and the policy
ones and if anybody cares deeply about
them we can go and review my CV after
the talk but frankly they don't they
don't say anything about me besides the
fact that I can pass a test I love sushi
and I truly and deeply love my job so if
I seemed really really stoked it's
because I really really really care
about security so this is this is my
talk by a show of hands and I do a lot
of crowd participation who here works
with security create two people two and
a half two and a third
okay - I'll give you two and a third
thank you and I think that kind of
highlights the problem because who here
has heard that it's important to work
with security so pretty much everyone
besides the two in the back know
fantastic you live in a rough like under
uh inner in caves under a rock okay so
everyone knows it's important yes nobody
seems to be doing it which is something
that fascinates me because you would
think that if it's so important that
people would you know their boss would
tell them to do it and they would tell
them to do something constructive they
would be given time to go for a course
they would be given a certificate they
would do they would do something
constructive yet I talked to a lot of
conferences I made a lot of other
companies and I can count on one hand
the number of companies that have a
constructive actually good security
program to take a junior person and
actually make them a security person yet
if you look on their website they're
going to have some sort of security
touting security is super important to
us but when it actually comes to the
nuts and bolts of actually getting it
done the field cemani and so generally
there is a top-down approach when it
comes to security the company's first
response is to hire someone that has my
particular title which is a head of
security you see so a CSO something like
that is very fancy and then they put
this person on their website with a
picture with them smiling like this and
it says their their title and then it
has a long list of their certifications
and that is their entire security
program it is one person and that person
is generally not a developer yet they
are producing code that person is
generally a policy person anybody run
into this person one two three four five
six yeah so it's kind of an interesting
to have an entire security program for a
development company with one person that
doesn't produce any code yet they are
their entire security department
fascinating again I don't have the
answer to that but
waitis the general lack of lodge I think
we've we've demonstrated in this room by
the people that don't really work with
security which is fine and this talk is
specifically for you so I'm glad that
you're here I would say another problem
is the larger security community because
a lot of security people are and I can
say this as a security person Dix this
is true it's true a lot of us are
arrogant Dix
who has seen the DEF CON blackhat talks
where it's some guy live coding and
exploit in a pre-configured environment
that he has found the super exploit and
somewhere in this talk this person makes
a statement along the lines of no one
could be too stupid until I found
blahblah
everyone has heard this talk everyone
has seen this dog who would want to go
talk to that person to be like I don't
know what I'm doing I I definitely
wouldn't and a lot of this the the what
is presented by the security community
as a whole is that person if you're
coming into the security community it is
like running into a concrete barrier I
have very very rarely seen job openings
or junior security person with no
experience but we will teach you so if
you look at the job ads that are out
there it's seven eight nine ten years of
experience needed and then you turn the
page in the newspaper and it's screaming
lack of security personnel you're like
all right I will get my seven eight
years nine ten years somewhere else so
it's a huge problem so security
community it not particularly welcoming
once you start working in security the
burnout rate is unbelievable so when you
work in security who is her the story of
Sisyphus guy who pushes a rock up a hill
and then the rock rolls down then penny
next day rock up the hill
Rock goes on the and and if you look at
the types of people that work in
security they're not really prepared for
that because and this is myself included
you think that once you find a bug the
bug will be fixed and things will get
better and it's a common common problem
but we'll get back to that so here's
here's the classic security approach
and if you look on the right there that
triangle confidentiality integrity and
availability that is a sum total of
security theory it is the most important
slide and this entire deck that
particular portion on the right that
triangle right there that is all
security theory all security problems
will be solved using this completely
seriously laughing and completely
serious no one believed you is true it's
completely true all security problems
can be looked at using three different
factors it's confidentiality integrity
and availability if I'm sending
information from point A to point B how
sense it is how confidential is the
information that I am sending
confidentiality integrity how important
is it that the information I am sending
is the information that arrives so if
I'm sending a picture of a cat and at
the other end they receive a picture of
a dog that's either a problem mark not
and finally how important is it that
actually that I can actually use the
service that I'm supposed to be using
and this is true for absolutely every
single problem and you can look at it
from every problem is this so if it's
not important that the information is
correct for example you don't really
care about you're using UDP as post PCP
for example then integrity is probably
not going to be the security mechanisms
that you're looking at if the
information is publicly available and
everybody can see it
then confidentiality is probably not
your main concern but if it's super
important that that services up and
running all over the time then you
should probably focus your security
efforts on availability so I was getting
back to that with the hiring of the C so
if you read security certificates and if
you take security classes they're all
going to come back to security is
impossible if you don't have management
support you have to have the buy-in from
your CEO your CIO your CFO your c-level
whoever they happen to be if they're not
backing you up security is basically
impossible to do and it's true to a
point
however if you don't have the buy-in
from the people actually building the
code and the testers I would argue that
it's equally as impossible because the
CEO is never going to walk down to the
developer and just be like I am going to
do this with you at least I've never met
that particular CEO maybe maybe they
exist I've just never experienced them
it's also incredibly policy heavy so who
here remembers their IT security policy
yep no hands up who here is find an IT
security policy I rest my case
so that is security work that's
obviously extremely effective because no
one remembers it and if unfortunately if
you look at a lot of the head of
security people the people that have my
particular position what they what they
believe to be a security work is writing
a giant document that is then signed and
then immediately forgotten and then
expecting that to be effective and it's
not it's absolutely not but that is that
is what a lot of security people do and
that is because it is a top-down
approach and you're hiring someone that
isn't an engineer they're not technical
they can't read code and so they go to
you know a cissp which is a great
certificate and they they learn how to
write policy but the certificate doesn't
tell them that there's more that they
need to be more in contact with their Rd
so if you look at this person they're
generally not in contact with their
developers and not in contact with their
testers are not sitting in reading code
and they're not writing specialized
requirements because if they were you
would remember your IT security policy
because it would be written in a
language that you can actually
understand and it would actually be
technically enforceable and generally
it's not and finally
security is unfortunately at present and
this is something I'm hoping to change
incredibly specialized so I tell thief I
work in security and they immediately
assume that you know this is some sort
of special skill and I'm here to tell
you it's not but it's very rare to find
a developer that says honestly that I'm
mostly a developer but I have some
security stuff that I do every now and
then which is which is a problem in it's
odd because you you assign all security
work to security buffs or security
developers and then you make that a silo
and you lock then that skill set into
one particular person which not
works because they can quit they can
leave they can do a bad job I can do any
number of things that just simply are
bad so you remember my story of Sisyphus
this is my amazing graphic that I didn't
think would work that I stole from
Google it's true I did so common
security problems and here's why
security fails if you have security in
silo it dies because it's not going to
be spread throughout the entire
organization does anyone does anyone
know the most common security threat or
the biggest security weakness seeing I
call on you cuz you're sitting in front
room people yeah it's absolutely right
and if you have all of your security
locked into a particular silo it's not
going to be spread throughout the
organization which means your
receptionist is going to let the hacker
bite in the door and support just going
to tell whoever is calling on the phone
all about the back end but you're going
to have a security person working in a
silo this unaware of those particular
risks there's a failure of understanding
so who here could tell me and I'm not
going to call on anyone because this is
actually a hard question why two-factor
authentication is used everyone knows
it's a good thing to have two-factor
authentication
most people use it but very very few
people understand the problem that
two-factor authentication is actually
trying to solve go ahead yes yes very
good and do you know how many people
have been able to answer that question
it's a very it's a shockingly low number
I think you're one of three and I've and
I and I pose this question because
everyone knows what two-factor
authentication is most people use it and
most people tell me it's brute force
they're trying to solve the brute force
problem which is true but you can solve
a brute force in a lot of different ways
two-factor authentication actually
strengthens your authorization on
authentication process because you're
absolutely right authentication is built
on three particular pillars it's
something you have or no I'm doing it in
wrong order something
know something you have and something
you are and in very weird circumstances
you can have a fourth one and somewhere
you are like a geographical location but
that's that when generally is not used
but everyone knows that it's something
that you should use but most people
don't know why
same thing with CloudFlare same thing
with validation same thing with off the
skating certain URLs same seeing with a
lot of validation checks saying I mean I
could the list goes on and on and on but
most people are unaware of why those
things are important which means it's
really uninspiring to do them there is a
failure of vision the security community
and this one saddens me the most because
if you don't know where you're driving
the bus is just really difficult to get
there so if you have if you have a
company and this is this ties back to
the leadership idea the the leadership
and the company has to decide what type
of company are we what type of security
do we offer and how are we going to get
there and the company could decide that
we don't care about security they could
do that and are they going to publish
that to their customers and their users
yeah maybe or
they could do what Volvo did and make it
their selling point so I know nothing
about cars like I take my car to the
mechanic and I'm just like do something
but when I bought my car I know that
Volvo is super super safe and that's why
I bought my car so I Drive a tank from
my perspective and so I paid a little
more for a car that is safer now I know
nothing about cars so that could be
complete crap I don't know but I bought
the car specifically because of Volvo's
message of security so no one correct me
and tell me that I'm driving some sort
of horror because I don't make me sad so
why the security fail I would argue that
is it is two different factors and
chiefly it is that people have a
misunderstanding of what security
actually is so personal story time when
I started working in security a long
time ago I came in and I got my first
security engineering job after I was a
pen tester and I made money when I was
going to school as a pen tester doing
bug
finding bugs in the Internet so that's
how I said myself and I got a I got my
first big person job at a company doing
their security and I came in and I
thought I was hot I was amazing
because I've had several years of people
paying me money for doing basically
nothing it's true the pen testing is
relatively easy and so I started at the
company and I was like I'm going to
solve all of these problems this is
going to be great and I started just
pumping out bugs because I was the first
security person they had and I mean I
was you know three four or five bucks a
week and I would put them in and they
would be immediately placed in backlog
and I was like all right I'll find a
nastier bug and so I did and it was
immediately put in backlog man I found
an even worse bug and I just bug after
bug after bug and I mean it ended with
me having you know 30 40 bugs in backlog
and these immune bees were not nasty
you know these were not you know that
the picture changed these were big big
big dangerous bugs and they all sat and
languished in backlog and what I'd
failed to appreciate was that security
is not necessarily all locked into code
I had failed to appreciate the fact that
if my boss didn't understand what I was
doing they were going to sit in backlog
until the day I died it's true and when
I left that particular company they are
still in backlog to my knowledge
so yeah security fails for that reason
it's not all in code and the second
reason is the users now I have the the
Bose headphones the ones that were
spying on the users if anyone does
everyone here has a story they were you
know they were they were sending data to
a third party they were selling it on
there possibly spying on calls
everyone's heard the story most of us
have heard the story they were spying on
us
so both made an app that you connect to
your headphones are wireless and through
the app you get firmware updates to your
headphones I got the app have the
headphones using it and I'm sitting on
the train one morning and I'm listening
to you know my terrible music because I
have terrible taste in music and I'm
reading the news because that's what I
do every morning I
that they are spying on me my headphones
are spying on me and um I go oh god oh
god and so I started reading I start
reading the newspaper article and it
turns out that the fact they were
sending this data was clearly listed in
their terms and conditions which I had
not read and I had no way to turn this
data stream to third party off so
somewhere out there glitter mix Sparkle
pants which was my apt name for the you
know if someone knows that glitter mix
parklands has terrible taste in music
and avoids answering the phone like it's
on fire and so I'm reading this and more
importantly I'm reading people's
reactions to it
so what Bose did was not security
problem at all they just simply had
chosen not to give people an opt-out and
they had failed to appreciate the fact
that people would probably think it was
inappropriate for them to sell on their
data and that is not technically from
most people's understanding of what
security is a security risk there was no
exploiting code there was no leaking of
accounts there was no passwords that
flew out into the distance they were
simply taking data that they had
gathered in for me and selling it on to
a third party in terms and conditions
that I had agreed to I just hadn't
bothered to read them and so it turned
into this huge story and those took this
information and released a new app that
you can now opt out of which I promptly
did so people seem to think that
security is always exploiting code it's
always you know a hacker getting in but
this is a security problem for both they
had to immediately you know push out a
new app version where you could opt out
and it was a big story it wouldn't
surprise me if they lost some customers
based on this but if I ask people was
that a security risk from a pen tester I
probably get 5050 yes no but it is a
security problem so if we make the
mistake of assuming that all security is
in tech then we're going to miss
security risks like that one
which brings me to the dreaded user so
this is what Bo's failed to appreciate
they'd failed to appreciate the people
who are using their particular product
they'd failed to appreciate but the
people who are using this particular
product would be offended by a third
party realizing that they have terrible
taste in music and avoid answering the
phone and had they taken those two
considerations into account when they
were making their app maybe they would
have made other choices maybe not I mean
maybe they decided that they don't care
about security I don't work there so I
don't know but the mistake they made was
a failure of understanding of their
marketplace and they made the mistake of
failing to understand that people's
privacy concerns were way up there they
should have ranked up the
confidentiality leg on the triangle that
I showed you a few slides back that
everyone has forgotten already because
everyone does so when you're when you're
building something you have to look at
security from the perspective of the
people using it and the concerns that
those people might have in this case the
privacy of their calls and the privacy
of their music they're doing listening
to that doesn't mean that you have to
find a working exploit but you have to
have the security concerns taken into
mind when you're actually building this
thing and this is probably the most
important question how do you then rise
to meet that challenge in boses case it
is entirely possible that they knew that
people would freak out if they found out
I I don't know I don't work there so it
is entirely possible that they had this
discussion and they had decided that
that was an acceptable risk that it cost
the company more to have an opt-out
function and have people not send in
their data that they could then send on
then it would be to have this discovered
that's entirely possible
so when I say how we rising to meet that
challenge that doesn't mean that you
have to rise to the challenge to
actually perform security or do security
or have security at all it's true you
don't but you have to make a decision as
a company and impose this case maybe
they made the wrong decision and again I
don't work there so I simply don't know
the reality of security is that not all
of us are penetration testers I happen
to be one but most people when I say are
you going to start working in
security but the answer I get back is
I'm not a penetration tester or I'm just
a developer or I don't write code and I
think this is so so sad I cannot write
code I can't
I can read code I can code review but
put a gun to my head and I will produce
the ugliest code you have ever seen in
your entire life
it is truly mind-bogglingly bad but I
can code review I've never been able to
code and it is not stopped me from
working in security and I would say in a
marginally successful way I also have no
desire to learn to code I've tried and
it's just not my thing
so there's a misunderstanding that
penetration testers are the only job
existed in security which is a problem
because it's 2% of security work my
strongest I don't even know the word but
my strongest defenders are the people
that I need the most in my organization
our security developers and not even
security developers I need developers
that actually write secure code
I don't need penetration testers I don't
need you know security gurus I don't
need DEFCON I don't need blackhat I need
a security developer who knows how to
validate their code I need a security
developer that oh no you're smirking
it's true it's totally true I need I
need a developer that knows that echoing
back the password is a bad idea
I need no no like everyone is laughing
but these are all examples that I have
seen I need a developer that knows that
sending personal data over HTTP is a
terrible idea that putting the password
in clear text in a cookie is a terrible
idea that having the password in a
drop-down menu is a terrible idea that
having no password is a terrible idea I
mean all of these are instances of bugs
that I have seen in production in the
wild weeks ago I mean they are still out
there
these are not the bugs of you know
yester your the other recent recent bugs
and they're built by a developer that's
hopefully not sitting in this room and
if they are I'm so sorry sorry but
they're obviously still being produced
and a penetration tester yes that per
would have found that particular bug but
I would argue that having a developer
that knows that that's a terrible idea
is a stronger case in a more important
case than hiring a penetration tester to
you know frankly kick a dead horse most
of us are horribly understaffed and if
you have a top-down approach you're
taught to think big picture you're going
to be in the C level you're going to
think a big picture and you're going to
make a big plan and it's going to be
very big and it's going to go over six
eight nine twelve months it's gonna be
huge and it's gonna be amazing it's
going to revitalize your entire
organization that's going to be staffed
by half a person and it's it's that is
never going to work there's a screaming
need for security people like screaming
if you write security somewhere in the
margin on your resume I guarantee your
recruiter will call you promise I'm
pretty sure you don't even have to spell
it correctly at this point it's true
it's true this it sit there like it is a
screaming desperate market need for
security people and yet for whatever
reason developers aren't taking it upon
themselves if we are given a budget and
that is miss not a when it's generally
not large enough to buy the shiny new
blinky box that all of the salespeople
at DEFCON black hats is e-squared
conferences will tell us that will solve
all of our magical problems all of the
medical problems
our budget is generally small if we get
one at all it does not cover the giant
holistic huge plan that I have for my
half a person that works every other
Wednesday so what do you do how can I
solve my problem because that doesn't
mean that I'm somehow excused
I can't just be like all right no budget
no people no security no one wants to
hear that I will be fired immediately if
I still have to solve the problem and so
I can make two choices at this point I
can either try and build something with
nothing or I can leave or I can make the
third terrible choice of just screaming
into the wind trying to get a budget and
trying to hire my 26 people that I
decided I
for my big picture so those are my
choices final problem Security's
horribly misunderstood I have most of
the time I can't tell people what I do
because they assume I have some sort of
magical power that I can hack into there
whatever it is and it's always fast and
it's always speedy and it's always
amazing because when people look at
security they're looking at people at
DEFCON where everything has been filmed
in a pre-configured environment and it
goes super super fast what that person
isn't telling you is that that
particular bug took them six months like
someday I'm going to make a film of me
hacking and it will be me in my pajamas
sitting roughly in this position like
imagine me just like laying in a chair
drinking copious amounts of coffee for
six months and after six months I will
produce an IP address and six months
later I will have gotten teeny-tiny a
little bit further into whatever
environment you're trying to keep me out
of and the thing that I have on my side
is time I can sit there and wail against
your firewall until the end of time
frankly but your job is to keep me out
and to keep me out of every single hole
in your company ever I only have to find
the one thing you missed and I can sit
there forever and I can script it
because I can script and I'll just
script everything to you know keep
hammering away and sooner or later I
will get in and then I'll present it at
Def Con as if I just did this in five
minutes and it's super cool and that's
just it's simply not true here are the
special skills needed yep it's a long
arduous list it's very long it's a
functioning brain skill number one and I
would say bravery this is the most
important skill you have to be brave
enough to say I have no idea I say it on
a regular basis security is a massive
field massive and there are a million
things about security that I don't know
and I say I have no idea on a fairly
regular basis and if you're starting in
security you're going to say it even
more often than I do and so you have to
be brave enough to say that you don't
know and you have to be brave enough to
be able to say I don't know
more than once and you have to be brave
enough to ask the question and if you're
not brave enough to do those three
things then you're not going to succeed
within security because it is a massive
field so here is the special skills I
think that everyone in this room has the
particular skill set that is needed if
you can't code doesn't matter can't test
doesn't matter if you can ask a question
you're good to go
that's it that's all you need to be able
to do you need to be asked the question
and be brave enough to ask it that's it
that's all there is a stack overflow the
for security it's a security stack
overflow just as well populated a stack
overflow I hang out there a lot don't
send me your keys I see that a lot don't
do it and you can ask the question there
you can write to the OAuth forum to even
write to any forum you can talk to your
neighbor talk to a fellow developer
Google but ask the question I get to
hear a lot when I give talks of this
particular nature that I can't do
security because the customer doesn't
ask for it and this will always be true
the customer is never going to be
knocking down your door being like I
demand stronger HTTPS because the
customer has no idea what that is the
customer is never going to ask how you
encrypt your database the customer is
never going to ask about your password
management or your account management or
your access control it is never going to
happen ever however I refer to Apple who
did this probably best of all Apple when
they built a computer they built the
iPhone they built the iPod they built
the watch I'm wearing they did not have
customers knocking down the door to get
those things Apple drove that particular
innovation it is technology that drives
innovation it is not the customer it is
advertising that drives the need for
something it is not the customer Volvos
done the spectacularly with my super
safe tank car I have no idea if it's
true or not but that's how it was
advertised and that's how I bought it so
if you're waiting for somebody to call
you on the phone and be like I want to
secure something I mean one of a hundred
people will do it I'll probably be that
one person but most people simply don't
care or they're not knowledgeable to
actually ask the question
and I said it's simply the way it is and
this is kind of my own highly personal
opinion and you can take it or leave it
but I believe that as developers and as
engineers we have an ethical
responsibility to actually deliver a
secure product I think that if you're
building something and you know that it
is insecure or if you know that there's
some problem that I think we have an
ethical responsibility as security
people as human beings to deliver a
secure product and I hear when I say
that that people are like well I'm only
a developer and I would argue that
that's enough if you are brave enough to
ask the question if you're brave enough
to say something then that can be enough
to start a conversation I mean I have
been working in security for many years
and again I there are lots of things I
don't know and I have been sitting in
meetings with a developer who is like
well what about this and it'll be a
security risk that just totally blows my
mind I hadn't even considered it but the
fact that that person was brave enough
to actually answer ask the question at
all means that we handled them actual
risk that I probably should have thought
of but didn't the person had no idea how
to attack it the person had no idea how
to actually write the code to attack it
you know how it worked anything like
that but just simply asking the question
start a discussion where we realized it
was actually a problem that we could
handle before it hit production and that
was just simply someone being brave so
this is my highly personal opinion but
if you're building something I think you
have an ethical responsibility to
deliver it in a safe manner if you're if
you're doing something that you think is
morally questionable that adds a risk to
customer as risk to a patient answers to
someone using it I think that everyone
has the ethical responsibility to say
something and they could be overruled by
the c-level they could be overruled by
their boss that's a given but at least
say something so that person knows what
they are overruling I would argue that
this is the way to start working with
security and since you're all here
listening to me that you can't say I'm
wrong because this is my talk everyone
knows what risks their own product has
and people
start when I say that people go well I
don't work with security and I say you
don't have to because every developer
can tell me well don't send that
particular library my database will
break don't send that to my API of a
break
don't do that al overload if someone
finds out it'll be a problem everybody
knows this
they just don't consider it an actual
security risk so take those things and
write them down it can be on a post-it
note it can be on a wall it can be on a
I don't know whatever you happen to have
it work just write it down so that
you're aware of them you don't where
you'd gone up to do anything you aren't
just writing down and identify trust
boundaries who in here knows that a
trust boundary is mmm no one not even
you you did so well just before you did
some well I hope I hope don't worry
we'll get to that Nora you'll learn but
you start you your write down everything
that you think is going to go wrong with
your system buy some pizza grab a beer
do whatever it is you want to do and
just have a think to think about it for
a little bit and then this is the most
important one start small so most people
they they get a security book and it's
thick and it's boring it's probably you
know some sort of tome or they go to a
security conference and they're inspired
and then they look it up and it has lots
of huge security systems that you could
build in and they were immediately
overwhelmed with the security problems
that they have of security things that
they should do and oh god where do I
start
so start small pick something anything
it can be one API it can be one request
it can be one website it just start with
something and please start with
something small this is the big security
secret and this is what everyone should
start with this is code this is the only
code I have in this this time a little
nervous about it this is a validation
strength validate your code data you
will solve eight of ten security
problems this is the big secret everyone
thinks validation is boring as
myself included but if you validate your
input
I can't send nastiness to you if you
validate your output you can't post
nastiness that I've somehow gotten into
your database back to me this is it this
is security right there
done I have never met a developer who
can't validate their own code never it's
never happened ever everyone can do this
everyone is capable of doing this missus
security that's it
start with validating your inputs and
your outputs it's called the vent
defense and depths it is the strongest
security mechanism we have just validate
what you send away from yourself
validate where you take into your system
and I swear to you and I could beg you
on bended knee but I don't think you can
see me behind the table that this will
solve eight of security eight of ten
security problems I promise and you
won't believe me and that's that's
totally fine Google and you'll see that
I'm not lying but this is it this is the
big secret this is a trust boundary so
this looks super confusing very flashy
very fancy this is simply identifying
what speaks to what over a trust
boundary and a trust boundary is when I
speak to somebody that isn't me so if I
speak to the gentleman over here on my
right hi hi we have a trust boundary
between us stuff I'm validating the code
I'm like I am sending the gentleman on
my right to glass and I know that it
goes through a trust boundary because he
is not me I am NOT we don't work at the
same company so when he sends the glass
back I'm going to give it a good gander
to make sure he's actually sending me a
glass and then I'm also going to ask
myself how do I know it's the same dude
I mean he could be a different dude so
now I have to check is it the same dude
on the right yeah same dude cool is it
the same glass yes looks like same grass
okay and now I can take it so when
you're developing something you write up
what talks to what do you talk to
vendors do you talk to foreign api's do
you talk to foreign SDKs do you talk to
foreign databases do you talk to for
applications do you talk to whatever it
is and that is a trust boundary and most
likely that is where you're going to
find your security problems because
you're going to make some assumption
that
the dude on the right is still the same
dude so I don't have to check or my
personal favorite he's always been
trustworthy before sorry I'm sure you're
lovely but you know he's always been
trustworthy before so I don't have to
check or another personal favorite he
would never do that sorry I'm picking on
you now
or he wouldn't care so going back to the
Bose headphones I don't think anybody
would have thought that people's
playlists leaking would be a big deal
Netflix was hacked and people film you
know what movies they were watching was
leaked and that was also a big deal but
if you'd asked them on the street do you
care if everybody knows that you watch
Gilmore Girls on a regular basis I don't
but you know maybe if not you know it
was leaked and everyone thought was a
huge deal both you know my terrible
taste in music all over the place but
people make assumptions that no one
would care about that until they do so
trust boundaries validate your input and
you will get started in security I
promise I swear I know what I'm doing I
promise this is probably the hardest one
for new security people and developers
in general not every fire needs to be
put out when you start in security when
you start looking at security problems
in general you're going to find a
massive heap huge of security problem
security bugs remember my giant backlog
and when it failed to appreciate time
with a not every fire needs to be put
out from a security perspective it can
be more important to know about the
problem and decide that you don't care
than to throw yourself over it create an
emergency patch and panic but when
you're new that can be a really really
difficult thing to appreciate some days
I've been doing this for a long time
even I struggle with it so I have to
take like a 10-minute brisk walk around
the building and then I come back and
I'm like all right we don't care and I
know it's a hard one because you have
found it so obviously it's a burning
problem and you can't understand why
everyone doesn't care and that can be
really really really difficult the sky
is rarely falling you may think that
this is the end of
world but the media will say that this
happens you know and it's going to be a
huge thing but the media loves to write
about security because it's sexy and
it's new when everyone loves you know
hackers because we're spooky but the sky
is rarely falling and if it does you're
going to be fine as long as you're
prepared some things that you can kind
of help keep the sky from falling and to
give you a better understanding of the
risk that you've pressed discovered are
two different things one is the CBS s
database and it gives you a ranking of
how dangerous a vulnerability might be
it also has open vulnerabilities that
you can look at so this library of this
that and the other thing is currently a
critical you can find a patch here this
that and the other thing and then
there's also a loft top-10 Oh F is the
open web application security project
it's a massive global project we're
working with application security
believe it or not and every single year
they kind of look at what current
security vulnerabilities are most
dangerous and most common and rank them
from one to ten and it's a security
problem that you find is on that
particular list then it's probably
something you should address because
it's common it's well-known and it's
known to cause damage this list is also
something that penetration testers use
it's also something the auditors use so
you can use it to say to your boss or
your general or whoever it happens to be
that it's on the OS top ten list it's a
given list and they will be able to rank
that according to the fact that it's
it's an auditable list it's something
that's given the most valuable thing you
can do and I've kind of harped on this
during my talk and I'm going to continue
to harp on it is asking the question
have we actually considered what will
happen rather than actually finding the
exploitable code so if you're building
something actually asking the question
what will happen if so that we as an
organization can prepare so that your
security team can do something so the
unit developer can do something is far
more important far more important than
actually being able to find the bug
itself being amplified in the bug is
great and I'm not saying that you know
it's not an important skill that it
doesn't have
smile but I would I would hazard a guess
that eight of ten times it's far more
valuable to be able to identify the risk
ahead of time than the bug in production
because if you identified ahead of time
it won't get out to production to begin
with you'll be able to actually address
the problem
so everyone remembers the triangle from
my first slide that I said was super
important
no one does it's totally fine I'm going
to skip back to it
see because everyone lies and says they
remember and they don't if you take
nothing else away from the talk there
are two things one be brave and actually
ask the question everybody starts from
somewhere and insecurity unfortunately
the community has a way to go to be more
welcoming but I promise if you're brave
enough to answer the question someone
will help you second thing this really
is where to start with security I
promise if you're struggling to figure
out what to Google go to the triangle
and be like all right my API is sending
information I am sending a password for
example it is super important that that
password not leaked anybody else so I
have to think about confidentiality
super important it's also super
important that that password is actually
the password integrity probably super
important so when I start googling on
Stack Overflow I know that I should be
googling confidentiality problems with
that particular API or that particular
service or whatever it happens to be
same thing with integrity how am i
hashing this particular password because
I know that those two things are
important availability is still
important but it's probably not as
important as the first two everybody
following me good all right I don't know
if DevOps does this because I'm new here
but if anyone has any questions I will
take some questions because that was all
I had be brave people please oh one more
thing
if you hang out at the wasp forums or if
you hang out security forums at all I'm
as brakus you can always write to me
because I do a lot of intro trainings
for new people I do a lot of newbie
questions and so
you can always write to me because I I
like helping new people so I will be
your way in worst case scenario
all right now take some questions if I
have any questions at all maybe I don't
okay you can just yell oh sorry okay
okay oh well all the people are thinking
okay and so I'm a CTO but I have to deal
with security not necessarily have but I
have to also help people think about
security one of the things we talk about
is for encryption but anything really is
how we store it how it transfer it and
how we handle it is it just those few
things or am I missing something is
those you've forgotten one particular
thing and this is a particular skill set
of Mines called daisy chaining if i get
into your system the first thing i'm
going to go after is your log files so
when hits the fan you're going to
want to figure out what I just did and
if I can recreate the log files and back
out of your system recreating a log
files as a go you're going to be in big
trouble
so traceability don't forget it because
most hackers and I know a fair few of
them go after the log files first and if
you haven't salted and hashed your log
files you're going to have a terrible
time because worst case scenario I'll
find an exploit and then I will sell it
to someone else and you'll never know I
was there and the next person will get
in and they'll not know that they were
there etc etc etc to solve salt and
hashes or log files the question
hi something I kind of struggle with is
you mentioned the trust boundary so I
could take the view that everything in
my data center is trusted yes you can
and I could take the view that if I'm
going from my app server to my my
database that that communication path
doesn't need to be secure you absolutely
could yes
would you have any comments on that is
that good thing to do do you trust your
people good question do you let anybody
else into your building good question
do you let anyone else under your
network I'm leading to the answer is I
shouldn't really say you shouldn't and
here's the thing here's the thing I have
a huge huge advantage when it comes to
security work and the fact that I'm a
girl this is the one area in tech that I
have an advantage every else sucks but
there are no female hackers I will stand
in front of your database and I'll have
two cups of coffee and will be my first
day and I'll be really sad and you will
let me in okay thank you so yeah that
was a great sort thank you very much
um I'd like to know if you have any
comments on the kind of the kind of
pattern which I've seen a fair bit which
is where people will where you'll
implement this this application without
necessarily having them security in mind
much and then someone will come along
and say right make this secure you know
we haven't done the dream so they look
for some that have bought some you know
some library that you're supposed to
integrate somehow makes it secure more
they're all they're just courses as an
information security and hours analyst I
want it to be secure yes if you have any
comments on dealing with that kind of
attitude
sorry um that happens a lot
unfortunately and generally the way
security work is done is it's either
three days after it was in production or
30 seconds before it's supposed to go to
production and those are the two options
that suck and when that happens honestly
there's nothing you can do the honest
answer to that IT security analyst is
where were you three months ago okay
yep it's it's an honest question because
if you don't design security from the
beginning taping it onto the back end
and just being like it's not gonna work
hi I was wondering do you have any
opinion on the yourself
static vulnerabilities Commercial Code
because we brought money to our
organization at the moment what it's
doing is it's there's loads of issues
coming up with the applications and then
really not getting any time or much time
or budgets for people to fix them so you
have any piece are they of much use or
is it a case of just causing extra
problems for yourself it depends it
depends totally on how you use them so a
static vulnerability scanner tends to
vomit out like three thousand blue merle
ities three four or five thousand huge
and then usually it'll have like I'm
going to say that your organization's
semi up-to-date I'm just going to you
know across my comms say it has maybe
ten criticals
maybe you don't have to say yes or no
but both the system it has ten criticals
and we're going to assume that your boss
is like I see it and my responses and
that's and you're going to be like okay
that's fine and then you make a chart
and then you start charting how long
those criticals are in the system and
then you can say okay we scan every week
and there was ten criticals week one ten
criticals week two 10 criticals week
three ten criticals week four and sooner
or later you're going to have a really
long span of time say four months and
then you have most organizations have a
KPI of some type and all of a sudden you
have proof that your organization has
ignored ten critical vulnerabilities for
four months say and then you go to your
boss or your boss's boss or whoever has
the ability to actually help you and you
present that to that person you say your
ear okay with this or you're not you
have to make sure those ten critical
vulnerabilities are actually real
because false positives are real and if
they say then you know we're fine we're
okay with ten critical vulnerabilities
in production then I can't help you but
most people would not be when presented
with the fact that it's it's lived there
for a long time and no one is doing
anything but most of the problems with
vulnerability scanners like that is that
you have such a huge mountain of
information that it doesn't become
something
a non-technical or CTO or CEO or CFO can
consume but a small number of verified
bugs that have been there for an
extended period of time is a scary KPI
especially if you have shareholders or
stakeholders or someone that the board
is responsible to that's going to look
really bad so I'm usually not for the
scare them into action but if you're
really struggling that can be kind of a
last resort scare them into doing
something what oh yeah certainly it's
blinking at me but my time is up so I
guess thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
