name is eerie and I'm going to be
talking to you today about progressive
enhancement and CSS so just a bit of an
introduction to myself so this is
actually my full name my full name is
eerie OLOA akan care Elizabeth Ulua sure
I dare in Oakland so that's pretty
typical of where i'm from for many
answered uncle's to give you many
different names but don't worry you
don't have to remember all of that
because I typically just go by eerie or
if you're adventurous and want to be my
friend you can call me ray um so I'm
from Lagos Nigeria and this is actually
my first time in Zurich so pretty
excited to be here it's very different
between here in Nigeria and not least
like the weather so this is the last
time I'm going to put my face in an
image but this is kind of like me
particularly yesterday when we're
walking around going to this because
then I was just like I'm cold so I'm a
user interface designer and front-end
developer I currently work at a media
company in Nigeria which is called big
cabal I also write weekly articles on my
blog which is called bits of code so
definitely go and check that out and I
just write articles about anything to do
with HTML CSS and JavaScript and I kind
of like to think of myself as someone
who can really break down complicated
topics in a way that people can easily
understand so I'm also a Google experts
in web technologies which is just a
program that Google has that like a
network of developers and other experts
in different fields who go around and
kind of like give talks and try and give
out their knowledge as well so the talk
today I'm going to do is about
progressive enhancement but not really
progressive enhancement as you might
have typically heard about it
so it's going to be about progressive
enhancement and CSS which is like oh my
god groundbreaking so first of all what
is progressive enhancement and to really
understand what progressive enhancement
is we have to go back to it origins all
the way in 2003 and that was kind of a
bit of an interesting year this was
actually the most popular phone at the
time which is not here 1100 which is
kind of crazy to see how phones have
come back have gone so far and okay this
doesn't work but this was the sound of
the internet so anyone who had dial-up
internet probably recognizes this sound
and this was the state of the web
essentially so there weren't very many
browsers there was only so that was the
only pirate suicide yeah so this was the
state of the web so there weren't very
many browsers at all Safari was just in
version 1.2 and Phoenix which is now
called Firefox that's what it was before
and Internet Explorer was completely
winning at the browser Wars with over
ninety-five percent market share so
apart from the fact that there were many
different browsers available each
browser was still in its own infancy so
there was only about a handful of
versions of each browser so it's not
like you have to deal with a million
different browsers and then a million
different versions of each of those
browsers so the prevailing practice at
the time was then something called
graceful degradation and this is
essentially the practice of building
your web functionality so that it
provides a certain level level of user
experience in more modern browsers so
that would be like the most optimum
experience where users can do pretty
much everything on your site but then it
were also sort of degrade gracefully to
a lower level of user experience in
older browsers so people in these older
browsers will have like a very limited
experience and functionality and ability
to access the functionality in the site
so this kind of an example of graceful
degradation
done poorly but still graceful
degradation so someone visits your site
and they don't have javascript and you
just send them a message saying well
your browser sucks like go get chrome
but then a turning point came on March
11 2003 and this was a turning point not
unlike Moses coming down from the
mountain with the Ten Commandments but
instead of Moses on the Ten Commandments
we had the sky called Steven champion
and he brought us progressive
enhancement so he gave a talk at South
by Southwest and in this talk he first
outlined what the major problems were
with graceful degradation so first he
said that it doesn't straddle technology
and flexion points well so graceful
degradation is really just a solution
for whatever is the current best browser
so it doesn't really think about what
could be in the future or what was in
the past another problem he knows her he
noted was that many designers don't even
really test for anything but one version
back so graceful degradation won't
really be a problem if people were
testing like many many more versions
back but if all you're doing is testing
the current and one version backs and
that becomes a problem he also said that
graceful degradation doesn't address the
different needs of different audiences
so it's only about like I said
highlighting what's good for the person
who is using like the latest version of
Chrome for example but it doesn't really
take into consideration people who are
maybe are even using that browser but
maybe they have like special needs or
special disabilities it's also expensive
to retrofit to new alternate devices so
apart from only being able to work with
Leslie like the latest version of Chrome
it doesn't look at like latest devices
or latest browsers that aren't
necessarily like sitting with the norm
so it might be something that came out
today but it's just kind of like not the
usual type of browser and finally kind
of gave the practice of whatever is good
enough
just usually rule so it doesn't really
encourage assess designers or developers
to think about think outside the box and
think about people who are not in the 99
percent when we're building things so
then he introduced the concept of
progressive enhancement and what he said
was that web design needs to be more
mature and accept the developments of
the past several years so we can't just
look at what is happening currently we
have to accept what has come before and
not just forget about it and he also
reminded us that the goal of web design
isn't just to dazzle the user it's to
also deliver information so if someone
is going to your site's let's say it's
like a new site or something they are
going there to read the news they're not
going there to look at how beautiful the
site is even if it is okay so all of
this was pretty theoretical but what
does this actually mean in practice so
what exactly is progressive enhancement
so I'm just going to go over some five
guidelines for what progressive
enhancement is so first we need to make
sure that basic content and
functionality of your site should be
accessible to all web browsers so you
have to think of whatever it is is like
the core of your sites and just make
sure that that is accessible to anyone
using any browser so here's like an
example of a site which is like a site
where you can go to define clinics
around you so the user goes to the site
and enters in their post code or their
location and then they'll get a list of
clinics that are around them and
information so those are two things that
users in any browser on any network
should always be able to do so a second
rule is that sparse semantic markup
should contain all the contents and this
involves sort of two things so first of
all the semantic markup so when we're
writing our HTML we need to make sure to
be a thematic as possible and use the
correct elements for what we're trying
to convey so you can see that I've used
like the actual header element to
display a header and then actual footer
element to display is footer
and then the second part of that is that
as much of the content as possible
should be defined in plain text in the
markup because this is ultimately the
most accessible formats for everyone to
the third rule is that enhanced layouts
can be provided by CSS style sheets and
the key word here is the enhanced
layouts so what you're saying is that
the page to still be functional without
the SSF oh and CSS is just an
enhancement so this is an example of
what that clinic site looks like without
any CSS and obviously it's not like it
looks pretty or anything but as long as
the content is there and it still makes
sense and it's still functional if
someone actually had to use it in this
way the fourth rule is that enhanced
behavior can be provided by unobtrusive
JavaScript and again the key word here
is be enhanced behavior so that the core
behavior the core functionality is
available without JavaScript and then
you just add JavaScript as an
enhancement so for example this is how
the search would would work without any
JavaScript so the user will just type in
their post goodbye hand and then click
search they'll go to a different page
where they see their results of the form
but if the user does have javascript
enabled then you can add this
enhancement which will allow them to
just click a button and use their
current location so finally we need to
make sure that the end user web browser
preferences are respected so ultimately
the user who's using their site needs to
be in control of how they want to
experience the site or experience any
other sites and we have to be careful
when we're writing our HTML CSS and
JavaScript to make sure that we're not
interfering with that I'm taking that
control away from them so this kind of
an example of something that yet you
might have seen and it's really bad
practice to add things like user
scalable is no for the meta viewport tag
because that just takes the control or
the decision away from the user who
might need to like zoom in or zoom out
to make their
experience more comfortable so wise
progressive enhancement still important
today so obviously the world is very
different today than it was back into an
2003 so there's just more of everything
if we think about it so first of all
there's many different more browsers so
even though chrome is dominating as the
most widely used browser it's not nearly
as much of the market share us it's an
exporter had back in the day so there's
still significant amounts of other
browsers that we need to take into
consideration and apart from that each
browser has many many more versions so
we're not just dealing with a handful of
versions for each browser so even if
your user is on Chrome well like which
version of Chrome are they using they
might still be on chrome version like 20
or something for all you know and
there's many more technologies that were
using to develop and many of these
technologies require many more things so
we can't just we're not just developing
with very simple like HTML CSS and
JavaScript anymore and there's
significantly amounts significantly more
people that are now online so compared
to 2003 the amount of people online has
like almost quadrupled and even if let's
say one percent of the users now have
some sort of like special need that's
still in the millions and it's not
something that can be ignored and on top
of all that the web is still open and
it's still for everyone so this is a
study done by mckinsey &amp;amp; company back in
2014 and they kind of and they looked
into how many hours of work that people
in different countries have to work to
be able to buy and use 500 megabytes of
data and as you can see like where I'm
from in Nigeria the vast majority of
people the average person will have to
work correcting like
eight hours just to be able to use 500
megabytes of data as compared to someone
maybe in Germany or here would have to
work just like one hour or so and
because of this the way that we choose
to build our sites actually matters so
even if we might think that adding one
giants like a completely giant style
sheets or adding lots of JavaScript and
things are uncertain really that
necessary to the core experience even if
we think that's not that important to
someone who is having to spend like
twenty eight hours of your time to go
and look at your sites that is really
really important and Bruce Lawson
reminded us that ww-well see Western web
actually stands for World Wide Web so
it's not good enough to build the site
and only and make it only accessible to
like one percent of people so now I'm
going to go into how progressive
enhancement works and first I'm just
going to go over progressive enhancement
and JavaScript and HTML to be able to
compare it to how will work with CSS so
first of all progressive enhancement and
JavaScript which is probably what you're
more used to when we heard the term
progressive enhancement so what can go
wrong with JavaScript and they're
basically broadly speaking two things
first of all may be a case where
javascript is not enabled in the browser
or the user might be using a browser
like opera mini where javascript is
essentially unavailable or maybe
javascript is available but whatever
feature you're using isn't supported by
the browser that your user is using so
how do we deal with this first of all as
I've said before the first thing that
you should always do is try and make
your site as functional as possible if
javascript is not available at all and
that's just kind of like the ultimate
progressive enhancement so no matter
what at least your core functionality is
going to be available another thing we
can do if javascript is available is
before we use any particular feature
especially the more cutting-edge ones
that we do feature support so we just
check to see
it's available before we use it so for
example if we're making like a
progressive web application and when
using the service worker the first thing
day we tell you to do is to check to see
if it's available before you start using
it and that way it's not going to break
for browsers that don't support it and
we can even take this further and poly
fill our own features so if for example
a browser doesn't support native
promises we can just add that
functionality ourselves with a polyfill
so that's pretty simple enough
progressive enhancement with JavaScript
so next with HTML so what can go wrong
here is let's say we want to use some of
the new html5 elements but the browser
doesn't support it so what happens there
so for example we write something like
this we're using the header element and
the main elements but if the browser
doesn't understand it it's essentially
as if you had just returned a plane div
so none of the semantic meaning that we
intended to convey by using like header
element or main element is actually
conveyed and if we think about it this
is kind of like the graceful degradation
approach so nothing really breaks things
are still functional but the browser
isn't getting the extra information that
we want to and this isn't terrible but
we can actually make it better by using
progressive enhancement so in this case
we can use Aria rules to add that extra
information so for browsers that don't
understand what header or what main
means they'll get that same information
from the area rules that we've applied
so again simple enough so now to the
actual question well what about CSS so
there's a bit of a problem with
progressive enhancement and CSS and
understand this let's just go into how
CSS works and what happens when things
break so as we know CSS is a declarative
language for describing presentation of
a document written in markup language so
this is how a typical CSS rule is we
have the selector which is how
we select the elements in the markup
then we have the property which is the
CSS property we want to apply and then
finally the value which is the value
that corresponds to that property so
what happens if something goes wrong so
we have this example here this is a
lovely picture of Carney laughing out
loud and what we want to do is just
turning around 180 degrees so here's an
example of what happens if we have a
faulty selector so instead of doing IMG
i wrote image fully and we can see that
nothing happens and then here we have a
faulty property instead of using the
transform property I wrote transformer
and then again nothing happens and then
finally for T value instead of writing
90 deg I wrote degrees out in full again
nothing happens and even if we get all
of that stuff right this is the result
that we get in a browser that doesn't
even support transforms at all so
nothing happens we don't get any error
messages like we might do in javascript
there's nothing Breaking and we don't
have any like inbuilt fallbacks or
anything like that just nothing happens
so why is this a problem so unlike
JavaScript we can't really prepare for
unsupported features in the same way as
like poly filling you can't go like if
this is supported then at this polyfill
so we can still have the same
functionality and with on my HTML
there's no sort of built-in fall back
the way it works in markup so that kind
of leaves us in a situation where we
might we don't really understand what
might be breaking and when we change
things things just go unexpected and
that's why people tend to think
debugging CSS is such a pain but there
are things that we can do to help the
situation so first I'm going to go over
some of the solutions we can use today
and for the past few years to for
progressive enhancement and CSS so the
number one thing I always say is to
start with sensible
HTML so as you mentioned before markup
is the core it's where the content is so
it's ultimately the most important thing
so when you're writing your markup try
to make things as semantic and as
orderly as possible so write your markup
in the way that makes the most sense so
don't do something like this where you
put your header all the way down and
then you CSS to now correct it to make
it make more sense you should just put
things in your markup the way they
should be and you can still reorder
things in CSS but put them in the most
logical order in your markup and then
this illest apart article this guy
called Aaron Gustafson I think talked
about what he called the progressive
enhancement Eminem and he talked about
how the HTML is the core so it's the
actual nuts and is the most important
parts and everything else you add on top
of that is just like an extra
enhancement it's not is not crucial to
the actual mmm so another thing we can
do is take advantage of the Cascade so
as we know CSS is cascading style sheets
and we can use this behavior to
advantage by building rules on top of
each other and making each rule kind of
like a progressive enhancement of top of
the other so for example if you wanted
to use gradients we would define them
later on and then have some fallback
styles defined earlier so that if the
browser doesn't understand this linear
gradient function there's something that
they can fall back on and that's also
how we use vendor prefixes so we always
put the unpriests version at the very
bottom so when the browser now supports
the on prefix version that's what's
being used and then you put the floor
back style the ones that are for
browsers that don't support like the
full of prefix version we put that
before so that only when the browser
doesn't understand the latest one that
they can now solve back to the previous
ones another thing we can do is
implement a mobile-first strategy when
we're writing our CSS
there are many many benefits to adopting
like a mobile first strategy and using
min with based media queries are the
best way to go about it and the reason
for this is because styles that you
write for mobile are typically way more
adaptable to the desktop than the other
way around so for example here if you
have like an image that you style
correctly for the desktop it's not going
to work that well on mobile whereas if
you have a style that's for mobile will
at least be workable on desktop so
that's why we try to start from the
smaller screen size which are also
typically more responsive sizes anyway
and then work our way up so an example
of this is just if we had a width on
mobile will typically just have it like
eight as a percentage style maybe a
hundred percent but then as you have a
bigger screen size then you can start to
work with more fixed units another thing
we can do is use flex books so flex book
was actually designed to be a
progressive enhancement and it has a lot
of features that allow us to work with
this as an enhancement and have things
fall back so if flexbox is supported it
will actually override a lot of styles
that you have already included so for
example this selector is trying to
censor both vertically and sense and
horizontally any children within it so
the display table cell and the vertical
align middle that's what would work if
the browser doesn't support flexbox but
if the browser does support flexbox then
those Styles be completely overridden
even the vertical align will also be
overridden even though we haven't set a
new thing so flexbox will actually take
control of your layouts and that way you
can have the Flex box tiles and if it
doesn't work you can still have other
styles to find and it won't actually
interfere with anything if the xbox is
supported our xbox is very well
supported actually so you can and should
be using it in a production at the
moment so another thing you could
consider doing is separate
seeing your style sheets so I would say
as a very last resort if you have to
support something as far back as like
ie7 or something it might just make
sense to have like separate your
concerns and have like a separate thing
just for that browser so the BBC wrote
about how they did this a few years ago
wouldn't the method that they called
cutting the mustard so what they did was
they started with a core experience that
would work in pretty much any browser
and then they now built on top of that
and started doing feature detection to
see if if the browser supports certain
features then you can start adding some
extra things on top of it so this kind
of the way they did it so checking for
specific features that the browser has
and if it has those features then they
now start loading extra style sheets or
extra script files so now I'm going to
talk about the future of progressive
enhancement and CSS so I'm sure by now
you're probably wondering like what
about the latest thing which is feature
queries so feature queries allow us as
the authors to condition rules based on
whether a particular property
declarations are supported by the
current browser so the way it currently
works is sort of like media queries so
we use the app supports rule and then we
have a condition and then we now have
cells that will only be applied if that
condition is true so there are four ways
that we can use this so first we can
just do a simple detection to see if a
feature is supported at all so for
example here we have if support display
sex then we now just apply it to that
profit that selector we can also chain
chain feature queries together in a way
so we can detect if all of several
features are supported so we might only
want to apply certain style it's both
the font kerning and font feature
settings properties are available and we
can do it's the other way around like do
either or so this way we can detect if
maybe the prefix or the unperfect
version is supported before we
apply some styles and finally we can
also just check if a feature is not
supported and maybe try and apply a
fallback a fallback style instead so
yeah it's pretty perfect it seems like a
really truly perfect feature and it kind
of is and it's very very well supported
actually and very recently it was only
added to opera mini and so actually the
only browser that doesn't support it
right now is Internet Explorer so the
fact that it's not supported by every
single browser doesn't mean that we
can't use it today we can still use it
and there are different methods that we
can use and gentlemen wrote an article
about how we can use them today even
with browsers that don't necessarily
support it so so we're going to take
this example so we want to apply the
object Fitz cover a style to our images
and what we want to do is check to see
if objects thick cover is supported and
then apply it so there are four
scenarios that we have here so the first
scenarios let's say the browser does
support feature queries and it also
supports the CSS featuring question
which is objects its cover so for
example Chrome which is a browser that
does support both those things so this
is a scenario that's good for us because
yes the browser suppose feature queries
it also supports the feature in question
so the styles in between the curly
braces for the supports for the support
tags will be applied which is exactly
what we want a second case is where the
browser supports feature queries but it
doesn't support the feature in question
so for example Microsoft edge does
support feature queries but it doesn't
support the object fit cover prophecy
and this is also a scenario which is
good for us because then the supports
block works as intended what is between
the blocks is going to be ignored
because the browser which understands
the supports query will look at it and
say ok well it doesn't support objects
it cover so it's just going to ignore a
third a third situation is the case
where the browser doesn't support
feature queries but then they also don't
support object fit cover so this is
internet explorer for example doesn't
support either of those things and this
you might think is not a scenario we
would once but in this case it actually
works perfectly because because that
Internet Explorer doesn't support
objects recover what we want is for that
entire block to be ignored and because
the browser doesn't support the feature
queries it is ignored so we have the
result that we want even though the
browser doesn't support the feature
queries but then we get to the situation
which is bad for us because the browser
doesn't support feature queries but then
the browser does support the feature in
question so for example Safari I think
it's 7.1 does support feature queries
but it doesn't support objects it cover
so this is a scenario where what is
within the feature query should actually
be applied but it isn't because the
browser doesn't support future queries
so you might think this is a horrible
problem and we can never use feature
queries again but of course there's a
solution and I'm sure you can guess what
I'm about to say it's progressive
enhancement so the answer to this is
just to use feature queries as a
progressive enhancement rather than a
requirement so we'll have a fallback
code above which can be used by any
browser so we'll be outside the supports
block and so no matter what if the
browser doesn't support either supports
or doesn't support the actual object bit
cover we have something that's going to
work for any browser and then we can
have it as an enhancement so now check
if it's available and then apply it so
the world is only moving to a place
where progressive enhancement is going
to become more and more of a
requirements and more rather than less
of a requirement so like I said they're
just going to be more things in general
so we're going to have many more
browsers and it's going to be a greater
range than we've ever even thought
so ranging from people using like a huge
VR display as a browser to people trying
to browse your website on their watch
and we're going to have many more
technologies by that point we might have
angular 123 whatever and we're going to
have many more people online as well and
those people aren't all going to be
coming online with like whatever the
latest iPhone is some of them might be
coming online with the equivalent of the
nokia 1100 that it is today so lastly
I'll just like to leave us with this
quote from Steven champion so the web as
we know is meant to be open and
accepting of anyone who can connect to
the internet and has a web browser so as
much as possible we should be
considerate about how we write our CSS
and HTML Javascript as well and leave no
one behind thank you question
hi how to cover how to holla wars with
other yes play football this is death
death because that we creat a reusable
mental ago sorry I didn't get that color
when we call you about yes how to pull a
Boris with others before work together
okay so how do you collaborate with
other yeah well theaters are quite
difficult it can be quite difficult to
collaborate with other people because it
tends to be something that you're
thinking about in your mind how you want
to achieve certain things but it's just
about I guess communication and deciding
along with your teammates before you
start a project like how are you going
to do this or what approaches you're
going to take so it's yes just about the
initial communication so everyone knows
the way that the project is going to be
written before you move forward
any other questions okay you have time
to yeah you can ask what do you want oh
yes question thanks a lot for the talk
it was really great thank you I was
wondering in this supports query can you
also use the knot selector there or
something so that we can have exclusive
style for each feature is supported or
not yeah you can use the not as well but
you have to be careful about how you use
it in case you get into a situation
where the browser doesn't support
feature queries but then it does support
the thing so but then again like I said
it's you provide a good fallback but
yeah you can use not as well
thank you very much for your talk I mean
again I wonder I think it's not a
problem but I wonder if it is a problem
essentially can you use CSS variables
inside support Christ and then basically
have the same scope have a different
values for to a certain level within the
report way yeah I think you can actually
because when you're setting a variable
is usually in the roots or if you want
it to be anyway so you can have it
outside like your route variables and
then inside a supposed query have
another route yeah that's a good idea
actually I didn't think about that yeah
yeah okay since we have time I was
wondering if you show some examples with
the fall back through the different
browsers how would you recommend going
about testing all of these different
cases that we've been talking about the
different situations with all the
different browsers how could we even
make sure that what we wrote actually is
progressive for the different cases for
the different place process um the only
thing you can actually do is get the
different browsers or different devices
or that's the best thing you can do you
can try I know in chrome dev tools you
can emulate different browsers and try
things like that but the best solution
is going to be to actually just have
different devices you can test on and
have the different browsers as well
which i know is difficult but what yeah
yeah yeah yeah well that stuff like I
can't remember what the tools browserify
or something where did you google there
some tools that will try and do that for
you and take screenshots yeah yeah you
can try that as well yeah
any more questions only shine yeah
hi Thank You fun talk you know my
question is there now we have different
possibilities to do this progressive
enhancement first of all we have the
possibility to do something in CSS but
it could also do it in JavaScript and
bonus if you do responsive websites who
have to do hex on both sides so what are
you recommendation so trying everything
you can do with CSS and go further this
JavaScript or what's the idea to mix
these things up and to both i guess it
depends on what particular things you're
talking about i would say well like that
article talked about how like you have
the progressive enhancement mmm so if
you start with HTML then the next thing
you should try and do is CSS and then
it's only if you can't use or if CSS is
not enough then you do javascript so i
guess i would say as much as possible
try and do CSS but then that would also
depend on what you're trying to do
because you shouldn't try and be doing
like logic things and CSS anyway so yes
there does different things and you have
to apply progressive and husband to both
of them
okay thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
