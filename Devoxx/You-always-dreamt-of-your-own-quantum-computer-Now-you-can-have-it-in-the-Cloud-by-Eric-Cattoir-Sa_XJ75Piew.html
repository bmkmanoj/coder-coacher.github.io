talk about quantum computing happy to
see you with so many still at this late
hour for a topic which is quite
challenging so I'm Erika Tran I'm in
fact part of the IBM company in the IBM
cloud unit and in my regular day-to-day
job I'm covering the the IBM bluemix
cloud platform so I'm not part of the
the quantum research department or
something like that so this is just one
of my hobbies and and that's why I'm
gonna explain you a little bit what you
can do with this IBM quantum computer
because that actually what this IBM
provides a quantum computer which is
hooked up in the cloud which you will be
able to use for your own experiments and
so we first will introduce you a little
bit what is it what is this IBM quantum
experience what the purpose why do we do
this and and then we will dive into it
and we will look at how you can use it
the main tool which you will be using is
this quantum composer and so we will
look at that I will also try to do some
demonstrations of how it works and one
of the things that I've already posted
my slides on SlideShare so and and I've
tweeted the link so if you want to look
at the the presentation contains quite a
few links to where you'll find this
quantum composer etc so if you want to
play with the things you can download
the presentation and then you have alter
all the links
so once we've introduced the the quantum
composer we will start to look at what
can you actually do with it what are the
basic building blocks and for anybody
who already seen some introduction
because we will not be able to do a full
overview of what this quantum computing
of course here we will mostly focus on
how you can use it I will try to explain
a few things for those who are not
familiar with quantum computing but so
we will first look at the basic building
blocks what is at your disposition in
this composer and then the next step
will be to look at some algorithms how
can you really do something and get some
things going and then as a last part I
will discuss a little bit about quantum
error correction which we will see is
quite an important subject and is also
one of the things which over the years a
type at the IBM research lab space they
got more and more control on which makes
the quantum computing really usable and
then as a last piece I've included a
number of slides with lots of reference
information will also explain a little
bit what it is because there is quite
some good information both at IBM and at
some other sources so first of all an
introduction to this IBM quantum
experience so to begin with let's first
take a look at why do we think quantum
computing is important why do we need it
why are we not just continuing like with
it sorry and probably everybody already
realized that over the last few years
you saw this exponential growth in
computing power no longer happen
if I remember a few years ago I also had
a CPU which was at somewhere between two
and three gigahertz and it's not moving
anymore at that pace which we were
seeing like 10 years ago
and that's basically the point we are
coming to this end of the Moore's law
and and and the the the increase of
those traditional computing models
actually the the typical microchips we
are currently building are at the point
that a transistor is only a few atoms so
we can no longer go much further in
those kind of models and still there is
a lot of problems where we want huge
computing power if you pay some
attention at the conference
you probably heard a lot about all those
machine learning deep learning etc and
each of those things it requires quite
some power especially if you would want
to apply them in real time so so so we
need more computing power for certain
for solving certain problems so how can
we do that and one of the the possible
solutions we see at IBM is quantum
computing I mentioned the few other
things which we are doing in our
research labs one of the other things we
are we are looking at is so-called
approximate computing what's the idea
there the idea is that one of the most
costly operations in our traditional
computers is a processing real numbers
and and and making calculations with
lots of digits behind the coma that is
what is costing a lot and for which we
use things like those graphical
processor units and and and all those
kind of things but in some solving some
problems you
I need all that precision so we are
looking at some computing models where
you would do some approximate
calculations and then it's a bit too
simplified here 10 times 10 is 98 so of
course not what we are looking at but
it's more like in some cases for example
calculating those neural networks and
things like that it might be enough if
we calculate with less digits
less precision which of course can then
also save a lot on the on the computing
power so that's one one area we are
looking at another area is so-called
neuromorphic computing so a computing
model based on the actual or at least on
the model how we think that neurons
human neurons work and that of course
has also some good links to all those
neural networks and and so on so one of
the the and actually we already have
some of those processors available and
actually one of the the things we are
doing with that is image recognition and
one of the big advantages of that
solution is that it's quick and it
consumes little power so you can do
real-time image recognition in small
kind of devices so so that's some other
computing models the one which we're
gonna look into is quantum computing
because that's one of the other
possibilities were we see that there
might be some some advantages and in the
future now what what might be possible
applications of quantum computing so a
first case which pops up a lot when
people talk about quantum computing is
cryptography so most of our today's
cryptography algorithms
based on these large prime numbers which
are difficult to calculate and which
would if you would do it with
traditional computers would cost you a
lot of energy and a lot of time so it's
basically not feasible and that's why
our a cryptography is working today so
one of the things which you might be
able to do with with quantum computers
is do these prime factoring algorithms
much more quickly which would of course
mean a lot of things a lot of changes
from a viewpoint of cryptography and
cryptographic algorithms the thing is
that it on the one hand it might my
brain some possibilities to break search
turn over to these algorithms it will
also open up some new possibilities to
do more powerful cryptography or more
powerful ways to exchange keys and and
things like that which is one of the big
problems in today's cryptography now
that's only one of the possible cases
what we will be also what we also think
could be a good possibility is research
into the behavior of molecules one of
the the things that we know is that a
lot of the things that happen within a
model molecule are actually quantum
based kind of effects so today trying to
simulate those molecules with a normal
kind of computer is too complex we can
only do very simple molecules maybe we
can do things like a water model
molecule but already a molecule like
caffeine or is way too complex to be
able to completely simulate it with a
traditional computer now if we would
have a quantum computer
which is based on those quantum effects
we would most probably be able to do
such kind of simulations which can have
all kinds of advances with regards to
for example research towards new
medicine new drugs or new kind of
materials so so that's another domain
where we think this is gonna become
important as I already mentioned another
domain where lots of computing power is
as needed is this machine learning for
example yesterday I was at the session
by some of my colleagues on the the
networks behind the Watson computing one
of the questions that was asked was why
is it that a child can watch a movie for
maybe 10 minutes and learn a lot of
things out of that and if you want to
learn or train some of those neural
networks you have to send them lots and
lots of hours of material before it
becomes a bit effective so the that the
problem there is also of course that a
lot of those calculations and and the
learning the deep learning takes a lot
of computing power so it might also be a
quantum computing might also be a
solution for those kind of things and
then the last thing actually a point
which we're going to see one example a
basic example of it is the fact that we
can improve some of the search
algorithms so we would be able to
perform certain search in large volumes
of data quicker which of course
everybody knows is a problem we
encounter a lot in today's world so
these are some of the domains where we
think quantum computing can become
important where it can mean mean really
something and that's of course why we
are perform
the research in it and on the other hand
why we think it's important that the
world starts to learn about quantum
computing and and and that's actually
the whole reason why we are doing this
quantum computing in the cloud and and
so on is to help people in getting and
understanding learning how you can
program these things etc now with vide
Ivan just for those who are not so
familiar what what does quantum
computing about so quantum computing is
using some of the principles of physics
quantum physics um and actually it's
based on the usage of something which we
call qubit which actually are some are
very similar to regular bits in in
traditional computing with one very big
difference the fact that they know not
only can be 0 or 1 but that they can
also be this all the states in between
those which is actually what we call the
the superposition and that will be the
basis of a lot of the the reasons why
you can do certain things quickly with
quantum computing because you will be
able to pass just with a few qubits
could we protential you represent a lot
of information and as such you can do
certain things very quickly now that's a
bit too simplified because there is some
other things which you will have to take
into account one of the big problems and
we will also see that when we start to
look at the the algorithms is that as
soon as you try to observe those qubits
as soon as you try to measure them they
will flip either to the 0 or the 1 state
so that will make it very difficult to
make use and that will be also the
channel
when you devise the algorithms is how
can I get beyond that and that's
actually what we're going to do with the
entanglement in fact the entanglement
will mean that if you have multiple
qubits there can be certain effects from
one to the other and you could by
measuring one qubit get some information
about certain other qubits as such not
destroying the superposition on those
qubits which are which with which you
are treating the information so that
that's in a few words what does what
does quantum computing now how do we
make in fact to create the quantum
computer you need to create those qubits
those qubits which show those kind of
effects which obey to those laws of
quantum mechanics and that's actually
where IBM succeeded in doing this in a
relatively useable form factor and we
will immediately see what what I mean
with that so we will succeed that and
here is actually an image and this is no
longer the image of what we are using
today it's what we devised in 2015 so
this is actually a chip with four cubits
now what what is it what is it based on
in fact we will see that it's based on
some oscillators and I will immediately
explain a little bit more about those
and why those can be used and we will be
able to put certain frequencies on it
and then also measure certain read the
holes out of them which will tell you
what kind of state those those qubits
are in and actually a few more
information so you see the black the
black stripe here is basically one
100 micro meter so it's showing you kind
of the size of this of this kind of
things and actually the the piece here
is one of the qubits which is enlarged
if you want to know more about how these
qubits actually work and are implemented
I mentioned here one of the articles so
that's one of the articles which are
research people brought out when they
first devised that kind of qubit design
now to explain a little bit more what
this qubit this design is about I have
here some some diagrams with which I can
explore try to explain a few things and
the first thing is those are based on an
oscillator and for those of you who
maybe in their past experimented with
building radio circuits they probably
know this kind of of construct which
allows you to for example create a
certain frequency filter in in most
basic radios you were using this so an
induction and a capacitor to to create a
filter and under most cases those
capacitor the capacitor was one which
you could tune so where you could change
the capacity and as such modify the
filter and filter out a particular
frequency so now such an oscillator
basically gives you the possibility to
create certain frequencies and those
correspond also to energy levels now the
problem with such a basic oscillator is
that they are all the same so it's not
possible to to make any difference and
measurements between all those various
now that is where if we had a Johnson
junction which is actually a very tiny
solution construct which will be
operated at very low temperatures were
some superconductor
conduction effects are starting to
appear if we add that to the circuit we
will see some other effects happening in
fact we will see that the energy levels
will all be different and as such we
will be able to distinguish between all
those states allowing us to create a
basic kind of qubit so so so this is
kind of the basis of what we are putting
in there so already first remark you
might have heard it's based on some
superconductivity at very low
temperature which of course makes it not
so easy to take some of those qubits and
put them here on the table for example
so how did we get from that those qubits
to a quantum computer so actually this
is a photograph of the current design
and the big difference is that now there
is five cubits in there so the
principles are still the same but there
is five cubits in there and there is
some important thing also to note when
you're gonna start to build algorithms
is that actually the second qubit here
is kind of connected with all the others
which will play a role when we will
start to play with the entanglement and
the multi qubit gates so so that will be
have some impact and we will see that
also later when you start to build the
algorithms now how do we go from that
qubit to a quantum computer so I have a
few images so we add
a lot of wires to attach all those
measure oscillators to frequency
generators and then also measurements we
put that in some cooling environment
from which we can cool with some liquid
helium and then basically it becomes
this kind of thing so so that's the
photograph of the actual quantum
computer that you can use now what I
have here is a short demonstration of
how it looks like in this lab so I will
start played the movie welcome to the
IBM Research quantum computing lab in
this lab scientists are building quantum
computer inspired by nature and the laws
of quantum mechanics this computer could
exponentially speed-up computing and
solve challenges that are out of the
reach of today's computers take a look
around explore IBM's quantum computing
efforts
so and actually here you see one of the
scientists mounting some of the
resonators before the thing gets closed
up etc you see here also all the the
pumps and floors that are controlling
the the the de liquid helium cooling etc
and then of course some control
apparatus which which which you used to
calibrate and and and and to access the
the whole thing and actually you I've
also added the link in fact you can this
movie as actually if you look at it on
YouTube you will see it's a 360 degrees
here it's flattened out but on YouTube
you see it and 360 degrees and you can
kind of walk through this they slap so
what is now the nice thing is that
actually this whole setup you can use it
for example from a tablet or just the
web browser with this composer which we
will be looking into so that's kind of
the amazing thing you have this huge
device being cooled at almost the
absolute zero degrees and you can
control that you can submit experiments
from it from the cloud from from a web
browser using whatever kind of device
you want so so that was the introduction
what what is there what what can you do
what what does that your disposition
what we're going to look now into is a
bit more this quantum composer so how
does how can we really do something with
it and the again the link that this is
the link where you can get access to it
you can just create a free account there
and you can get you can get going and
access both a simulator and the
quantum computer and we will immediately
also explain what this the difference is
when we start to look on it
the real quantum computer you will have
some credits to use it and basically the
more experiments you do you will get
some additional credit so if people if
the lab people see that you do some
reasonable things with it you will be
able to do more with it so this is just
a screenshot of the of the composer and
actually what I propose is to look at
that in real life because that's always
much more fun so so actually I the link
was pointing to the place where you
immediately create a new experiment so I
have to give it the name and then the
first choice I have to make is ideal
quantum computer or really quantum
processor and what's the difference in
fact it's mentioned there the the ideal
quantum computing an ideal quantum
computer which you will only be able to
use with the simulator all qubits are
equal in the real quantum processor
setup it will take into account the
actual the actual setup and the actual
layout of those qubits the five qubit
processor so if we select that so now we
get this composer and so then there is a
few interesting things which I can see
so here first of all I can see that the
actual device is active at some point in
time they perform maintenance on it so
then the actual device is not active the
way it works typically if you submit
experiments to the real quantum computer
they go into a queue and the verb be
executed
at the certain point in time and then
you get back the results on the
simulator obviously you can immediately
exit you next you see also some of the
calibration values so for example you
see the fridge temperature there so it's
pretty cold in there so so you see that
and then we also see some calibration
values of the the various qubit and we
will come back to that when we look into
the error correction but those timings
are basically based on the decay time so
how long will a qubit keep its value and
that's one of the big difficulties and
all quantum computing now let's just do
something very simple just to to show
how it can be used so what I have here
is a number of quantum gates and we will
immediately look into what those are and
explain a little bit more what they are
but for those of you who have already
had some exposure to quantum computing
this should be no strangers so we have
some quantum gates which we can just
drag and drop and add to these lines and
then we can also add some measurements
so very simple so this actually this X
operation is corresponding to a bed flip
Oren XOR operation so orange and not
operations or in not operation so we
will actually play executing this one we
will be able to see what's happening
first remark you see here those zeros
actually all the qubits will be
initialized for you in the zero state so
if I now perform a simulation I again
get two options ideal quantum processor
or
realistic quantum processor in fact
what's the difference this one will just
apply the mat without including any of
the error effects the realistic quantum
processor as a simulator will actually
perform that that's the same kind of
thing but including some of the error
effect so you will see that certain
error start to appear
so let's now execute this so what what
do I get here in fact I get some
representations of the measurement so
the first thing is what we see is that
the output of this des experiment
returns me a 1 which is the the result
of actually this this not operation but
you see here that the rest else a slight
tweak here at the zero why is that
because we took the realistic quantum
computer so there is some errors and
this is also what to Booty if you
execute it on the real quantum computer
the glue the the glowbrasion
representation is just representing
those values because now the graph here
is still quite simple because we're only
working with one qubit one measurement
so there is only two possible values
that we can see if you work with more
qubits you're obviously gonna get more
values here and then it becomes
sometimes easier to look at the results
in this quantum sphere representation
where actually in this case the the zero
value is represented here and the one is
represented there so you can in the
composer you can also run your
experiment so if you would do that you
can choose how
many times you want to execute the
experiment and depending on what you
choose you will pay a certain number of
units one of the nice things is also
that for many experiments that people
have already been using you can also
obtain results from the cache so then
you don't have to specify this spend
your units so for example for this very
simple experiment I can get some results
which are in the cache I can see from
what kind of dates when those were
executed and I can get a search also
what is happening whether really quantum
computer and you see here there is even
a bit more of an error in the execution
so that was a first kind of look at at
this composure and let's now look a
little bit further to see what you can
do for real so a first kind of thing is
there is all these gates and what what
are they about just quickly because
again if we would explain that we are
explaining the whole theory of quantum
computing so you will have these yellow
gates which are basically just weights
so they are just weights and we will see
those will allow you to experience for
example some of the quantum errors so
you will be able to insert those and D
in the circuit and you will see that the
errors well will will will increase then
there is three green gates which are
basically known as the poly gates which
we will immediately also see a little
bit more what they are represented by
mathematically but basically those are
rotations around multiple kind of access
and we will immediately also introduce a
little bit why it comes that this is
actually being represented as a three
dimensional
vector space there is some more gates
one of the very important ones is this
had the Margate why because that had
more gate will be one of the gate that
will allow us to create super positions
so we've seen in our first experiment
the qubit was initialized on the zero
value and we just used this poly X get
to perform a bit flip which would bring
it in the in the state one if we want to
start to use the power of quantum
computing we will need to make use of
the super positions and in many cases
that will involve those Haddam our gate
so they will be fairly important and
there is some of the other related gates
so some phase gates what will those do
they will do a phase rotation so they
will also be important in those super
positions one special gate will be a
gate that this controlled gate so it
will be multiple it will use multiple
qubits so it will start to use the
interference between qubits and that
will be very important in many of our
constructions of the algorithms and then
of course there is some more but we will
cover them later on and then there is
also some measurement gates because
those will allow us to observe what is
what is happening so first important
remark which we already made when we
when we looked at the the real-life demo
so you the real quantum computer takes
into account some of the circuit design
so you will for example notice that when
you do the real quantum computer you can
only do this controlled not gate between
the qubit two and the other qubits in in
an ideal
quantum computer all the qubits will be
equal and you will be able to do the
control not between
any of the of the line so that will be a
difference and it's just based on the
the physical factors of the of the
circuit that we are using to implement
the the five qubit computer now here is
another example it's basically a random
generator and I'm not going to try to
explain here in a few moments the
experiment but just let me show a little
bit what that actually does and it
allows me also to show you a little bit
more about what is another important
part of this quantum experience is
actually there is a whole guide
explaining about quantum computing and
giving you all these kind of samples so
why is that important because we put
this out on the web for people to be
able to learn about quantum computing so
there is also a lot of material there
and the examples so here we have this
random generator we can just open them
up in the composer and then we can for
example random or simulate them and here
you see we don't have a run why because
this one has been created for ideal
quantum processor meaning that for
example I can do these kind of things
these control not gates between qubits
which are not the cute two qubit and on
a real one I would not be able to do
that so simulating that in fact what
that will do is it will generate one of
four random values and we see that in
this graph there with equal probability
and we can also see it on this on this
graph you see those values being
represented
wait let me go back to the
yeah so in fact those are corresponding
I have it in the slides also but those
are corresponding to the 0 0 0 so the
top of the sphere is actually the all 0
values and then it goes down like this
so it allows us in this much more
compact view to show all the different
values and then they also try to
illustrate with these lines which are
not always that easy to interpret the
probability so the lines towards those
dots will become thicker or thinner
depending on the probability so now the
lines are all the same thickness because
it's equal probabilities
so going back to the to the presentation
so this is just slide showing that the
result so we can skip that let's now
look a little bit more at what are all
those gates what are those building
blocks and and how we can use them so
first of all important is the qubits
they will be vectors in a complex
Hilbert space which actually means that
you can represent the coordinates of
that space with the cube at 0 and cubed
1 and all the values are the possible
values for qubit state can be
represented by a coefficient for example
alpha times that the zero cubed plus I
which is the the square root of -1 times
D times a factor for example beta times
D the one qubit so so that is how you
can represent from a mathematical
viewpoint those those those qubit States
and so the 0 and the 1 correspond to
these kind of vectors and the operators
are actually it's possible to represent
them with some matrices and the lot of
the operations are in fact linear
algebra calculations and here we have
the representations of the poly
operation operators the XY and Z so if
you want to calculate what the the ax
will do on for example the 0 qubit which
is what we did in the experiment you
basically multiply this matrix with that
vector and for those of you who still
remember some of their linear algebra
you will see that the result would be 0
1 so it would be the flip and actually
performing the same multiplying the ax
with the one qubit it with the result in
this so um the other operations are
actually involving in this case some
complex and that's also why we call them
phase flips because they will not just
flip from the 0 to 1 state but they will
also perform some rotations now the next
step is the superposition because that
one is very important with those basic
poly operations ok you can do some
things you can flip and you can change
the phase but it would not yet allow you
to make use of the power of quantum
computer because that's based on the
superposition so what what can we do
with the how can we do that we can use
this atom or gate
what will the Hadamard gate do it
actually is represented by this matrix
here and actually it will turn the cube
the 0 cubed into this plus state which
is actually a superposition of the 0 and
1 state and if you would run this
experiment so and if we in the composure
at the atom atom or gate and then
perform a measurement you would notice
that it will return in half of the cases
or approximately because of the errors
it will return the 0 cubed and in
Harvard B it returns the 1 what is
important to get your mind around is
that actually it's not either 0 or 1 but
before you measure the the qubit is in
some superposition state which is a
mixture between those two and that will
be important for for many of the the
algorithms now you can also create a
model so we have also this minus Q cubed
superposition state which actually you
can obtain by
using the Haddam are combined by this
zat gate so that's actually a face this
face flip and the one thing to notice is
when you measure you will not be able to
distinguish between the state and the
previous one so it will give you exactly
the same measurement why because you're
only measuring in one dimension so
you're not measuring that face flip so
how can you do that you would need to
add some additional gates to rotate to
or not rotate actually your measurement
and a search obtain the difference so
you would be able to do measurement
combined with gate which will allow you
to to see the difference between the
plus and the minus state and actually
with the rest of model gates the phase
gates which allow you to create some
more superposition state so those are in
fact indicated by those circular
representations in two directions and
again so there is the s and the
corresponding gate which will allow you
to create those kind of states and that
will actually result in the fact that to
distinguish between all those
superimposed states which we have here
you would need to perform three kinds of
measurements and actually we've solved
that for you because we added this other
measurement operator which we call the
Bloch sphere representation actually
that will execute your experiment three
times and will perform the the
measurements along the three kind of
superimposition states so and and that
will show you that you can represent
your qubit state by this kind of
mathematical function which actually
means
the the state is somewhere on this kind
of sphere and you can measure those kind
with those angles you can get an idea
about those phase flips and all those
kind of things so this will is
facilitating and will give you this kind
of representations now we see here a
circuit which is an illustration of some
of those things through when you would
execute this kind of circuit so it it
again remember all the the qubits start
and the zero state and then you apply a
number of those for mentioned kind of
gates and each time you you perform this
block measurement on it and you will see
that you create those states which we
call cardinal states because they are
along those axes of the XY and z of this
block sphere and important to note also
is that the ideal system always the the
qubits are on the on the sphere so the
length of this vector is always 1 now
what else do we need in fact in also in
real computing you need some controlled
operation so you want to do some if
something then something else happens
and that will be possible with this see
not gate which actually will involve two
qubits it can be represented by this
matrix and in fact it will perform only
the not operation in the case that the
control qubit is in the state one and
actually here is a table which shows
what happens when you when you use these
kind of inputs to the C naught gate and
then you measure a new
see for example the zero zero it would
remain zero zero because the control
qubit is zero and as such the gate
doesn't do anything
those were the the first qubit is one
then the the gate would perform its
operation and would perform a flip and
as such you would see that for example
the one one state would turn into a one
zero again why is it not one and zeros
the reason is that it's being executed
on a real quantum computer or on a
simulator which takes into account the
errors and so you get some errors in
your measurement now one of the things
which you can prove is that with those
gates all the gates which we mentioned
before you would be able to create any
of the standard kind of logical gate so
you would be able to create and NAND XOR
and all those kind of things which is
nice which would mean that you can do a
lot of things which could also do
whether regular computer but that's of
course not the purpose so we need some
additional gate which will allow us to
reach also some other state so we have
you noticed that you have these other
gates and we call them non cleveroad
gates because they they don't belong to
this set which corresponds to the
traditional operations and those will
allow us to rotate it in the end in the
Bloch sphere and and and it gave us also
some of the other results and allow us
to do some interesting kind of
experiments so that's the the other
gates which you will also see in the in
the in the composer now if we start to
look at some quantum algorithm so how
can you not do something with this the
the important thing to understand is
that we want to
try to make use of the that
superimposition because the
superposition sorry because that will
allow us to perform operations a lot of
operations at the same time so a first
kind of the first kind of algorithm is
this dodge yas algorithm based on the
names of the people who invented it and
it's actually not a very useful one but
it's a one which allows us to prove a
lot of the basics that will be used in
many algorithms so what is it it in fact
starts from a preposition that we have a
function of X which either return 0 or 1
so we are guaranteed that the outcome
will always be 0 or 1 and the function
will either be a constant or balanced
meaning that either it will return
always 0 or always 1 so a constant
outcome or it will return 0 for half of
the values X and 1 for the other house
and so we know that if and where where X
is rip is representing an n-bit kind of
string now if we if we execute if we
want try to evaluate that then a
traditional way what would we need to do
we would need to evaluate the the
function f for all those for a number of
values and actually we would need to do
it just for 1/2 plus 1 of the D value so
it depending of course on the size of
the of your height it would take more
and more evaluations now what can we do
and and then this is allowing us to
explain the basis of this of many of the
quantum algorithms in fact the money of
the quantum algorithms we will use a
so-called Oracle this Oracle will be
represented here by a mathematical
raishin on our qubit which actually will
have as an outcome minus one to the
power to the power
FX times ax and this will be the basis
for many of the the algorithms this kind
of oracle circuits and we will
immediately see that we can easily
implement those using some of the of the
gates now what will we do to execute
this in a much quicker way using a
quantum computer so remember the qubits
are initialized in the zero State
we will applica apply an atom or gate to
each qubit which will bring them in this
superimposed state and then we will
apply this Oracle circuit now this is
basically kind of applying the function
to all the values of x in one and one
shot because we are applying it to those
qubits which are ended that superimposed
kind of state and so the superimposed
state is represented by this
mathematical formula so when you do the
superimposition with noted that there is
all these the probabilities of each of
the states are equal and then actually
if we apply the Oracle circuit we will
get this kind of value now we will what
you will note is if we if the FX is a
constant value for example 0 then it
would sum up just all the vectors if the
F acts would be balanced so it would be
it would be 0 or 1 for a half of the
values then you would note that those
things are going to cancel each other
out so if we go then in fact we can
represent those
the Oracle in the case of the of the
balanced function with this construction
and in the case of the the in the other
case constant we note for example if we
assume that the constant will be zero
that it will just map acts on X so if we
don't do anything we basically have a
constant function for Oracle and if we
look at the result so what you will see
is that if you execute this quantum
circuit on in the first case you will
get those different values if we execute
it in the second case where the constant
function it will basically return a 100%
probability on the 0 0 0 value in the
case of three qubits in this case so
allowing us to with one execution of
such a quantum circuit to immediately
distinguish between those two things and
so that's illustrating a basic kind of
principle now of course that is not a
very useful algorithm because it allows
us only to make the difference between a
function which would be balanced or non
balanced but very similar you can and
and this algorithm is called Grover's
algorithm again based on the name of the
person who devised it and basically that
would be one of the search algorithms in
quantum computing so if we assume we
have like and possible outcomes and only
one is the one which we are searching
for in fact if you would just do a
traditional search where you start to
look at each of the values you would on
average have like an over two
evaluations to figure out which is this
rat kind of value which we want to have
and it would in the worst case you would
need an executions now we can show that
with a quantum computing again using the
similar Oracle as well as before we
would be able to perform the same in
square root of n times execution so a
quadratic kind of improvement in this
and giving the fact that if we would be
able to apply this before a large volume
of qubits this could mean really some
good improvements and search functions
which of course we all have to do in in
big data cases and all those kind of
things now again it's using the Oracle
function the same one as we we were
before but in this case we will have a
function of X which will be zero for
each of those and which will be one for
this one now if we evaluate the Oracle
with that function we will note that it
performs a flip of this one value in the
case of BAM we are at that value it will
flip around and actually you can
represent this in a graphical way so if
we look at the grover algorithm you
would be able to represent the factor
representing the final outcome as here
this would be the original superimposed
state which we can obtain by applying an
atom or gate on each of the qubits
where actually each of the possible
values would have an equal chance so
here is the example of two two qubits
so which allows us to represent four
possible values and it would be an equal
outcome as long as we didn't execute
anything
now if what would happen if we apply the
the Oracle on it it would basically flip
around this work for this one value
which is of course allowing us to make
some distinction and then we can apply
actually an additional transformation
which would turn around they would do a
face flip and actually the end result
would be that we increase the
probability of finding the value the
correct value and lower the
probabilities on the others and the
mathematics allow us to prove that this
if you perform this square n times you
would be able to have one probability
for the value you were searching for and
now here is an example of how you could
implement that algorithm so you can find
them back on the end end in the guide in
fact if we execute that and I will
quickly do it because the time is
running out
so actually this is executing the Grover
algorithm for a two qubit computer so
allowing us to to to show to distinguish
four different kind of states and
actually in this case the implementation
of the Oracle so we first have to be
Adam Adam or gates then we have the the
Oracle this Oracle will basically be the
one for filtering out this this one zero
one function to it the function would
flip at that value and we see that even
with one execution in the case of the
two qubits and only four values we get
already 0.8% or and sorry 0.8
probability on on the zero one which is
the value which we are searching for so
unfortunately the time has run out so a
few more few more things before I let
you go so there is also a few things in
my presentation on the what's happening
with the error correction without those
times in fact what is happening it's
basically when you put the qubit in the
one state this time is showing you how
long it takes before it will start to
decay to zero so you see this is very
small amount of time and the t2 time
which we see here is the defacing so if
you perform a phase rope rotation that
will go away after this kind of times
now the important thing is that this is
a factor which we have been improving
over time so this is where we were like
nineteen ninety nine and this is where
we are now with the the current
implementation which starts to make
it make it really usable so that was in
fact the overview of course there is
lots and lots of more that can be told
about that there is lots and lots of
more experiment algorithms that you can
evaluate and that's why I've included
all this reference reference information
so there is the link towards the quantum
experience itself there is an example
where a university university of
barcelona used this five cubed computer
to perform some to perform some
experiments for a doctoral - research
paper and then there is a number of
books which I find really very inspiring
so there is these which are specifically
about quantum computing and then there
is a fairly old book but they actually
written or based on the lectures of the
originator of quantum computing Richard
Fineman so that's if you want to know
more about quantum physics and all the
maths behind it etcetera and then there
is a lot of information all kinds of
links IBM videos there is a lot of
articles both IBM and non IBM which I
mentioned here so you will be able if
it's really of your interest and I hope
my talk at least gave you a little bit
of a feeling of what quantum computing
is and what you can start to do with it
will give you a lot of more information
to study more and there is also some of
our researchers which you could follow
on Twitter who post all kinds of funny
things also for example here you can see
an experiment about quantum chess where
actually also your chess pieces can be
on multiple places at the same time and
those kind of things so the restroom
also funny things but the purpose of
course is to
explain you some of those things which
are very abstract so that was what I
wanted to present as said there is still
a lot more that can be done but they
will still be around on the conference
and you have all the reference
information to find more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
