hi maybe I'll start again oh we can have
humor in there yeah so you're talking
about using a saga to maintain data
consistency across the microservices I
am yes I'm saying that a bit like it was
a test it's quite a long title I was
trying to you want to see the file name
actually it's it's really it's
ridiculously long so micro versus and
data consistency assuming people are
talking about a lot this year actually
data and microcircuits what is saga oh
yeah so I mean sort of the fundamental
idea with the micro service
architectures is decomposition
functional decomposition so breaking
what would otherwise be a monolithic
application into a set of services so
that you know and putting it like that
makes it sound like it's just at the
code level which presents some
challenges but it turns out is only half
the story and the other part of it is
that each service has its own private
data so if I am the order service I no
one can touch my data like my order
table and conversely I can't go and
access the customer table right I can
only go through services can only
communicate through API so sometimes
there are transactions that are going to
span multiple services so there the
example I use is when placing a new
order you want to verify that that that
new order will not exceed the customer's
credit limit and so that's a transaction
that spans multiple services and the
traditional approach to doing that would
be to use a distributed transaction
two-phase commit but there's a whole
bunch of problems with that like people
basically don't use two-phase commit in
modern
applications anymore and so the solution
is to use a saga which is a series of
local transactions so instead of a
transaction spanning the order and
customer services you just have a
transaction in the order service
transaction in the customer service and
then in this particularly use case
another local transaction in the in back
in the order service the set of sharing
data between I'm just making sure I
understand this instead of sharing data
through API is going from one microsomes
to another
they each have transactions yeah so
instead of like if I say I was the order
service you were the customer service
there would be a transit in a
traditional application what traditional
sort of way of doing consistency is a
distributed transaction that we would
both participate in yes but with sagas I
do something I send you a message you do
something and then you send me a message
back and I do something so with the
participants in a saga basically send
messages back and forth to implement the
sort of that what would otherwise be a
distributed transaction so it's the
challenge then making sure that you're
de chelly is truly separated in the way
that your code would be in a micro
service so you don't have any shared
fields but yes so so I mean sort of
backing up a level right so it saw it so
sagas solved the problem that you create
for yourself by decomposing the system
into services with their own data so I'm
the order service I've got my data with
the customer tables and also with the
order tables and so on you're the
customer service and you've got the
customer tables you know we it's like
it's very analogous to objects right
like the proper definition of an object
is that it's this thing that has
behavior and state and the state is
private to it right and so accept that
unlike objects when it comes to
databases we need data consistency yeah
and so we need some form of transaction
management mechanism and if it's within
a monolithic it's within a monolithic
single database no big deal right begin
a transaction do whatever you want
commit the transaction but in this
microservice architecture where the data
is scattered across multiple databases
and can only be accessed through api's
you have this problem and saag is aadi
solution what's the most interesting
thing you found when you were looking at
so how did you get into it yourself I
think that the just in general the saga
concept is quite is just sort of
interesting and kind of the way I got
into it was you know I started kind of
developing applications with the
microservice architecture found there
was this problem with managing data
consistency and I actually started using
an approach known as event sourcing as a
solution to maintain data consistency
and that that would be am you I'm like
my wife I'm an order object I am it an
event you're the you're a customer
object you consume an event and admit
change your state and amid events I mean
there's events or things a whole other
topic and that so using this event you
kind of having a model where services
maintain consistency by exchanging
events and the domain objects the
aggregates implemented using event
sourcing was was this really great
approach but there and then I started
I'm working of I'm writing a book on the
micro service architecture shameless
plug right the service patterns it's
available of
and so I said I was gonna write I
thought okay I'm gonna obviously I'm
gonna write about implementing business
logic in a micro service architecture
using event sourcing and I sat down to
write about it and that was when I
realized that what the approach that I
had been using was a was a particular
form of saga okay and and it was like oh
I better go right about sagas instead
and the whole idea of sagas actually
goes back to this 1987 paper called
sagas by someone cool I think it was
last name Molina so for instance like
eBay you know ecommerce site right they
they basically 10 years ago used what
you would loosely cool now a micro
service architecture and they had
functionally decomposed their system
into services they decomposed their
databases which were actually relational
databases and they could use two-phase
commit but in order to be highly
available they basically they they used
an event-driven approach to maintain
data consistency and that was that that
was that was effectively an
implementation of sagas though they did
not call it that they didn't in that in
the article I don't if they really gave
it a particular name but it's today way
this saga concept has been around for
some time so it's not you know it's not
it's really really old but you know it
stood the test of time yeah but it's
useful which is we tend these days we
you know in the software community often
focus on the new shiny thing yeah yet
some of the old there's so many
fundamental ideas from a long time ago
that are hugely valuable
make it do it makes us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
