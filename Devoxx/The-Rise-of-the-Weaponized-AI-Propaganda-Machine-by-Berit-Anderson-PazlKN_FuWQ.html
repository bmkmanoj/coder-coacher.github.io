keynotes
how was your deaf Fox up to now yeah we
had a good time
great so as I've mentioned in the
opening everything is recorded tomorrow
you will have already all the talks from
today as well so you don't have to miss
a thing and then of course at 8 o'clock
we will open the doors and have the
movie and then tomorrow it's still a
very busy day even if it's only half a
day all the rooms are often packed on
Friday so make sure you don't drink too
much beer if you want to attend some
sessions tomorrow morning cool well it's
my great pleasure to introduce our next
keynote as I mentioned in the keynote in
the opening keynote I read an article of
Barrett online I was I was blown away
and I try to reached out through
different channels and luckily you reply
it and actually work exactly the magic
of the other social web absolutely so
it's all yours thank you thank you
thanks guys you're applauding before I
even started this is going well so I'm
here today to talk about how this turned
into this so I wanted to before we get
started I want to do a quick show of
hands who in the audience considers
themselves to be an extrovert okay a
couple of you yeah we got a few in the
front here they're all in the front row
that's ironic
how about an ambivert an ambivert kind
of like a mix between the two okay got a
couple more a couple more who here
considers themselves to be an introvert
yeah a lot of hands there so like many
of you Mark Zuckerberg also considers
himself to be an introvert and in a lot
of ways that introversion has been one
of his biggest assets it's really helped
him to have the vision and determine
and singular focus to build Facebook and
who else but an introvert really could
build a software set up that allows you
to talk to someone on the other side of
the world or to track here the lives of
your friends and family without actually
being there in person or to organize an
entire community all without ever having
have a face-to-face conversation but in
a lot of ways that introversion has also
been his biggest weakness it's kept him
from anticipating the long-term social
and cultural effects of the platform
he's consistently underestimated his
responsibility and his impact on the
world and as a result there were no
protections in place to keep the world's
most powerful tool from for connecting
from being hijacked and turned into the
world's most powerful tool for
manipulation so I wasn't in I am also an
introvert I would consider myself an
introvert but I was lucky enough to grow
up attending a tech conference that my
working on tech comments my family puts
on is called future and review and it
brings together top technologists every
year in science scientists and
filmmakers and to talk about where
technology and the economy and the
political space are headed in the next
five to ten years and through going to
this conference every year I taught
myself how to be less of an introvert to
the extent that I am actually now semi
comfortable standing up here talking to
this huge roomful of people
and the other thing that I learned from
this experience was that all of these
top technology executives and the
intelligence community and the military
communities they all depend on science
fiction authors to help them understand
and foresee the future and so for that
reason about a year and a half ago I
started a different company called Scout
AI and the goal of that was to
democratize this service that top
technologists and military and
intelligence officials have been using
for years to help them understand and
anticipate what was coming and to bring
that to the broader tech community so
unfortunately right away it started
working so this is
an article that we published back in
June and it was inspired by I don't know
if anyone remembers there was this big
kind of to-do about Facebook's trending
stories category which is just like
three little bullets on the top right
corner of the Facebook newsfeed and you
know the more that we thought about that
we were like well that's stupid because
trending stories takes up this teeny
tiny little corner if someone really
wanted to manipulate you or to be biased
they would use a newsfeed like that's a
big central feed that takes up every the
majority of your screen space and so we
started talking to we developed some
internal sources at Facebook and at
Google and we were able to
reverse-engineer their code approval
process and what we found is that
because they have such a developer
friendly culture any two developers
working together could actually change
the news feed algorithm itself in a way
that could materially affect the outcome
of an election without anyone else at
the company or any of the leadership
actually knowing it and at this point
Facebook had already come out publicly
and announced the study that they had
done where they were actually able to
improve voter turnout just by showing
users like I voted stickers from their
friends in their newsfeed so it was not
beyond the realm of possibility in our
minds that someone you know some
internal actor could decide that you
know to save the United States from
Trump and shift the algorithm just a
little bit so that those ins people in
swing states would be concur aside then
on the conservative side and we actually
had some science fiction to illustrate
how this might work so then the election
happened in the US and it turned out a
little differently than that
and right away I kind of started to get
really interested in this it seemed like
there was something kind of weird going
on so the first thing that kind of stuck
out to me just just right off the bat
was there was this big difference
between the historical margin of error
within exit polls
and the 2016 exit poll totals
particularly in key swing states in the
US and what that means is that like for
the last four elections before this
there was always less than 3% margin of
error between what people sue people
said they voted for when when they voted
when they registered their vote in exit
polls and how the actual vote turned out
and on top of that we already knew
because we'd been told in October before
the election that Russia had been trying
to interfere in the outcome of the
election by hacking into a bunch of
emails so we we embarked on this great
research project and the outcome of that
research project was this article which
Stefan Stefan just mentioned the rise of
the weaponized AI propaganda machine and
what we found was that there was
actually this global action
electioneering platform that was
deployed in the US election for probably
the first time ever and then like
several parties that contributed to this
and that used the platform and they had
overlapping goals so they all worked
well together and I'm going to talk you
through a few of those but there are
really three key tenets of or
technological underpinnings of this
platform so the first one is what I call
summoning the moths to the flame and
essentially this is SEO hacking to
attract and track suitable targets so
one of the first researchers that I
connected with when I started looking
into this was a guy named Jonathan
Albright and Jonathan Albright had
scraped the web and found that during
the campaign there was actually there
were actually two net news networks
going on so you see right here in the
middle of this giant cloud is all of the
the traditional news sources that you
would expect to be linked to a lot on
the web but there was also this shadow
network of outright propaganda sites
that was specifically designed to game
search engine optimization and what
would happen is that these sites could
link to each other many of them were
just like simple Wix sites or tumblers
but they were automated so that they
could link to each other within seconds
and therefore changing which sites came
up first
in search in search engine results and
also what was trending on Facebook and
on Twitter and those sites specifically
were linking back to primarily these
these red bubbles so Breitbart The Daily
Caller the Daily Mail a lot of them were
linking to RT that was a little fishy in
my mind the Russian propaganda site and
so the result is that anytime bad news
came out about Trump during the US
election they could spin a new story up
and then automatically popularize that
story just by linking it out through
this automated propaganda network so
this whole system actually served two
roles the first you know is the search
engine optimization but all of these
sites in in the network in the
propaganda network were actually also
equipped with cookies not surprising but
the cookies let them track who was
clicking on which articles and which
topics they were most interested in
which brings me to the next part of this
propaganda machine turning voters into
disinformation agents so because they
were able to track who is interested in
what they could then use those cookies
to read mark it to these voters on
Facebook using dark ads and dark ads
were interesting because unlike
traditional political advertising they
can only be seen by the people who
actually have them in their news feeds
so normally the FEC in the United States
tracks political advertising and they
make sure that you know they're saying
who paid for the ad and
I can track the content of the ad they
can make sure they're not I don't know I
mean I guess they don't really stop
people from lying but that's kind of the
idea it's like a general ethics Patrol
so but in this case that wasn't
happening and because it was on Facebook
and for the first time ever in this
election ironically enough Facebook is
its advertisers the ability to target by
a zip code and so what that meant is
that for the first time the Trump
campaign and and Russian sources as well
could actually very specifically target
swing states and key districts in swing
states that they thought were more
likely to flip one way or the other and
on top of that not only could they just
target those swing states but they could
a be test anywhere between they were
they were testing anywhere between
thirty and fifty thousand ads every day
and on top of that there was one day
like during the third presidential
debate where they tested a hundred and
seventy-five thousand versions of an ad
so the whole goal with this architecture
was to get people get voters activated
and to rope them into these bigger
communities online generally to get them
to like some kind of Facebook page or to
join a group so that they could continue
serving them content and ads and they
would then start spreading that content
or those ads themselves preferably
organically because then they don't have
to pay for it and the interesting thing
about this was so at least in the case
of Russia in the case of Russia they
would actually these groups are mostly
targeted at cultural groups or cultural
issues much less than specific political
candidates or campaigns and it's the
groups were not exactly what you would
expect so there were a lot of kind of
like raw raw red blood u.s. Patriot
groups there were a couple of like Texas
defend our borders or like no one can
take my gun away groups but there were
also groups for black lives matter
activists
groups there was a group for the LGBTQ
community and the broader strategy there
was not just to like rope people in and
feed them misinformation but actually to
start to pit these groups against each
other and so what you're seeing here on
the screen is is two different sides of
a protest being organized by a Russian
propaganda so on the one side we have
stopped the Islamization of Texas and
they're calling everyone to go to this
rally on May 21st 2016 and then on the
other side we have the save islamic
knowledge and that was also a russian ad
that was trying to rally the opposite
side of the protest and so what happened
is this they're actually well to protest
ironically you know we've got the nice
confederate flags very loving on the
other side we've got these peace on
earth signs and it was very successful
and not just mobilizing voters and kind
of like roping them into these
communities and networks but also in
hitting different cultural groups
against each other and creating more
tension and more hatred and more
frustration all throughout the United
States so I'm not I'm not trying to like
abstain us from responsibility here but
I'm just saying it you know there there
was more at play than than just what
meets the eye so the third part of this
is deploying bot armies and I first
learned about this through a researcher
named Sam Wooley who is the head of
Oxford's computational propaganda
project and Sam and his research partner
Phil Howard actually started researching
BOTS during the Arab Spring and they
were tracking BOTS because they thought
they were interesting and they thought
it was they were sorry they were
tracking Twitter usage as it was used in
revolution because I thought it was
really interesting that people were able
to use Twitter to organize and to create
these social and political movements but
they started noticing that there were
all of these other Twitter profiles
coming in and spreading fake information
and trying to actually you know send
people to the wrong places giving people
bad information about what was going on
where or
was doing what and so they started
tracking these misinformation BOTS and
what they found is that the same network
of bots that was using the arab spring
was actually deactivated and then
reactivated several years later with
different names and different profile
pictures during the brexit campaign so
then that same network of bots was
deactivated and then reactivated during
the u.s. election with american names
and american profile pictures so a lot
of these bots are automated and they
look something like this and they're
designed just to respond to keywords
right or to retweet specific candidates
tweets just to make them seem more
popular but the most effective bots are
actually operated manually and what that
means is that there are actually
contractors both independently working
independently and within governments
that their entire job is they create and
maintain networks of fake profiles on
facebook and twitter and they do this
because it's hard to actually maintain a
valuable network because they have you
know like in order to really really you
know convince Facebook and Twitter that
you're not a bot you have to maintain a
friend network you have to respond to
actual tweets you you know you need
someone to be the human behind the bots
you can engage in conversations and and
they're used for a really wide variety
of things so used to prop up candidates
as I mentioned there used to kind of
like take over hashtags of the opposite
candidate there used to attack
journalists there was a journalist in in
Finland who reported on Russia's
internet research agency which is the
building where they house all of the
people that operate their bot networks
and she was then subject to
a very long and extended like basically
attack online where all these articles
were published about her she was
constantly attacked on Twitter she was
threatened on and on and on so and then
the other things they use these bots for
is to comment on major news sites so
sites like The Washington Post or the
New York Times especially in the United
States where you know it's generally a
well-respected news source they'll then
go into stories that might be negative
like that might be negative coverage of
their candidate and they'll try to
undermine and undercut the story itself
so the whole goal is just to change the
narrative around and confuse people and
start arguments and more and more and
more of the confusion and division
strategy so both sides actually did use
BOTS in in the u.s. campaign but there
was a little bit of a discrepancy
between who uses more of them and in the
last few weeks of the u.s. presidential
campaign Trump BOTS outnumbered Hillary
BOTS 5 to 1 now we know now that that
was because Russia was also operating a
lot of Trump BOTS and most recent
estimates they keep changing it's hard
to keep track but most recent estimates
from today actually there's a new kind
of analysis of numbers that they reached
about 150 million Americans on Facebook
and about 145 million America users on
Instagram and that's I would say that's
a pretty still a pretty conservative
estimate so here's what this means
Silicon Valley really spent the last 10
years building digital addiction
machines and in 2016
Trump Russia and the alt-right hijacked
them to try to change the outcome of the
u.s. election and this isn't just it's
not just fake news they're actually like
getting these people and roping them
into these disinformation networks and
as Jonathan Albright said they're
capturing people and then keeping them
on an emotional leash and never let
go I've had a lot of friends in the
United States tell me stories about how
they don't understand why their parents
or their aunts or their uncles have
changed so much politically in the last
few years where they would have you know
they they had previously been much more
politically aligned to the left and have
swung much further right and it's just
like they don't understand where these
ideas are coming from they don't
understand why they changed so much and
that's the thing that there was an
article actually just today I think or
yesterday about this group of of this
town in Pennsylvania in the United
States many of whom voted for Trump and
the reporter went back you know like
almost a year later and interviewed them
and and asked him about you know how's
he doing has he done these things that
you thought he's gonna do did he build
the wall like you still like him even
though he didn't build the wall and they
haven't changed like nothing about his
his actual job performance has changed
their opinion so we're gonna talk a
little bit more about why that is but
it's really important to understand that
this is not just something that happened
in the past this is an ongoing
manipulation of opinions and ideas so
let's talk about who's behind this so on
the Trump side this is a guy named
Robert Mercer and Robert Mercer is was
the largest donor to Trump's campaign he
was also the biggest investor in a
company called Cambridge analytic which
was the one that was running all those a
B ads during the campaign and robbing
people into those Facebook groups for on
behalf of the Trump campaign and he's
also the biggest invest for one of the
biggest investors in Breitbart news
which is one of the main news companies
that was kind of the bullhorn for Trump
in the US
so in addition to that Mercer is a
billionaire he made his money he's an AI
savant he made his money as Renaissance
Capital pioneering the algorithmic
trading industry and he's pretty
reclusive like I don't know if that he's
ever actually given an interview to
anyone ever in his life he's actively
avoids that so the only way that we
actually know really like who he is or
what he believes it's mostly from
talking to fellow co-workers that he
used to work with at Renaissance and so
I'm just gonna share a few of the things
that that they have said about him so he
doesn't believe in climate change
he's downplayed the dangers of nuclear
war he basically doesn't think that
nuclear fallout or radiation is that
harmful and we shouldn't be worried
about it
he hates the Republican establishment
interestingly enough but even more than
the Republican establishment
he hates Hillary Clinton and he believes
that she was actually part of a drug
running scheme with the CIA and has had
many of her opponents murdered he also
the believes that black people in the US
were better off before the civil rights
movement but perhaps his most defining
belief as as defined by his co-workers
is that he believes in like teeny-tiny
government as in no government at all
whatsoever and I wanted to share this
quote with you because I think it really
illustrates I get a lot of questions
about like who is this guy and why would
he want to undermine the US government
or why would he want to undermine
democracy in the US this is why he also
one last fun facts and then and then
we'll move on he he also believes that
people are direct that the value of a
person is directly related to their
income or the amount of money they're
able to raise so he actually believes
that those who are receiving any kind of
state support or services are actually a
negative value on as humans essentially
which is a also feeds into the like
really really really small small
government
spect and so he seemed to be the
architect of this network right Bart
Cambridge analytic and you know the
Trump campaign which he kind of just
like hopped on board with because it
happened to be the campaign that was
winning he was actually supporting one
of the other candidates before but the
the reason that I think he's so
important for for everyone to understand
is because he you know he's funded a lot
of the white nationalist in the United
States Milo innopolis Steve Bannon was
his pick he brought him in to help Trump
run things and he Steve actually left
recently went back to Breitbart news and
he didn't really interesting Fox
interview recently where he said in 2018
which is the next time the u.s. is going
to elect a major round of
Representatives we're gonna these are
not his exact words but the gist of it
was we're gonna just screw over all of
the Republican candidates this the
existing Republican politicians except
for oh god I'm gonna get this wrong I
think it was Rand Paul no maybe Ted Cruz
it was Ted Cruz yeah so Ted Cruz is safe
every everyone else in the u.s. is not
safe and then what that essentially
means is that they're planning to take
this network that they use this year in
this election and to put it bring it to
to bear on this next four hand of
election so this is something that
they're building up and it gets stronger
the more data that they that they
integrate into it so the other person
that I want to talk about is Vladimir
Putin so Vladimir Putin I had you know
at first I was a little bit more
confused about like why would Russia
take this big risk of trying to
interfere in the u.s. election like what
if they got caught and there was some
kind of retaliation by the US or NATO
it just seemed it just seemed not in
necessarily in their interest but then I
started doing some research about recent
Russian history and everything started
to make a lot more sense to me so let's
flashback to 2014
now it's important to understand that
Russia is you know maybe not so much as
a country as an oil and gas company with
the standing army by which I mean that
their entire economy depends on oil and
gas it makes a 52% of federal budget
revenue that means that's a lot and the
oligarchs the rich Russians who control
everything and tell everyone what to do
most of them if not all of them are
connected in some way to Russian oil
companies and in fact when Putin stepped
down as president a few years ago he
went on and was placed in this kind of
fake presidency where someone else was
president but he was really running the
show and he was also running an oil and
gas company in Russia so there are a lot
of things mixed up for him for Putin in
in the oil and gas industry and I think
it's really important to think to think
like him really to like start try and
start to get get into that mind space of
what it's like to be that and if you're
Putin like you really don't have a lot
of options if you're not president
anymore like it you're in a pretty good
spot you can do whatever you want you
can try and you know keep trying to find
new avenues for political power
expression so in 2014 he was having kind
of a rough time
the economy in Russia was not doing very
well and people were kind of upset about
it because it wasn't very much fun for
them to live there the price of oil was
at an all-time low
and the Paris climate Accord was about
to go in effect which means that there
would have been this they were about to
experience even more transition away
from oil and gas
at the same time they just invaded
Ukraine and so Russia was experiencing
the second largest citizen protests
since the fall of the Soviet Union so
premium was in a pretty tight spot he
didn't have any money he didn't he had
all these people revolting they were
demanding democracy and he was about
things were about to get worse they were
only about to get worse and that was the
point at which the United States decided
to impose sanctions against Russia and
so those sanctions actually were in
retaliation for their invasion of
Ukraine but what they did was they
blocked a five hundred billion dollar
oil deal in the Arctic sea between
ExxonMobil and Rosneft one of the
biggest oil and gas companies in Russia
now five hundred billion dollars that's
that's a lot of money and in fact this
was if it had gone through this would
have been the biggest business deal as
far as I know in the history of the
world like the biggest business deal
ever so when you're out of money and
everyone's revolting and suddenly like
the biggest business deal in the world
gets blocked you're not gonna be really
in a great mood and at that point Putin
um you know got kind of kind of as far
as I can tell I wouldn't say went
underground but he kind of retreated a
little bit with some of his top guys and
they tried to figure out what to do and
a couple months later probably bout five
or six months later they came back out
and did three major interviews with the
media in Russia and the surround and
surrounding area and those three
interviews laid out their new approach
to foreign policy with regard to the
United States which was essentially as
they explained it a new Cold War
so at that point the Russia had already
been testing information warfare broadly
all across the former Soviet states say
they'd done that in Ukraine quite
extensively in Lithuania and Latvia and
Poland
and so they kind of knew what they were
doing and this is the point at which I
believe they transitioned that energy
and they said okay we need to do
something to undermine the legitimacy of
democracy in the Western world's NATO
was the closest thing the most
threatening body that that they had on a
you know on a regular basis that they
were interacting with and that actually
NATO had had when it was founded it
originally agreed that it wouldn't go
closer than I think it was further east
than a certain than a certain space and
they had actually already gone past that
so Putin was feeling pretty cornered and
he didn't really know what to do
but he did have this really epic
information warfare capability that he'd
been building up over the last couple of
years and he also had this really epic
cyber warfare capability which he'd been
building up over the last couple of
years and that's the point at which
Russia unleashed this whole surge of
weaponry not just on the United States
but also across Europe so we're not
going to talk about the cyber war part
of it today I'm happy to talk with you
guys later about that if you'd like but
I want to make sure that we understand
that this whole information network and
this whole information warfare problem
that we're dealing with it's not just
about fake news it's a hybrid
human-machine political botnet and it
has extremely global ambitions so this
is a map of the world and this
represents kind of like right after the
election right so you see you got
Breitbart has an office in LA and Texas
although it's kind of off the side
Cambridge analytic has an office in New
York right Bart and Cambridge both have
offices in London because fun fact they
both were involved in brexit Breitbart
has an office in Jerusalem and then
Russia has a couple of different
information propaganda and information
warfare and propaganda campaigns taking
place across the Soviet the Soviet bloc
so the first thing that that happened
right after the election Breitbart
opened offices in France and
with a goal of manipulating and changing
the outcome of those two elections and
then Cambridge analytic expanded their
reach quite a bit they're now running
Trump's reelection campaign in the
United States and already using these
seemed same techniques to keep his his
base kind of in line and and faithful to
him they also opened offices in India
they they were involved in the Kenyan
election which was just overturned
because there were five million
illegitimate votes and there they're
considering working in Australia I think
they might at this point may have been
shut out of that but that was one of the
things they wanted to do and then
they're also deploying broadly across
South America because there were very
few unlike here in Europe there very few
data personal data protections there so
no one's really paying attention to what
they're doing or with whom and it's
unlikely that you know as happened in
the United States people would get upset
if they found out what's going on and
try and you know move things along or
return things to the way they were so
and then Russia actually was also
involved in Germany and and in the
French election they've successfully
hacked into McCrone gmail McCrone did
this really smart thing where he created
a honeypot so he made all these fake
emails ahead of time because he knew
that would probably happen
he had this far alright opponent and so
when they found all the emails he was
then able to say like you don't know
which of those are real or which other
are not real and France did something
pretty interesting at least from the
perspective of an American city a US
citizen which is they actually banned
any media company from reporting on any
of the emails and they said if anyone
posts these emails were going to arrest
you so this is this is a widespread
issue and we publish this article about
this in February when we did BuzzFeed at
the time it was still pretty early on
this a lot of this has now been kind of
reported on and it's a lot more well
understood but BuzzFeed immediately
wrote two articles calling us conspiracy
theorists citing Republican operatives
which we took as a sign that we were on
the right track
luckily Pierre came came to our defense
and said something that is absolutely
true and so one of the things that's
important to remember about all of this
is that this stuff sounds scary and
they're like many global ambitions of
these that these humans have who are
behind this campaign but there's
actually nothing illegal about it it's
really mostly just marketing applied to
politics for the first time and so
that's part of the reason that in the
United States it's been so hard to
respond right where we've been having
all these hearings with with platform
companies and trying to figure out you
know lawmakers are frustrated because
they feel like the platform companies
aren't responding in US platform
companies in Silicon Valley community is
frustrated because they feel like
they're bad ideas coming through from
lawmakers but as a result of this
article a lot of things started to
happen so I was invited to go to the
Brussels forum to debate the Prime
Minister former prime minister of Sweden
about whether or not the Internet is a
force for democracy my co-founder was
invited to briefs the Senate
Intelligence Committee in the United
States the article has been read more
than a million times now it was cited by
the New York Times UNHCR the World Bank
Forbes and a lot of others and we know
it was personally circulated at Google
by Eric Schmidt and it was also cited by
Tim berners-lee as one of the three
biggest challenges facing the Internet
in his article about this on its on the
28th anniversary so I bring all this up
not not to brag although I am proud of
all of the impact that this that one
article has had but I bring it up
because the more that we talk to these
people and the more that we were you
know connecting with high-level
political analysts and political
strategists and top technologists the
clearer it became to us that there were
a lot of really small fragmented
technological responses
but there really wasn't anything that
was gonna be able to compete with this
global network and in a sense like a lot
of these kind of like fact-checking BOTS
and and systems it's really like we're
bringing a knife to a space laser fight
and that's not gonna work so as a result
we've actually decided that we have
begun building a comprehensive strategic
response out of scout to protect
democracy in the age of computational
propaganda and I'm happy to talk more
with all of you about what that means in
person but we've been working on it now
for several months and the most
important thing to know about all of
this is that we here right now it's easy
for us all to kind of like go about our
daily lives and just pretend like
everything's gonna be fine and
Facebook's gonna create some changes
that mean that this isn't really a
problem anymore and you know maybe they
will be able to fix some of the
political advertising problems but how
do you control information that isn't
fake right because a lot of this isn't
fake
some of it is just true facts applied to
manipulate huge swathes of people and
this is only to get more complicated as
we move into fields like artificial
intelligence as that adapts and gets
better I mean even since the last
election we can now make AI generated
videos that just spin themselves up out
of nothing right
we can now fake a person's appearance on
video in a way that you can't actually
tell whether you're looking at that
person saying something or if you're
looking at a simulation of that person
saying this thing and so this raises a
lot of questions about truth and
freewill and what it means to make
choices in a free society when you know
that all of the information that you're
getting
could be really just an extension of
someone trying to create a broader
political change we at this moment are
living through an unprecedented
cyberattack on Western democracy free
will and cultural cohesion and solving
this problem is going to require elite
machine learning automated marketing and
cybersecurity talent to work with
political strategists in ways that the
technology community and the civics
community and policy community have
never done before right because we
really fundamentally speak different
languages from one another so I want to
just finish this up by saying that the
reason that I came here today the reason
I flew I live in Seattle the reason that
I flew all the way across you know
halfway across the world in addition to
Stephane being a really wonderful you
know an invitation giver is that the
world really needs you guys right now
and I say that not just not just because
you know you're here now in front of me
but this specific community of
technologists and developers and the
extended devoxx community as well we
need you guys to dive in and get your
hands dirty and to figure out what to do
about this to help us figure out what to
do about this and the cool thing about
doing this I've been doing it for a
while it's actually really fun in the
process you'll be exposed to the most
important developments in technology and
psychology both new insights and
economic opportunities it's a huge
problem and hopefully who knows maybe
you'll even be able to get over some of
that social anxiety along the way thank
you
okay thank you very much Barrett so if
you still have a few questions or
whatever you can always come down here
we can still open up the floor a bit but
now in 15 minutes the the movie will
start so just gently go out of the room
if you want to see the movie get some
popcorn as well while doing so keep in
mind the movie is 2 hours and 43 minutes
so it's a long movie and otherwise we'll
see each other tomorrow morning for the
next sessions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
