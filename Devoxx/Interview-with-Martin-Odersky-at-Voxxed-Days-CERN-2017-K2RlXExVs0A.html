you're talking about scarlet and in
particular dot and dusty so Duffy is a
next-generation compiler scholar that
right that's right yeah so that is a
compiler we've been working on for
almost four years now and it started as
essentially an experiment what can we do
better in compiler design and
essentially new ways to modeling types
in the language and now it's sort of on
the final stretch to get out the release
and really have developers use it in
anger yeah so it's your time scale so
really we want to come out this spring
so we have two scholar days one in
Chicago in April and one in June and
Copenhagen and it's not quite clear yet
with Scala days it will be hopefully
would be one of them pretty and I say if
you face something called dust isn't it
like a fundamental principle that trims
down some of the it's going down to like
the basic mathematical it right so
that's sort of the theory you could say
the theory behind it that you say well
when we want to study properties of
programming languages you have to
simplify simplify simplify and Scala is
a fairly particular programming language
in that it is really tries to carve out
a different way that is neither full
object-oriented no functional or Rabbis
is both so it's essentially both
object-oriented and functional and
doesn't exclude either side and that it
turns out to do a good job in actually
understanding what it is we need new
foundations and that's what's that that
is supposed to be oh and dr. Duffy is
built around dot then what are some of
the what are some of the features that
you want in Goffe that you hope to
improve on from previous Scala compilers
right so first it was it's actually and
they try to simplify to essentially have
a smaller
or and the compilers on the core of the
compiler type checker and essentially
there is where typically you get often
combinatorial explosion of complexity
once you get a new feature and
everything becomes try to talk so you
want to minimize really radically and
period sus there because it tells us
what we can model in terms of what other
features so that was that was a big big
step
the other thing is that theory also
helped us with laws so for instance in
Scala we have the so-called compound
type that's a with B where impr types
and it turns out that with is actually
not but we would like it to be
commutative so that a with B is the same
as B with a but because in current Scala
which really is also reused for
inheritance where we have a concept
called linearization so there automatic
and that caused us to come up with this
bit operator that wasn't commutative so
now the theory told us that well there's
actually another way to do it and that's
we will follow that and in in dotty we
will replace the written types by an
ampersand which is meant to be true to
intersection and there will be a union
type operator which is written by a bar
to complement it that's then the dual of
the intersection cityscene a scholar
language itself evolving as duffy along
yeah yeah looks like so so that sort of
the blueprint for Scala 3 and it will be
some years until we get there so there
will be for awhile parallel releases the
Scala two week series will continue and
that would be a dirty release years and
at some point
dottie will essentially take over and
become scarlet we know that sort of
thing the map that we currently have in
our heads and we'll see where that comes
true
