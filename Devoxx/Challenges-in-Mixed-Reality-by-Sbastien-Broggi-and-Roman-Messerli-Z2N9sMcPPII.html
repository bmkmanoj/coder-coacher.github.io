my name is Roman messily and this is my
colleague sebastian grouchy we both work
at the IT department of swiss post one
year ago the post started a
proof-of-concept sorry
and with the hololens and our team was
asked for people who were interested in
developing an application for the
hololens the two of us were the lucky
ones that got selected this talk will be
about challenges we faced during the
development of our first mixed reality
application so people always ask us the
same question this is why we brought
those questions here with us today if
there is anything we do not cover feel
free to pass by our booth later and ask
those questions so what is mixed reality
exactly mixed reality is a term used by
Microsoft to describe their lineup of
devices in augmented and virtual reality
who has already tried to hololens hands
up yeah nice great
so those of you who have already tried
it probably know the feeling of other
people looking at you laughing taking
pictures yeah while you interact with
things that they don't see so if you
never had the opportunity or if you want
to become a star you can try the
hololens at our booth so to get started
some facts about the hololens the
hololens in short is a pc running on
Windows 10 that you can put on your head
as usual in Windows 10 you have a store
where you can find already several
hundred applications specifically
written for the hololens isn't it quite
heavy the hololens weighs around 580
grams which is actually pretty light for
a computer but Microsoft also points out
that this is a task oriented device and
not thought for longer shifts it is also
important to adjust the device to your
head and calibrate the eye distance so
you get a good experience what is your
experience how long can you wear the
hololens well one or two hours is
absolutely no problem in our tests
people actually forgot about the weight
after a while what about glasses and
people who see only with one on well as
you can see I am wearing glasses and
that's absolutely no problem in our
office we also have one guy who only
sees with one eye and when I asked him
whether he can see the Holograms he just
answered of course I'm blind
so what components are built in the
hololens well a lot of sensors at first
there is an inertial measurement unit
which basically tracks the orientation
of the device furthermore there are for
environment understanding cameras and
one depth camera those sensors are
important so that the holograms stay in
one place and don't jump around
furthermore there's four microphones and
one ambient light sensor so it's
basically connected combined with a
Windows Phone well not really the
display really makes the difference with
the whole lens you can see Holograms in
the real world and you even get 3d
sounds
hmm there is only a 32-bit processor and
to kick up bite of RAM what come can the
hololens handle usually you don't want
to overload the display like in the
famous hype reality video from ket
Matsuda it is one of the big challenges
here to find a good balance between
simplicity and aesthetics so what's so
great about the hololens well you get a
whole PC that fits on your head while
your hands are free to interact with
objects in the real world I think
Microsoft really found a good balance
between performance weight and
functionality here about performance how
long does the battery last that heavily
depends on the usage constantly using
the death sensing cameras we'll use up
your battery fast the developer has to
decide when it makes sense to use which
functions and when to leave them out so
that's the hardware but what about the
software how do you develop applications
for the hololens well to develop mixed
reality applications we use Visual
Studio in combination with unity we use
c-sharp scripts to then add additional
functions so who has already developed
an application with unity nobody okay
okay some few okay so for those who do
not know unity unity is actually a game
engine used by many state-of-the-art
games and applications other VR and they
are devices also use unity for
development game engine do you play
around all day of course we do no
seriously there is also the possibility
to develop applications using DirectX
but unity or
for a lot of great tools for that you
can also easily deploy your applications
on different platforms using unity mixed
reality is rather new how is to support
from Microsoft and are there any
libraries that support development of
mixed reality applications
well Microsoft officially supports unity
with their mixed reality toolkit for all
of their devices in addition there are
also some third-party libraries like
beforeö which make developing mixed
reality applications straightforward so
what kind of applications do you develop
for the Swiss post-games No
obviously we normally develop
applications but with the little effort
we also created the game side version of
our it first use case which you can try
at our booth can you tell us more about
to use case of course our first use case
for the hololens is a virtual overlay
for a sorting rack to support the
sorting of letters and parcels like the
one displayed here in the image there
are currently hundreds of these racks
distributed in post offices all over
switzerland why do the employees have to
sort the letters by hand
do they not search the letters in big
centers with big machines
of course big machines sort most of the
letters but there will always be some
cases which cannot be sorted
automatically this is when the employees
have to sort those manually there are
labels on the racks with street names
and house numbers what happens if a
dress is changed and new houses pop up
well that's exactly the problem with the
current system these racks are labeled
with paper labels and use
and are used to sort mail for specific
locations if there are any changes the
employees have to have to change those
labels manually why don't you try to add
small electronical displays to the Rex
well this was actually tested at first
but with all those displays there comes
a lot of cables and batteries there for
an installation and maintenance of all
those displays really is a pain in
addition the solution is also not very
cheap as previously said there are more
than 100 boxes in one of those rack and
there are hundreds of those racks all
over Switzerland so you can do the math
yourself so what is the advantage of
using hololens to sort letters well the
big advantage is that you do not have to
change anything manually on the racks
you create a configuration once and then
just change the addresses you said the
solution with the electronic displays is
rather expensive what about the price
for the hololens well a commercial
version is around the 6000 Swiss francs
this does not sound very cheap but
compared to the electronic displays you
only need one in addition you can also
use the hololens for different cases can
you show us some pictures of the
application of course here you see a
picture of the first prototype which was
developed within a week well nice colors
but you cannot see what is behind the
hologram people could hurt themselves
when they try to take out the letter
when they do not see what is behind the
hologram absolutely there are many
things to consider the whole topic of
mixed reality is pretty new and user
experience is very important this is why
we spent a lot of time improving UI
you X since then so what did you change
to the application firstly we use frames
instead of those big colored areas the
user should be able to find the
irrelevant information easily and the
Holograms should not hide any important
real-world information we only display
the information needed at the time it's
needed for example when sorting letters
we display the address when taking out
the letters we display the information
about the number of mailboxes how did
the users react to the information
displayed and a head-up display well the
range of reaction was pretty big from
wait there's a head-up display - yeah it
really helped a lot looks nice but what
if it even be better if you would
recognize the address on the letter and
then highlight the right books
automatically absolutely that would be
an awesome feature but sadly the
resolution of the camera is not good
enough the processor is also not very
fast and for such cases you need an
immediate response in the end our
employees are faster in just reading
themselves what about barcodes barkos
should be easier to scan yeah in another
project we also try to read barcodes
with the camera but the result sadly
still were pretty bad this is why we
added a ring scanner by a bluetooth a
ring scanner so your hands are no longer
free that's right but the scanner does
not really influence the process as you
can still grab things with it the
solution also saves time rather than
putting things 10 centimeters in front
of your head constantly well now we
talked about the output how do you
interact with your application
when we started one year ago we try to
track the position of the hands to try
to add identify interactions with Dirac
unfortunately the reliability there was
a big issue so we abandoned the idea
what about voice input we actually did
implement voice input but just imagine
five or more people in the noisy room
trying to tell their hololens to move on
to the next box constantly screaming
next I think we can rule that option out
so what solution did you find well in
the end together with the users we found
a nice way to navigate simply through
head tracking Microsoft Costas input
also gaze as you can see the color of
the frame changes from blue to yellow
when the user gazes at a box and after a
fixed time the green frame locks on the
box and the selection moves on to the
next one the reliability is important to
not lose time whilst holding letters the
employee is faster with the hololens the
difference between trained people with
and without a hololens really is in
second significant however there are
other aspects what aspects are you
talking well we can save a lot of time
since we can change those labels very
easily we can also save space because
the racks can be reused another great
advantage is that people with no
previous knowledge are pretty much as
fast as trained people you can use the
taller lens to train new people with
that in your tests the acceptance of the
hollowness was good what about the
stability of the
platform consisting of device and
software well during life tests user
reported repeatedly that the application
crashed after the restart of the
application they could make it work
again but it took a bit of time sounds
like a serious problem well not really
the platform actually really is stable
the problem was that the hololens
recognized the movement of the hand when
they sorted in the letter as the bloom
gesture and minimize the application
what is the bloom gesture you can
imagine it like the windows button of
the hololens it minimizes applications
and open UPS the Start menu so could you
change the gesture unfortunately it's
not really possible to change the
gesture at the moment it's deeply
embedded in the system I read that the
entire on the this gesture seems to be
rather rude well so how did you solve
the problem well the current solution is
to put the hololens in a kiosk mode to
disable this gesture but in the long
term we need a different approach it is
important to work together with everyone
to find a good and balanced solution
here most of the time you develop
applications for personal computers what
is the big difference in developing
applications for the hololens well there
is literally a new dimension to work
with the application we usually develop
for our users are only two-dimensional
well I guess its advantages if you are
not bad at mathematics
exactly finally you can use that vector
geometry you learned at school
unity helps a lot with that but you have
to be careful too
with local coordinates and world
coordinates
so this is when you sit on your
workplace and and ask yourself where is
my hologram or why is my hologram so
small
exactly placing objects in unity is
pretty simple as soon as you start
dynamic to dynamically add objects to
the scene and move them around it gets
more complicated some operations are
easier to do in local coordinates some
operations are easier in world
coordinates so how long did it take you
to get a customer to unity and the third
dimension well I like mathematics and
vector geometry so I adapted it rather
fast okay so you develop your
application and deploy it on the
hololens and that's it well not really
but once you know where the challenges
are it gets easier so what is the
biggest challenge when deploying the
application performance the application
can run perfectly in unity on the
computer but on the hololens
you may have a terrible performance the
framerate is really important to keep
the holograms stable so you want to keep
it high to achieve a good performance it
is important to select the right
materials and limit the polygons used
well unfortunately we are running out of
time last question do the employees
already use the application today well
the whole thing is a proof of concept
right now but the interest in the whole
lens is constantly growing and we hope
to bring it to productive use very soon
well there are still a lot of questions
for instance to integrate the device in
our network we built a team of
developers engineers architects and
people from security YUM so if you still
have questions
just come by visit us at our booth and
you can also play a game and win an
oculus rift so thank you very much thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
