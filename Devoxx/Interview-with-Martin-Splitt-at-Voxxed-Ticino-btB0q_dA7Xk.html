creative all right we're here
questionnaire I'm talking to Martin yes
do you go by any other name no I think
that's pretty much it the unicorn for
obvious reasons maybe sometimes I
thought you might have a name you say
well I'm okay fair enough I have an ADA
on twitter i'm keiko not so you might
have heard me on geek or not rather than
mine
okay you see I J I don't know why I
thought you would have named yourself I
really I don't know the geek on art
thing is basically like because I'm
floating between different communities
and different technologies and I keep
doing pretty much everything a bit so
I'm like astronaut because this is a
vast space of Technology that I'm and
navigating this is like ECD Sasha's a
game developer but you're talking about
web components so how did you get from
one to the other right so first things
first I have to clarify that I was never
a professional game developer I did it
all the time because I had a really
boring computer graphics lecture and
universities that happens to build games
because that teaches you all the things
about real-time 3d graphics and and I
was interesting but there's a huge
problem with that which is you go to
game 4 for instance a game console or a
computer but then only certain people
can play it a not everyone in life like
everyone in my social circle is a gamer
so they are not interested in games and
if they are not having a Windows PC then
my stuff didn't work anymore and
generally I just like the web because it
allows everyone to build their own thing
and share content and share their
knowledge and that's like super
interesting and then I think it's an
important thing to do for us as a
society
even though web today is also used to
actually share a lot of file and and
hatred and stuff and that's not so good
terrible actually I make it truly
democratic it is yeah it is democratic
but it tells or shows us that we have
fundamental democratic issue of social
societal issues that we have to actually
address but we're digressing so I went
into weapon like how does the web work
and I started building websites and then
what
so many hybrid apps which were things
before we had actual like proper react
native or something like that I did a
bit of embedded programming for
renewable energy we serve research where
that what's interesting as well if I do
a bit of everything kinda and then so
web components why are they important to
you so web components to me are
important because I think so the web
gives us a really nice platform even
though a lot of people will disagree
about the platform's like super
resilient and hTML is why it is so
resilient and because if there's
something that the browser doesn't
understand it just skips it or just
dumps the text instead of just crashing
I mean it is if you have an iPhone app
that is not compatible with the iPhone
version somehow it doesn't even install
anymore right if you have a Windows
application on it like a Windows 95
application that we try to run on XP or
7 or 10 Windows 10 it crashes and you're
like what the hell doesn't happen if I
open the first website that Elmo's ever
created it's still displaced it looks
terrible it's lack text with blue links
on white ground still I can use it I can
click the link it takes me somewhere I
can read everything that there was like
all the knowledge that was stored there
I can still retrieve and work with but
we have evolved we are now building
applications so the web has evolved from
a document platform and the document
sharing platform into an application
platform however because making this
resilient and large it's like we have
lots of browsers we have lots of
environments that we have to work in
accessibility is a big concern how about
people who can't use the web without
assistive technology it starts with like
zooming a page lots of mobile pages do
not allow to you to zoom if you do that
I'll hunt you down and yeah so the web
has not ego although the back platform
has not evolved to give us tools for
this kind of stuff and that's why a lot
of developers have switched to
proprietary platforms such as iOS or
Windows Phone or Android because they
give them the components and the bits
and pieces to actually build
applications because they have been
started as an application platform we
have now another platform the web has
evolved into
an application platform and at some
point the browser's went or the
standards body the w3c behind it well
you know what we should give people the
low-level primitives the low-level
measures to actually build new things on
the platform because we can't evolve as
quickly as the market does and you can
see that we have things like toggle
buttons there's no such thing as a
toggle button in HTML itself right you
can't have that like this little toggle
it doesn't exist tabs popovers dialogues
we are rendering all that kind of stuff
all that is missing really and so we now
have decided that we have to have
primitives that allow basic building
blocks to allow developers to build
these components developers have done
that I mean jQuery UI is the thing don't
know toolkit is the thing mo mu tools is
the thing they allows you to have take
components based on JavaScript and it
was really happy because it has to work
around all the things that the platform
doesn't do now the platform gives us a
way to do this in a cleaner faster nicer
way that's what web components are like
this is what we need if we want to
secrete as an application platform on
the web we have to have components and
we have we have developers that want to
build components but we can't so we
should really let developers build the
platform forward and then when we see
certain patterns arise if we figure out
that the hamburger the dreaded hamburger
menu is the thing that everyone uses all
the time after five years we could
potentially try to get it into the
browser directly so we don't have to
build our own components but for now we
have to build our own components to
figure out how this all works yeah so
web components enable that and I think
that's very powerful cool and how do you
build an accessory mentioned
accessibility how do you build an
accessibility cheer well that's a really
good question and a tricky one actually
it's not that tricky um so basically the
thing is with with components the
biggest problem with components how we
did it two years ago or three years ago
or five years ago or even today
sometimes with new tools and jQuery UI
was or bootstrap trailer brutes are
super popular every template every site
template that you can download for your
blog
that and what they do is they have this
class button problem with that is that
the browser sees this and goes this is a
block of text but there's JavaScript on
top of it that somehow kind of makes it
look and behave like a button but it's
not a button and then there's the button
element and that is a button so it tells
the browser hi I'm a button I can be
toggled and triggered and when I as a
developer think of a button oh yeah sure
I click on it and then it does something
yeah but that's not the full truth right
because if I'm a screen reader user I
use space or return to press the button
yeah I want to tab over things and I
can't tab over over buttons that are not
pretending to be buttons and then or
just pretending to be buttons rather
than actually being buttons so buttons
behave in a certain expectable and and
dependable way that this don't and
that's because they're for two different
purposes
so with web components if you are
careful enough you're extending really
existing things that the platform
already has so if I have a toggle button
I would use a button so Internet
Explorer 6 will display a button but if
I'm on a modern browser or browser that
the polyfill works and so ie 10 upwards
for instance I would then not see the
button I would see a toggle thing that I
can toggle and that looks nice and it
does all the things and mmmm but if I'm
on a screen reader I still see the
button and it would I would go like with
my screen reader I go to the text
analysis button activates night mode
disabled and then you press return or
press space and it goes button enable
night mode enabled and that's accessible
and that people can use and work with us
and that's how you do it cool you can
write components that are inaccessible
sure but now you have a chance to not
but then do that and it's easier might
it be in a continent the unicorn comes
in two years ago I think in Montreal I
met a brilliant person who's also
speaker here and I think she's gonna be
on interview as well hi Mariana how's it
going and and she's my 1c consultant now
and she proposed to get me a onesie and
I'm like I want a unicorn ones because
they look so fluffy and nice and
eh turkey I don't know you that well but
I feel like I said yeah you can also
just like you know okay it seems off
yeah I did okay I hold myself back
yeah it's fine no actually I had I had a
colleague of mine at work and she went
when she saw me in the ones in the
office one day she goes can I touch your
horn and I'm like sure go ahead touch
touch it and then I Vern and it's like
why so fluffy and it's so nice and I'm
like I know right and yeah my onesie
compartment I can highly recommend her
and and I'm like you get me one is just
like yes but you have to do a talk and
I'm like all right I thing happened I
see I like it okay and then obviously
people here because Twitter is global
everyone here when like why you're not
in the onesie why don't you do this here
and I'm like I can I guess and last year
Zurich I think it was last year yes the
world last year I did it and I came in
the one but I wasn't a speaker I was
part of the program committee for Vox
taser at high Vox a Zurich and everyone
loved it and it's like wow this is
amazing and then when I was invited to
speak here in Ticino I'm like why not
yeah I think I mean you're very
recognizable definitely does an
icebreaker but thank you very much thank
you very much yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
