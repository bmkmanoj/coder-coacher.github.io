closing keynote speaker Stefan Ching I
mean Stefan is part of the Deaf Fox
program committee as well I mean he's
our bridge also towards a lot of Oracle
engineers but you know he has a lot of
other people that he knows with via the
night hacking and so on so Stefan it's
all yours thank you Stefan so before I
start the presentation I just wanted to
say how much it an honor it is to speak
here to you guys I think I've been
coming to the DevOps conference for the
past seven years started out just as a
little you know scrub trying to do my
little presentations and prepare them
the night before started helping out the
program committee helping behind the
scenes here and this is really one of
the b-best community conference in the
world so big hand to the program
committee in these guys they do an
awesome job
and what I want to talk to you guys a
little about today is the past 20 years
of Java so in the year nineteen
ninety-five what what were you guys
doing in the year 95 all right so it's
kind of a rhetorical question I don't
expect everyone to to answer but here
are some of the things which were
happening in the year nineteen
ninety-five just just a kind of ground
things so this was the first the year
the first Bionic I was implanted so this
was kind of the bleeding edge research
at the time World Records for a number
of people said in space although we
apparently given up and then we just
stick robots in space no financial
markets reaching record highs so it was
clearly boom year handheld gaming
devices burst forth actually I have a
I've a little handheld gaming device
here this actually is an empty shell of
a handheld gaming device that we were
printing and somebody else is going to
walk away because I don't I don't have
room in my luggage for this so somebody
else in the room here will walk away
with that one DVD optical discs were
announced and internet usage grew so
this was clearly a groundbreaking year
for lots of things including the
introduction of Java but if you look at
it we've had quite a history of
different Java releases so help me out
in the in the room here I know if you're
in the overflow rooms this isn't quite
as easy so we're going to play the what
was the earliest version of Java let you
use everyone stand up for a sec in place
so just stand up at your chairs
alright so this is stretching before the
movies this is so you don't fall asleep
during the the James Bond flick this
evening so who who here if if your first
java programming version was 16 you can
you can sit down now okay so you we have
we have a lot of we have a lot of people
have been around for a while how about
15 if your first version was 15 sit down
okay a few more 14 all right so how
about 113 now that was all the Emmy
developers who just sat down who were
stuck on 14 for generations how about
120 all right okay so for the audience
we have we have a lot ten percent still
standing with 12 11 okay now we still
got about ten percent who programmed on
the initial Java 10 all right everyone
else it down thank you guys give
yourselves a round of applause so all
the guys who are standing at the end
there you guys are really the pillars
that made Java successful and one of the
great things about the java community is
the engagement and the fact that
everybody has been who's was involved
really around actually i started with 10
at Carnegie Mellon University
programming an IDE and I've stuck with
it ever since so hopefully some of you
guys who were standing also have great
shirts great stories to share might be a
good one for a quickie next year No okay
so here are some of the milestones Java
actually started way before 95 the green
project began in 91 Duke was born in 92
the mosaic just to put things in
reference the mosaic browser came out in
93 the Java compiler WebRunner k been 94
and it was until 95 when the java
programming language was actually
announced so to give us a little bit
more insight into the the early days of
Java I've SAT with James we sat down at
his um liquid robotics had a nice little
chat and this is what James had to say
about the very early days of the Java
programming language so so the green
project you know being a bunch of
Engineers we were you know trying to
figure out what was going on in this
space but you know rather than just just
study stuff and we did a fair amount of
that I mean we did a lot of like road
trips to Japan and road trips to Europe
and we talked to people at a whole lot
of different countries and companies and
we you know bought toys played with toys
you know did the usual sort of engineer
things but then as we you know we're
trying to really understand what was
going on we felt it was it was better to
actually build something and then so we
decided to to build something that was
that was kind of like a home remote
control you know the you know a tablet
that was linked to devices in the in the
neighborhood and the easiest things tie
into were were like televisions and VCRs
and such so we built the thing called
the star 7 which was kind of a prototype
handheld it was sort of a you know an
iPad you know decades before the iPad so
this is a short video of what the actual
star 7 device looks like so James hello
I'm Jim he didn't have much more hair
but at least his hair was a little bit
colorful stars and this is the physical
star 7 device he actually they hammered
this together they would rip apart old
nintendo's and prototype some LC to grab
LCD screens and radio antennas because
they didn't actually have readily
available parts that they could utilize
is and the actual display leverage Duke
who you guys are quite familiar with
actually can has the avatar for it and
you would click on items in using a
touchscreen so this kind of felt and
acted a lot like a like a very early
version one of the iPad
so here's a little bit of trivia for you
as well so the ipad the hardware
engineers who worked on the ipad a bunch
of them were actually the same guys that
were part of the Green Team so Apple
Apple doesn't like to divulge their
secrets the guys who worked on the
hardware project or now sworn to secrecy
in some apple basement but actually this
this is a proper successor it was the
same hardware engineers working on it so
pretty cool that you know very early on
Java had its roots in a real embedded
platform but you might be one of
yourself why does the Java language they
developed the Java language specifically
for this handheld device why does it
look so much like C and C++ so I asked I
asked James about this kind of an um why
he chose this and this was his answer
and you know all their engineers they
understood see and that was that was
kind of it you know so it had to be kind
of culturally compatible with that
universe you know so you know as I as I
started building it and fixing things
and fixing things and it's like you know
pretty soon any just it it only vaguely
looked like C++ and I and at some point
I just just gave up on trying to be
compatible and I'm trying to just do the
right thing always do the right thing so
I think I think James did a pretty good
job with the language what do you guys
think yeah
so it's kind of interesting James
actually he hand-wrote compiler compiler
zero which is you know what the very
very first version of Java was out
compiler one was written by Arthur
compiler to actually it does anyone know
this where compiler to came from let me
give you a hint scala yeah i'm martin
odor ski okay we got some very smart
people and via the audience but Java
really has a rich history and really was
marked by a lot of the language
decisions which Gosling put in place
very early so 95 was when the
announcement actually happened Netscape
was released early IDEs like a semantic
visual cafe came out just in the first
year this was also the job in a nutshell
the predecessor to javadoc 11 was was
released to sun tzu's microsoft in 97 12
is released the JCP was formed the key
and java was released and then j2ee 12
was released in 99 so this takes us into
kind of the you know midpoint of java
ends this is the question I always have
for for folks as you know after 20 years
looking back at the language what what
would you have done differently if you
could do anything so so what things
would I have done differently you know I
mean that there's you know there's kind
of a long list you know if I was just
building something for myself so so on
my list of things I would like just for
me is operator overloading you know I do
a reasonable amount of math and operator
overloading is really nice for that one
of the things that that sort of happened
was that there was a lot of people kind
of in the ecosystem in the area that had
a lot of experience with operator
overloading in NC and I'd actually
implemented operator overloading twice
over the years in first and implemented
it once in compiler zero and then once
in compiler to but the issue with
operator overloading is that it's really
easy to abuse
you know you when you look at what
people do with with with C++ you know
when you start using these shift
operators for input/output you know it's
it's kind of crazy and then when people
start using plus equals for a list
insertion and then it gets crazier from
there you know when I whenever I would
start you know writing emails about you
know to you know we really should do do
operator overloading I would get really
angry people stomping into my office
it's like no to me is unacceptable yeah
so it's probably a good thing he didn't
net operator over losing it I would have
hate to see him get beat up by adam
sandler but it's kind of interesting
that lots of features which we were
missing from the language or which are
things which as developers come we saw
come in much later we're actually
introduced fairly early on as prototypes
and experiments I think one of the
things which sets Java part is a
language is the the fact that a lot of
feature explosion in the language didn't
happen early on so that helped it to
have better backwards compatibility and
mature better as a language you can look
at other examples of languages where
they added too many features early on
Python and then they the explosion of
incompatibilities in later versions
which actually make it much harder to to
release to build enterprise software on
top of it so anyway the road to modern
Java kind of years 2002-2004 so NetBeans
happens was open source java opolis oh
wait what's anyone know what Java
places' that's that's kind of a weird Oh
dev ox yeah so I'm I'm very glad that
even though well I guess we since I'm
now I'm not working for Oracle even
though we didn't do the right thing with
the name that you guys kept the
conference and kept things strong with
the Java focus so kudos again to the
local team here for making things happen
but this is one of the big community
conferences which i think is an
important milestone in the Java
ecosystem and the lifespan of Java
and I'm putting it right beside j2ee and
all the other big achievement so I think
this is this is the right place in the
right setting for discussing 20 years of
Java so j2ee 13 jruby was released
Eclipse 10 2000 to be a acquired a vm
anyone know anything about this it
probably it probably doesn't look very
interesting but um this is actually
where J rocket came from and then later
was acquired by um oracle so that's
where the original Stockholm team came
which is doing a lot of compiler work
now 14 was released in 2003 j2ee one
before was released and then finally 15
which that's probably you know before
lambdas this was really the biggest
language change which happened in the
Java ecosystem so a little bit later you
know anything that Gosling regrets
adding to the language and I'm sure you
guys have your things which you might
consider but I think it's interesting to
go to take from the founder of the
language there were some things that got
added to Java over the years that felt
like they were done to sort of plaque
eight people who were just whining you
know and and probably pretty high on my
list is printf and those the sort of see
style formatting strings so I ever
guessed never been a been a fan of
printf it just has all kinds of issues
you know I personally tend to never use
it you know I tend to like sort of the
kind of fluent style you know where you
do change method calls and you know it
always felt to me like the right answer
was an interesting syntax for chained
method calls and I came up with several
proposals for doing Jane method calls
but people were really loud that it must
be printf and you know at some point
yeah you just it's like you know pissing
into the wind go for it man jump off the
high dive stare down the barrel of the
gun p into the wind yeah joe I assure
you so the gun I'm gonna be pretty much
peeing every which way who here actually
who's a well now that we've now that
we've we've exposed Gosling's secret
about which language he doesn't like who
who agrees with him who thinks printf
was a bad idea all right a few and
anybody here who really likes that
really use printf they couldn't live
without it all right so so just to give
you guys the results of the Paul we have
like you know about 20 people who
grieved as gosling and we had one brave
soul who actually raised his hand kudos
to you for sticking to your guns I
actually I use printf quite a bit as
well because um it's a handy way to get
around number formatting issues in you I
so i use it for UI code alright so
moving on 2005 2 2009 so this was when
the java champions were formed if you
want to find more about that then you
have to come to the insider secrets Boff
we're not going to talk about that now
beyond Java which is a nice book right
up there Red Hat buys jboss 2007 ja b 16
was released java ee 150 java 16 in java
ee 150 release job was open sourced in
the initial j2me release 2008 is javafx
an or acquired be a and finally java ee
6 was released in 2009 so this is really
the modern era of java and this is kind
of when i got involved in java as well
because I my first foray into Java was
doing javafx and or most forcefully into
book writing and speaking was javafx I
was doing Java for quite a while so I
thought it would be interesting to get
James's take on client Java since he's
had a big hand in this over the years
working for something kind of happened
in the late 90s early
Ott's where people started to believe
that the only way that can construct
user interfaces was through the web and
the web works great for a bunch of
things but there are a bunch of things
where it doesn't work well and you know
doing desktop programming really became
a four-letter word I mean you know you
you you you know you kind of had to go
into a back alley and kind of admit in
whispers that you were doing desktop
programming because it was it was so
wrong but everything had to be done with
the web and you know you can do a lot of
stuff with the web the web's the web's a
beautiful thing but if you try to build
something like Photoshop or a good text
editor I mean you know people have have
expended an immense amount of energy on
building you know text editor widgets at
widgetbox oft word there's just it's
just night and day and so javafx was
really designed for that universe and
it's been but it's it's it's really
really lovely and I'm not sure which a
lot more people were using it you know
you should you should really give it a
try the the kind of things you could do
on a screen with javafx are really
really pretty amazing and you know if
you've got the kind of thing that
requires tight interactive response or
really high data density it's really
really hard to do those things in HTML
somewhere in between really hard and
just outright impossible whereas you
know what you know I show people it's
it's really been funny because I show
people this app and and and it'll have
you know maps of the world and I scroll
around them and there's no like repaint
tearing the way there isn't say Google
Maps
scaling is absolutely fluid and you know
you can draw paths on the map that have
hundreds of thousands of points multiple
paths that have hundreds of thousands of
points do all kinds of funny things
overlaying it and people go how do you
do that isn't that you can't do that and
how do you know that doesn't work it's
like yeah you know you grow up grew up
knowing only HTML I'm sorry there's a
bigger world than HTML so um I just
wanted to highlight one thing so if you
guys have been doing any app development
on mobile phones this is kind of the new
desktop right doing apps on mobile and
android and there's actually somebody in
the audience here who's doing kind of
bleeding edge cross-platform job on
those devices you wanna you wanna stand
up mr. Voss embarrass yourself so Johan
keeps a low profile but he actually is
he started a new company called glue on
and he's doing exactly that he's doing
Java and Java effects running on Android
and iOS and multiple mobile platforms
and it's great to see the community
actually picking up what was started by
james gosling at son this was really his
vision for having a better framework for
clients and Java so you know you're
talking about Java we've been talking
about Java Duke and you know what's with
the little cute adorable figure which we
see is the mascot of Java ends this is
this is perhaps James's favorite part of
the Java language and this is the final
James clip as well he's sort of mascot
Duke just throw it up in t shirts
everywhere I mean you know there's all
these all these all these t-shirts that
we do we did over the years you know you
know Duke mice another Duke Mouse Duke
watch
probably the craziest thing the Dougal
Ailey the new gun playing cards the
Chinese Duke the Spanish bronze Duke the
Duke comic books I mean it's just it was
just sort of became the Nexus of fun you
know we had these these great costumes
and he had just been really really great
and it's it's really different for a
corporation to embrace fun and kind of
hand it to Scott for for tolerating the
goofiness of Duke but it was all good so
here are some of the t-shirts in the
back so Duke with the world on them do
kind of motorcycle Duke destroying doom
I guess is that when the doom character
is one of those 3d characters got
swimming this one is a little inside
joke what the heck is a glass cow this
is the classic painting the mural that
you'll see on James Gosling's homepage
with the Duke cafe I'm Duke driving down
the street so Duke is a whole lot of fun
as a character and the great thing which
James did before he left his he made
sure that it's an open source model that
anybody can use and leverage in their
own user groups so I think he's James
has given us a really great legacy both
in how he's developed the language how
he's left things in terms of the
community and Duke ins different things
and he's still engaged with the
community which is really awesome to see
the the founder that engaged even after
leaving oracle so now we're going
against the really really recent years
you know 2012 through 2016 this is the
oracle era here's our buddy james and i
asked them a little bit to give us
insights into the java 8 platform so
here's j here's um George on the
adoption of Java 8 Java 8 is
probably the biggest release that we've
done the most fundamental changes
because it involves changes to the
language libraries and underlying
support in the vm that all kind of work
together so it's it's been nice to see
the adoption of Java 8 which I think has
been about the most rapid adoption of
any of the major releases of Java so
it's kind of cool that you have this
combination of you know fundamental
change bringing about uh you know the
ability to program in a completely new
way for Java but in a way that feels
very very natural for java developers
not like you know something weird bolted
on the side and you know yet you know
despite that large change it also
something that people are embracing and
answered picking up quickly so there's a
whole lot of different things to the
Java platform other than just lambdas
that's probably the most significant one
but it was an entire API change to
support lambdas there were JVM changes
to support lambdas as well there were
other features with flight recorder
emission control which we're done by the
Stockholm team java FX 3d came out on
the client side a whole bunch of tooling
improvements profilers and probably
something which nobody's going to miss
does anybody here miss permgen ok I
didn't see any hands go up thank you so
this there are a whole bunch of
different things which came in and JDK 8
that made that a great release and this
is also one of the big language changes
in the platform but there's also another
side of 8 which is what's coming in the
upcoming java ee 8 so I chat a little
bit with Bill Shannon the Java EE
architect to get his take on what's kind
of upcoming java ee 8 release we're
doing a few things one of them is this
MVC API is another web UI framework it's
different than jsf it for people who
like that different style I think that
will be very interesting people it's
based on jax-rs which is proven to be
popular as well we're trying to do some
work in the security area for Java e8 we
always had a bunch of security stuff
there but there's been some
app some things that could be easier to
use and then we what we've done so far
so we're trying to improve in in the
security area what else there is Oh
management we're also trying to improve
management in the management area so I
think we had a management API for a long
time but it was built on ejb and as the
community is moving away from the sort
of remote ejb model to a more of a rest
based model we'd like to have a
management API that takes advantage of
that so that's a little bit of insight
into what's coming up in Java EE eight
but I'm actually more interested
personally in Java Java 9 anyone want to
see what's coming in Java 9y a few books
or actually beyond Java nine so I
chatted with John Rose a little bit who
has the auctions get as bigger and
everyone gets bigger it becomes more and
more important to be able to put your
applications data set in a flat form in
memory so you can pick the pieces up all
at all at once you don't have to do
dependent pointer chases also memory
compactness becomes important both of
those influences mean that we want more
things like primitives in Java we want
more things that don't always need to be
boxed in Java we want complex numbers
that are real for the first time instead
of boxed complex numbers objects so this
leads us to the value types discussion
which is ongoing and will see some
fruition we hope in jdk 10 and beyond
but the whole idea with value types is
we make something that codes like a
class but works like a primitive and so
a complex number or a quaternion or a
small transform matrix all of these
things which C programmers use vectors
for and small structs we want that in
Java also so I'm he's talking a little
about the upcoming features in project
Valhalla that's really exciting stuff
I've been trying to twist John's arm to
actually come out to dev oxxo one of
these days we're going to we're going to
get John out here seems really really
awesome and one of the biggest things I
think which marks the the 20 years of
Java is really the java community all
you guys so there's over 300 Java user
groups nine million Java developers 150
Java champions and fifty plus different
jug groups who are contributing to the
JCP and so I need I need your help I
talked a little bit earlier about
stories about you know kind of getting
started with javed we even like that we
can pass around so I need I need two
volunteers from the audience who would
be interested to share their first
experience coding with Java kind of an
anecdote or a short you know just a
minute quick a quick one minute kind of
how did you how did you get started with
the Java language to share with the rest
of the audience here and I I'm not I'm
not just going to do this without reward
so you get your pic used to choose one
you can either have the book Raspberry
Pi with Java that tells you how to build
the device or you can have the 3d prints
which makes which lets you skip a step
so you can just do the internal hardware
and then you don't actually need a 3d
printer to finish the final project in
the book so you get your choice of a
book or toy all right so that that also
means whoever whoever gives the first
anecdote gets an advantage so who would
like to share a story this guy's very we
have several very passionate people okay
works well my first experience was
actually in kind of a sub college I
needed some extra credentials so i could
start studying and the professor we had
he was nice he was friendly and one of
his very first assignments was blowing
bubble sort and I failed it miserably I
honestly can't say that my first
impression was too great not because of
Java but because I just didn't know
programming at all but once I got back
and we actually started college with a
second professor
he really gave us a sense of a sense of
completeness of fun yes not for
programming but also for java that's a
really good point so my my first few
algorithms classes were all stupid
boring sort algorithm so we should all
been boring homework assignments in
college exactly discourages people from
learning programming so I'm glad you
stuck with a give him a round of
applause all right so unfortunately you
get to pick so you have to choose toy or
book toy okay and please yeah my name is
Andrew so I've been a developer even
before I use Java so I developed see and
then c++ and then dotnet and then a
friend of mine just said me that there
is a java another language and i should
try it so I hesitated for a long time
and then I just yeah I tried it and I
for C sharp I used visual studio I don't
want sound offensive but then when I
been trying java I've seen intellij idea
and yeah I said this my language so I
right now i'm working at jetbrains so
Sharon's a good time I didn't work there
so yeah that's the most exciting thing
about I have an interesting story about
them intellij so you remember you
remember I said that I started out doing
an IDE back at CMU so I was working on
this little you know little project it
was actually the old CMU common list
team and we were building at Java IDE it
was really awesome and let you do like
code refactoring and you could do like
you know pull up lists of fragments and
it was like really we eventually open
sourced it when we lost DARPA funding
and I was working out into my spare time
for a while and then one of my coworkers
because I would bring it into my
different job look at my cool of ide and
then I get other people to try it one of
my co-workers showed me intellij and
that was that was it that day
I canceled my project it was it I
couldn't compete so yeah excellent
company good job give a round of
applause ok so I hope you guys have
enjoyed the presentation happy birthday
Java 20 years and here's some cakes to
celebrate the 20 years across the world
of the java programming language so
