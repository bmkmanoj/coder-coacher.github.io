afternoon my name is Chad Rochelle and I
am a software developer Oracle my focus
at Oracle is to develop tools and
reusable components and libraries for
developers to build enterprise
application and my current project that
I'm working on is Oracle jet and that's
something that we'll discuss later on in
the session so some legal stuff out of
the way first so today we're going to
talk about enterprise software and
specifically the client side the Java
client side JavaScript in the enterprise
workspace today and how that actually
fits the question that comes up first is
when I start to look into this is what
is enterprise software even mean these
days traditionally this means the
software that can extremely scale will
be able to handle heavy loads these sort
of things and then if you look at
wikipedia it basically defines it as
some software that are targeted for
corporations and groups meeting those
needs instead of individual which I
guess it's more consumer software
instead of an enterprise software but
like I said also in some degree hits
both of these you know with the extreme
loads and be able to actually scale to a
certain degree and when I start to
resource what other people actually
thought about these of course as always
you know one cynical response and this
one I found it very interesting it
basically said that is actually
complicated enough that you can do a
consulting business around it well I
hope when we build is that's not really
the case but them you know maybe
for some of us that's you know a good
thing the one thing that is true though
is the relationship between
client-server are changing so and that's
what really forces many of the changes
that we do with JavaScript on a client
on the server as well you know
traditionally when you look at them you
know all this data center and with this
you know large the server farm etc that
what we look at is you know things I
requests per second and how we do load
balancing on the web here or the a
petition here and and so forth so what
we really focus on is getting you know
the scale and the performance out from
the data center side and while in some
degree that is so true the relationship
between what the client can do and what
the server does is that is what's
starting to change so from the client
that we get used to meany does the
desktop and if you're lucky you get
something sensitive like this but you
know the world today is pretty
distributed so right now we're dealing
with things like tablets or phones in
addition to desktop and you know even
you know smartwatches and that the data
can actually run pretty well on these
client devices as they do on the on the
server so now we start to look at the
relationship between not only scale the
server cycle but also on your client
JavaScript code as well so what we're
going to focus on today is above scaling
on the client side and understand some
of the best practices that we have found
over the last couple of years while
working with this java client side
JavaScript frameworks themselves
and what I'm going to go over is a view
of these tips or building box if you
will on how when we start to look at how
you can build those enterprise
applications and you know the first
thing when we look into the JavaScript
space the biggest thing to start with is
resisting the hype or you know sometimes
we call it don't taste a shiny object so
there's always something new coming out
from the JavaScript world every single
week there's a new library coming out or
some new things that you can do so that
kind of thing and it's like yeah if my
application can do that that would be so
cool but you know the reality is that
i'm just because that it can be done
doesn't mean that it should be done
there will be some scenario where we're
we're it doesn't make sense to do this
type of things so for example the air
traffic controller you know the day when
we start to learn planes using phone or
tablet you know using rest services and
client server that kind of stuff that's
today when i'm going to click on the
train instead it just doesn't seem safe
but anyways there there are times where
in you know it says stone doesn't make
sense to on to to to make any changes
you want to stay with that you know
architecture would you go there's
absolutely no need to chase the shiny
object to you know to move to this
client server or using the browser as a
platform but you know that doesn't mean
that if you don't want to change these
things maybe there are things that you
want to to take a look at so maybe
extending it instead of replacing it so
you can keep perhaps their scenario
where you can keep the core application
feature the way it is but then the
things around it you can look into new
technology to see how you can extend it
so going back to the air controller
example for instance that you know some
pieces like the idea the management
piece the reporting keys where you have
the chart and stuff those are the things
that you can think of moving them to the
web platforms right other things like
you know maybe sending alerts to your
phone obviously not the critical ones
because by the time when you see value
will probably be too late so so maybe
there are certain types you know we can
look at things this way so think about
how the mission critical application can
be extended or to reach out to a
different audience using the new
technology you know with the core around
the core application features second tip
is with rediscovering HTML so when
historically when XML came out years ago
with HTML for being there for lasted for
13 plus years it was really designed to
describe you know scientific documents
and you know that's what we do and for
what what is doing it's doing pretty
well but then you start to see all these
plugins coming in you have flash plugins
everywhere you have audio fuckings and
all these kind of stuff and you know
when html5 comes out it was designed to
basically remove all these burdens or
plugins it was designed to UM to to to
basically give power to HTML to to
develop application and be able to run
after run application on the browser
itself and now we're just seeing you
know all this more than browser
implementing all this feature in the
html5 specifications and one of the
things that they actually added to the
html5 they have added a lot of semantics
into the language itself so you see
things like the the the the sections tag
or the head
attacks which are the things that
enables developer to write software in
assessable ways so you know you know
writing software that can not be used by
people with disabilities and you know
it's becoming more critical in today's
world and not only from a legal
standpoint with over 27 countries and
Association around the world they
actually require your software to meet
certain accessibility guidelines but you
know it's also the right the right thing
to do so you know if you can write
software that can be you know used by
all these audience and it's something
that is easy to do you know why not
doing it right so I'm going to show a
quick demo on what I mean by the html5
sin taxes and stuff so here you see you
know just some straight HTML we have
some new HTML input types that was
introduced like you know infotype for
color and for date and you have a list
that has a list of option that you
cannot specified and we have a range
here which is basically a slider as we
will see that kind of thing so and then
when you run it right then you see all
these things where if you click on here
you actually brings up a actual color
picker that I can choose color form or
if I choose here then I can you know
switch the date and year etc or if I
click on this it will actually bring up
the actual date picker right and on the
list it actually has doing a feature
that when you start to type in you would
do filtering or look ahead kind of
things so you know all these features
are provided natively by the browser and
of course the downside of this is that
you know the vendor has different pace
of
implementing those features so what you
see here in chrome might look complete
this one on firefox or IE for example so
so that's one of the downside but it's
also the direction that we're heading
right now what is most interesting is
when we start to get into the look and
feel so when you started to actually
deploy into as a mobile hybrid mobile
application like running onto iOS or
Android for example you actually see the
native widget on your phone or an iOS or
on Android so that's pretty nice so
going back to the slides so next step is
responsive design with CSS and
JavaScript so when you look at
application today you sort of expect it
to be responsive and what that means to
be responsive is basically your content
will adapt to the two to your viewports
so when you change the size of the
viewport that you're seeing you expected
the content to be changing and you know
live you're developing on the browser on
the world on desktop that will probably
mean to set them you know you resize
your browser and you expect it to see
that you're content to resize of reshape
itself depending on them you know the
view size of the viewport now obviously
the intent of this is changing devices
so switching from a desktop monitor to a
tablet or even to a phone right and
traditionally CSS is the is the is the
is the way that you can you can use to
this do this type of responsive design
specifically css3 which is gives
imbalance from the original CSS the
well-known mechanism or
or commonly used for is the media query
so with the media query the idea is that
you set up all this media query and say
that you know with this maximum width of
this and run these classes and if it's a
minimum width of this and run these
classes and then on the screen you
basically when the classes run you see
that your content actually adjust that
depending on your viewport sizes right
and this sort of works pretty well and
that's what people has been using it for
quite a number of years but the problem
is that when you start to go from
desktop to a phone and then the
bandwidth is starting to change that's
when you start to get into issues now
for example we're starting to look at
things like I have a really big images
or a chart in my on my page and I'm
shrinking down this from an application
on the desktop onto a phone and I
decided that you know this thing doesn't
look too good on on a small screen so
I'm going to hide it right and that's
pretty easy to do with CSS all you need
to set is displayed to none right but
the reality is that just hiding it
doesn't change the backend logic behind
it so when i'm doing this pic
application right and then i shrink it
down to UM to a phone basically hiding
half my stuff on it I'm still doing all
this rest call or I'm still you know
printing all this data from the rest
point or or or am i'm still fetching you
know making HTM CP requested to fetch
all these large images so you know going
from a desktop where you're running on a
local area network there you have a fast
internet that's not a problem but then
when you start to run this on a 3g phone
for example then you know it's going to
be run really really slow because you
know we're still it was still loading
data large amount of data from the
background right so the holy grail of
this is that
we want to get over to the JavaScript
side be able to do responsive design
using javascript and be able to control
the back and logic based on the viewport
size and you know let's start to show up
about two years ago and it's actually
use you see that in a quite a number of
places the big difference here of course
is that the show and high capabilities
simply highs the Dom element from the
Dom tree so the DOM is still there
versus when you do a food the JavaScript
then you basically you take out the DD
the Dom from the Dom tree entirely so if
you're running a page on the phone and
you got something that you don't want to
show you just don't load it completely
all right and that's really grateful a
high-performance type of application and
now there's two different libraries that
I wanted to mention in here first one is
responsive yes and that's all of the
first library to this do this JavaScript
responsive API the second one is
introduced by a company called ZURB they
have a UI framework called the
foundation and they have a piece called
the interchange which does this
responsive javascript thing so now you
can actually adjust the back end of your
business of your business logic using
javascript depending on the review size
but you can also do things like for
instance you're showing a big table
fetching a large chunk of JSON data and
show that onto the desktop but then on
the phone maybe what you want to do is
show a list view instead so you're
showing a lot less data information on
it and then when people click on the
item that's when you start to basically
drew into data and show more detail
about the item so it's a different
layout a different paradigm that you can
do with responsive JavaScript so you're
not only changing the domicile things
you're also changing you know using a
completely different
us endpoint to fetch less data so in the
end you get higher performance with
lower bandwidth so with that I'm going
to show another demo so here we go down
right here so basically I hi I have a
diff with two images image a and image
be so the first image a is has a media
query associated with it basically it
says that if if it's more than 70 less
than 7 167 pic so then you know hide it
don't run this cost right and then image
p I have a local piece of code wrap
around it so basically we'll only render
if this medium screen functions return
to true and this is basically defined in
my JavaScript code as you see in here so
I have variable here set up i'm using
this responsive na caboodle which is
actually something that comes from the
Oracle jet framework to creative media
query in my CSS and then when i run this
so here i see that both images is shown
but then when i start to shrink the
browser then you start to disappear and
then in the Dom tree you will see that
for image a is still there in the Dom
tree but imagery is basically I'm not
there so it's not render alone so let's
go back to the sly so my next tip is
some framework versus library there are
so many options in the JavaScript world
and like I said in the beginning they
are you know new stuff we're popping up
every single weakens them and not only
there's new things coming out is
whatever is the coolest one of them all
so in one week you might have a library
that do specific tasks and then a few
months later you have something that
came out that basically do exactly the
same thing but in a cooler way so
everybody kind of go on and chase it and
see what it does but if you really think
about is that if you're building
enterprise applications right it might
take six months to adjust to write the
base code and then you know six months
actually nada it's a pretty short time
to writing enterprise-grade application
and by the time when you finish writing
piece of the code the the library that
you're using might already be obsolete
and you haven't even released your
product yet so you know staying on that
bleeding edge is not something that you
can do creamy on the enterprise space so
the question is how do I make a decision
on what to choose and there's a couple
of ways to do this like I said there's
libraries out to libraries that comes
out and then even on the on the on the
back end side you have this libraries
for maintaining the application that you
need to look into like testing
frameworks and project runners and and
scar voting libraries etc right so one
of the ways that you can look at this is
ok I got all this library that I need to
look at all these things out there maybe
it's a little bit easier and if I start
to you know break this into different
purposes right so looking at the actual
library to see what the purpose is and
then try to find the best of breed among
those categories and see which one fits
and me better so if you look at
full-blown application framework first
one come to- angular and ember and then
you also have pieces feed that knock out
the backbone and view and react
on the modular system side you have
required GS browserify and web pack and
web pack is the new vapor right now on
the build system and this one is kind of
interesting because I'm so so grunt came
out two to three years ago and you see
you know it's the big kid in the block
that you know everybody is writing
plugins on on the on the system and then
grope came along and then it's like it's
basically does exactly the same thing
except we use this no stream and you
know you know it's like a mixed best
thing and then that lasted about a year
and then front school now so you know
it's them got a lot of them things to
consider so it's hard to find what the
next best thing is so sometimes it's
better to find that one thing that
actually seems to need find something
that has a has a strong community behind
it have a strong ecosystem around it so
that you know that you can stay on it
for a little while all right so that
doesn't mean that you don't keep looking
at the future thing we do because the
thing that you are on right now might
you know you might need to move off from
that so that's especially true in the
JavaScript wall and we're talking about
the difference between you know looking
at things every few months versus every
few years a ton of name and for testing
framework we have a protractor Jasmine
qunit qunit is actually what we're using
internally Oracle RightNow for for jet
and it's pretty nice framework and we
have karma so what it really comes down
to is there's two different ways at
looking at these things on one hand you
have the framework approach and it's
basically all nothing or all in one
invite
Armand and you know angular and amber
are you know is the one that comes to my
mind with this and angular of course is
backed by Google and so it has a lot of
resources behind it and it's a really
good friend worker as well but the thing
is that is all what you want to do with
it I mean it's a google way of doing
things so if you are buying into this
whole angular system then you have to do
things the angular way right which is
perfectly fine I mean I'm not here to
say that where there is right or wrong
to do things in such a scenario what I'm
saying is that if there's something new
come along and it's something they
actually fits your need then with the
framework approach then you have to wait
for angular to pick that up right so
that's one of the downside so if you are
picking the framework approach then you
want to find something that is very well
maintained has a good company back
behind it like in the case of angular so
on the other hand you have the library
approach so that's basically I'm finding
all these atomic pieces finding library
for a specific need and then and then
you know finding the right routing
library the right data binding library
the UI library which you can actually
break them into you know further into
different pieces that you want to do now
of course there's overhead into setting
things up right with the library
approach because you have to make sure
that all these pieces work together and
also you know different version and so
forth but once you have this set up once
you have something that is working for
you then it becomes much more flexible
and you're in a better position to
basically switching libraries in and out
and so forth so take the routing for
instance cross row I don't know if you
guys heard of it but is you know it's a
library that used for routing two to
three years ago and it's basically a it
has based on the abilities to shove
things into a half system and but it is
not it is not if it cannot work with
html5 history API and when html5 history
API comes out then you'll need this
extra plug-in to basically get crossed
over to work and then people are saying
okay so maybe there's a better ways to
do things right so and then there's a
library call during though and it was
really really cool so if you're doing
things in the library opposed you can
just swap out via the the the existing
routing pieces and then put dirndl in
right and in for routing sucks for you
young not that big of a deal because the
configuration is very very similar
between all this library so it's
something that is very easy to do others
might not be other pieces might not be
so easy but the rallying is a good
example and speaking out during doll so
when angular when they update to from
version 12 version 2 they actually hire
the guy who wrote during doll to write
their mayor the router layer pieces in
angular 2 and then he basically left
after four months so which brings us to
the next step which is modularity so
there's absolutely no way in today's
world where you can write enterprise
application without considering
modularity the fact that if you have
more than one developer writing on the
same application forces you to look into
a modularity and we're talking about
like in the vsi or perhaps in single
page application where you have someone
basically writing
frame for the application or maybe have
somebody writing multiple different
pages and have them loaded in a modular
way you want to be able to look at it
this way so for example you can split
your development team into a developing
separate pages right so that they don't
basically step on each other's code so
doing things in module way on the client
side saves you a lot of headaches and on
the business side also makes sense to
them to do things in module way too so
you have someone who write an
authentication module someone to write
the the data service module that kind of
thing and then you can reuse those
pieces in different places in your code
and this is nothing new it's always been
around so but it has to be done even on
the client side in order to be able to
reuse our code properly and when it's
done properly is pretty amazing you know
how great these things can be I don't
know if you know about this trend but um
apparently there's a huge access number
of cargo containers around the world and
I thought that this cargo container can
actually be reused but turns out there's
a shelf life to them so when a cargo
container cannot you know meet the
quality to serve its purpose then
they're basically dumped into the
junkyard and their stack up and up and
up and up and then you have architects
that are coming in and start to turn
them into homes so you know all these
houses that you see here actually go
from a cargo container and it's pretty
amazing stuff and you know it's pretty
cool what you can do when you start to
think about doing things in a modular
way again looking at some of the
libraries out there that can help you
work with module these are all
JavaScript side libraries
so required jess is probably the the old
man in the block it's been there for a
while and it introduces an architecture
called AMD which stands for I singles
module definition web pack is one of the
new ones out there and is gaining a lot
of popularity both require jets in web
pack has the ability not only to load
module during run time but they also
have ability of helping you build
package your file at bill time browser
by if I say the car is it but browser
very basically does the same thing
except with them it basically brings the
noche es syntax so the require syntax
down to this so that you can use that at
the browser also the one that I want to
talk more about is actually a year six
in vs 6 or year 2015 they actually
introduced the module capability so you
can actually write module in es6 but but
the problem is that when they define
when the committee defined the spec
final I suspect they actually planned on
whether it's how to load module a
synchronously I guess they don't they
they probably don't have enough time and
they have to get the purse back out so
they actually punted it in fact they
have move that piece to the html5
working group so that it will be defined
for the next release of html5 spec um so
now we have the modulo during yes x is
synchronous that means and then in
enterprise application where you have
hundreds of libraries across hundreds of
pages and then if you start to have
synchronize loading of all this module
you're going to have some performance
issue so there are things that you need
to watch out for when you are
you know start to move to the latest and
greatest things so next step is
abstraction over JavaScript and CSS I
know it's hard to believe but there's
actually developers who don't love to
write JavaScript natively looking at
code in a native way might not be clear
to some of the developer I know that you
are you know writing JavaScript from the
beginning you're probably scratching
your head but if you're a developer
coming from the Java world who are very
used to strongly typed languages then
Java scripts start to you know look a
little bit strange so that's why you
start to see some of these library
coming in like typescript which they
basically they call it transpires piling
but basically it transpile a neutron
thai script code into JavaScript in the
end and what they do is so while you're
writing code you actually have the
ability ability to to to have strong
type and on top of that because you know
exactly what type of you can you you're
working with that you'll be able to
write better 20 supporting on top of it
so there's argument on both sides of
whether you know strong type language
actually leads to a better programming
or through a box what I'm trying to say
is that you want to take something that
your team is comfortable with so anyways
there is a coffee script which is an
older solution and then types could we
talk about that and that's probably the
most popular right now because of this
party angular and then you have Q script
flow is one of the new ones out there
but in the end they all abstraction over
JavaScript
unless these are actually abstraction /
CSS and they are css3 compilers they
absolutely do more so they added a
programming capability to CSS itself by
the way I'm SAS unless they have a
really strange history so so fast come
out first with a format right and then
let's come along it is basically built
on top of sass and it's like the best
next best thing and then some time later
sighs come back in and say you know I'm
going to change my format to scss and
I'm going to do on top of less so it
becomes the next best thing so we have
this back and forth going on between
sass and ask has been going on for a
while but i thinks asses sued the the
more popular one out there and they're
both great as i was saying they both
bring a programming capability to CSS so
you can start to do things like
condition statements or declaring
variables using lutz or doing
calculation using math packages etc but
you know in the end what we're trying to
do is just find a way to see the whole
picture more clear you want to be able
to provide a way for developer to get to
JavaScript or to get to CSS and Bill
code in a more clear away so the final
tip we take a look at the corporate
frameworks out there so large companies
are getting more and more involved with
the open source space these days
Microsoft for example they have been
doing a lot of great things in the open
source world for quite a while they
especially with the developer tools they
have contributed to a lot of open source
libraries in many many different areas
the one that I can think of this is
related to javascript / is a library
called wind j/s which is a UI library
so I BM sorry IBM they are actually one
of the founding member of a dojo which
is one of the original JavaScript
framework although IBM right now is more
involved doing angular stuff but those
who is due around Salesforce they have
their own thing called the lightning
framework which is pretty much
proprietary but but it's built based on
an open source project Cola project ora
SI p they have something called the
essay p open UI 5 and they they have
pushed that to apache foundation a while
back ing is more known for known as a
financial company but they did have a
have a UI component framework days bill
on top of angular call spectacular i
hope i pronounced that correctly so they
push it out to open source of both three
and a half years ago but unfortunately
it doesn't seems that there's any
activity for the past few past year and
a half which doesn't sound too good
paypal has his library call cracken jas
which is back in framework and it's
based on no chairs and express
application framework and of course
oracle we have jet which i'm going to
talk a little bit more about this right
now and why you should take a look at it
so what is oracle jet oracle jet stands
for oracle javascript extension toolkit
and it's basically a collection of
library instead of a framework it's a
toolkit and with jet we basically take
the library approach we basically built
on top of a collection of open-source
libraries each serving a specific needs
and these are the one that we are using
so every single UI component in jet wrap
around as a jQuery UI widget so this
allow us developer to reach out to a
greater repository of widgets that you
can use so if you can't find something
in jet itself which is something that
you don't like you can certainly use
some other widget we've used knockout.js
for the data binding layer and requirejs
is the one that we use for lazy loading
resources and for handling loading of
modules AMD stuff so jet is also
designed to develop mobile application
so for that we uses the accord over for
developing hybrid applications and it's
modular so use as much as you need or
use as less as you need it's all up to
you you know you can sort all pieces
that you don't want for example here are
some of the basic components so we have
basic components for the form table for
layout for example and in total we have
80 plus components that you can use out
of the box at this point we also have a
set of events data visualization
components so things like charts and
gauges and map and then you see timeline
in the middle and we also have a game
chart that we are coming
out with we created jet about three and
a half years ago and we have been using
it internally within Oracle for
developing our own cloud products in
fact seventy percent of 70 seventy
percent of our cloud product users yet
in some shape or form so we know that is
scale we know that it works well because
we use it ourselves and these are the
screenshot that are coming out from our
bi cloud service visual analyzer this
one is a screenshot coming out from the
Oracle cloud management cloud services
so we see here like we have a chart that
shows your request response time so
that's coming from jet all this diagram
and all this kind of stuff and then we
have another screenshot of the orphan
Oracle management cloud where we show
charts of page load time and CQ
allocation sorry page view that kind of
things page load time in chart so all
these subject this one is from visual
analyzer so for example the map here it
shows you know the cell stores for each
of the region you know in a map sort of
mixing it with the chart and this is
coming from our from apex so if you go
and get apex 5.1 today you're going to
get jet with it all the graphs engages
that you see are coming from jet and i
also want to mention for us for the
solaris the operating system the the web
administration console we have written
that using jet so all these graphs and
engages that you see in there that shows
you know real-time status of the server
all those things are written in jet
every single component in jet fully
meets the accessibility guideline so we
want to make sure that all the features
can be accessible with a keyboard for
example or be able to you know work with
the screen reader on the desktop or on
the on the mobile devices and you know
we're pretty proud about what we have
done as far as I believe as far as open
source framework is concerned I think
accessibility wise we are one of the
best one out there we support 28
languages in 190 + locale that locale
out of the box both languages include
Hebrew and Arabic so we support
languages right-to-left languages so for
example if you have a Gantt chart and
showing a Gantt chart when you change
your locale to Arabia for example then
you see all the time axes and all the
task bars all this kind of sub will be a
flip over same thing with the table and
it's mobile ready of course every single
component that jet provide are touching
gesture enable not only just forms but
also on you know touch enable desktop as
well we provide native themes for each
of the mobile platform so iOS Android
and Windows rooms we also provide a
command-line tool that allows you to
very quickly compile your application
for deploying to mobile devices and the
Cordova is what we use as I talked about
earlier and if you choose to compile to
end or for example we also manually
choose the the end Roy look and feel for
you so that you want to run on the
Android devices you know it will look
native same for hours and windows we
have support billion support to you know
common mobile paradigm that you find in
common in mobile applications so for
sample this one we showed the drawers or
we actually call it the off campus that
you know when you when you click on it
then you will slide in and out of that
kind of thing you know very common UI
pattern the other one is positive
refresh which is another one that is
very common and this one actually I work
on it you can have it's actually exposed
as as a utility class so you can you can
associate it with anything so not just
to list view but you can be to any live
and you just specify a call back to the
call when you know when you are
releasing its startin to invoke the
degree first action same thing with us
swipe to review this is also a very
common gesture again this one is exposed
as a utility class so you control what
the content is inside the drd2 swipe
actions and what to do when you know
when user click on one of these buttons
sticky they say this real Heather is
another one of them that you usually
found in them you know contact this on
the on the device for example so let's
just scroll you basically maintain your
information content and then we also
have have an indexer component of one
day you see on the right which again
something that you found a lot of mobile
applications and it's actually written
as a separate component so it doesn't
have to be associated with this view but
if you do associated with this view then
you can hook them up very easy and be
able to when you click on the and let it
be able to scroll to the appropriate
header so you know very easy to set up
progressive data loading or we call it a
high-water mark schooling so this is
basically when you scroll to the bottom
of the list then we'll begin to fetch
more data the loading indicator that you
see at the bottom there that's actually
also fema ball so it looks different
depending on what devices that you're
deploying to and last one jet actually
we have our own rather implementation so
and we provide basically platform
appropriate animation when you are you
know Joe down to this view to a detail
so and it's all open source so we are
open source under the universal
permissive license which is actually a
step better than the MIT license it's
basically one step away from being a
public domain and you can learn more
about that from oracle Jetta org or you
can follow us on twitter at oracle jet
