this session over the other two which
were also a great great quality I I saw
mr. Phillip crane in one of the other
talks great guy I've been to his talks
multiple times so I hope that session
will be videotaped so that I can watch
it later my name is Hana and I'm going
to tell you a bit about spring boots and
also about spring boot version two which
only was released last month and I'm
also I also want to try to build a
spring boots application in the next 50
minutes emphasis on try I hope it's
working at the end most of the times it
does and I've done this talk also in 40
minutes so a bit less time so in theory
this is possible but I really need you
guys and girls to help me out a bit in a
few ways actually for starters when I
make a mistake during the live coding
and you see it please raise your hand
and I'll try to fix it and I'm bound to
make a few mistakes so there's my
disclaimer secondly spring boot is quite
flexible when it comes to dependencies
and using multiple frameworks like
databases or template engines or other
other libraries and I really need you
guys to help me define the requirements
for the application so Internet
connectivity permitting we I'll try to
organize this using an online voting
system and if the internet fills us
we'll just do it by making ourselves
hurts like applauding or something or
just yelling out what you want to see I
think we will make it work so tiny bit
about myself because let's face it you
just want to hear me talk about spring
routine not about myself at least not
for very long so my name is on oh I am
from the Netherlands I work for info
support as a Java developer sometimes
also a software developer I've been a
scrum master a few times also trained
people at our company mostly on the Java
really
technologies now also before we get
started I need to know a tiny bit about
you guys so can I see some hands who has
worked with the classic Spring Framework
before a lot of you guys yes so it's
like the custom XML configurations Java
annotations in later version of spring
and who has worked with the spring booth
before okay yeah that's like half of you
guys so I I'm going to assume that it
was with spring boot version one is
there correct never assumed right it's
very dangerous in our profession but I'm
going to do it anyway no that means that
I have to divide my attention a bit
because there are a few few of you like
half of you guys who have never worked
with spring boot before so I'll try to
introduce it a bit tell you what it's
all about and what are the benefits and
the drawbacks obviously and I'll try to
focus a bit on the new features that
spring put version two rings so it will
be a kind of a hybrid approach this time
so let's get started lots to do so
spring but when you go to the website of
spring boot it says the following spring
boot takes an opinionated view of
building production ready spring
applications and it's favors convention
over configuration designed to get you
up and running as quickly as possible
well we'll see about that
in this talk how quickly we can be up
and running so in fact the the framers
of this talk is also to put this to the
test this claim
well the key features of spring boot is
that you can create standalone
applications so they don't well that you
can actually configure it to produce a
war file but you don't need to and by
default it will produce a jar file if
you build it with an embedded web server
and it tries to apply automatic squint
spring configuration wherever possible
so for example in a classic spring
application you would always have to use
the components can annotation to tell
Spring Framework where all your spring
beans would be in spring boot this is
done automatically wherever possible so
if you stick to the defaults your
components will be found automatically
of course we don't want to stick to the
default you need some custom
configuration but in that case that's
your own choice so this means it doesn't
rely on any code generation which is
based which is in which it differs from
the spring Roo project with the spring
Roo framework which generates code all
over the place and also in spring but no
XML configuration whatsoever you can you
can do fine just without it and still
it's still trying to offer all spring
features so no that's not really a
reason to choose the classic Spring
Framework anyway not today
so there are a few pros and cons
obviously a pro is you don't need a
separate web server which also means
that you can debug your application
directly from the IDE so there is no web
server involved you can just start up
your jar found debug mode and also
deployment gets very easy because you
can just start copying your jar file to
remote server or add it to a darker
image or just something like that so no
web server involved not directly anyway
there are also no web.xml classes and if
you don't need them also no
configuration classes again if you want
to change the defaults then then you
would need to have them in fact you can
be up and running with just one Java
file and the build script well of course
there are also some drawbacks like every
every library or framework is if you
must have a few drawbacks and in this
case it will be custom configuration and
because most people use spring boot just
by using the defaults so if you have
some exotic config configuration or some
requirement that nobody else has it can
be a bit of a puzzle now I'm not saying
it can't be done because I think it can
but it just needs a bit more time to
figure it out and I also put in the
trash you to port your legacy spring
project to frame boot because framework
is designed to get you up and running
quickly like with a new project or like
with a demo or proof of concept so 14
year legacy spring
project would mean that you were yeah
you would have to deal with all kinds of
deviations from the defaults so custom
configuration all over the place and of
course another drawback is that it uses
spring obviously which excludes roughly
half of the java community because there
are also people who don't like a spring
framework or companies who have chosen
to do everything the java ee or I should
say the Jakarta away right now because
the name changed last week I guess so
like half of the Java programmers and
half of the Java jobs there's no spring
involved anyway so you can't use it but
I'll return to this statement at the end
of the presentation okay so what if we
would start a project what we need well
I told you earlier that you can be up
and running with just a build script in
the Java file one Java class this is not
exactly - because you need at least two
Java files but you know what's the
difference right of course you need a
Java file to to offer some functionality
so in this case with a very simple rest
controller with a one method that
listens to the root of the of the web
server and it just returns a string this
this one is the rest controller and you
would need an application class to do
the quick assembly and to to start up
the whole thing with the main methods
and and you would need a bill through it
with a few compilation dependencies well
everything you you need would be right
here in this case we've chosen the the
web starter but you can choose whichever
you want there are a lot of them I know
you would also need the spring boot
Gradle plug-in to make sure that all the
functionality from their plugin is
available this will also work with with
maven by the way but I have to
the greater greater script in this slide
so I already showed you the spring boot
starter web a dependency descriptor in
the bottom of the slide and there are
all kinds of starter dependencies
actually which are all meant to get you
started as quickly as possible and there
are a few actually and everyone actually
inherits from this one spring boot
starter which is the core starter and
it's bundled with every starter
dependency this one includes logging and
also outer configuration
there's just tests are there to get you
started on your unit tests also includes
mojito and hem crest dependencies this
is the one where it was on the slide the
previous slide the web starter which
includes spring MVC support there is one
for a JPA
for spring data and are all kinds of
variants that supports bring data with
all kinds of different implementations
so I'm not going to list them all here
but there's a quite a good list if I
follow this link you can get an idea of
all all the starters that are available
it's a very long list and this is a good
thing because there's lots to choose
from there are all these technologies
that are listed here are supported
through the spring wood starters which
means that if you use one of this these
technologies you can get started very
quickly with your application so spring
an issue lawyer who is used to bring
initializer before a few people more
great it's a web-based application by by
the Supreme people that allows you to
select your dependencies when you start
your project and download like a
template project which you can open up
in your ID and you can start working
right away so I'll be using this
application actually for our
replication that in a few minutes so
I'll show you how it works ER then now
there and of course the spring boot to
was released last month with some new
features so I thought I'd put in a few
slides to talk about it
of course there were all kinds of
upgrades so spring boots who works with
the spring 5 framework with all the new
features that are included in that and
this also means that there is a Java 8
baseline now so if you want to use
spring Mbutu you need to be on Java 8
there are a lot of reasons why you
should be on Java 8 by the way but this
is also one of them and Java 9 is also
supported if you want to continue
following the version trends well spring
whip flux is a project that was released
some time ago which is Springs a
reactive component and this is also
included in spring row 2 now so you can
create your Spring web flux applications
using spring boot and there is some AC
to be to support for tomcat jetty and
undertow as a web servers to make use of
faster connections and well of course
using this HTTP 2 protocol anyway so
spring would one used to have a spring
specific metrics API this has been
replaced by micro meter based metrics
and there are there have been various
improvements to actuator which is the
components by spring that that tells you
the health of your application and can
tell you all kinds of statistics that
are then exposed via rest endpoints and
this has been improved greatly because
it was very much tailored to spring MVC
and this is the spring people writes
about it saying it's technology agnostic
now so it can be used also with other
spring components like for example web
flex so it's not tied to NBC anymore the
courts scheduler library has has been
supported so if you want
scheduled jobs in your application it
can be done very efficiently using
sprain boot - and the outer
configuration of spring security has
been simplified a lot so if you would
want to secure your application with
spring would one you need to specify
exactly which paths would be secure and
which would be anonymously available and
in spring boot - by default everything
is secured and because a lot of people
really wanted that to be the default
setting and of course you can override
this and configure this yourself in your
security security configuration what you
don't really have to if you want to
secure everything and there are a few
more new features I'm not listing every
every new feature on the slides here but
these are the ones that I'm talking
about in a bit more detail so there
there's a component that creates
animated gif banners which is so great I
just had to show you so I will in the
next slide and this was the one that I
was looking forward to the most
accordian support so build your spring
and Kevon is using Coughlin's full
release notes are or if you follow this
link you will you'll get to the full
release release notes though there are a
few more things but these are the most
important ones well animated gif support
that sounds great right so this is the
demo project that I that I saw on the
website you just put an animated gif
somewhere and it's and if you run it it
will be it will generate and yeah an
ASCII version of it how's the movie any
better if you want to see it this is
just crucial to your company's strategy
right yeah how will you ever get market
leading positions if you don't if you
don't support these kinds of
functionality yeah so recommend these to
your clients anywhere if you want some
animates give support get these projects
well to leave all the kidding behind us
complain support really is something
that I was looking forward to well
besides that it is possible to ride your
component in Groveland now there are a
few other things other characteristics
of the coupling language that are used
by the spring people in a great way for
example nullable information in spring
annotations so imagine you are arising a
spring MVC application and you need to
specify whether a request parameter is
required or not well in Springwood one
and in the spring classic framework you
need to to enter these information in
the request param annotation so so open
up the brackets and say required us
through or required is false if you use
Coughlin's you can use the nullable
information so you can just put this
right there you could just say a request
brand name string question mark and in
this case it means not required because
question mark and colin means that the
variable can be knowable it can be no
actually and if you leave out the
question mark it means the request
parameter is required so at any request
to that URL and you don't supply the
name parameter will fail well some of
you you guys may may remember that
classes in coding are closed for
extension by default you need to
explicitly tell these some specific
classes to be open well the spring
people have made sure that beam classes
are open by default and this means that
all classes that are annotated with
component and also async transactional
and cashable if you use one of these
annotations on your beam class it means
that cult link class will be open and
all the other ones will be closed anyway
so you can easily extend your own
components for example and allows that I
put up on the slide very is called line
based Gradle build configuration so you
can use : in your Gradle scripts also
is possible since great offers in the
fora if I remember correctly but this
also means out of completion in your IDE
and also validation which is a nice
feature I guess also you guys are in
luck because as of today tonight at 5:00
p.m. the pivotal people will will do a
webinar on spring boots ooh
I just saw this last week and I thought
I have to put this in my presentation so
if you get home in this afternoon very
tired and weary from two days of
conference you can just keep going you
know you know put up this webinar and
then and and and see what the pivotal
people have to say about spring boot and
I guess it would be a bit longer than my
talk so there might be even more detail
in it so if you're interested go to this
URL tonight at 5 p.m. I checked it's
right at times I don't oh don't worry
about that and learn even more about
spring boot - okay what do you guys
think that it's it's a it's been quite
enough talking right so let's see some
code let's see how this stuff works and
well also we'll see if the internet
works so I've put up a few online voting
sessions and I will I'm very curious to
see if they will respond so if you want
to join in our vote and I'll start the
session and there will be a URL in the
screen you can just visit it using your
phone or your laptop so just go to
cahoots adult IT and enter the game pin
that is shown on the screen
and you were into the lobby and you will
be able to help us define the
requirements for the demo application
that we're building
so actually you need to provide your own
nickname and it's good for you guys to
know that I'm a Star Wars fan and not a
Trekkie
so no Klingon chisel or you know seven
of nine or although
two things unless you want to upset me
of course
so I have to admit I haven't seen enough
to Star Trek to recognize names from it
so this this could very well be a name
from the Star Trek movie I'm not even
sure yeah I think I've seen one or two
or something just enough to know what
Klingon is okay well thirty people in
the lobby that's quite enough to get
started I guess there will be a second
version of the the floating session in
in a few more minutes so if you're
missing out now you can still join the
next one so there will be three
questions first question will be what
what's the purpose of our application so
what do we want to build actually
because it needs to have a purpose right
everything really should have a purpose
so should we build a simple task Flynn
er should we build a craft beer catalog
to keep track off everything that we've
tasted so far or should we build a movie
database to keep track of everything
we've watched so far it's up to you guys
time's up 27 answers and the winner by
far is the craft beer catalog I get this
every time and not sure why I'm only
building craft beer catalogs anywhere I
go you know also in Barcelona they also
one other card catalog so what database
should our Springwood application use so
relational with JPA you know the
old-school way
Couchbase new forge a MongoDB don't look
at picture because it just selected one
randomly not trying to influence any
votes or something that will be that we
now see so
oh it's a tie
it's a tie I've never had this before
relational JPA or a neo4j I think we'll
have to have a shouting contest right
once a relational GPA yeah once near for
J hey whoo well new for J is a clear
winner thank God that we can still talk
to each other eyes otherwise how would
we ever solve this kind of deadlock
situations yeah
no I'm an IT guy I don't I think talking
is very scary so what language it will
use this is a new question of course
because since bring boots we can choose
whatever Java are holding you know the
point really in this floating session is
I don't really care well spring boot
doesn't really care what you choose and
I do care because I had to prepare all
these variations what sir seriously guys
Java really okay yeah I don't care I've
prepared Java Java version even more
times than the colt they were themself
so but this is really the point right
and when you get started spring boot
doesn't really care what you choose and
I care a bit because really I had to
prepare like four times four three times
for you know yeah like sixty versions of
the talk so don't do this ever if you
actually have a life and nice hobbies
yeah because I did it you don't have to
do it again right so okay thanks for
taking part then now we know what to do
because we are doing neo4j building a
Croft implicit proper application and
we're also going to use Java for it for
itself let's go to start the spring that
I own here it is I'm choosing greater
for this one we're choosing Java and
we're choosing spring boot too of course
well let's give it a group ID clock
stays Vienna let's call our application
beers well we're going to need the near
forge a dependency and also I'm going to
include dev tools the people who have
worked with spring boot before
might recognize this one and there are a
few features in here that enable you to
do stuff like hot swapping and all those
kind of things so it's a good dependency
to include now I'm pressing alt enter
and it offers me a download that is the
template of my my application so let's
extract this somewhere where I can find
it preferably development slash Java and
now extract is right there so let's fire
up the IDE and import the project that
we just extracted so it was in C
Development Java all kinds of projects
that I've done before of course here it
is this is the beers project I guess so
let's open up that one let's use auto
import and my local grade distribution
so let's see what spring initializer did
for us so this is the spring good
version which is spring were to here's
our group ID that's for what this is
doing here let's get rid of that right
yeah I know right
not sure why it does that okay and it's
him also edit of course our spring
starter data neo4j dependency and the
dev tools so that's great well if we
really want to store some beers in our
Crawford catalog that's great a beer
close this should be the beginning right
so there we go
Java close we just call beer I hope you
guys can all read this in the mech is it
okay should it be a bit bigger
is it okay yeah great thanks
okay well beer um could have all kinds
of fields of course so let's start off
with an ID which in the new 4j database
they prefer a long value so let's put a
long in there we also need to annotate
this with ID
the neo4j annotation and also a
generated value because neo4j will
generate the ID value for us well a beer
can also has a name of course otherwise
how would we know what we are talking
about so let's add a name and let's also
add a style it could be larger or
Pilsner or quadruple or triple or
whatever and let's also add an alcohol
percentage so you know how many you can
have before you need to get a right or a
cap or something
well with Cokely we wouldn't have to do
this but in java we need to generate
some getters and setters
unforunately so here we go well there at
the top and really character it works
either way
okay and if we want to store these beers
and read them from our you know database
we would need a class to access the
database so let's create a beer
repository the Ituri which will annotate
with the repository posit ori annotation
from the Spring Framework and actually
I've created a class here but we don't
really need a class an interface what
you'd do just fine because spring date I
can generate a runtime implementation of
it with all the the common operations
like find all and delete one and insert
so let's let's use that we're going to
extend from the crud into the crawl
repository interface and it takes two
generic arguments the first one will be
the entity type which is bear in our
case and the second one will be the type
of ora our ID field which in this case
is cases long but for example if we
would have chosen among gonna be we we
could insert object ID here or string
one of those two
actually they'll use the crowd
repository this is not the right one
sorry mistake number one like yeah right
well you guys keep calm for me we really
need the new your Forge a repository so
the crowd one you can use when you're
using Couchbase for example if we want
new your fridge a to work we will need
this one okay and we won't need another
thing which I have prepared before but
it would take so long to do a live code
that I've prepared it so I've created a
secret config folder for a year for J
and this contains an application
properties file so let's just open this
up with notepad and copy these copy
these properties there's already an
application properties in our project
but it's empty so copy these in and
these are some you know the username and
password for our local near forge a
database well speaking of that the only
thing that we need right now is in the
New York or J database so I'll start
this up in a minute and we'll also need
a test class I guess because we need to
be able to see whether insertions and
deletions are working correctly and also
I've prepared a test class so it's not
working so let's find the test class
anyway we can also do it like like this
we're using the beer once so let's copy
the beer task Java file we can get rid
of this one because doesn't contain
anything you so anyway let's paste it
like this test it we'll just test
inserting a beer and finding it so let's
try to run it and not sure if the neo4j
database is running anyway so maybe I
need to start it up I'm not sure where
it is installed
that's not running I guess can actually
refused I'm not sure where I installed
it oh I do remember sorry like this I
thought it was right here
hmm so would you guys mind if I switch
to JPA right now or not
you know I've used windows for quite
some time now and I asked my company if
I could get a MacBook and it's arrived
within three weeks so this is the last
talk I'm doing on Windows and after I
installed previous updates my Start menu
stopped working if you guys had this bug
or maybe you're not using Windows after
all but so I can click on this but
nothing ever happens yeah it's quick I
use anything from Microsoft right so I
tried to fix it before the talk but it
didn't work and now I can't fight money
or forge a database and I know it's
somewhere and I can spend the next 15
minutes looking for it but I don't I
don't think you guys want to see that or
do you nope not really right so what I'm
gonna do because it was a tie anyway you
know between JPA and neo4j I'm going to
switch to the JPA version just just for
the sake of being able to show you
something and if you guys are interested
I can post a neo4j version online after
a talk with you if you want so so I'll
just generate a new zip file and copy
the build script that will be faster
than looking up the other things so if
we want to use JPA we need to we need to
graduate the JPL dependency and also an
h2 in memory database so let's open up
this one and let's go through the build
script because that's really the only
thing I care about what's this please
this is this is terrible it it's like it
it knows that I'm going to it to a
competitor right in a few weeks
so let's annoy you a bit longer just for
a few yeah like this yeah there it goes
thank you that's a good idea okay I see
yeah I have a 15 minutes so I'm really
going to speed it up right now so let's
hope that we get something working well
actually it's it's a nice case we should
because you guys can see how easy it
will be to switch technologies right if
you want to switch technologies in
between so I have there's the h2
database one I need to change my
repository a bit because we can't find
new forge anymore and in this case we
can just extend jp-8 repository there we
go so this is actually quite nice
because it figured out the dependency
change all by itself something is wrong
when I can't see what this one needs to
leave by by and the long is okay but we
need different annotations we need the
JPA version of it that we need also a
generated value but then the JPA version
of it and we also need to annotate the
class with entity entity there we go
so what's wrong now imports again be
gone there we go
so let's run the bear test and see if
this works
and while I run it let's do the second
version of the floating session because
I also need a few other requirements
from you guys this is the second one so
the mechanism will be exactly the same
but the game pin will be a bit different
now you can use your old nickname if you
want or you can use Star Trek nicknames
if you want to annoy me it's also okay
because I'm not let's face it I'm not
really going to do anything about it
now while you are assembling yourself in
the lobby I'll try to see what happened
to the test
we built this is great the test has
succeeded and it's because we use this
in memory h2 database and what has the
test actually performed it has created a
new beer with a name this is one of the
most famous beer in the world it's from
Belgium it's very hard to get if you
want a bottle come see me afterwards no
problem I'll get it done for you and
which is a quadrupole which is very
heavy beer 12% alcohol it saves it to
the repository which saves us to the h2
database and after that we can you will
find oh this is a bit ugly we don't need
a collection we can actually use a list
which is a bit better I think poor list
this is a bit better and it serves that
there's one beer in the database so
let's round again because I changed a
few things I don't think it will fill
anyway so let's get to there to the
lobby yes I see yeah like you like do
yes great thank you Yoda let's start up
the session 35 players so depending on
the answers you give three or two more
questions first one is what architecture
should our implement shall we use a
single page application with rest
controllers and angular and angular
front-end or she will use a spring web
application with so spring MVC actually
with web controllers and a templating
engine if you're choosing the blue
option you know the blue pill speaking
of great movies we also have a question
to choose a templating engine we're
going to use and the results tell me
that we don't need that question because
we're doing rest single page application
so this means I'm going to skip this
question because we don't need a
separate templating framework skip this
one and the only thing I need to know is
what web server are we using
again the image doesn't have anything to
do with the answer you should provide
just vote according to your own
preference speech I can put up three
pictures right
there's only place for one so that's why
it's right there
time's up and the answer has been
Tomcats okay thank you guys for folding
this means I can continue developing my
application in ten minutes so I hope
I'll manage
okay so we have chosen to create a
single page application in order to do
that we need to add a dependency which
is the rest the rest dependency start
our data rest data rest there we go I
don't care about your spaces there we go
and it will get the dependencies needed
for rest now we need you know if we were
building a big spring application we
would create a service right now and an
controller this is a very small one so
I'm just creating a controller it will
actually just be a few one-liners I
guess so if you're building a bit one
big one please build a service layer but
I'm not going to do it this time we'll
annotate this one with the rest
controller also we need a mapping
request mapping and it will be I like to
prefix my register for example beer but
you can of course choose your own and
now I will be hosting the angler
front-end on a different port on
localhost in production you can just
export your angular project and in a
mini fied way included in your spring
with the resources folder but just to be
a bit more rapid our host both are low
cost which means we need a cross origin
annotation to be able to tell spring
that requests from another port are fine
just for this demo right
and the angular front end will run at 42
M 100 so that's why it's there we need
to also wire our B ripples through here
like that and then we need a method to
get all the beers so we'll put this on
in the get method and tell and create a
method that returns a list of beers
this just one TVs list of bears based
beers and it will just return very plus
three dot find oh just import please
there we go I'll start up the angular
front end which is uh it's a closeness
know by right which is a bit more down
the road I guess
so now I'm telling the angular2 project
to open up you know if we if I would
have a bit more time I would show you
the angular code it's just very basic
some very basic views and this is not
talk about angular angular 4 so I'll put
it up and github afterwards and you can
see it for yourself this is working to
to open the application in the meantime
I can add a few more operations because
also we would need to delete bears if we
really want to be able to work with it
so let's create a delete methods method
here sorry what in the reactive way you
know if I had a bit more time I could do
that
but I need to finish this one in 8
minutes so it's okay if I post it up
afterwards ok top is that ok or I can
show you you know during the break or
something yeah so you come see me
afterwards ok when we are doing a
deletion we need to have the idea of the
the ID of the bear that we are deleting
which can just be sent using a request
parameter so there it is and we can just
tell the be a repost 3 to delete by ID
also we need to be able to add new bears
so I'll tie this to the post HTTP HTTP
method which is avoid says add beer and
in this case you hope the whole beer is
sent via the post method so it's in the
request body so let's use the request
body annotation
and in this case we just can save it
directly because
JPA will generate a new ID for us like
that and actually the Edit beer method
isn't so different because it also need
just needs to save it so we need to tie
this in this case to the boot method
let's call it Edit beer and actually the
implementation can be quite the same
I'll call it update beer anyway there we
go just need to create a run
configuration so let's add one a greater
one let's call it good run because
that's the great old sauce that will
create a jar file and run it this is the
project that we're using right now so
this project and let's call it boot run
let's run it in the meantime our angular
front-end has started up now I've worked
countless hours to get this into a very
beautiful slicker interface user
interface I consulted a few user
interaction experience experts and my
wife and kids haven't see me for two
weeks and this is the result so please
tell me it's beautiful yeah it's great
right yeah I'm a back-end developer you
can you can tell right yeah yeah so
let's see if we have started up we have
we have and actually the default web
server is Tomcat so if you would choose
under tower jetty I could just add an
exception to the dependency list in the
build cradle script well in this case
it's already its own good so that saves
saves us some time because this is Ana
memory database everything was erased
from the database so let's add some
beers also this user interface really
you know I'm crying inside when I see it
it's so beautiful yeah so we need some
test data also Musa
and steagle design order 9 what's this
good is beer good this rooster liked his
beer mooses I'm still design 9 what's a
good option beer guys you ready go
Pilsner boot or claw from czech Pilsner
Urquell i've had this one a few times
from Pilsen right I guess it's like 5%
or something oh let's end it it's been
added to the list so that means that ads
has worked correctly can I add a
favorite of mine I'm from the
Netherlands and one of the best beers in
the Netherlands is called a drop and the
trip was ok oh you can see I've typed
this before right yeah that's what I do
with my spare time just at some beers
tell my own beer application which is a
Belgian Tripel and it's typically around
9% or something so ok I'm steagle lose
this iced tea cosine a sine a cosine
which is a lager
I guess 4.9 now let's add a beer that is
not really a beer at all this is the
worst beer for my country do you know it
Oh Oh III really
I suspect the factory people should just
just dip these bottles in the water of
the nearby pool you know and just sell
it like that it's awesome so this is not
really a real beer so let's delete it
quickly there you go
it's gone so for you for all the guys
who thinking or the girls who are
thinking this is just a front end demo
it isn't because if I do some things
like this Steagall is not 4.9 but for
per date it will actually send a request
with with the headers in it if I select
the right request right this is the put
1 so I need to
all right Kayla yeah here it is to
actually send something and so we have
we have I have shown add and edit and
delete all so I guess it's really
functioning that well right okay well I
did manage so let's wrap it up quickly
because I'm running out of time right
now I'm going to skip this light but if
you want to define your own query string
data is a great support for custom
queries you can do it in a query
annotation or also in one of the
supported query methods that are also
implemented at the wrong time you can
just define an interface method so visit
this link for more info you can just
define a message like this type a name
container in our case and spring boot so
these names are quite meaningful you
need to provide them in the exact same
order and if we would have had more time
I would implement this one to implement
a search function that just that can
also work with a partial name so maybe
the next time wrap up in questions so
spring boot gets you up and running
fairly quickly and it assumes standard
configurations for rapid development
which is the reason why I was able to
create the application in like 25
minutes or so and it plays nice with a
wide range of frameworks as you have
seen actually it's up to the top no
matter what choices you make and you can
even switch technologies halfway through
your talk if you want what if I prefer
Java EE or sorry I need to call it
Jakarta ee I promise to get back on this
point well at least you can use embedded
servers because both well slice form and
tell me embedded are implementations of
web servers that allow you to run a jar
file with an embedded web server just
Java - jar and provides your jar file
and it will start up and also if you
want quick assembly like with the very
small application cloth in the Jakarta
EE world there has been an interesting
blog post on tables shrink wrap so if
you're into that you should definitely
need to check it out
well I'm afraid time's up so if you have
any questions come come
me after talk or I'll be here for the
most of the day so just just talk to me
and if you just can't get enough I'll
post the slides on my webpage which is
right here or you can just follow me on
Twitter thanks for sticking with me and
thanks for your attention please</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
