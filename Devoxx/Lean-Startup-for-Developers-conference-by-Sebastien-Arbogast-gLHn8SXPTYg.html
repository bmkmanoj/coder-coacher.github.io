wake you up they're almost the last
session so welcome everybody let me
switch to the big screen here you are so
what God welcome to this talk about lean
startup I'm really glad to be here but
before we start I just want to know a
little bit about you people so in the
room by show of hands how many of you
are not developers okay that's what I
thought so we're all in couple there
okay how many of you thought of creating
your own startup one day okay you're in
the right room that's cool almost yeah
seventy-five percent how many of you and
went through and did create a start-up
quite a few about it 10 something like
that okay how many of you are still
working in your own startup okay you
haven't tried too hard and how many of
you are working in a start right now
even though it's not something you
created yourself okay about 10 or 15 how
many of you are already familiar with
lean setup okay i hope i won't bore you
too much and how many of you have
already fell upon me saying the word
start up already okay you're going to
hear that a lot i'm sorry a few words
about myself i'm a been a Java developer
for about 10 years now iOS developer
five years I really love agile
methodologies scrum Kanban you name it
I've been a freelancer for five years
and actually practicing Lean Startup
methodology and techniques for about
four years or so it all started with co
desk just a little bit of story in 2011
but see baiting the first startup
weekend in Brussels the very first one
actually not really willingly a friend
of mine pushed me so yeah we should have
fun ok 54 our
what can you do in 54 hours for those
who don't know startup weekend starts on
Friday night ends on Sunday night and
you're supposed to create a start-up in
two days of course because why not so I
went there not really knowing what I
wanted to do just a couple of days
before I said all these side projects I
already have their too complex for two
days I'm just going to come up with a
stupid idea and I did and I pitched it
and it worked we gather the team after
two days I thought okay we're going to
pitch it and then I'm going to go home
and sleep for a week and actually yeah
it worked we when we won the startup
weekend and so that's the first thing
that came out of that the second thing
is that it was my first contact with
Lean Startup techniques and it really
woke me up so I hope it will do the same
to you even though we only have one hour
and not 54 I've going to start up coach
also for nest up so with all those
experiences of the lean startup and so
on I co-created the nest up startup
accelerator acceleration program in
Nyala van a nerve in the pub on well oh
and I've coached a couple of start-up in
that program including the one where i'm
currently working now even if it was two
and a half years ago so i'm now VP of
engineering for take it easy the fastest
growing startup in Belgium my team is
over there special kudos and by the way
guys we are hiring so if you're looking
for great new opportunities please come
to me at the end so why would you create
your own startup I think that's the
first question that we should ask
ourselves first reason I hear a lot it's
cool to be an entrepreneur right means
good for the ladies there's some money
to be made obviously you're reading y
combinator I mean hacker news and all
those Tech Crunch sites all the time and
you get to use all these cool words like
MVP Peter laying that's nice angels you
know magic guys anyway so that's cool
right
well truth is looks a little more like
that you get all the sleepless nice the
nightmares not thinking about anything
else actually feeling guilty when you do
anything else this is an interesting
experience another reason why you want
you might want to do it is because you
have this unique million-dollar idea
that you might want to protect with an
NDA that's the lean version of an NDA by
the way thank you David so yeah it's
unique you want to keep it secret and
you're afraid that if somebody with more
financial means steals your idea they're
going to do it instead of you and well
I'm here to tell you something really
true really rude there is no such thing
as a million-dollar idea if an idea is
original chances are it's either a bad
idea or it's ahead of its time and by a
lot so might not be really good idea and
if it's a good idea most chances are
somebody already had it and a lot of
people are already working on it so yeah
good original ideas forget about it you
have plenty to lose actually not to talk
about your ideas that's something I
always try to explain to people come to
me trying to pitch an idea but getting
me to sign an NDA first yeah that's not
the the best the best way to get some
good feedback so another reason why you
want might want to create your own
startup you want to be your own boss you
read all the biographies of this guy you
think yeah I want to yell at people too
I want to get them to do my bidding
instead of the other way Wow and of
course your creativity will do the rest
I mean managing a team cannot be that
hard right you're already managed
projects well truth is like the wise man
said power comes with responsibility
managing people is really really hard
it's not just managing a project and you
can especially when you found when you
create your own startup i can tell you
can feel the pressure
from all sides not just from the inside
loss if also from the outside so it's
really tough job another reason your
product will be so much better right I
mean you've seen so many crappy i call
them golf where products because their
sign on golf courses and not with real
people anyway and yeah of course your
user interface design will be so much
better you have all these ideas for
these cool features that you're going to
put in there and of course the more
features the more people will want to
pay for it right mmm if you're an agile
developer you know that's not true so
the cool the really interesting thing
here is not to think just in terms of of
product but also in terms of business
model okay yeah I've done that a couple
of times this week so yeah I think in
terms of business model and try to be
creative in terms of how the how you
make money instead of just products and
that's where the real innovation comes
from sorry I was late by a slide another
reason you heard somebody tell you that
they have a problem by the way this is a
bad joke is just because in French there
is this expression of telephone Arab the
arc phone and this is a is a friend of
mine so I'm allowed anyway now if it's
just if you just heard of some rumors of
some special population as far away from
you two had some problems and you know
how to solve it might not be the best
option because you don't sorry you don't
know anything about the existing
solutions to that problem you don't know
anything that specific business and it's
not your own problem so in terms of
motivation in terms of yeah keeping and
going on a long term it's really a tough
job so usually the advice we try to give
is try to scratch your own itch solve
your own problems you will see there are
plenty of advantages and and you really
want to solve it and it it's something
that you wake up at night thinking about
so that's a good thing another reason
and I think this will talk
you more are you tired of being a
consultant think you sell your soul you
do things that you're not proud of and
don't do willingly you go back home
every night feeling dirty well anyway if
that's your case you might think that
you're being exploited well just one
word of warning beware of the pimps okay
I look by the way who was already there
on Tuesday afternoon for the university
talk because I'm doing the same jokes
all over again so anyway sorry so Bureau
of the pimps they are not the same but
sometimes investors have different
agendas they have different objectives
and it might not be that will align with
yours so it's a it's also another kind
of pressure another reason you might
already be obsessed about building
products building it right with the
right materials the right technology the
right tools of course well and you yeah
you want to do something cool something
really beautiful the problem is in a
start-up your product sometimes look
like that and this is version 2 by the
way there's a roof and something to do
push-ups and so on yeah because reality
catches on and you have you don't have
the same the right budget from the start
you can do it right from the get-go and
yeah it just needs to last long enough
until maybe the rates are out of funding
or the next big milestone in your
business so if that's what you want to
do I mean the previous one is that's
what you want to do I'm just telling you
a start-up is a very specific kind of
business it's a it's a fast-growing
business and has all sorts of side
effects if you are passionate about
building products maybe a start-up model
is not the most adapted you can build a
lifestyle business out of a software
product and still be very happy about
it's just that you won't
10 times every year another reason
you've got the skills right you know how
to code you can fire up your IntelliJ
environment tomorrow and start coding
and boom in a matter of days sorry weeks
or eight months you have product right
well after all the main part of a tech
startup is the tech well that's not the
only one usually entrepreneur investors
are really really interested at teams
that have more than one father first I
mean mono founder startups are really
rare I think there's Dropbox in in the
well-known examples the guy was a is a
well-known developer but apart from that
they usually prefer to have more than
one and especially those three very
complementary profiles are really hard
to find in one person the tech guy the
design guy and the sales guy okay so
might be a good idea to surround
yourself to find some co-founders or to
learn real fast another reason you might
want to use your favorite technologies
and build this cool carpet you've always
dreamt off and yeah you want to learn
about them on a real project you've
always been frustrated that your
customer your employer didn't want them
to use do you want you to use them and
you have this idea for really cool
desert design just a little story about
that this is well it used to be a shiny
new building in the engineering school
where I was in France ten years ago and
and the they were really proud of it I
mean they had it designed by a boat
architect and and boot architect
designed his crew building thinking okay
there's going to be brand new campus
there's going to be this building there
this other building here and it turns
out that the other buildings didn't get
the budget so this one was right in the
middle of a ground that was going in all
directions and the boat started to sink
and you could really literally find
buckets of
in the in the hallways because the
ceiling was flooding so that's just an
illustration of overkill design and it's
really important to think about that to
be pragmatic how many of you have at
least one pet projects side projects in
their own yeah usually there than what
the same ones as those who want to
create a startup that's a good time
anyway so you have those projects on the
side you never finish them sometimes you
lose motivation you switch to something
else by new technology brand new idea
whatever you have several of those and
you really want to turn at least one of
them into a real business and move
forward with it well don't forget that
you will have to stick with it that
means that at some point if you create a
startup you will have to make choices to
say no to all these other shiny new
things that you would like to try and
this is tough believe me I've been there
another reason you might want to improve
everyone's life I mean who doesn't want
to end Wars and make the world a happy
place well when you think about it the
Facebook's of this world I've changed
everyone's life and this is a cool idea
to think in those terms you want to heal
the world and poverty whatever well the
truth is all these world-changing
startup that effects pretty much
everyone on earth they all started with
a niche they all started with a very
small community in which they could
validate some ideas some hypothesis and
and then grew from there and most of the
time didn't even know what the ultimate
model would be so it's also interesting
to think about I mean Facebook was only
targeted at frustrated Harvard students
male ones first Airbnb was just for a
conference attendees in San Francisco
very small niche and they only grew from
there another reason market research
shows you the way there's money to be
made there and of course you're the
first one to read this gartner report
right it's so expensive nobody can
afford that anyway so chances are plenty
of other people who have already read
that market research and you always have
to ask okay who came and commandeered
this dude this study where this the
sample looked like it's always very very
tricky to use those figures so don't
forget that in terms of market research
and so on quality times quantity
especially when you're exploring new
markets and not just you know trying to
see okay there's is it a good place
there to start to start my fast food
restaurant or something now it's more
than that if you want to explore a new
market quality Trump's quantity so a
couple of good reasons to do it you want
to invest in yourself that's a good way
and its really an investment because I
can tell you creating your own startup
will eat some of your own money and
probably some of your families and
friends as well if you want to go that
way and a lot of startups have to so of
course it costs some money because some
time but it's a unique investment in
yourself and whatever happens even if it
fails then you will have learned a lot
and that's a good thing and not just
technically I mean people management
business management there are a lot of
things to learn another good reason you
might be obsessed to find your own
solutions and I really see I'm really
and fassa emphasize find because it's
not just okay I already have some
solution ideas that i want to put
forward no it's really looking forward
searching asking people around trying to
find a solution for you the process has
to be more important than the end
because otherwise you will always cut
short and you will have surprises
another good reason you have unique
opportunity and unique expertise that
place you in a really really good
position to solve a particular kind of
problems okay if you don't have that it
a bad sign for you I mean that's what
make you unique and that's what we call
the founder market fit somehow it's just
to make sure that you are the right
person to do it if you want to grow as a
human being that's also very good reason
because I can tell you that creating a
start-up whatever happens is he is a
really an energetic path you learn a lot
about yourself about your limits you
push the boundaries of what you think
you can do and it really makes you move
forward in life much faster and of
course you're tired of hearing people
complaining and you're not like that you
want to be a part of the solution you
want to propose your own solution it's a
matter of pride for yourself that's a
good thing last without least you might
have met some interesting people over
the years some people you'd like to work
with you trust deeply and you want to to
work with them instead of being sort of
sort of imposed the guys that that your
employer wants you to work with or
something like that and this startup is
a good way to do that because I mean the
team is really much more important than
the idea and if the team is already
solid and the people trust each other
and they have automatic ways of
communicating of collaborating it's
always a good thing okay so a few
reasons why you would not do it I think
the most famous and the one that I hear
the most is the golden cage excuse i
already have my company car i already
have my life insurance i gasps guard my
i mean i already have all those all
discomfort and this is really hard to
quit and you're right it is and that's
why they give it to you like you stick
there as long as possible I mean you're
not paid an incredible amount but you
have all these little advantages for you
and your family are really reactive and
in startups you have all sorts of other
perks like for example stock options
that are very rare in big companies
but those are really hard to value
because it's just a bet on the future
and of course you get to learn a lot of
stuff and you get to meet a lot of
interesting people and so on but once
again you cannot pay your bills with
business cards so doesn't really work
and after all your comfort zone is
comfortable so that's interesting reason
not to hide under the carpet it's real
another reason that we hold you back is
you don't have enough money set aside as
I said creating a start-up before you
can even raise any funding costs a lot
of your own money and if you don't have
what they call bootstrap money which is
enough money to go to the first round of
funding or to the first I mean revenues
that can sustain your activity then yeah
you need some money to buy you a few
weeks few months well we'll see that
it's a little less complicated and used
to be actually it has never cost less to
create a start-up than now with all the
AWS hosting and all the software service
products that you can find online that
can really help you at the beginning and
actually having too much money on the on
the side it's kind of a devil and these
guys because having very few money
forces you to be creative forces you to
be lean forces you to be efficient and
yeah that's also something to consider
maybe you think you missed some business
skills and I won't tell you otherwise
business kids are important two things
to consider one being a developer and
learning business if that's what you're
interested in is actually easier than
the other way around it's not to say
that business skills are easier it's
just that the learning curve is shorter
and then the rest is experience of
course the other thing is if you are not
interested in learning business skills
of course you can surround yourself of
course you you
are in a better position if you have a
co-founder that has those business kids
even big plus if you can trust him of
course you need to pay the bills and of
and as I said shares in a start-up are
neither are not an easy way to pay your
rent so you need more than that and you
need at least a little bit about a
little amount of money to pay for just
your food and shelter and if you have a
family if you have some kids it's even
more responsibilities that are on you
and it's really scary to to cut back on
on the regular salary for that maybe you
don't have enough time and once again
yes indeed creating a start-up takes
time interesting fact is that usually I
hear a lot of people saying okay today I
do it on nights and weekends once I quit
my job to create my style at full time I
have more leisure time and nights and
weekends and doesn't work that way so if
you don't have enough time now don't
expect to have more time tomorrow for
yourself I don't know what's the average
age in the room but sometimes people
think okay this is not for me I'm too
old for this shit it's just for students
20-somethings college dropouts they have
the idealism they have the unconscious
to do it and and yeah it's just for them
not for me while the truth is when you
are a little more than twenty something
you also have experience you also have a
big adresse book you also have
real-world knowledge of how the world
works and how people interact and all
that and this is really important as
well so don't let yourself down because
you just think that this is for
youngsters your ideas are not good
enough as I said and I will repeat it
several times during this presentation
ideas are worthless okay so forget about
this million-dollar idea myth
that's still going around even after
the.com bubble and all that's happened
over the years it's wrong don't focus
too much on the idea I'll show you why
later another reason you are in Belgium
I mean how many Belgian people do we
have in the room yeah quite a few maybe
you are in France I don't know well we
all think that of course the mecca for
entrepreneurs especially I mean software
entrepreneurs is the Silicon Valley
right and I've been there a couple of
times it's true it's really amazing but
it has some drawbacks as well when you
have all this money available once again
it's really hard to be creative and to
think of real problems also those are
first world problems okay so chances are
if you find something that works it
might only work in the Silicon Valley or
in very specific populations and in the
system that is even worse than that
because you have this resonance effect
of all those people working on photo
sharing and all that and you're all
thing that you since you're doing the
same thing it must be right the good
idea right well of course it's not
something that you will find here in
Europe in Belgium in France whatever
probably the reason I hear the most
that's holding people back from creating
their own startup is what happens if I
fail and this is a key element in our
culture this is something that's really
hard to change I always say that okay of
course you have more money in the
Silicon Valley but that's not the
primary reason why it seems easier to
start there then then here it's because
people are just less scared of failing
and actually failure is valued it
doesn't mean that you have to aim for
failure but yeah fail fast fail often
fail small learn out of it and you will
see that it's very it has some
high-value now of course here you have
all these worries about okay well like
what will I write on my resume between k
2012 and two
14 I was creating my startup but now
there's a blank here I don't want to
talk about it i'm not not proud of it
don't be don't be scared of that this
has some value and more and more people
understand it so your software software
developers right so why i think you are
uniquely positioned to create your own
startup first you've got the power sorry
oops you've got the power to execute ok
this is really key as I said ideas are
worthless yet another one and the reason
for that is because execution is what
matters execution is of course how you
implement your idea it's not just about
the technical aspects but also the
strategy the products vision and all
that and when you are a software
developer you already know a lot about
that and this is really hard to find
this is hot really hard to reproduce
this is really hard copy so you are in a
very good position either to create your
own startup or to join an existing
startup because of course there are
plenty of interesting setups out there
who are looking for this kind of profile
that's good for you another thing how
many of you have already worked with
scrum or agile methodologies that's what
I thought a lot and this will help you a
great deal with startups of course with
Lean Startup because it's inspired by
the same principles and the same
philosophy but not just that just
because of the philosophy behind it that
forces you to be to be to be efficient
to be lean okay to avoid waste to
eliminate waste that's good for you
usually a software developers you are
surrounded by problems you see them all
over the place okay you are in the
center of them and you are in the habit
of putting them off and that's also
something that you will do a lot in
startups believe me of course you we all
want not not to create them not to light
those fires but
sometimes hard to avoid one of the
reasons I I mean one of the reasons why
it's really interesting as a software
developer is control contrary to this
guy you can go back if it doesn't work
if something fails if for some reason
you run out of money either your own or
somebody else's well you can always go
back to freelancing and fill up the
tanks again okay I've done that a couple
of times actually it works really well
and that's not something that I don't
know sales guy or project manager or
even a designer as an easy time doing so
that works for you so enough about the
reasons but about the psychology behind
creating startup let's move on to the
real deal that is how to create a
start-up and the way I wanted to do it
is just to show you the usual way to
create a start-up is the one that comes
to mind and actually the one that was
holding me back five years ago when I
wanted to create my first startup and
the position with what Lean Startup
suggests and that really works so
traditionally you might think that the
first step is to study the market right
to know if there is some potential for
the idea that you have especially in a
special in specific population or in a
specific place so you start designing
some questionnaires give out surveys
maybe interrupt people in the street
like do you have some time to answer a
few questions and then people know I've
always busy I mean admit it's you always
do that right we always have something
more important to say then to do then to
answer surveys so another source of
information is surveys that other people
have already done market studies market
reports okay but they're usually very
expensive and they are not updated that
often because they cost a lot of money
to
make and the problem with all those
approaches is that your approach is
quantitative only which is good when
you're trying to validate again an
existing business model and you just
want to validate some strong knowledge
that you already have just to reassure
yourself and your banker and your
accountant that's yeah it makes total
sense but when you're exploring new
markets when you're exploring a new
business idea and you don't know yet
what's going to work this is a really
poor approach and as I said all those
approaches take my time and money they
are only valid if you want to validate
the strong hypothesis and the problem
with the fact that they take time and
money is that the iteration cycle is
very long designing a questionnaire
putting out the survey treating the
results creating some nice pie charts
and diagrams and graphs this takes from
a few months yeah usually a few weeks to
a few months at least and if you learn
that you're completely off the road on
some aspects then you have to restart
and redo the surveys it takes an awful
lot about an awful lot of time and
usually the problem with those surveys
especially when you design them yourself
you tend to try to confirm what you
think you already know so you ask the
questions in just the right way to
validate what you already think so can
you really trust those figures the way
we avoid all those pitfalls and lean
startup is by doing customer interviews
I mean that's one of the main techniques
anyway one of those that work the best
and also one of those that is the
hardest to implement for us software
developers because without making a
general rule usually we're introverts we
don't like to you prefer talking to
machines than two people right admit it
okay anyway
but yeah it's really it's it's much
harder for for us to interview people
but believe me is just a yeah a habit to
get into and once you are there it's
much easier so how do you do that well
first good idea is to brainstorm all the
possible customer segments okay that's
the first thing to find customers forget
about your shiny new ideas put it on a
shelf maybe you will get to use it later
focus on the customers first okay so
brainstorm all the possible customer
segments and the segment's word here is
really really important your customer
segment is not the world earth no it's
it's got to be more specific than that
especially when you start you gotta
start with a community that is that
gives you some valuable feedback let's
give you gives you some qualitative
feedback that's the most important thing
that you're looking for so once you've
brainstormed all the possible customer
segments just choose three based on your
gut feeling that's the moment where you
get to practice your instincts you got
to start somewhere okay it's really
important in lean startup it's a it's
essentially a scientific very very
experimental method and in any
experimentation it's really dangerous to
mix the experiments because then
treating the results and and
understanding what works and what
doesn't is really really hard so try to
separate things start somewhere so why
not choose three with your guts we're
talking more in details afterwards about
what a business Candace is but basically
that's just a short version of your
business plan okay and it's really
important to for those three first
customer segments that you've chosen to
try and think in terms of okay who are
these people what are their problems
what others so what are the solutions I
could propose to them how can i make
money with them this is really important
okay so that's the thirst
in general process of course this is not
to take by the letter it's just a
general process that you can keep in
mind another thing that's important
don't think too much in terms of market
size try to sort those three options by
pain level first market size comes at
the end okay so usually the best order
is pain level is of reach the price that
they are ready to pay for a solution to
you to the problem and the market size
only at the end usually when I when I
need to do that I just take out my excel
CTA X and again and draft a quick mate
matrix add some weights here and there
give a score too every to each of the
three targets and then I get to choose
the first one I'm going to work with
okay it's not very scientific but it's
just to start so take the first one and
list your ipod leases okay at this stage
you want to list especially the IPCC's
related to who the customer is okay with
which their habits which who they are
what they do and and the other thing is
what their problems are okay at this
stage this is all that matters customer
and problem don't know need to go
further than that and that's where the
hard part comes in because all that was
just you with your co-founders in a room
on a whiteboard very nice now you get to
get out of the building and meet real
people this is really important try to
focus on people of course who correspond
to the market the customer segments that
you have identified and ask real
questions for all the customer segments
validation questions you can ask some
straightforward questions like okay how
old are you what do you do in life do
you have kids all those criterias can be
really fast and easy to validate for all
the questions about problems okay
validating problems these need to be
open-ended questions no I'm sure you
have this problem right now what are
your problems really
too blah blah and then you listen the
listening part is really important and
when I say listen it's not just in here
with your ears it's also with your eyes
look at the nonverbal aspects this is
really important once you've done that
with 10 people that's the rule of thumb
but it's a good number to avoid you know
errors specific errors and and at the
same time it's more efficient that way
but that's the moment when you adapt you
change a few things you pivot that's it
we said the p-word knowing that pivoting
doesn't mean changing everything we hear
that a lot okay yeah yesterday I was
doing a website for to put in touch
people with dogs with old ladies and
today I'm selling refrigerators this is
not a pivot ok this is the bet the best
way to spin around and get DZ this is
not what you do so usually a pivot is
okay I thought that this customer had
this problem I'm going to stay with this
customer but I'm going to pivot on the
problem okay this is the kind of thing
as you and you go again until you get a
good understanding of you who your
customer is and you've got a real
problem okay this is really important so
in a traditional method in traditional
way of creating a business after you get
your market study and you get your
research and your numbers and so on the
next step usually is the infamous
business plan right usually 50 hundred
page document with plenty of figures and
big plans on three years we're going to
do that we're going to take over the
world well takes time to write again so
if it takes time to Ralph has a long
interation cycle so if you want to
update it if you want to change it and
believe me everything will change that's
a start up we're talking about so yeah
it's very cumbersome to update usually
it's something that you write once you
put it on the chef and stay there or
maybe you put it in your toilet so that
you can read it when you're bored I
don't know that's pretty much it
and besides who will read it in that
must ring a bell to all the guys doing
agile because they were frustrated by
waterfall right it's like useless
documentation that's just a waste okay
and the truth is very few investors
actually read those business plans they
just want to know that you've done it
and they redo introduction the
conclusion and say okay that's nice and
usually it goes to the bin right after
one and yeah usually in those documents
you include some three-year projections
to really reassure the investors and
show that kind of growth okay and of
course there's nothing nothing can go
wrong at the bottom part of the curve
right no way to go dim down and of
course investors have seen that tens
hundreds of times they know about that
you won't bullshit them like that it
won't work so alternative to this
business plan technique in the lean
startup we prefer to use this this I
mean again just to make it parallel with
what you might already know with the
agile methodologies is not much more
than the information radiator okay this
is a board you're encouraged to display
it somewhere visible you've guessed it
you will get to use all those 3m squares
again post-it notes yay with plenty of
colors and sand and so on and they this
kind of canvas really sums up all the
different aspects of a business plan
basically of a business model but in a
much more digestible and much more
efficient way and of course also much
more easy to update and that's the key
okay so we're going to go quickly over
all of these boxes because they are all
very important and they are also all
important to take into account in
specific order usually by the way this
is a lean canvas something it's just one
variant of the
kind of exercise something coined by ash
maria i really encourage you to go to by
running Lane book it's an excellent one
and he has a blog with plenty of advice
and this for me this is the the canvas
that is most adapted to the kind of
products we're talking about here
software products okay if you are
creating a hardware startup if you're
creating a drug startup for example this
is a completely different kind of
business and usually calls for different
kind of tools to model the business
model so what are the important parts of
these candidates the first one to focus
on as I said is the customer segments
part by the way this is really important
on the right you get all the customer
things on the left you get all the
problem things and in the middle you
have the solution customer problem
solution that's the key three things
that you need to figure out okay so yeah
usually for customer segments what we
tend to try to do is use customer
personas it's just a way to think of
things that are important in the
customers that you think about so give
them a name can be a good idea just to
refer to your customer easily think of
the behaviors ok what does she do all
day think of her a typical day when does
she go to work does she have to care
about this is really important of course
try to focus on what's relevant for you
ok but on the other hand not don't focus
too much because otherwise you might
miss some opportunities on the sidelines
so this is really important what our
needs where does she expect in life
sorry ok where our goals and a few facts
ok how old is he I mean is it a she or
he all those aspects can be important
and can really give you some important
information once again think about
specific customer segments we're not
talking about the world here we're just
trying to find the ideal
the community that can get you started
and then from then on you will get to
evolve that to broaden the scope of your
customer segments but start with
something small and easy to reach once
you have that try to think of the three
most pressing problems for this specific
population okay that's usually what
differs the most from one population to
the other at first you might think that
your customers is I don't know lawyers
for example all the lawyers and then you
realize by doing the customers customer
segmentation exercise that well actually
there's it can be some difference
between established lawyers and just
graduate lawyers or between independent
ones and employees I don't know there
can be plenty of things that differ and
usually it starts with the problems if
you think of different populations
chances are they will have different
problems another interesting aspects in
that reflection is the existing
alternatives okay try to think of how
those people solve their problems those
three problems right now it can be
another software product it can be a
competitor of yours or it can be just I
don't know a stepmum a phone an email
and mailing list a newsletter whatever
it can be something very not software
like even so think of all the
alternatives why is it important for two
reasons first it will help you to
position yourself in terms of marketing
okay today you use an excel file to do
that tomorrow I will propose your better
solution and also helps you to position
yourself in terms of pricing because if
it takes them three hours to do it and
you make them pay I don't know ten euros
to do the same thing but in five minutes
then you get something up going okay
third aspect in order is the unique
value proposition one way to put it is
just this is the first sentence that
appears in big letters on your website
okay the first day you want to sell it
this is the message that you want to go
through
this is the sentence by which a person
coming to your website will decide if
it's for them or not this is really hard
to craft this can take some time okay
another way to think about it is the x4
why technique or okay this is very
trendy right now the embers for
something you know the Airbnb is for
dogs and all that plenty of those is but
once again don't put that too much
forward in your external communication
this is just a way for you to think
about your business model onto presented
to some people so that they make the
connection with something they already
know next element now that you have a
unique value proposition how will you
implement this unique value proposition
to solve the problems on the left okay
usually that's the moment when you start
to think in terms of features as few
features as possible just for the
problems that you have identified and
validated next element the channels by
channels I don't just need marketing
channels just how you going to make
people aware of your solution our you're
going to reach out to them how are you
going to distribute support your
customers these are some really
interesting aspects because they will
have an important impact on your cost
structure then it's time to it's time to
start thinking in terms of revenues and
this is where you can get creative too
ok don't think in terms of okay like any
other solution are just going to make my
users pay as a monthly or yearly
subscription or the freemium model the
magic word I know there are some more
creative ways to do business ok one
example that I like is this idea that
a company can buy invoices from people
who need money now and sell it to people
who have some money to pay it later I
mean this is what I call creative
business model the product itself is as
easy as possible but the business model
are really creative and it makes a lot
of sense financially then focus on your
costs ok make a difference between your
fixed and your valuable cost of course
there the human cost is usually the
biggest now it used to be that the
server's was a big concern now not so
much so that's think of all the costs
that are incurred by all the the boxes
that you've already filled and it might
be time at this point to start thinking
of how many customers you might need to
offset your costs how many of those are
no subscriptions or one-time payment on
the right you might need to to offset
the cost on left this is a very easy way
to see if your business model is somehow
viable of course any experiment needs a
way to measure its success you need real
metrics by metrics I don't mean vanity
metrics registered users is not going to
get you anywhere except all these
registered users have to pay somehow but
if it's just yeah probably people coming
to my site to my site and adding a
record in my database that's not going
to do you any good ok so these are some
real metrics that measure the success of
your business model especially the
really interesting aspect here is first
of all the marketing metrics so I really
encourage you to google pirate metrics
there are some good element of
inspiration in there and also what I
call the problem metrics so people have
problems either they spend too much time
or they spend too much money or they
spend too much energy doing something
how can you measure that and the
decrease in all that that you that your
solution brings to the customers
last but not least probably the hardest
box to fill especially at the beginning
it's the unfair advantage by unfair
advantage I mean something that can be
that cannot be easily copied or bought
ok so maybe it's a patent but usually
software patents in Europe another thing
so maybe it's some unique expertise that
you have some market knowledge that you
have some unique network industry
knowledge this is the kind of thing that
you put there usually takes time to
build that sort of unfair advantage so
don't be too worried if you don't feel
last that box at first really important
aspects about this at the beginning
those are all assumption all assumptions
okay you know nothing Jon Snow so start
with that feeling humility you don't
know anything so all of that are just I
/ thesis that you need somehow to
validate to experiment next step after
you get your business plan / business
canvas the prototype that's what we are
all as software developers that's what
we are all eager to start working on
right so you start guessing what people
are going to need because come on of
course you know you guess what they are
familiar with the kind of interface that
the interfaces that are already use of
course you include as many features as
you possibly can in a given amount of
time even though you know that very few
of those features will actually be used
right because you like to waste your
time lot of wasted time and effort an
important thing with all that with
building your prototype do not consider
that as free effort it's not because you
can do it yourself it's not because you
are a developer and after all well it
doesn't cost you a dime to do it that it
doesn't cost you a dime to do it because
actually that's an opportunity cost the
time that you spend building your
prototype it's time that you won't spare
on something else and buy something else
I don't just mean another project they
also mean another aspect of your project
the business part the marketing part
okay the growth part the fundraising
part which usually takes a lot of time
so this is not free effort try to value
it to try to put a figure on that this
is really important and then of course
when you're building a prototype when do
you stop right seems like there's always
something that you can improve some
small features that you can tweak some
button that's not the right color and
it's funny because the more you go the
more you approach a stage where you can
actually show something the more details
you find it's like you're afraid to show
it or something I don't know so weird we
all do that instead of the prototype
what you should think of if you're doing
lean startup is this first of all the
most the minimum testable product sorry
about the most minimum testicle product
should be anyway and then the Minimum
Viable Product okay what is the minimum
thing that you can do to validate your
assumptions there are several techniques
to do that you can also go to interviews
same way as we validated the problem
before okay once you have your customer
and problem you can validate your
solution with interviews that's one way
of doing it you don't need to build any
actual software you can use wire frames
they are very very powerful hard to sell
but still very powerful you can use
landing pages they're very powerful
especially to validate this unique value
proposition box in the middle okay if
you want to test out several sentences
and we see which one brings you the most
email addresses that's a good way to do
it another technique the concierge mode
even though you want to satisfy as many
customers as possible you might want to
start with a small niche and with a
method with a product that's so simple
that it's not scalable the example I
always give is just okay give out a
phone number and do the service yourself
on the phone of course you will only be
able to serve like 10 or 15 customers
that way but we'll bring you a lot of
validated learning another technique is
the wizard of oz that's something that
was famously used by suppose for example
at the beginning the way he sold shoes
is just by putting a web page with some
pictures of shoes that he had taken in
shops and then people would order online
thinking that it would go through an
entire logistics machine actually was
the guy going to the shop buying the
shoes and sending them via the post but
he learned a lot with that that's a good
technique as well and think of all the
ways that you can put something together
very quickly forums blogs mailing this
phone numbers they are really powerful
angel list via famous marketplace for
investors and entrepreneurs started that
way with a mailing list that's it and
thanks to that melanie's they learned
what was important to their users and
they started to put those features into
a real website so think of ways to
validate your hypothesis with a minimum
of effort okay next step usually when
you have a prototype you start okay I'm
going to show it to people but then
they're going to steal my idea and do it
for me no of course the way you protect
yourself from that is by writing a
nondisclosure agreement because you're
afraid that somebody will steal your
idea as I said good an idea good n
original ideas don't exist don't need to
explain why again and a good way to
think about this as this comes from
derek sivers it's not mine but you can
look this up on the internet and that's
an important aspect you have to multiply
left by right so that means that a week
idea with it awesome execution is worth
about a million dollars a brilliant idea
with crappy execution or no execution
twenty dollars that's it okay so think
about that this is real by the way I
mean I haven't seen anybody in the
industry who didn't agree with that in
instead of being afraid of talking about
your idea try to gather as much feedback
as possible that's the key you have more
to win by doing this than to lose ok you
get feedback from real potential users
who might become your potential first
customers from investors from partners
of course from co-founders and remember
that if your idea is all you have then
you have nothing this is really key I
think about i will have said enough that
ideas are worthless anyway usually when
you get that you go to see investors and
you want to pitch your business plan ok
just remember a few things and your
investors are really interested in a few
things quality passion commitment
integrity of course you've got all that
no need to go over that that's our
problem market opportunity and potential
you have your market study right you
have your market report so you're
reassured with that you have your
business plan you need initial
attraction usually that's the missing
factor and it's really important initial
attraction a way to show that your
figures are real they're not plain
bullshit if you have some technology
intellectual property patents anything
that can be good for you but usually
they don't that they don't value ndas
that much anymore and an appropriate
evaluation this is also a very important
so it means that they will be able to
give you as few bucks as possible for
maximum of shares in your company that's
the logic so this is also something that
you need to think about when you start
talking to investors and exit strategies
ok it does your solution have good
chance of being sold acquired go public
whatever they want to make money that's
their primary goal and of course to do
that you need an elevator pitch you need
a peach take any all sorts of material
to really perfect your craft and and
show it to people in and when it
basically gets out get visible and
and cut through all the noise the most
important aspect you need introductions
okay those investors are so hard to
reach especially the best ones so you
need some people to show you the way you
need some people can say okay I know
this guy is on to something he should
meet him this is really valuable the
first thing that I think you should
focus on if you want to show something
to in industrial these days is validated
learning okay if you come up with a way
to show that you have a market and to
prove it to show that you have validated
your learning and not just put some
assumptions out there this is a good way
and this is the loop that's at the heart
of everything Lean Startup okay build
learn measure I might build measure
learn so in that order anyway just the
last resource that can be very useful
something that you could start to think
of for your next business that you're
going to start on Monday right and
that's the elevator pitch this is one
way to write it that has all the
essential elements in it so once again
these are just elements coming from the
canvas except the company name that
don't spend too much time on that trying
the code name and that will be fine but
defined offering platforms are not
defying the forums okay websites mobile
app mailing list phone number these are
good define offerings target customers
you know what it is you want to solve a
problem and your secret sauce is
premature unique value proposition and
that's all I have for today I hope that
it has some inspired some of you to get
started and read some interesting things
about that and we don't have any time
for questions I mean I'm afraid so if
you have any questions when please come
see me thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
