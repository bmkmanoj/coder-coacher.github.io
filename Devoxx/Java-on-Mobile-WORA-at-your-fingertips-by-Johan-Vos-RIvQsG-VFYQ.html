session about Java on mobile wara at
your fingertips so for the people under
43 years old water means write once run
anywhere I'm you have us and I work for
a gloom gloom is a company that tries to
bring Java to mobile what will we cover
today first of all I will give a brief
overview of the current state of Java on
mobile and embedded and I will give a
quick demo just to show how easy it is
today to create Java applications using
Java vex to create user interface run
them on desktop and easily deploy them
on ipad and android devices i will
briefly talk about some improvements
that we can do and that we are doing i
will talk about the glue on vm briefly
and then i will spend some time talking
about how can how you can integrate your
application your java mobile client
application how you can integrate that
with your existing enterprise or cloud
software so again just just for my
knowledge who here is a process
themselves or a mobile developer oh ok
and who is an enterprise developer ok
interesting thanks so the mobile
transformation is happening right now
today more transaction start from mobile
devices there from web devices and
especially the demand from enterprise is
to have the functionality of mobile
devices is going exponentially and the
strategy of many companies is today is
mobile-first cloud-first and the
business the dark transformed today are
really moving their functionality from
from web front-ends more and more to
mobile form dense but it's important
that you can also access the backend
functionality so
is very important is a reliable mobile
development platform that that fulfills
all those requirements and a reliable
platform then the first one I think of
is Java because it's proven to be a very
reliable mature language and platform so
I will briefly discuss the status of a
Java on mobile and all the things in
bold here are just reminders for me that
I have to create a slide for this so i
forgot to unbolt them so today java
applications that are created with java
7 they can run on iOS and Android
devices and we have ide plugins that
make it very easy to do this java also
contains a modern UI toolkit which is
java FX and it's cross-platform it works
on iOS and Android and it allows for one
hundred percent code reuse so not only
the business logic but also the UI
components of your application can be
shared across desktop android/ios there
are third-party add-ons for example the
glue on glisan framework allows you to
create applications that are really
targeting mobile devices that that
contain a material design look and feel
a framework so that the applications
don't look too much metal or desktop and
today it's also possible to access
device specific functionality via
cross-platform Java API without you
having to to write code specifically for
Android or iOS if all goes well I can
show a demo just briefly on how we
create a java application for desktop
and run it on mobile as well if it's not
going well then then there's a network
hiccup so I I prefer to tell that in
advance so with netbeans but with all
the other IDs you have a plug-in called
the gloom plugin if you go to tools and
plugin for example with netbeans you can
see that amongst or amongst many
installed plugins I have a gluon plug-in
if you don't have it yet you can get it
from the NetBeans portal and the same
holds for IntelliJ and
eclipse after the some updates I'll
probably do that later because otherwise
the network might go down so once you
have this plug-in you can create a new
project and then that means we go to new
project and gluon is a there on top and
we can create a single view a project a
glue on mobile sync view project we
click on next we give it a name for
example hello devoxx belgium and we want
to have this project on Android iOS and
desktop we click on finish and the
project is created so this is just a
template so this is a basic project it
doesn't do anything fancy but the good
thing is that I can run it on desktop
and that's the first thing I'm going to
do my laptop is making lots of noise I
think it's doing the updates so running
this project on desktop gives me well
more or less this is an emulation of a
mobile phone we have this is a javafx
user interface start with glisan the
mobile framework that i talked about we
have a simple button change the world
and if I click on that you will see that
the hello gr vivexx world is going to
change into hello javafx universe so
that's fine that's desktop so that's not
mobile yet but the code that we have
here is only two classes so we have a
basic view class and a hello evokes
Belgium Claus hello defects Belgium is
the start class that will do all the
rest and it will add a view factory we
have different views in a Java on mobile
so it will add a basic view to the to
the scene and that basic view you don't
even need to know Java vex but you can
clearly see what is happening here we
create the label hello Java vex we
create a button change the world and if
the button is clicked we have a lambda
expression that will set the text of the
hello javax world too hello javafx
universe so that's nice but it would be
nice if you can run this on an iOS
device in the tasks and already did it
to say whoops in the task in the
NetBeans project you can see launch iOS
device for example and if you do that
then all the code will be compiled for
iOS devices for an iOS device and it
will be installed on a connected iOS
device if you have one connected via USB
and all I have to hurry because i have
this quicktime player ok which is
showing the ipad that i have here now
you don't see that probably so this is
an ipad and and you can see the so it's
it's a it's either good fake or it's
real so so what is happening now and I'm
going back to NetBeans but I will try to
show this iPad as well is that all the
classes are compiled from Java bytecode
into native iOS native iOS code so our
Java code is compiled before it is
packaged into an iOS app and before it
is sent to the device so we don't run
Java on the device it's not allowed by
Apple because Java will create dynamic
code and that's not allowed but we
compile it ahead of time and if we then
look at what happened at the device so
this is the this is the ipad the mirror
of of the ipad screen and it's the same
application so if i close this you will
see again the label hello javafx and the
button change the world and if you click
that button change the world then the
text will change in hello java vex
universe so with just a symbol a single
plugin in the IDE you can easily create
a java application once run it on
desktop and run it on mobile as well and
that was not that was not hard i think
the same holds for android but what's my
excuse today for not doing it I don't
have an Android cable with me yeah but
that's that's what it so I bought this
new Nexus 5x and they have new USB cable
that can be
turned us bc i think the problem is that
the other side can't be turned yet so
we're living in the middle somewhere so
that is a that is just the demo that i
wanted to show because otherwise it may
sound like yeah this is all theory but
no this is really working in practice
and on a monday pulling gear lenders and
gave a great tutorial on how you can
create java mobile applications using
this framework so it's been recorded you
can watch that for getting more detailed
information on how to do it yes your
native functionality you mean yeah yes
the answer is yes and that will be in
slide okay yeah so the question was what
what was the question okay yeah right
can you access native functionality I
don't remember the question but the
answer is yes so so the question was can
you access native functionality using
this application for example the GPS and
the answer is yes you can and I will
come back to that in a slide yeah slide
17 I think so that the status of Java on
mobile we give the demo very briefly
what is the status of the Java Virtual
Machine on mobile well at this moment we
use on Android we have a dolphin flash
art which is java 6 7 based on the
harmony vm but as from Android n there's
a new virtual machine / aot compiler /
runtime that Android is using which is
based on OpenJDK 8 it's it's better on
iOS as i said we use an aot and ahead of
time compiler that will translate our
bytecode into native code for iOS we
also provide the JVM which is also based
on harmony because if you want to
execute Java code you need a virtual
machine jvm but all of this is compared
before it enters the device it's based
on robo vm but program is don't know and
it's at this moment we use a
of problem that's maintained by moby
develop i will briefly come back to that
later UI toolkit as i mentioned at this
moment we are using a yo-yo I toolkit we
also use it before and in the future
which is a javafx which is it's part of
the Java SDK it's a modern and mature UI
toolkit Oracle supports it for Mac
Windows and Linux so it's distributed
with the SDK and the gluon support it
for iOS and Android and arm devices it
leverages hardware acceleration so
there's lots of native code in this in
javafx the api's are of course Java API
is but the implementations use native
code that's in apart from and from
windows it's using OpenGL or OpenGL ES
to do the low-level rendering so it's
directly using the GPU of the device
instead of rendering on a web view for
example or doing software rendering we
do support software rendering as a
backup but on mobile devices that the
GPU is typically relatively more
powerful than the CPU so the GPU is
doing the rendering and the cpu is do is
a computation but because many mobile
applications they need a very performant
you I operations and therefore the GPU
is is really performant and Java vex
leverage is that not only Jarvik
sammobile but also java vector on
desktop so that's a great framework for
using on GPU enabled devices the Java
API is and the native code for this
platform specific functionality or all
part of javafx we don't only have java
of exxonmobil we also have it on
embedded the sandwiches that you see
here at devoxx or using java vexa
forearm and it's the same code base is
one hundred percent the same code as the
code that's used in a mac or on android
and iOS so as a consequence applications
that you write on
for embedded you can test them on
desktop we're under 1 i'm better to run
them on mobile with a with a single code
base so i think it's very convenient for
example the testing you can do that on
desktop you don't have to test on
devices if you saw and it's what I
always do when I give a demo I first run
the application on desktop because
typically if you have errors you will
see them on desktop and the deployment
development lifecycle is much faster on
desktop than on embedded devices for
example ok then we go to the mobile UI
library providing the material design
look and feel this is a component that
glue on created and called argh listen
listen they actually say I don't know I
don't know why but um all the names from
the in the gluon products were
originally chosen by me and they were
physical names like a charm charm down
charm up and and and particle and so but
nobody liked it and they removed it and
they gave it like connect and clout link
and names and so only the only the
glisten name which is not a physical
name is still remaining anyway that's
the that's the the library that allows
you to create shiny applications using
the that conformed to the material
design specifications of Google so you
see here two examples of how some of the
elements can be used in a mobile
application so there are many widgets
that are taken from JavaFX and there are
styled a bit differently using CSS so
those of you who know Java vex know how
easy it is to take an existing component
and change some of the CSS code and have
it then look differently more applicable
to mobile devices for example and apart
from starving the existing job of X
controls we also have a number of mobile
specific controls like the up bar and
what's it called the toast and floating
action button and so and many more and
we also have support for views
lightweight views because you have to
switch files between different views
we support of XML which is the rendering
language for updating 404 for defining
user interfaces in Java vex you can
declare that you can write them in a
declarative way using XML or you can
program them we have many transitions
that allow you to move from one view to
another in a more or less animated way
and we support different layers for
example the typical dialog doesn't
really work on a mobile but you can add
different layers there back to the
question we had earlier device specific
functionality is indeed supported we
have a library is called charm down it's
an open source project many of the code
from a gluon is a as in the open is
developed in the open source and charm
down contains the list of services that
implement native functionality so we
have a cross-platform Java API that is
conformed to the Java patterns and the
JavaFX patterns so we try to have a very
familiar API for developers to access
those functionality because I forgot to
say this in the beginning but I think
one of the reasons why I really believe
in Java on mobile is because they are
there are ten million java developer i
always used to say there were nine
million but then you learnt from oracle
who hold the java handle corrected me
and she said that as of yesterday there
were 10 million java developers that's a
huge it's huge developer base that can
now write applications for mobile
devices so what we try to do is to make
it easy for them so that we we try to
make the AP is very familiar to the
existing Java and Java vex api's and of
course the implementations of those
native functionality are very different
but you just program against the the
cross platform api so here you see a
list of services are already supported
the list is growing and we it's not only
grown that's doing this but there are
contributions from the source community
that are adding functionality
is ide plugins when I talk about that we
want to have the that we want to make it
easy for existing Java developers to use
this framework and to create Java
applications using their existing skills
and patterns then the most important
thing that comes to mind are the ID
plugins and we support with glue on the
three major IDEs so we have plugins for
IntelliJ NetBeans and Eclipse and these
plugins they will take care of
everything from writing the code to
deploying it to the app stores so they
will make sure that the Java vex runtime
for iOS or Android is there they will do
the build they will include the required
libraries for example glisan if you want
to make it shiny application they will
do the aot completion and they will then
deploy it on the native devices or on
the simulators and you can also create
the native applications and packages
that you then can that you then can
upload to the app store or the order
placed or so it sometimes get questions
can you is it allowed by Apple yes so we
uploaded a few applications already and
none of them was rejected and there are
more applications out there than I then
I am aware of because we don't know what
everyone is doing but we didn't we never
heard a complaint from a former user who
said my application is refused here or
there of course you have to you have to
apply to the to the Apple take ethics of
course so if you do illegal things then
then it's not allowed it's very hard for
me not to make jokes about new legal
stuff in the u.s. today so those plugins
are available for netbeans Eclipse and
IntelliJ talking about the u.s. there's
a conference coming up in the US which
is a devack us and I do recommend all
people to to go there because it's a
great conference with great speakers so
now that I did some promotion for Derek
us maybe it's time to introduce the
folks us chairperson for this year and
the dev ox Berchem chairperson Stephanie
answer who wants to make a very cool
announcement about devoxx and glue on
thanks for joining me Stefan Thank you
Thank see one so yeah what you one did
he's a very modest guy and he likes to
do some dry jokes as well but but he
really did with his team is he developed
a very nice application the schedule
application for Java one and what's
really cool is that they actually open
sourced it right yeah and because it's
then open source then well it's you can
even see it on the title it's a huge
opportunity for dev Fox actually to take
and rebrand that into a def Fox mobile
app so what we're going to try to do is
well first of all they already did that
all the work they interacted with our
rest interface using the cfb so that you
really were showing all the speakers and
so on and then we had this nice
selection of the world which they've
already done as well I mean you guys are
really stars in javafx and so on and the
idea is really to move forward with this
as hopefully probably next year derek's
belgium you'll be using this one instead
of the ones we have now now it's still
depending on a few features like for
example push notification it was on your
list but it's not there yet today I
believe that it's probably a matter of
weeks or so but by next year we'll have
it because we use push notification if I
changed something in the schedule in our
cfb scala play application then it
actually does a push notification to the
mobile apps I hate you need to update
because that talk changed or was
rescheduled so that's a critical one we
need but the beauty of course and you've
already mentioned it in your in your
talk here is that the as a result as a
Java developer i can now maintain it
because you probably saw at the opening
keynote there's a lot of people involved
in the my dev box we have a developer
for windows we have one for android and
iOS and for example the guy who is he's
moving from Geneva to Canada so he had
other things on his mind and changing or
fixing a few bucks so we had some
practical man
def exposed viscose and he was just on a
plane going to Canada and I'm chewing
and a lot of other Americans are going
to be moving with plano konica but at a
part or a side so I want to be a bit
more in control and definitely like cats
from Fox she's a Java developer she
wants to help out as well so just one
code base and we can run it on bit on
Android and iOS windows I think you are
you covering that or we get a questions
about Windows Mobile every month and
then our answer is if there's enough
interest we will cover it yeah what I
knew I haven't looked at the stats yet
but last year we had 888 people using
the windows up I don't know for this
year still need to ask it so it's
marginally small compared to the number
of people we have and the guy running
the windows he's very very responsive
always on late so we might just stick to
that one but I'm really excited about
that you want thank you very much for
your support and you know no I respect
you and what you're doing is like this
is like crazy stuff so congrats okay
thanks a lot Stefan and it's the first
time that you call me a modest guy so
I'll remember that so but yeah it's
really important to hear this people
won't use Java on mobile not only
because they want to create a single
code base but also for the maintenance
if you create an application in Android
or iOS it's typically out sourced to two
other companies and then you need to
maintain it and the company already
moved forward or so that's a that's
something that we we often hear having
said that we're not we're not ready yet
what you saw was really working and and
much more can can work but we are still
improving so at this moment we support
the Java well as I said we're harmony
based which is java 6 7 harmony is a vm
that's end of life it has a long history
which we're not gonna in going into not
now but it will never reach Java 8
compatibility so we are working with
blown on the glue on vm which will be a
job online vm now which leverages
openjdk mobile the openjdk mobile
project is an effort by oracle where
they bought the OpenJDK glasses and the
virtual machine to mobile
operating systems in general so it is
leveraging the code from openjdk so it's
one hundred percent the same code for
desktop and for server and for mobile
devices so that is then really write
once run anywhere at this moment da OT
so the compiler that compiles the
bytecode into the native iOS code is
based on hope of em but we already have
our own aot compiler that will be part
of the glue on vm once we release it it
will contain performance not well apart
from glue on vm we will also work on
performance improvements in the graphics
layer and in other parts and we will
work on even better tooling support we
have really very cool stuff in the
pipeline we just have to decide on
priorities so i mentioned it a few times
the how we use the Java Virtual Machine
on Android and iOS just to make it clear
again on Android you have a java
application you have with libraries you
have a java vex runtime and the Android
tools will combine this into your native
application on Android on iOS it's more
or less similar except that we have this
dis aot compiler in between that will
translate all the code so not only your
application with all the libraries the
job of excellent time and the java
runtime it will ahead of time compile
those into a native application and with
glue on vm because we want to overcome
the limitations of harmony we will be
based completely on openjdk in line and
so that means that we will support not
only all the classes of a jdk nine but
also all the patterns like the lambdas
and the streams and the modularity this
is what we will support in the glue on
vm and the architecture then looks this
way so we have the java 9 the java vex
runtime and your application the glue on
vm will do the ad ahead of time
compilation of all those components and
will then make it a native component and
so the problem when I when I prepare
presentations is that I've
okay i have to spend five minutes here
seven minutes there and then you see how
many time that's left so and then i
always have to do the backward
calculation because i have now 34
minutes left so that means that I've 26
minutes done then we are right on track
perfect that's 34 minutes so is it so
when it when you get to 30 minutes it
becomes more complicated because then
you don't know is it minus or plus
anyway so that is that is that is
currently the situation on the mobile
part yes question okay so the question
is he remembered that robe of em had
support for lambdas but that was back in
the days that is that is true so robo vm
the robot m aot compiler will compile
your lambdas into inner classes so while
you are restricted to the Java 7 ap ice
you can use lambdas for for iOS fo for
Android you can use them as well because
our build tools so the plug-in uses a
another project this is called vitro
lambda and this one will inspect your
classes and your jar files the office
that you depend on and will also replace
the lambda expressions with the with the
inner classes actually those who paid
more good attention to so this is not
just black screen it's it's me doing
escape if you look at the sample I
showed we have here along the expression
so when you click on a button this
expression is triggered so we set the
text of the label to hello Java vex
universe so lambdas are supported in
Java on mobile because robo vm and mobi
develop support them and because we
support me in the build tools as well
and that's very important especially who
of the audience has experience with java
development okay nice in Java Vicki
there's a lots of there's many AP is
that really make use of lambda
expressions there are lots of single
abstract method classes and it would be
lots of boilerplate code if those
lambdas were not available so that was
critical for us to have loved us
supported in a Java on mobile and I'm
glad we already have it so streams at
this moment is possible if you do
android deployment but on iOS it's not
supported yet and that's a pity but
strings are already working on if you
deploy your application to Android n
because we leverage the existing Java
Runtime on Android there there was
really a very very cool demonstration of
this at javaone by Shaun Phillips who is
a contractor for the NASA and they have
this a space trajectory application
where they predict paths and orbits and
try to find the best orbit for launching
satellites and so and this application
is making here this application for the
desktop it's made lots of use of dreams
so he said I won't be able to do this on
mobile but well because as of openjdk
sorry Android n it can be used on
Android devices he used he modified his
application using glue and mobile and he
run it on a pixel tablet and he was
blown away he was a amazed how fast it
was and so that's I think a great
reference case that the NASA is using
using this for for doing a deep space
missions so so on set above flight level
35 pretty much everything is running
java so that is a that is for the for
the front end which is which is very
important that you can create Java
applications on mobile but mobile
applications do not live by itself well
some do but
not not all of them do who's playing
pokemon I didn't mean right now I just
meant who is playing pokemon in general
okay much more than here so even even
even Pokemon is an application that that
really requires lots of data
interactions interactions with data on
the backend business applications of
course if you if you make a reservation
for for a train or so when you do that
for mobile that into the needs to
integrate with with with a back-end it's
hard to think of applications that do
not integrate with back-end applications
and then there are some requirements
data need to be synchronized we've
remote back and imagine that your your
device crashes and you had 150 pokemons
and if they were not backed up that
would be a disaster so data need to be
stored on the backend and by the fact
that more people are now laughing and
nodding then that we are saying that
they were playing pokemon I've doubts
about the first 40 of the audience so
that is mobile applications need
enterprise functionality at least data
persistence and storage but if you look
at it from the other way it also is to
enterprises need mobile functionality
and there are many companies that that
provide some enterprise functionality
and that have a website for it for
example you have an e-commerce shop and
you you you sell some stuff and your
customers say yeah that's fine i can buy
things online but today i'm not really
using my laptop anymore i'm using my my
tablet on my phone so can you please
provide this functionality for mobile as
well or you have a reservation systems
where people want to say i won't have
this seat on an aircraft for example
more and more companies are facing
demands from their users to offer the
same functionality that they offer on
the web also on mobile devices and then
it's often we we we the wet alarm lights
that cough in the company
was more about is still a bit strange so
they think that mobile that's for
playing pokemon and now we need to do
serious things on it but we don't have
we don't have the knowledge in house to
do this so what often happens then is
that it's being outsourced to do mobile
specific companies that do something but
if then in one year later the company
add some new functionality for example
you can now store items in a court or
applied discounts and so and then the
mobile developer said yeah sorry I
switch to a new framework meanwhile so
if you want to have this functionality
you need to upgrade to the new framework
and that's frustrating for many
enterprise developers who love stability
and peace in their software stack so
therefore it's it's it's I think it's
good that you can use Java on the mobile
client as well because your existing
Java knowledge that you can use on the
enterprise can also be used to create a
mobile applications so having your
functionality from enterprise exposed
not only to a web front-end but also to
mobile fondant is I think a big
requirement these days now you can say
okay as I have job on the mobile client
then it's easy because then i will just
make a rest call to my back end but
typically if you for example the example
of the shopping cart if you want to buy
something you actually request a new
page and the average size of the page is
huge so you get you maybe do a rest
requesting you get lots of information
back that's nice but the mobile you're
not going to render all this information
so you don't want it because downloading
even with even all the bandwidth is
increasing the whole time it's still
it's not it's not for free so you want
to limit the amount of data being
downloaded so you don't want those big
objects so what do you do you make a
rest call and you add a query parameter
for example mobile equals two and then
at the server you need to check this oh
if mobile equals to the
I have to not put the whole the name of
the category and so on I just give the
ID and a description or so and then the
mobile developer says here but I want
some specific functionality for example
I know where the user is so if I pass
this information for example location is
X Y then maybe the backend can say oh we
are also going to send you the location
of the nearby most nearby shop so you
have then a mobile specific code but
then your quarter depends on this mobile
parameter and it's not going to work for
the web front-end anymore and you will
have exceptions all over the place and
that's not what you want so you well
well the functionality on mobile and on
the web is the same it's still not it's
not good I think to to directly call the
enterprise functionality for mobile
devices it's not only me who is saying
this but in the mobile industry you have
something like an emboss which is mobile
backend as a service which is the middle
layer between the mobile devices and the
enterprise functionality and this emboss
deals with the typical mobile issues for
example well not only the size of a
mobile data but also connectivity losses
versioning what if a transaction support
what if you buy something and and then
you're in a tunnel so you lose the
connection but the money is already of
your accountants also on mobile you
still have much more constraints than
then on desktops so the mobile backend
as a service is in the mobile enterprise
industry something that's being used for
making the life of mobile developers
easier and also making the life of the
enterprise developers easier by removing
saree by removing some of the
boilerplate code that's required for
circumventing all these all these edge
cases so we've grown we have an
embassage is called gloom cloud link
we're working on it and some of the
functionality is already available and
you can even download
it from the website and we plan to
release it by the end of the year who
wrote this light that's probably some
some of the someone who wants to put
some pressure on me who said it will be
available by the end of the year so it
will be there and in this a.m in our
embassy provide functionality like for
example Stefan was asking for push
notifications that is something that
well you can't do on the device only you
need to have some back-end for and so
that's something that we're working on
supporting push notifications contextual
information geotech do what it's much
more readable on the big screen and on
my screen so the geo location is also
something that you have available on
mobile and that you can leverage on the
back end so this information is
seamlessly sent by the mobile device to
cloud link and your back-end application
can leverage this and then you can use
it to make decisions on for example we
want to send a push message to all the
people that are in this region region
but also maybe only people who opted in
for this or this so you can apply some
custom logic on this so without going
into much detail on all the different
aspects of the mobile backend as a
service in general if you want to have a
middle layer between your mobile
application and your back-end like glue
and cloud link you need somehow to to
access this and we and it's dip lick it
down in this in this industry offer two
options you can have the public glue on
cloud link which is a cloud service it's
a multi-talent cloud service so if you
create an application and register it
there it will keep all your data your
functionality and your configuration and
your users in a separate isolated
database it's a multi-tenant service but
for many companies and organizations
that's not safe enough javafx and
probably most of you is working with
javax know that is often used in
healthcare in finance and insecurity and
in telecom and privacy and security is
extremely important there so they don't
want to go to a public cloud they want
to have the same functionality but then
local on-premise so that's why we have
grown crowd lincoln farmers as well and
how do you connect your existing
enterprise functionality with your
mobile applications for your glowing
cloud well that's simply done and groan
growling does as well vr connectors so
you can specify for example a west
connector you can specify that if if
this data is changed on the client then
I want to that this rest handler is
triggered so and this rest handler is
then running on my back end vice versa
you can have you can if if your date on
the back it changes you call blue and
clouds and this will then synchronize
that's new data to the devices are
connected or it will update if Isis once
they come online so that's real time
synchronization without enterprise
developers having to take into account
wait but that device is not online so i
will i will remind it when it comes
online that it needs to synchronize this
part of the data to this version also so
that is how in general growing cloud
works i will give an example but the
example that i will give today and i'm
pretty excited about this is running on
the pivotal web sources so other spring
developers here ok so then I've really
exciting news for you so developers that
are using the pws services the pivotal
web services which is a platform for
running cloud native java applications
now has as of today as a new service and
that is glue on cloud link so you can
use cloud link now in your applications
that use pivotal web services so we are
extremely happy that the pivotal wants
to have a glue on cloud link and it
allows mobile developers to easily share
their mobile data with everything
created with pws and it also allows
existing pws
users to share their functionality with
new mobile applications so if you create
an enterprise application you want to
run Adam mobile then this is this is I
think a great solution for you we are
working with other cloud and back-end
providers on similar offerings because
we want to make it as easy as possible
for existing enterprise developers to
create mobile applications and to share
functionality and data there so as an
example we have a we created a simple
whiteboard application an in despite
both application you just give in some
text a title and you click the Add
button and it will then appear on the
website and I will actually show how
this goes so I go to the website and see
aya and now oh yeah there is network so
if there's no network now then I just go
back to to my slides and I pretended
that it's real time so i will create a
new white book entry from the herbs from
the day vox talk in room 7 i will edit
and you see it's being added to the
website that's nice you can remove it
from the website so that is a simple
application that we created that's a
that's a pws application that is using
the spring boot and it's a standard web
application running inside pws so it's a
front-end and back-end the back end is
storing the entries in the database I
think in in a Postgres database and the
content is rendering them in this nice
website that you saw so the code
snippets that handles the creation of
new items is shown like here so this is
a regular spring boot application that
can be accessed by a web browser and as
you can see
we pass one parameter title and we call
then service to create items on title
and services our extremely complex back
and functionality that will store this
in the database so that's a that's easy
but that's of course web only now we
will show how this works on mobile as
well and is there someone called Nandini
in the room no okay then I will give a
demonstration that's hopefully going to
work we will now apply the same
functionality but on mobile devices I'm
not going to create the whole mobile
application right now because it should
already be been running but i will i
will start the application on mobile if
i can get my quick time back it's always
tempting to click on you don't see you
don't see the quicktime ah how comes so
what are you actually seeing there what
did you see this I don't see that on my
screen so we're really wonder where that
comes from is that my presentation okay
okay did you see the website when I
showed it okay weird I want to see that
in the recording about what happened
there that's weird so okay we have this
application I believe it's called a
whiteboard yeah so it starts here and
you see the the items those are items
are retrieved from the pws service so
what I will show now and I will try to
put this on the same screen at the same
moment i'm still seeing this ok so the
title is i will send to mobile
I add it and if you go to the well onto
the ipad it's been edited there as well
so similarly i can go to the ipad and i
can type from mobile i'm extremely
stressed so i might do it make a typo
okay whoa that dad's death distress ok
alright so that's a yeah that should now
be sent to the back end we are not
really web front-end developers so for
our web application you have to reload
the page and then you see from mobile
but we are where enterprise developers
so when you delete it from mobile i will
send to mobile you see that the mobile
application is updated immediately as
well so that worked and to end right so
that's that's the demo I will now show
the different pieces of the architecture
that will explain what exactly with it
so we go back to the presentation ok
you're seeing the presentation now and
I'm seeing the presentation so what we
added to the existing beckoned
application was the cloud link and the
mobile devices so it may be a bit
overkill for this very simple
application to do it this way but it
demonstrates the usage of an emboss in
the middle I will zoom in on the bottom
part of the of the new part of the
application so cloud link is the bridge
in the middle between your spring boat
web application or any enterprise
application and the mobile devices and
we have three arrows there so first of
all the the top arrow
no going to start with the bottom arrow
if you add some data using the web
application we will go we will use this
arrow to push the data to glue on cloud
link and gloom crowd link will then send
it to the mobile devices if the mobile
device ads on data it will update glue
on crowd link and the data is then
pushed to the back end application
that's a that's the flow of the data and
I will show the code snippets for those
for those two use cases now in the end I
will show the code that's required at
the mobile device for making sure that
this is a sink with glue and growling so
we now have something in the middle so
we need to make sure that the the front
end and the back end can work with grout
link and we need to make sure that the
mobile device can also work with cloud
link and then we don't care about
connectivity loss or about versioning of
data or so we just update and we will
trigger to when there something changed
so i will now very briefly show how you
can configure a pws service using cloud
link I will tell you what you have to do
for telling clocking that the data need
to go to this spring boot back up and I
will then show the code so in the
pivotal at pws marketplace you can you
can you have application then you can
add the service you can choose but from
number of services and if you choose for
glue on Clark link you will see that
there's the glowing cloud linker serves
as think as of today it is available in
the marketplace you select that the
plans and like unless you like us very
very much you start with the free plan
and and you add that to your plan you
then can manage this this instance of an
services assistant created you can
manage it by clicking on manage and then
we will come to the glue on Clark link
portal where we recognize you and where
you can add an application for example
you add a whiteboard application and you
will then be given a key and a secret
the secret is extremely hard to read but
that's probably on purpose
so the then you you have to configure
cloud link which is with an application
that you can download the crackling
dashboard and you you log in using the
credentials that have been created for
you so you have to to type over the the
password that's extremely hard to go to
read and you configure the rest
connector for this because we want to
trigger our back-end application if we
have new data configuring the rest
connector is done by supplying a URL so
please remember the whole URL there or
just the end flash crowd link and that
will that will make sure that that this
part is working then that that if
there's new data from the mobile to the
cloud link that the data is then sent to
the web app now if new data is added via
the web application that we showed what
we did before was just adding this to
the local service and storing it in a
postgres probably but now we also need
to tell glue on cloud think about it so
the code snippet that we had changes a
bit so before we just had so we have
this a post method where we pass a title
we not only create the item on the
surface but we also tell the cloud
linked service that's now accessible in
our instance to add the item so cloud
link serves that item the implementation
for this is as follows this is a bit for
both it can be much much smaller but
just that you see what is actually
happening we crowd link understands for
example Jason so you can send Jason twit
so what we do is we create a JSON object
using JSON generator for this item that
we want to add so we at the title every
of the creation date and then we we ask
for the payload of the JSON object and
we create an HTTP entity and then we
want to make a rest request to cloud
link it's very important to use the
right credentials and so the key and the
secret because we use go out to sign
this
request and we post that request to the
clerk link endpoint that's been defined
and we call this this part for telling
we want to add new data to a specific
list and the list is called items so
this is pass / part of the path and then
cloud link knows okay for this
application it's in the it's in the key
and secret in the headers I need to add
data to the list called items and it
will then send it to the to the local
application the other way around if we
add an item from the mobile application
glue and cloud link will give it to us
and remember the URL that we showed when
configuring the rest endpoint was
something about cloud linked list and
then items so this one will be called by
glue on Cloudland when new data is
available it will call the list items at
and then the name of the new an
identifier of the new item that we
created we got a desk Jason so we read
to chase whoops sorry we read the JSON
object and we create the item based on
the JSON object and then we call again
the service dog create item method so we
use the same back and functionality to
to create items so the rest handler is
different but the back end functionality
is the same so we reuse our existing
enterprise code whether the item is
created from mobile or from desktop
finally what do we need to do on the
mobile client to make sure that we can
read this data and add items it's
actually very simple we create a glowing
client using a glue on client builder so
this this code runs on your mobile
application we use of the the Builder
pattern here we pass it our credentials
that's again the key in the secret that
we got from a growling frame we created
the application and we tell it in
operation would cloud first which means
that if it says no
action but it has a stored version of
our data I still use that one and
otherwise it will use the it will try to
get the data from the cloud first so you
can also have local first and then it
will only go to the cloud if it doesn't
have it yet but cloud versus recommended
actually and then on this client we we
use this client to retrieve a list and
we tell the client create a list data
reader which is called items so it will
get all the items from that list and
it's very important that you see those
sync flags here because what they say is
Ritu right who and the result is an
observable list and those of you who
know Java vex know that in an observable
list you can listen for changes so if
the backend added an item to this list
then cloud link will automatically send
it to to this glue and observable list
and every listener to that code for
example UI elements will be notified
about this vice versa if you add via the
user interface an item to that list you
don't have to write any specific code
this code is going to do everything for
you because we know so growing crowd
link and the client library know that
the list is changed you added something
and you specified list right to so that
item will automatically be sent to cloud
link and cloud will link will send it to
your rest back end so you don't need to
write code for detecting changes on the
mobile client that's all done by the
observable list and the building
detection of a change in the list so
that was my thing maybe the pretty fast
going over the both the mobile part of
mobile applications and the enterprise
part of enterprise back end applications
which is just to try it out it's a it's
pretty new but and we are still making
it better but it's at this moment I
think well there are many applications
already on the appstore and playstore
using this have a look at the samples
and yeah make sure to try it out and to
give feedback
so in summary we really believe that the
Java is not really ready for the for the
mobile market technology is there with
the plugins it's extremely easy
performance is already good we are
committed to make it even better and
weave glue on mobile it's easy for
existing Java developers to create Java
applications that that look like native
Java applications that use hardware
accelerated rendering and gloom cloud
link is the bridge between the mobile
applications and the cloud enterprise
world you can use it to connect to any
enterprise system or any cloud system
and we're very happy to have a pivotal
supporting us by offering blue and Clark
link as a service in the pivotal web
sources and that gives me two more
minutes for Q&amp;amp;A yes question there yeah
so the the material design the code is
the same with the CSS styling code on
Android and iOS is slightly different
but I'm not the UI expert of the company
but it seems that there are many
companies that that prefer to have a
consistent cross-platform brand so that
they want to have their application on
iOS and Android looking very similar if
what we and I i can't speak for my
colleague who's doing the UI part but
the difference you can have different
started for iOS and Android at this
moment our style sheets do not differ
too much but they can differ more and if
we don't do it probably someone else can
do it we have customers who are using
their own style sheets for specific iOS
look and feel free trading up specific
iOS look and feel so I had to repeat the
question the question was at this moment
your iOS application looks material
design as well can you also start to
look it like more like a native iOS
application and in theory yes you can
but we focus on the material design
look a few more questions yes how about
pricing a good question so our
philosophy is we want to make everything
we want if you're a developer and you
want to spend time then you don't have
to pay anything if you're a company and
you want to get support then you don't
have to worry about your time so we want
to make sure that developers can work
with everything for free without paying
and if you want to use it in a
commercial product then we appreciate
the license so what you saw in the
mobile applications is that with the
free version of glue and mobile if you
start it up you will get the screen
application created by with glue on
mobile and it's fine so you don't you
don't pay for this you can get all the
functionality and run it on mobile
devices if you want to get rid of that a
next screen you buy a license and then
you get a commercial access to it you
also get a hot fixes as a lace and so on
and but then you you have to pay a
license and and the that initial next
screen doesn't appear anymore but if you
are just playing with the with the tools
then you want to find out how does it
work and so then you don't have to to
pay a license then you just use the free
version and to convince yourself that
this is really working for you the only
thing is here you get the screen that i
godda swelling you have to click the ok
button yes yes question is what about
testing in the combination with with
cloud lynx-o unit and integration
testing at this moment there I know some
people are doing testing with I forgot
is it jemi or test effects which is a
java specific testing framework unit
tests can be done as well it's important
to mention that our builders are based
on Gradle which already support testing
SS in the life cycle already so that
should that should work but the cloud
testing is a very interesting remark and
when I said that we are improving our
tools that is one of the things that in
the pipeline ok I got here the times up
a message for a few minutes already so
I'm thanks a lot for attending if you
have more questions that's our website
that's me and feel free to ask and try
it out thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
