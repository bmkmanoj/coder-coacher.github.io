that so many people are interested in
hearing something about angular so to
quickly introduce ourselves my name is
Roman and I usually do a lot of web
stuff so in diamond projects where it
comes to developing web applications and
my focus daylight in front end
architecture responsive web design
usability UX and all that sort of stuff
yeah my name is Sebastian I'm currently
focused on IT solutions and work for
some years with angular since I think 10
version 10 and yeah good both weeping a
dinner q yeah that's a company based in
Germany so prepare for fun some funny
german accents it is located between
dusseldorf in cologne and we usually
have a lot of customers who have some
pain points with angular or regret that
decision that they used it for whatever
web application we talked about so one
disclaimer for those of you who do not
know about this acronym FTW when you
look it up at something like urban
dictionary it says for the win so our
talk will be about is it always the best
solution for my application it's more
more of a high-level talk and we want to
question a lot of things if it's always
a good idea to use it and if you scroll
a little down on urban dictionary you
might find something like that we do not
mean this so it's for is it for the win
we're not in the back again not no
biking gangs involved so let's let's
start by imagining you're a kick-ass
developer that shouldn't be so hard to
imagine and you're in a team and you
have to develop some sort of web
application and that sort of web
application could be a brand new one on
in a sort of greenfield project where
you have a lot of open possibilities you
have to freedom to choose a lot of stuff
or at
could be a web application that stands
next to others some legacy stuff some
really nasty things which you do not
want to touch at all because they're
like crumbling falling together whatever
and of course you're interested in
angular because it's here for quite a
while and you're asking yourself should
i use it is it a good idea to like build
my application with this and you might
find some some reasons could be that
there is someone who's saying man this
is the way you do web these days this is
the only way and you should do it like
this or your your your inner engineering
curve wants to like chex certain
features are you read about like two-way
binding boss and I won't always wanted
to try things out with this so I'm like
picking angular for for this reason or
maybe management said you have to do it
in angular sorry for whatever reasons
you don't know or it might be something
like Google built that it must be
awesome they're successful right we
wouldn't want to be successful as well
so yeah if you actually pick maybe one
of these reasons to be like the reason
for you choosing angular what could
possibly wrong right because like
everything is awesome we were like
totally rock this well as you may be no
chances are you totally blowed because
you like don't make it in time you
totally underestimated like the
complexity behind behind things your
team can can't take on all that and yeah
if you do not make it time you most
likely do not make it in budget and
chances are that management gets really
upset if you do not make it in budget
because they have like wasted a lot of
money in you and probably they have to
waste more money for experts that are
fixing like stuff behind you and all
that sorts so that's not cool we all
know what happens then like projects
going to be like this
sorry projects over next one so let's
fix this it's that's like not not the
things we want to achieve with this yes
and to fix this you have some decisions
to make before and maybe you have to
choose a web framework which fits your
need and you have some environmental
things to consider we have an
organization maybe you will freelancer
if a big company but that will matter
that will give you an environment where
to work in you have users which will use
it you have some sort of productivity to
achieve to earn and some tools to work
your users with and frameworks and so on
and you have a nekkid architecture which
is a bit which is a basement for your
application let's start with the
organization what's your business or
organization who's responsible for what
what's your environment you have some
constraints you always keep in mind you
have your time that's one cornerstone of
it and you have the budget that's very
normal then you have the technology you
have some constraints may be for the
hardware where it runs or some white or
black lists technology for example one
project was with the JVM technology you
can use jruby it's doesn't matter
because it's run it runs on the JVM and
maybe some processes for operations
communication flows and soul and you
have a team composition of some guys
with skills and they may have front-end
or back-end affinity and to get directly
on the angularjs example it made me not
such a good idea to put some back-end
developers on a high high level
JavaScript stack and you have to respect
the power of decision
is responsible and in power to make
techno technology decisions you have to
community and communicate a lot with him
or her if you're not it yourself and
always know your business model you are
not doing this for fun it's the most
important criteria to prioritize
prioritize your tasks on and you have to
to come back to angular you have to
think about death angular support or
dozen single page application support
your business model because maybe a
letter on some guys have to pay for a
service your building and you have to
support it that's all everything has to
concentrate on this business model and
it's okay and it's very important that a
developer knows it because is a part of
that of that hopefully success story to
fulfill this business model is not
important something like we have to earn
money yesterday it can be a let's build
to-do app the best app forever we have
one year for that then we look for one
year if it's successful and then we do
something with that its author business
model and you have to concentrate on
this one of the best things to to
support this business model is to
support users and to start with like
thinking about the users the the first
thing that comes in mind who are my
users actually do i know them do i have
like some sort of assumptions i I make
because like chances are you do not know
what your users actually look like what
are that pains are their needs what do I
have to make them like what would what
is the best way I can help him because
he's like the key for my business to
like earn money for example and when I'm
when I'm thinking about like building a
product I might have like some
competition going on and that user might
expect some sort of like snappy you I
feel
feedback for example if I'm building
like an app like that and this is my
competition so I it's like really not a
good idea to like build something like
in this in this direction without like
all this fancy stuff go as fancy stuff
going on so maybe maybe my my product
should even like support offline usage
we just heard a great talk about but in
an offline elements so this this stuff
is like really important if your if your
app doesn't like support offline usage
you might be lost maybe your your
business model won't won't be fulfilled
that good and another really important
thing about users is their context
actually so are there like interacting
with your application at home for
example or are they like sitting at a
desk and working working with that or
are they like traveling maybe in a
helicopter who knows and when I know
these situations I can like assume some
more like what kind of inputs does he
used as use keyboard and mouse or does
it use touch or maybe he's even like
controlling stuff with his voice because
he's like not able to like do the other
forms of input or you have to use like a
nasty remote for your TV for example all
these stuff are very important when you
think about can you can angular actually
like deliver that sort of stuff and also
it does of course when it comes to
devices a step further of course you can
run on mobile on on tablets and phones
of course our laptops or desktop PCs or
TVs or cars fridges watches whatever
it's it's like it's of course it's
important that you that you support like
all these screen resolutions with
something like responsive web design but
also this implies that not all of these
devices are like very powerful lower
Android smartphones have
really poor performance in terms of like
running all this JavaScript that you
need to run a full angular application
and if your users are actually like
using almost only old Android phones
might be not that good of an idea so
when we have like set up our ends
assumptions about devices what kind of
connections today usually have what what
kind of quality is behind it are they
when they are flying in helicopter they
are most likely like using some mobile
communications which could be really
flaky if there are Tom they may be used
like some Wi-Fi or when I'm at work I
may be using Ethernet connections so the
the less the less good the connection
quality is the more I have to think
about is it really a good idea to ship
like big amounts of javascript / over
the internet to like get to the get to
the clients so it might be too much to
choke for him so you have to think about
that another important thing is what is
there actually user intent they want to
like achieve a certain problem no they
want to solve a certain problem and your
application wants to help him with that
so how does he usually start interacting
with your with your application is it is
it like from a from a bookmark because
he la already knows about your
application or is he kind of searching
for like the latest nike air max
whatever special shoes and he is like
going over google and then he goes like
into your application immediately if you
have like more kind of these scenarios
you always have to keep in mind that
every time he jumps forth and back you
have like a little bit of ramp up you
have to do because you have to like load
oldest javascript stuff so how long do
they actually stay the longer they stay
the better for for us as
terms of like do when we want to use
angular actually because like this the
low time we need and the the time that
needs to pass by before before he sees
actually anything is probably better
what is not that important if he's like
just going through this phase once like
loading loading the application whatever
2.5 seconds and the longer he stays the
more this isn't a problem if he's just
like going up in and out then this might
be a really big problem and it's
measurable no yeah on development you
should always do such things that was a
screenshot from the chrome developer
tools and you can see how your page is
building up and where's your again with
your business model where does the user
work on on what time of the page yeah if
your business model is actually
depending on really really lots of users
because you want them to pay for
anything whatever and then you should
care for reach and reach you can
actually gain with compatibility for
starters so the more browsers you
support the batter there that is kind of
a problem doesn't have to be a problem
but can be a problem if you have to
support whatever like Internet Explorer
8 or on the underneath it because in
this job support for these kind of all
the browsers this doesn't mean that like
you have to care about these things but
if like a good amount of your users are
actually using these things and actually
buy stuff over it and you might think
about from other options so another
thing oh yeah and it gets worse on
mobile of course we just like talked
about old Android phones it's like yeah
it's it's not only like totally cutting
off the the feature support for all the
browsers but only also like maybe the
browser can run your your JavaScript
application but it suffers so much
because it's not powerful
enough it's like no good at all another
thing you can gain reaches like by
robustness and when we speak about web
technologies you usually have because
the medium is like very faulty you
usually have like in terms of HTML and
CSS and JavaScript some some good
support in terms of fault tolerance so
hTML is faltering by by itself so you
can like do programming errors produce
invalid markup and the browser will fix
stuff it's like not that not that bad of
course you sometime have funny rendering
issues but you're pretty safe on that
when it comes to CSS it's like pretty
much the same but you have to be more
careful because when browser for example
doesn't support like CSS animations and
your before the animation triggers move
something out of the viewport and the
browser does not support like moving
that stuff back then you're ending up
with like some content that is hidden
and not visible at all but when it comes
to JavaScript it like turn it flips
actually because the slightest mistake I
may can lead to like a total blank page
which is like not cool of course now we
do not want that but the likeliness for
when I'm using single page applications
is pretty high because like all the
client side rendering and stuff will
lead to an empty page for if it's like
really going to crash or whatever so
another big big thing that you should
think about when we're speaking about
reach the circus is accessibility
actually and when you do think that
accessibility is like not your problem
you might have a look at the number on
the right because when you're going for
lots of users you might be surprised how
much they spend and it's like when it's
not for moral or ethical reasons that
you would like to make your site or
application accessible you should at
least think about like their their
annual aggregate income and it's easy to
screw these things up
because we can build like beautiful
stuff now for example if you have like
these super beautiful range sliders you
might be tempted to build these with
like a div and another dip in a diff in
a diff and then like attached some
handlers and whatever and then make them
like Riku but the point is that when you
want to support accessibility the best
thing you could actually do is like use
semantic markup so instead of like
throwing everything into this you might
be better off with something like this
and actually relying on real input and
and real input types that actually fits
you problems so when you going for a
semantic markup you are like halfway
there for all the parts where this
doesn't apply you can use something like
why aria that's a standard that brings
in another set of HTML attributes that
you can attach to your to your elements
and that makes sure that screen readers
or other assistive technologies can can
do something meaningful with with your
component or whatever and in angular you
have like the opportunity to use the ng
aria module for example that can help
with that it's like not the silver
bullet for this so just by throwing it
in doesn't like solve all your problems
but you have to keep this in mind and
maybe like do a little more and overall
all these all these goals all these all
these things I could do to increase
reach also include SEO reasons of course
because wet like when the crawlers
coming by and your site is like empty
like totally because like content is
going to be loaded sometimes that is
kind of a big deal if you like living
from this business model that someone
comes over Google and like wants to
actually do something on your page so
you can you can prevent this stuff by
throwing in something in the Hat element
like metatext for descriptions or some
some microformats
are supporting Twitter or Facebook stuff
that enables like easy linking and
indexing your page or you could use
something like like a tool or a service
that like pre renders everything that
you that your application actually puts
out so you could use this but it's like
all of these problems all of these
things you had to to come up with like
when we're talking about reach you
wouldn't have in the first place if you
decided to do some things like on the
server because like server-side
rendering is very good at some things
they're like stinking old maybe but for
all of this stuff it's perfect we get
most of the things for free so you have
to think about these things yeah next
point is productivity developer
convenience ok angular is very good at
this you have a very very good
documentation tutorials which makes the
ramp-up face very good and you can
quickly get to something you can show to
others rapid prototyping yeah the dogs
are really good and but I have to ask
myself if see if I can handle my
problems with the structure angular
gives me the structure is there's a lot
of structure which angular gives you and
where you have to work with and maybe a
structure won't fit into your into the
angular models and you have to ask as
yourself too how much complexity
complexity cannot take and how fast can
I respond to problems because from the
docks it's like this it's very example
over the examples are very tiny and
shiny and cool and very powerful but at
the end you will have this stack of
JavaScript and how much complexity can
you
take can I respond to problems and bugs
quickly what is if one of these pipes
has has a hole and what have to do I
have to do to fix this it's it's very
complicated and the debugging is
completely on the front side you have no
clue what's from the backhand side
what's going on on the front end you
have tracing problems you have to do
this and and it is especially
problematic if you're not that familiar
was like the web technology or
JavaScript itself if you don't like
maybe a team of full of back-end
developers who say awesome angular has
like all these cool features but like I
do not know that much about JavaScript
when it comes to like these deeper
problems or errors it gets really nasty
and and cumbersome to like fix them and
getting to know what what's going on and
stuff so the good message is you have a
very active community and you can expect
help from them they are very active and
in the last year's here community was
always very helpful but I think if
angular 2 becomes more stable and is
officially released and so on you have
the focus will move to that and you have
to still solve your angular 1 problems
if you want my great 22 but it's very
complex situation the components and
plugins you have are our endless you
have so many things like English and
Slade ng area you mentioned it and for
everything here boots trap jquery-ui
google material and so on so you can
profit from that the most the most
common components have have good support
you can always see how much contributors
they have and rely on that
and one thing that gives that to you is
that your rapid prototypes are are very
good and I can validate assumptions I
made about my users I can really get
them some user interface and test or
what I expected from them or what they
should how they should use it and yes
that supports my age environment my HR
process and you have faster
time-to-market because you can say we
have this set of features and we'll
release that and add some features later
on yes yeah inspect it that is it can
you skip one bank and that is especially
like very important if you have if you
have that product in mind when you have
a maybe a UX team or something that is
like quickly one definitely one quickly
a quick feedback from the user if
certain things work because like maybe
we want to use like this the Select box
there or we want to use taps whatever
works better for like for pursuing my
business model and the sooner I get this
feedback back and can like change it
inside my application the batter so on
some things to keep in mind too yes and
the last one the basement we have the
the architecture we were building this
on you you know that you have good
control over your environment on the
back end but on the front and you have
to build this you have to type your
arrows your console to the backend to
see what errors occur on the front end
and but you have no clue about how the
render performance is and how how much
that reaches on that what they develop a
cease and what he develops some fluids
user interfaces will they appear on the
client side too
we don't know if you don't measure this
and pass this to the backend for example
you have a wire transfer it's one of the
worst cases and you won't send something
money and something go wrong and you
have a user which looks at a spinner and
he think maybe I have sent some money
but it cannot be sure what should i do I
have to handle this case if i don't
respond handle this in my front and
nobody will handle this and of course
the dependency management this
application here is a bit older and I
think the update of this won't be very
easy it would take some weeks i think to
read all these obvious dependency this
is not a full list but if i have read
all the dependencies with a match
together where they work together and
sometimes happens a lot on the project
and sometimes they don't respect to the
version numbering and we have to test it
there's always a lot of dependence is
not on which I deliver to the front end
but also on the back end on the
developer tools the developers which use
of the tools and libraries and so on
they have also there must also be
updated and this is especially
cumbersome if you're like working with
multiple teams and you have to set up
yourself or with others and you have to
decide can we update like this this
commonly used you tap component whatever
to the newest versions and then maybe
some of them are saying yeah okay why
not and some of them say probably we
shouldn't change these things right now
and then you have to think about like
all these dependencies of these
transient dependencies which can get
updated too and in terms of stability
when it comes to like making a a product
which is like stable like a released
version of it this this these things can
get really nasty
you have to keep in mind another thing
you should have a heavy focus on it's
like do I have to integrate with other
stuff we saw on the on the slide before
like this old building are there some
legacy services or are they even is
there even in an architecture or a or a
application that actually consists of
multiple applications it's more like a
system so for example like you have a
really big web shop and for you have a
lots of users and you decide to build
multiple applications into 1 into 1 UI
for example you build one application
there's one team that is actually
building a search and one is like
responsible for building the shopping
cart and another one could be
responsible for building the product
catalog and in these scenarios I might
be tempted to like decide I will do like
the shopping cart and angular because i
like it whatever but i do have to think
about how it's like the rest of the of
the team's like handling their stuff
maybe the product catalog is a play app
or anything else that is like
server-side rendered how do i integrate
with this especially when the users like
jumping between these like putting stuff
in the shopping cart and back is like
really painful if you like having all
this overhead to ramp up your
application inside an application so you
have to think about is it is it a good
idea to do it like this or maybe you
decide you do the whole shop as a single
application your web a single page
application and then like do tiny
modules and every and every team is like
sitting on a module and developing it
then you sure have like all these these
communication overhead you have to like
this settling on certain dependencies
and stuff when do we integrate
and yeah these are definitely things you
have to keep in mind because is it okay
to create a monolith in the first place
so when you decide to do this actually
like having if a single page application
for the whole shop for example you have
a the time is pressing you have a fast
time-to-market so you may be to keep
things easy it's totally fine and valid
to go for to go for egg monolithic
application but in the later and when
I'm like have to scale different parts
individually it's like pretty pretty
complex to do to untie this ball of
rubber especially if they're like three
teams involved in this rubber ball and
they all want to like achieve their
goals with their sub parts of the system
and yeah that's kind can get a kind of a
problem so you have to account for that
somehow and think about it yeah and one
thing is this capability is always
something I handle in the back end but
of where it's very easy i can put put
mail or more web servers with my
services for this more service for the
services on so on and load balancers but
do i have to expect some sky bility
problems in the front end and yes of
course you can have those too it's very
easy because if you think of the the
shopping example you can effort testing
environment with 100 items on one
shopping shopping page which displays
the catalogue button on this service on
the production side later on you have
thousands of products and you run in
problems like the to 2000 watch our
problems problem you run into the
problem
which makes your page very slow and you
ran in to really problems to surface one
thing is the one way binding angular
introduced introduced and angular 2 will
solve some of that problems too with
another architecture approach ok to wrap
this thing up to get a successful
project you have to know your business
and you have to ask to ask the right
questions you have to compare your
options what should I do to achieve my
my goats and these these options by the
way sorry these options by the way can
not only be like just angular or or
ember or any other single page
application you also might compare it to
like some server side stuff because you
saw a lot of a lot of situations where
it's like not only it's probably not the
best idea to use it like this and then
you have to compare it with something
like raise or play or spring MVC or
whatever and you should when you're
asking like all these questions maybe
make a list or something like that and a
little a little extra sheet or whatever
and then compare it like these things
and sometimes you have to make
trade-offs and you have to prioritize
because some things are like more
important than other things sometimes
may be the oldest UI stuff that comes
with it are like are really really
really important to you because you want
to compete with others and sometimes
sometimes maybe security usability
reasons are like your main concern so
yeah yeah so and you have to cite as a
team because they have to use those
technology you will introduce and you
should take them let them take part of
decision yeah so angular is not a silver
bullet maybe a solution for you but of
course not always that's what you want
yeah we totally speeded things up sorry
I hope you're not too mad that we are
like 20 20 minutes earlier so you can
either like have questions and put them
in the app or holler is a Twitter or
come come by we can go have a coffee
outside and discuss maybe your problems
or your experiences with angular and
yeah thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
