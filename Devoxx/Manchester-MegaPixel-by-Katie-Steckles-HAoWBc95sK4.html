make sure hi so my name is Katie and I
guess to give myself an introduction I
should probably describe myself in some
way probably the best thing to say is
I'm a mathematician which is to say that
I did maths at school and at university
and at the end of uni I decided that was
still not enough mass for me so I
carried on deliberate of research into
maths and now essentially my job is to
talk about maps so I go into schools I
do sessions at science festivals I talk
about maths on YouTube on the radio on
the TV basically anywhere that people
will allow me to talk about maths
up to and including in the street so if
you see me being enthusiastic about
maths that is completely normal and I've
come to basically share with you a
project that I worked on as part of the
Manchester science festival that's just
gone in 2016 which I thought you might
be interested in kind of kind of a
stupid thing that we did and I thought
it would be a bit of fun to kind of tell
you a little bit about it so essentially
the idea behind this was to try and give
people a bit of an insight into the way
that display screens work so LCD
displays are anything that's like a TV
screen a phone camera tablet anything
that have a screen on it will display an
image using you know particular way it
was hopefully some of you probably be
aware of but in order to prove this to
you I have a microscope and I'll get my
phone here and hopefully to show you
what it looks like under a microscope so
I'll see if I can get this to zoom in to
the right level I'm just going to work
something's happening there we go so if
i zoom that right in you should
hopefully be able to see the weight of
that image is made up I'm going to turn
the brightness up on my screen because
that's probably helpful there we go if I
go in far enough it's something like 400
times zoom you can see that it's
starting to blur into a mixture of
colors and in fact at the right depth
you can see it's actually made up of red
green and blue segments and in fact the
logo for the megapixel is split into red
green and blue that's hopefully giving
you an indication of why and this is not
quite working as it it's not my finest
moment
let's all be very proud of me oh there
we go gay man it's okay I've got a slide
it's fine so this is what it should look
like and it turns out if you look at any
screen under a microscope you basic I
know what was going on putting the wrong
dial it's obviously a while since I've
done this let's try that again there we
go just to prove to you that this
genuinely works as a letter and there's
just about the red green and blue the
main problem with this is that I'm not
physically capable of standing still
enough but you can get the idea there
and if I look at a part of the screen
that's blue you can see that it does
that by only lighting up the blue
segments of the display and obviously
you can make various different colors by
combining them so I've got some very
screenshots this is my phone this is my
laptop screen which is quite nice this
is a screen that was on a really old
school arcade game in a bar in London
and in fact this is used in other things
as well so LED lighting in kind of
venues and things will use a mixture of
red green and blue light to create
different colors and it turns out you
can actually do this and I've got a red
torch or green torch and a blue torch
which if you combine them in different
ways of a little Venn diagram I can
shine them onto as well but if you mix
them together you will get a different
colour of light in between you can just
about see yellow happening in the middle
there of the red and green and in fact
this is a fairly well-known thing that
you can mix colors in this way and that
you store images by the red green and
blue components of the image and it's
effectively just a massive spreadsheet
of red green and blue and in fact I had
a slightly impressive demo that I can
sometimes do I'm not going to do it
today because it involves a strobe
effect and I'm never sure who's in the
room but it is basically a set of poor
you know the spinning juggling things
that you can spin which flash red green
and blue intermittently and if you hold
them up they just look white but in fact
if you actually spin them you get this
really nice sort of split effect so
these are all the ways that we're
needing to illustrate two people that
light is made up of red green and blue
but what we wanted to do is something to
get people really hands-on with this and
to get them to think about this
process and why why this happens and how
the screen is actually choosing to
display the image and store the image as
a bitmap with those kind of three values
for red green and blue and we decided
that when we could do this is with
pennies and you can see in this image
we've got basically a pixel which is a
sort of square block split into three
chunks each of those chunks of 100
segments and if you have a percentage
red green and blue for each pixel you
can color in with red pen green pen and
blue pen and then fill in the rest with
black and we decided to try and do this
on a massive scale so we wanted to
create an entire photograph in a window
using just these pixels and getting
people to color them all in so we got
some support from various different
organizations and so it's part of
Manchester Science Festival adding
genuinely sent us 2010 which we could
not have done it without them and the
University of salt had put in some
funding and I've literally got a massive
bag of pens donated so you're all
getting free pens if you on them and
this was the window that we decided to
try and do this in so it's about 10
meters high it's about 6 meters across
and we're hoping that we could fill this
whole thing with pixels we want it to
have a pixels of a reasonable kind of 9
or 10 centimeters big and if you do that
you can fit 72 by 120 pixels in this
window which seems like a reasonable
number of pixels it's not very many at
all it's like that so we have to choose
our image quite carefully and 72 by 120
is 8640 which is the total number of
pixels that we would need so it's kind
of a small number but it's also kind of
a big number so for each pixel we have
basically a little square of acetate
which we printed up with the kind of the
black outline and the words red green
and blue and then we also printed using
some kind of horrific SVG mail-merge
type thing some stickers which contained
a QR code so it could easily identify
which pixel we were looking at the RGB
values for that pixel as a percentage
out of 100 the location in X&amp;amp;Y a little
space for someone to write their name
and then a kind of an ID number for that
pixel and we produced you know 8640 of
these
we call it a lot of them in we reuse
these ending pens so they're like we try
to use sharpies because that would that
was my sort of original for but we asked
Sharpie about this and they were like no
so I'm very grateful to adding for
actually giving us the Pens but the
problem we had was that the red green
and blue that we were using were not
exactly computer red green and blue they
were not to 5500 so we kind of
essentially had to recalculate all of
our RGB values in order to use these
particular pens so we looked at what
color you got if you colored in some
acetate with this pen and then took a
photograph of that backlit to see what
actual color we would get if we did 100
percent red and it's not kind of a full
computer red and what you essentially
end up with is I've kind of cut this
down to two dimensions so let's just
just think about red and blue to start
with so blue on this axis red on that
axis you can kind of think of every
point in RGB space as a point here so
you've got the amount of red and the
amount of blue and if it's a 3d space
you've got the amount of green as well
and our red is sort of quite red but not
completely so it's maybe somewhere sort
of out there it's quite a dark red spot
and our blue was again not quite the
exact blue that we were after but it was
somewhere off that what you essentially
then end up with is a vector pointing to
that point and the vector pointing to
that point this is kind of the new axes
for our grids because I can't just add
an amount of red I can only amount add
an amount of that particular red so I've
got effectively a new grid and I'm
saying that any point in there could be
defined as this many of the red pen and
this many of the blue pen and in fact
anything that's outside of that space we
can't do you would need a negative
amount of red pen it's also to color
that in you color the entire thing black
and then you color some more black that
doesn't exist I guess and yeah that
means that we're kind of constrained in
in what colors we can use but we did
various testing so we had an entire
testing evening at my flat Louis pizza
and we put up some pixels literally on
my bedroom window and we could we
managed to get this which is reasonable
it was kind of a sort of rainbow effect
it was also meant to be a photograph of
something but it was really not very
good and you can kind of see the colors
there I think probably further away in
the room you'll get a slightly better
effect
on that but that was sort of a test to
see how well it was looked back with we
also did a test at the Museum of Science
and Industry on a slightly different
window which came out really well I was
very happy about this so that's is a bit
of a robots face essentially because the
actual picture that we've used in the
end was a big photo of a robot and this
is looking pretty smug that that has
just about worked but the whole project
was essentially we had to get so many
people involved we had schools that were
coloring in pixels for us so we put
together little packs with a you know a
bunch of pens and some pixels and the
information that they needed to color
those in and then also some activities
that they could do in class looking at
the way the images are stored and
handled and you know playing around with
colored torches and so on and all the
schools we posted them out to about half
of them posted them back again thanks
guys so the rest of the pixels we had to
do at the Museum during the week of the
Science Festival and we essentially set
up a little table in the entrance to the
museum anyone who came in during a whole
week we gave them a pixel and told them
to color it in give it back to us and it
was a really nice way for everyone to
get involved I think because you kind of
feel like you're part of something
because you've done a thing and giving
it in and that's now become part of a
much bigger thing but pretty much
everyone who came in learned a little
bit about how screens work we had a
camera there so they could look at their
own phone screen and it was a nice sort
of way to engage with people and get
them involved but it mean you want to
see the finished thing go you want to
see what happened this this ridiculous
project so we had a photograph of a
robot which was our image that we were
going to do so this was the original
photo that we took we deliberately
picked this because our green pen is
very dark green it's like almost black
and it's a real shame because sharpies
have much brighter green but Eddings are
great so we use the the fairly dark
green heading and we realized that meant
we weren't going to be able to get any
sort of bright yellows or greens if
we're to pick something that has
probably a fair amount of dark blue and
red in it but enough variation that it
would look good we can't you can get a
reasonable white but the white is quite
pinkish just because of how we can't get
that much green into it
so this is our photo that we went with
and we figured it's got so quite a
recognizable shape to it it's got a lot
of detail but also a lot of big chunks
of color which hopefully is going to
work so I think if you d read that down
to 72 by hundred and twenty it's still
still pretty good still got a reasonable
detail we also had a little gadget that
we built that would let us preview what
something would look like as pixels
which gave us this image is quite dark
and again this is because of the dark
green but if i zoom in you can see that
is sort of generated using random
layouts and we basically anticipated
that people would not necessarily put
the pixels in a in a block within the
shape they basically said people are
welcome to do whatever layout of within
100 squares which have a combination of
those that they wanted to do as long as
it's not a picture of a penis we were
basically fine with pretty much anything
a few people tried to like write
messages and stuff but we didn't have a
policy that we were going to reject
anything that looks vaguely rude and we
did all right no one actually tried
anything too risque with us but people
did like regular patterns and they
enjoyed kind of spacing out and I think
the groups in the schools have fun with
it as well because you could be like
okay we've got to do 42 oh about 6 times
7 should we do seven blocks of 6 and
things like that so they're a little bit
of fun with the maps as well and yeah
again this is this is quite a big number
so the schools groups sent us back some
pictures of them doing it which is
really nice here the pictures of the
kids coloring in there's another group
in America that did some as well and
they sent us this nice photo of everyone
sitting in front of something much more
high-powered at displaying images than
what we're attempting to do here making
a sauce of the entire thing and this is
a Mac of basically where all of the
pixels came from so we had various
schools out in the u.s. we had a couple
in Europe and a lot of people in the UK
I essentially just emailed everyone I
could think of that might be up there
doing a thing and we got quite a lot of
responses and in fact if I go bigger on
the UK you can see we've got quite a
good spread there as well in fact the
the best set we got sent back was from
Orkney Science Festival and literally
every single pixel had the same guy's
name on it because he just sat there and
colored all
I think it's 64 pixels in a block so he
called them all himself which is
adorable and everyone had colored in a
pixel got a sticker
which they might just take over and
where and it was you know it's a nice
little mentor for them we've also done a
video about this if you're interested in
finding out more or hearing me explain
the same things again so this is Matt
Parker who does various math things and
I worked with him quite often and he was
kind of a pseudo consultant on this
project cuz it was inspired by a
ridiculous spreadsheet that he made a
little while ago and I've done a bit
leaf for that so that you can have a
look at that video and in fact I'm sure
I did a slide for this oh it's just
deleted itself great I have got a github
link for the code that we used to do
this because essentially we had to take
the photograph and pull out the numbers
from it which this we have a little
gadget that does this for a while
because Matt used it to make a
spreadsheet but we pulled out the
numbers from kind of a JPEG and produced
the the kind of RGB values that we would
need for each pixel we also had a full
database that was done SQL that was
storing every single pixel and whether
or not it's been colored yet and so on
and we also built and I don't know why
we tried to do this but it was actually
quite useful in the end a pixel checker
so we had a webcam pointed at a backlit
box that I laser-cut was very proud of
it and you could put a pixel in there
and it would photograph it and then it
would compare that photograph to the
entry in the database saying what colors
it should be and you could we did some
form of image recognition that basically
meant we could count how much red green
and blue there was in the pixel looking
at the bit that we thought was going to
be colored red how much of that is
actually red and and we've got a roof it
wasn't perfect but we've got a very
rough thing that would tell us if we put
a pixel in whether someone had done it
right or not so as people were coloring
them on the day we anticipated quality
control issues but as people were
coloring them in we basically had to
scan them and then if it was completely
wrong we'd go off thank you very much
that's great and then just put it in the
bin and get another one because that's
how you deal with the public it's great
so in my one remaining minute I will
show you the finished megapixel so this
is the photo I'm going to fade out the
photo so you can see what it's meant to
look like it's it's not amazing
I will prep you but it kind of just
about work so here is the finished
megapixel
on the window so I've got a red bit down
there for the foot you can just about
see the dial on the front and face and
stuff in fact the one guy in Orkney
there's a bit just in the middle like
between the robot's eyes where all of
the pixels are very regular and just
colored in down the middle that was that
guy we were kind of hoping that it would
be spread across people so that they
would be random but he just did in a
very regular way which was super
unhelpful but if you would like to find
out more about this project there is a
website at Manchester megapixel comm
we've got a converter there that you can
produce your own numbers we've got
principal grids so you can make tiny
versions of this with 10 10 pixels for
each color and have fun with this and
explore and I'll put the link to the
github on there as well so you can have
a look at the code if you want</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
