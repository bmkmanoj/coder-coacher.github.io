think for a second how much you've
communicated with each other just this
week you know you walk up to someone and
you just know what to say something
comes to mind you have a question or you
want to share some information with them
so the question is why do we have
difficulty then writing we're also
communicating there and what can we do
about it you know my theory is the
challenge with technical writing is not
really with the communication itself
we're good at that we have that down but
rather it's the constraints that we're
imposing on ourselves when we try to
write we're suffocating that writer
that's inside of us and as a result we
suffocate our writing so like
programmers right we're programmers
let's hack our way out of this mess with
a few tricks they get our fingers and
our brains working together you know so
that we can write more fluently so the
first rule number one is to write in
plain tex so free your mind by what you
want to do is you want you have the
information your head the information is
in all of our heads that we want to
write once we've written something it's
rare that that information wasn't there
somewhere buried deep inside so we want
to use the closest format that we can
use to thought okay so that's plain text
and it's funny that we use this
providing source code but when it comes
to writing content we tended to take a
different approach so if you're writing
let's say an ASCII doc for example
perhaps even markdown but I i I'm more
inclined to choose a ski doc you're
you're you're already employing the
primary thing that I do personally to
hack my brain to write fluently so if
you're doing that super if not your
journey with with plain text starts now
and so all the hacks that follow after
rule number one um become possible when
you switch over to doing plain text for
writing so using a plain text format
like a ski doc what it's all about is
your efficiently encoding that
information transcribing really into its
purest form that's something else that's
really there it's in its raw source code
really the source code of writing and
there's little to no
ceremony to get it going you know when
we pick programming languages we tend to
choose conciseness is a key factor for
deciding one over the other so we want
to make sure that we we choose also a
good language you know you don't want to
have a language this is overly verbose
so you could you could like in perhaps X
XML writing an XML to writing code in
Java which is much more verbose than
perhaps saying something groovy or Scala
etc and you also lose language you know
you don't have as much access to
powerful language features so we want to
choose our writing language like we
choose our programming language and
what's what's critical about this you
know going to plain text and is that
it's a clean separation now from the
content in the presentation I hear a lot
of companies a lot of projects that that
they write their source code and they're
very proud of that of course but then
they turn around and they talk about
their source code and they choose
something like wordpress and I sort of
want to challenge you as programmers and
IT people to say why aren't you using
the same techniques that you use for
writing your code when you write content
why do you give it up and then just say
I'm just going to drag and drop stuff
around you don't do that for your source
code why are you doing it for your
content so we'll get to that later but
but just keep that in mind start
thinking about that but what we want you
to be able to do is focus on very
minimal content and get a really
beautiful result so we like to say that
with a ski doc you can write once and
you can publish everywhere so whether
it's HTML or PDF or whatever all that
comes later so when you're writing
you're not writing for writing in PDF
you're writing for capturing the content
then you can convert it so when we move
from paper and pencil to the computer
you know kind of we gain some things you
know we gained a lot of things like for
instance not having to rewrite the
entire thing to edit it remember there
was a time when we had to do that but we
lost a lot of things too and one of the
things that we lost was the ability just
to kind of whip out a piece of paper and
just jot down some notes start
scribbling our ideas down or at least we
lost this capability for a couple of
decades getting tied up in all all this
other crap so what is some of that one
of that stuff that was going on well all
of a sudden you need to think about
things like
the file name where you want to store in
the file system you wanted to make sure
that you were saving constantly until
autosave sort of came around but worse
than that is you had a interface think
about something like word for a second
where all of a sudden you had to worry
about formatting in order to do any
writing you had to worry about the
structure of something and how it was
going to be what font you were using
what what you know what size of the
phone etc before you could even start
thinking about writing anything and you
had features like autocorrect and
grammar correction that was just
basically always prodding you to do
something irrelevant because this is not
writing someone had said this last night
writing is not editing and it's very
important to think about that when
you're writing who cares if it's crappy
who cares if it's wrong as long as it's
true and so the most important thing is
to get that information out of your head
you'll edit it and make it beautiful and
sound wonderful later and we'll get to
those tips so you know basically what
I'm saying was lost is that all of a
sudden we had to satisfy some tool that
we were using and make it happy so that
we could write when in fact the goal of
this is to write comfortably so and then
some tried to write in languages or like
xml and HTML and docbook and stuff like
that and we put so much damn clutter in
between the words that you're trying to
write and everything else it's there
that you start to just lose the words so
it this is part of what I'm saying
demotivates you as a writer or you start
to think this is a very difficult thing
you know when you write source code when
you're going to whip out and write a
program real quick you know you can get
right to it and you're not you know the
ideas really help you get into the flow
that's the lead so we're just trying to
do the same thing here so ask a doc in
the other hand is a very approachable
language and it's a very approachable
format and this is going to be important
if we're talking about motivation for
writing so the way that I like to look
at it just makes a lot of sense for
writers and it makes sense to writers so
if you look at this for instance you can
see kind of the general structure of
this and I don't even really have to
teach you about a ski doc if you don't
know it already you would kind of
understand what each part
already you know you can you can see
that that a paragraph is just a
paragraph and that it's spaced out by
other paragraphs and you can do list the
way that we write them down on a piece
of paper we just put little stars and we
write stuff after it so this is this is
a nice starting point right it's it kind
of gets out of your way but the other
thing is that is that ask a doc love
source code and so since we're often
writing about technical things that
include source code then it should have
features right out of the box native
that say yes we recognize source code
and we do things with it you know we can
syntax highlight it we can include parts
of it from a from a language one of the
great examples is like the groovy
documentation all the source code
examples that you see in the groovy
documentation are actually being pulled
from the test suite there is nowhere in
the documentation that someone copied
and pasted sample source code directly
into the document and think about now
when you're writing that you don't have
to go find where you want a copy paste
paste it in and then worry when you're
writing whether that that still compiles
so you want to separate those things out
so there's some nice workflow things
here but what's beautiful about is that
it's just source code so you can do all
the things that you do with your source
code now with your content so it's easy
to pass around and share it's easy to
check in to get you already have kind of
a workflow with you know something like
github where you can work with other
people and you don't have to have some
sort of way of doing that you don't need
a SharePoint or some Dropbox or whatever
you just put it in to get just like you
do your source code you have a way to
collaborate on you can track the changes
etc so we'll talk more about some of
those workflows later but it's really
really important that you know this you
know this system this is something you
already know so you're going to be less
worried and less anxious about writing
if it's something you already know so
the idea here in my mind is that you
want to write writing fluently is about
channeling the thoughts directly from
your fingertips into the computer just
like we used a pen or pencil before when
we were you know in our in our youth so
speak that's why I just love plain text
because it makes me feel like I'm
writing on a piece of paper but yet i'm
getting all the benefits that i have
that computer has the good benefits I
mean the good things about the computer
so for instance you can automate and you
can as I mentioned you can use workflows
like yet but above all I'm writing i
just opened up a document and there I go
now I tend to like to use them and one
of the reasons that I use them is
because it's probably the fastest
application that I can possibly start
and for me as soon as I have a thought I
wanted to be recorded and so especially
because you you know writing sort of
hits you it's sort of passion that comes
you have an idea you want to get it down
I'm not going to wait for an IDE to
start but if you prefer that or if you
already have an IDE open and that's your
your home base so to speak then you can
do that too I don't have to tell you
what tools you can use you get to use
whatever you want so okay so we've got
it open but we still ok we still don't
know what to put onto the page maybe the
cursor sort of blinking back at us going
okay fill me in so we don't know yet so
what do we do there so act number two is
to answer a question so if you think
about it for a second most of us are
okay with writing emails I mean ever do
you think okay so you may have some
difficulty emails but but never you
think you know what I said I try to
write emails and like I get blanks
rarely does this happen week burned
through you know 20 40 50 emails a day
so we're constantly doing it and we
that's writing but for some reason we
don't think of it that way and I have a
hypothesis as to why this is the case
and how we can leverage this but the
same thing is true for let's say a
social network for Twitter you you you
simply you know see the box and it says
hey what's happening you feel in the
blank so you're really communicate again
so what I'm saying before is you walk
around the conference you talk to each
other no problem you go to the social
networks or emails you you right no
problem you write the documentation
problem okay so now we're getting closer
to the documentation we sell me crack
the nut yet what is it that is
preventing us from being able to write
notice something about
all these forms of communication that
aren't writing the documentation and
there are responses to questions now
when we sit down to write a long-form so
such as a readme our tutorial we clam up
but think about that for a second we are
writing a readme or we're writing a user
manual let's let's use the the example
user manual better I'm going to write a
user manual no you're not is there is no
such thing it was a user manual a user
manual is the thing that exists once
you're done and people refer to it as
the user manual but the user manual
isn't a thing right that what it is is
it's answers to questions that people
have that's what it is collectively it a
grits to become a user manual but what
it is is answers to people's questions
that's what a user manual really is its
answers to their questions so you know
the answers to questions so what
questions they have you know are you
letting your project sort of keep stack
overflow in business or you know
something equivalent some forms or are
you actually thinking about what those
questions are that people have so you
want to write like you're answering a
question one of the ways to do that is
to sort of think what might people want
to know about this project and so you
ask yourself you write this down that's
the first thing you write not the answer
but you write the question okay and the
question is just sitting there now you
have the question up there and the box
below it but now notice the box bloat is
not just a blinking cursor on a white
screen the box below it is waiting for
you your knowledge what's in your head
it's sort of like a person coming up to
you a conference and saying hey what was
your favorite talk this week right
immediately your brains working your
brains working on an answer if someone
came up to you and they just stared at
you then you know you'd clam up what's
going on this is weird okay so ask
yourself what are they probably asking
so example on how do i install their
project so you think yourself how do you
install a project well you have to type
a wait a minute no wait that's right
there's some prerequisites do you have
prerequisites so then you write a
question above the question and so what
I'm what I like to do is I like to start
out with a whole bunch of questions and
then I answer the questions when I'm
done answering the questions I change
all the questions to statements
I change how do you install your project
i wish i had another slide here that
change that but anyway it would say what
might we say how to install the project
you could say installation or how do you
install the project case you come up so
basically you just go back those your
titles those are your sections you know
maybe their major sections by
intersections etc but your questions
become your sections and then your user
manual the aggregate when this is all
done is actually useful because it's
really answers to questions now
sometimes you do that you still there's
a problem because you still don't spend
a lot of time in the editor writing so
how can we hack this a little further
when we say well you're writing email
all the time so instead of writing the
question into a document why don't you
send yourself an email like someone
asked you a question hey I tried to
install the project and I don't
understand how to do it how do I do it
and then you say hey this is an email I
just read a response so you start
writing a response and you said and you
know and so you don't have to send
yourself an email that's one hack but a
lot of times we'll spend time on mailing
lists and what's funny is you've ever
been to the case where someone doesn't
understand and you start explaining it
and then you're like all wait now I have
to explain this to and then this long
email is about to go the mailing list
stop don't send us the mailing list copy
it paste it make a new documentation
page and then send them a link to the
documentation aha now we found a hack to
get ourselves to basically not bore
everyone with these long responses and
get documentation at the same time so
this is this is definitely a good
practice and also it's effective right
it also is the hack so the key right is
that we need to find a way basically to
get information pouring out of our head
into the into the computer and I think
the questions are the most powerful tool
to do that when you're stuck plus you
know the other thing that I like about
the question is is now when you're
writing you know when you're supposed to
be done because if the answer is if you
answered it then you move on you go to
the next thing okay so moving on so then
and so now we're flowing we're in the
flow of it
have a trick which you may not be doing
so maybe you had some of these ideas
this one I think is I I don't see it
around a lot and this idea of sentence
per lines this sort of a change your
world a little bit here because it did
for me so think about how you write code
right when you write code each statement
for the most part is on its own line
there's reasons that we do this but it's
also easier to read you know if we chain
like nine statements on on a line this
would be very difficult to do a lot of
things okay same thing with writing so
um unders now rough from the neo4j
project he introduced me to this thing
so neo4j project kind of like well he
said that he got it from someone was the
first time I ever saw it and they use
this for all their documentation and
this technique absolutely transformed my
writing process so in the sentence per
line you write a paragraph like you
would write a bulleted list so here's
here's how we would normally right we
might have the text just wrapping even
worse is if you wrap arbitrarily so at
80 lines were just going to truncate
this thing and force like I do a hard
rap okay so there are two ways of
potentially where you're coming from
this one does a soft rap so here we have
multiple sentences all jammed together
on into a single paragraph so the
sentence per line what it does is it
breaks them out so that they're all each
on their own line and you almost think
it's like a bulleted list except we took
rid of it we got rid of all the bullets
and since in a ski doc the the end lines
it just like an HTML or insignificant
they're just white space then then this
doesn't affect the output so no one's
going to read this like no one's going
to see all your sentence is now on their
own line in the published work so this
mode of writing absolutely is is
critical for doing a whole bunch of
things so what can you do well first of
all feels very natural because it
matches the way that we write code so
when I say we I'm talking about people
who would be writing code right so
you're used to that so why don't we do
the same thing it keeps changes
localized so i am very strongly against
arbitrary wrapping of content it's i
think it's a very very bad idea so and
here's the problem with it
let's say if you have a very long
paragraph and you change the first word
and the first word kicks the last word
in that sentence off that line and onto
the next slide and then when that new
word shows up in the second line it
kicks the word off that and that line to
the next one so now you change one word
in a paragraph and it looks like you
changed like 80 okay or you change the
whole bunch that's really really bad for
collaboration so in sentence per line
there's no way you could affect another
line because every lines got its own
identity okay so it becomes easier to
diff and it becomes less likely the
diffs are arbitrarily showing changes
what I call reflows so but here's the
really cool part just like in source
code you may say wait a minute this
statement needs to go above this
statement because that's the wrong order
will we do that in code sometimes but we
do it in writing a lot because to say
one thing and then want to say something
else and then say well no actually it
would be better if it was the other way
around we should have a way out in our
writing system that supports this so if
you see right here I can just use my
editor to just push a line and pull a
line push a line and pull line so I can
go up and down and I can even split like
this paragraphs getting kind of long
gangly so I can just basically put a
blank line in between two of the lines
and now I now they're in separate
paragraphs I can pull them back together
and can push them apart so we can do a
lot of things here and also open
something at the possibility of using
comments at the line level so we'll get
to that next now I realize that what I'm
about to say does depend on on the human
language that you're that you're writing
in it this for English at least it
encourages you to write shorter lines
now I understand that that languages
like German tend to be much much longer
words so therefore it's very very
difficult to fit everything on one
screen with so if it wraps if it's if
the line soft wrap that's okay okay you
can still tell the beginning of lines
from where wrap lines are you may get it
more often so it may make it a little
bit
more awkward to see here everything's
fitting on the screen with but this is
good because readers don't want to read
long sentences okay it's very tiring to
read long sentences so you want to
shorten your sentences and this
encourages that if your goal is to not
shorten the sentences but at least be
aware like shorten the sentence is to a
screen with your at least aware now of
the length of your sentences so maybe in
German you always it always wraps to two
lines for most of your sentences but
then you don't want it to rep to three
lines right so you're at least a what
you're counting subconsciously in your
head the length of lines so it's
important I think the other thing that's
really interesting about this is that it
warms up your writing because instead of
thinking about right sitting down to
write a paragraph is difficult because
it has to work right the whole paragraph
has to work there has to be a intro to
the paragraph it has to kind of go
somewhere and then kind of wrap up and
that can be difficult what we want to do
is we want to go go back to that idea of
dumping information down so a boarded
list is great we can do bulleted lists
all day long let me just go to and you
know go around too many of the talks
bulleted lists are very easy to create
so we you just create a bunch of bullets
all of the things that you know and then
you say okay the information is in front
of me now how do I organize it into
something that makes sense is a
paragraph so when you're doing sentence
per line you just remove all the bullets
now you already have sort of a paragraph
now you just move the lines around hey
you're getting closer and closer so what
we're doing is we're hacking our brains
to get closer and closer to the final
result without basically giving it all
the anxiety of having a produce up front
okay so this is highly recommended but
it also makes comments possible so one
of the great things about um ask a doc
is that it supports both line and block
comments just like you have in most
programming languages Java and C etc so
what this allows you to do is take
content out of the flow temporarily
permanently maybe was never intended to
be in the flow all the reasons that you
use comments in source code you use
comments and writing so there's no way
absolutely not a chance that I could
write anymore without having the ability
to comment
out content while I'm working on it so
my document has almost as much comments
in it as it has visible text and so
comments you can do all kinds of things
with them so let's think about what we
can use comments for well first of all
we could start out with ideas so we're
not even ready to write yet we just put
a comment block and we just start
jotting down a bunch of things that we
probably need to cover in this tutorial
maybe those questions I mentioned some
some some brainstorming they can be
notes they can be notes with yourself
thinking me notes with other people
reminders so I'll often do this I said
oh I need to go back at some point and I
need to add even like let's say when I'm
doing this talk and I'll put some of the
top Oh make that point so I just jot at
the top I was running by my computer and
I just jotted it down the top of the
document inside of a comment later all
integrated okay so kind of do this in
code 2 and what the key is that all of
this is directly adjacent to the source
code so there's the idea this is kind of
where I start often times at the top of
my document I'll just put a little to-do
list and this is like things that I need
to remember to do inside my document I
might be working on something and I go
this paragraph is just not working okay
I don't know how to fix it right now I
don't want to delete it so you can soft
delete it by just commenting the whole
thing out and maybe later i come back
and i put it back in but the other thing
that's really really interesting is to
be able to use it to comment on the
lines below and above a line so i'll use
this as i'm writing back and forth and
my wife like let's say that she picks up
the document and she's going to edit it
and before she starts changing my words
she might give me a chance to sort of
she just does like a you know a
development edit on it she'll basically
say here's where i think this needs to
go here's where i think this needs to go
so in this particular case we had a
paragraph i pulled this right out of the
work that we were doing we were writing
about we're writing out writing and we
said words are powerful tools and then i
got onto this other point she goes you
know so we'll do a line comment and then
she puts her initials that's how i know
that it's not just a comment that I had
made or
or commented outline but it was actually
her trying to talk to me and she says
hey look the next point this is the
wrong section so you need to go move
this so this is a really interesting
thing now if you imagine if we didn't
have sentence per line how can she get
her comment in between two sentences she
can't squeeze it in there and because we
have the same limitations as writing
source code we're working with plain
text okay we're in sit you were in the
the source we can't put something in the
margins because there is no margins
right everything is in the document
itself so this allows us to have margins
so to speak the other thing that we do
is rewrites so when you're writing you
you get to a point where you say I just
the sentences and working comment let me
try to rewrite it now that didn't work
comment rewrite it so i'll rewrite a
sentence like five or six or seven or
eight times trying to get it right but i
didn't delete all the other ones so i
can go back to my other work you know
what I think I had it number two number
two is it let's let's put that in I
uncomment all this the the ones i want
to keep delete all the others and I move
forward so this is really an interesting
way of being able to talk to you because
we're look we're negotiating with our
brain it's like how can i get these
sentences out of here and say oh well
let me just okay take a deep breath
rewrite the sentence no that didn't work
take a deep breath rewrite the sentence
okay i got at that time and then you you
get into why that's why i'm saying i kid
i can't right now without this because i
have to do this so um speaking of
getting stuck i want to share with you a
trick I've used my entire life and it's
funny because it's one of those tricks
whereas i was thinking about creating
this talk I said you know what I didn't
even realize I was doing this and I
don't know that I ever really told
anyone about it but people often say you
know when you write your your words are
very inspirational they're very moving
how do you do that and I said how do I
do that well we all have the ability to
be creative you know we're all musicians
were all writers etc but the ones that
can do it versus the ones that can to it
are the ones that
find that inspiration to get it to come
out right we call them creatives but
everyone's creative it's just a matter
of whether they're good at it or not so
how do you get creative well you get
creative by being inspired and one of
the ways that you get inspired in
writing is you see words that inspire
you so we are very connected with words
so when we hear a certain word we feel
in motion right and that's an amazing
thing so but when we're writing how do
we hear words I mean you can kind of a
mad oh well some people say oh I have a
voice in my head okay so not all of us
are that lucky where we just have
something in the back of our head and
we're just transcribing what it's saying
so how do we hear ideas so ever since
grade school I always SAT with us the
source at my size so the source will
basically say these are words that are
like that word and I kind of used the
word a little differently than most
people i use the word the source as mmm
these are associated words like this
doesn't actually mean that these are
just and I think that kind of we've
gotten to the point with some of the
tools where we're kind of that's kind of
what the source is it's like related
words okay not just exact definitions
but very very big so nowadays I don't
use I don't use that I use an online
tool I particularly like power thesaurus
right now I'm power of the source is
very is awesome because the bigger the
corpus of words the more effective the
tool is because we need to get like lots
of words in front of your face okay and
here's I'll explain why in a second but
first I want to say so I want to defend
the source so some people would would
tell me like when I was younger they
said how do you write and i said i use
it the source and they said that's
that's a terrible idea because it's
going to cause you just to use big words
that you don't know and your writing is
going to sound unnatural and you won't
have you'll have lost your voice okay
first of all that's don't
listen those people because that's just
not what we do as humans that that is
not going to happen to you a thesaurus
is not about trying to find big words
it's it's about trying to find the word
that you know is there it's in your head
but you just can't think of it right now
and a lot of times we get disrupted on
our writing because there were right
along and a word comes which we're like
aw life so imagine for a second going
back to that idea you're talking to
people and you wanted you're telling
this story and you forgot the word and
it's like you pause for a second and
then you realize that you're just
standing there saying nothing and that
you get anxious and your heart starts
beating faster right and you're hoping
that your brain is going to this word is
going to come to you and then you may
kind of go down a different path and say
okay I'll just say it another way but
you're frustrated because you're like
frustrated because i know that i was
going to say something but I can't
figure out what it is okay so this is
happening when we're writing all the
time so when you write your your kind of
listening to yourself think just like if
you were speaking to someone and you're
running down what's coming to you but
you know like I said just like when
you're standing there when you're
writing what do you do when you can't
find that word is it are you going to
let it disrupt you so that's where we
enter the source so the way that I do
this is that whenever this happens I
just use a pick a symbol so I use like
percent signs and I say so let's take a
simple example words peep something
people so we want to say something about
words like inspire people or something
wit there's a word there and as you're
writing you like I know I know what word
I want but I and I want it to be good
but I can't figure out what it is right
now so what I do as I say I leave a
place holder because I know that there
was a word there that I want and the
sentence now has structure and with this
may be a much longer sentence but we're
taking a very short example okay so what
do we do so then what we do is we open
up our thesaurus and we start shopping
because what we're doing is we're
ruffling through the closet of our mind
and we're trying to find the word that
has the meaning that we know is that we
sense the meaning that we want we just
don't know what the word is yet so what
you're doing is you're getting your
brain okay so if your brain sees the
word that wants it'll recognize it okay
so how do we recognize something if
we're not looking at it so we have to
start shopping and we have to go through
and like look at words and words and
words and words so we start paging
through all the results in this
particular case let's say we say oh it's
close to inspire but that's not the word
I
it's close to inspire 532 words okay
it's got to be in there so this is part
partly sort of a conscious and
unconscious sort of negotiation your
mind to find the words that you want and
so here's what we do is shop shop shop
and you want to listen to yourself say
the sentence with each word that kind of
comes up in the list I know I'm the
screen shot but imagine that it's giving
us like a bulleted list of all these
words so we say words blank people words
this people now that's not I would okay
oh that sounds good but I would never
say that so that goes back to people
saying you're just going to pick big
words now you're not because you will
you still want to say it you're writing
the documentation you're writing this
stuff down you're not going to pick
someone else's words you're going to
pick words that you have so because we
are emotionally connected two words we
won't pick words that don't make sense
okay and so finally we try them on we
say and we say words blank people words
move people yes that's what I want I
want to say that they move people they
get them to act that's what I wanted to
sort of get it crossed okay so this is
very very powerful now I use this all
the time and I also use it in in kind of
another way if I don't know what I want
to write about sometimes I'll start
browsing through the thesaurus just to
see words because me seeing the words
makes me inspired sometimes certain
words that you know that have some sort
of a memory they're linked to a memory
they can get me going so I kind of
always keep power thesaurus open I'm
always looking through words now you
will learn words so that's good you're
expanding your vocabulary you'll be like
oh I didn't know that word what that
means that's kind of interest it sounds
cool but I don't know what it means you
look it up so you will expand your
vocabulary I don't think you'll use
words before their natural for you to
use them but I do believe that you're
not going to learn words if you don't
start seeing them so it's a great tool
to like become a better writer anyway
now if your brain still isn't making the
connection even with the source but
you've looked at it and you're not sure
take a walk take a shower go do
something
your brain oftentimes rights when you're
not in the writing pose and the further
away you are from the writing the more
likely your brain is going to sort of
just be relaxed and it'll start thinking
of sentences and it'll start putting
something together but the element here
is time so time is a beautiful beautiful
thing because we often want to push
ourselves to say write it now write it
later but decide that you want to write
it now and then let your brain right it
later so you have to make that initial
decision somehow you communicate to your
subconscious I do want you to come up
with something you know at some point
here so I'm putting this on a background
task so perhaps it's your brain
rewarding you for taking a break right
you go up for a walk you you go out and
it's like oh now i know what i want to
say okay and then you run back to your
computer and jot down so as you're kind
of writing there's another thing that
you can do to sort of motivate yourself
so we talked a lot already about coming
up with words coming up with the idea to
write but i want to focus on that word
that i just use reward you do have to
reward yourself you want to feel like
you accomplished something so the
preview is a very important tool when
you're writing because the preview does
two things one it kind of helps you
convince yourself that you've actually
accomplished something and it gives you
the big picture the readers view of if
you will of what you're writing so I
always keep the preview open or I toggle
to a preview just to kind of convince
myself that I am getting somewhere so
inside of a ski doc ecosystem we have a
lot of tools we're just like you might
have in an ID you have in the left-hand
pane you have the source editor and the
right-hand pane you have the visual
output and so this is one approach to it
there's a lot of ways to get a preview
my personal favorite though is the
chrome extension so the chrome extension
you can visit any local or remote ask a
doc document and so you don't normally
see this so I'm showing you this this is
what you would normally see if you don't
have the chrome extension
installed you would see the raw source
now some you know ask a doc is designed
to be so that you can read the raw
source but I think that if you really
want to get in the reader shoes and get
the big picture you need to see the
publish result so if you install the
extension instead what you see is this
you actually get to see the rendered
document and nothing really motivates
you more than seeing your work published
that's a very that you know it taps into
the ego your ego and so this is great
because you're hacking yourself you're
hacking your brain if you will to get
back to doing more of this so that's
that so that's one approach to the idea
of visualizing what you're writing but
there's a whole other part two and it's
about visualizing the changes so when
you're in this kind of gets into when
you're writing with other people so if
you're collaborating with people you
want to see what has changed now think
about this for a second imagine writing
source code and you don't have version
control system but you have a whole team
of people working on the source code all
right and you change something and
someone comes up to you and says oh yeah
I changed all you know I changed a bunch
of source code that you were working on
yesterday I mean panic would set in if
you had no revision control system
because you're like wait a minute you
undid my work okay so this is even worse
in writing because we're very very
passionate about the writing that we do
so you're right sentence of people like
oh yeah I deleted all those paragraphs
they weren't good and you're like no no
don't take it away from me and so I
think that this is very important that
you you once you've written it and
checked it in to get it's always there
okay so you're you kind of get afraid to
edit it all right and this is the other
part of writer's block that we have is
that we've written something once a
rough draft we're very proud of it right
we spend time doing it put our you know
invested our life into writing that
draft we're trying to edit it and say
now no I'm just going to keep it how it
is because I don't want to lose what
I've already accomplished that was so
hard but you put it in the source
control system and you say I can always
go back I can always go back to a
previous version I didn't lose anything
nothing is really deleted
so source control gives you the ability
to have def so just as important for
writing as it is for code so here's an
example here where let's say we were
collaborating we go up and get up so we
can see that okay I can see what change
you made maybe we can even use reuse the
workflows we use for for code and say
don't just edit the documents please
send a pull request seat please send a
change request I want to be able to
review it before it goes in okay so now
you feel like as a team you're not
stepping on each other's toes and
documentation doesn't become this
horrible thing and you don't feel so
guarded about what you wrote now this
feature is what is nice in one way but
at the same time it gets it's hard to
see what the end user is going to see
the effect of the change so it's like
we're looking at the source code but we
can't see the effect that has so in a
sense it's like it doesn't have we can't
test the waters of the readers change so
github actually has this really cool
feature called a rich diff so it renders
the two documents and then it shows you
what effectively that change looks like
when it's rendered so this is a
beautiful thing now if you use some of
the techniques that I've had before you
know it sentence per line comments and
in that all that comes through as well
so it all this stuff starts to marry
together and this is truly powerful so I
think that with these two views right
you never feel that panic again that
you're losing something that you've
invested in writing because it gets to
be part of the version control system
just like you use for source code now
the other part of this is that once you
once you see that you've done your work
yes you preview it locally yes you've
sent a pull request ER or whatever
you've sent it into the chain system but
what you ultimately want is to see it
published out into the world so this is
where we go back to the beginning this
is where the automation thing comes in
so because you're in plain text and it's
just source code right then we can
combine these things into the automation
pipelines that we already have so
there's no reason why when you push so
when you push your source code sorry
when you push your source code to to a
tag then maybe it cut
release and your source code goes out
and gets deployed maybe through
continuous delivery or however else but
you know that all i have to do is push
my changes and all the rest takes is
automated we can do the exact same thing
for writing so now for instance when i
make changes and push it to the ascii
dr. website or my company's website I
just push my change and then magic
happens Travis does its thing the CI
tool does its thing Hudson Jenkins
whatever it might be that you're using
and magically it's updated and I think
that you know I've heard in the past a
lot of people say oh you should use a
CMS because the CMS has like a
publishing tool you have the most
powerful publishing tool you can
possibly imagine with get combined with
CI servers why do you need anything else
okay and plus build tools okay so you
again but the beautiful part is is that
if you want to be able to write
technical documentation it can't be a
foreign tool that you hate it has to be
a tool that you know and if we do this
if we write in plain tex and we store it
and get and all this thing then we go
that's just source code to me I don't
know I'm writing sentences instead of
lines of code but I still use all the
same tools and i'm still in my mise own
so again we keep ourselves writing
fluently by being comfortable and
nothing is more comfortable than I the
tools that we know okay so you've
written it all and I'll leave you with
this last tip which absolutely is the
trick I think to going from good to
great with your writing so you've use
all the tools and we have writing but
now you want to make it great writing
and use a technique that I came up with
by sort of accident and I call it couch
reading so the best way to get a big
picture view of what you've written
catch all those little tiny errors while
editing is what I is is do what I what I
call couch reading which is you you go
get your drink you know your coffee or
your tea or your beer or whatever it is
and you get your phone and you go find
your couch okay we all have our couch
you are a place where we like to sit and
chill
and bring up your document and start
reading it through now there's a couple
of key things here first of all that you
are away from your computer and that
you're reading on a small screen don't
bring your laptop okay don't bring your
laptop for a couple of reasons first of
all the whole idea is to get away from
your laptop and the smaller screen
actually focuses your attention so
humans can only focus on they only have
one locus of attention so be the point
there is that if your focus it like if
you're focusing on me you can't focus on
the slide okay this is just a limit that
we all have so if you are at your
desktop you cannot focus on reading
because you have so much other crap
going on so you need to get away from
your desktop wait away from your laptop
and you want to make your document the
locus of your attention so when you're
at your when you're at the couch yes
okay turn off Twitter whatever don't
look at that stuff but but the point is
is that it generally we the mobile apps
tend to run full screen so that you have
the whole thing is dedicated for that
thing so your horizontal you're on the
couch you're relaxing now you start to
read the document immediately the first
thing you think is while this is shitty
like that's going to be the first
thought that you have and the reason is
is because you're far from being able to
change it so all of a sudden you're
vulnerable and you are reading your
words and you know that someone else is
reading those words and you feel like
the pain that you're putting them
through with that sentence okay and you
can't fix it so and you start reading at
you all ah oh this is terrible it's like
if you ever watched you know oftentimes
speakers to say I never watch myself
speak because it's so painful yeah but
I'm making all of you listen to me so
it's pretty bad that I go I can't listen
to myself but I'll make you listen to me
so this allows you to be your reader
before you send it to your reader okay
and what you'll do is you'll you'll get
this idea that Wow okay the structure
doesn't work but I know I now
know how to fix it because I know that
that this felt wrong and so now I know I
go back to my computer and I have a task
I have a goal so I strongly encourage
that you couch read all your documents
maybe not all your emails right okay we
don't have to be so serious about
everything we write but but do this okay
and it's it's truly I think brings this
full circle because what it does is it
allows you to think what is this
document really making me you know
connect with the thing that I am
learning about I don't know when you're
you know when you're at your desktop
you're you're you're still you're still
thinking yourself that there's a chance
that it's not the final version yet and
it's sort of like the difference between
when you commit something to source you
know to the source control system and
then someone comes in says we're doing a
release like oh wait well if we're doing
a release I have to make a bunch of
changes but I would have just left it
the repository the way it was had you
not said that so it brings that sense of
urgency so again so it allows you to
focus now the other benefit of it is
that typos absolutely cannot slip
through this crack I'm telling you I
find typos that amaze me I find typos
and stuff that that I've read twenty
fifty a hundred times and I sit down the
couch bring on my phone and immediately
the first thing I do is I notice uh that
that word is spelled wrong okay because
you're looking so narrowly at the words
that there is absolutely like the air
just glares in the screen so you you go
right back and fix it mm-hmm so the key
is is that you start to notice those
little things when there's nothing else
that and you know it's interesting that
one of the things that you know you may
notice that I'm doing in my slides here
even is that I'm not giving you a lot of
content delivering you a lot of country
you can't read while you're listening to
me right you can't be looking at that
and doing this so again it's that same
thing it's benefiting from the
or being able to have that direct focus
and not letting yourself get distracted
not letting that locus of attention
getting pulled out to doing something
else so you're going to notice those
things and this let me tell you is
absolutely a lifesaver because it saves
you so much embarrassment for you to
find that typo that it is for you to
realize that you just publish that blog
entry and put it on hacker news or
whatever else and the title spelt wrong
okay so it's going to save you a lot of
embarrassment I promise couch read your
documents so to review we're go right in
plain text and to get started ask
yourself questions answer those
questions okay just like your you know
imagine someone coming up to you and
asking you a question if you can't think
of one use the sentence per line
technique try it out you can do it in a
ski dock it actually works in marked
down as well you can do that you can use
this in a number of different languages
then that allows you to use you know
line comments or you can just comment
out whole sections use comments like you
use them in source code when you when
you're writing don't let yourself get
stuck as a matter of fact if you have to
if you're having a really bad writing
day and most of your document becomes
percent signs that's better than you
just staring at the screen and having
done nothing because at least you have
an outline of what you're trying to
write and some days you the words will
come to you in some days they just won't
use techniques to reward yourself by
visualizing that you're making progress
I mean big thing in writing is like you
feel like you're getting nowhere so
reward yourself and use version control
to collaborate and then couch raid so I
want to that's all the tips for today so
basically if you use these techniques I
I promise you that you'll make some
progress in your writing more so than
perhaps you you've had in the past and
getting stuck pull them out when you
need them and learn to love writing
because that's the best brain hack that
you can have is to convince your brain
that this is not a crappy thing to do
this is not a hard thing to do but the
writing is easy that writing is fun
because then it'll want to do it so
allow yourself to enjoy the art of
writing thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
