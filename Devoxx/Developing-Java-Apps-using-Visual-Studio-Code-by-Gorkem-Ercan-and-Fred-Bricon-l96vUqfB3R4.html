today we're going to be talking about
developing Java applications using
Visual Studio code code my name is Kirk
mr.john I work for a Red Hat I'm the
project lead for Java Java language
server eclipse JD TLS and Harbach mobile
to link I'm also a commuter on several
Eclipse and Apache project and I'm
Claude Lacombe
I've been coding bugs for developer
tooling at eclipse at red app and
Eclipse for the past six years I'm a
project lead for the m3 WTB project and
a commuter on the m3 and I'm also a
committed on the claves TDT Hellas
project so how many of you actually used
reduces your code are you familiar with
it some of them yeah so not so much so
in in the in the developer tooling space
we have at one end the full-blown idea
is that we have all used and law and
still using things like eclipse think
think think things like in IntelliJ and
in the other end we have the text
editors that me is like sublime when and
so on so forth so this your studio kinda
is in that line but it is a bit closer
to I des then a text editor so it does
have language features it does have more
coding
encoding features compared to a good alt
text editor so I'm going to just do
directly jump into a demo of Visual
Studio code just just to introduce you
so one of the best features that I think
what we just use is its integration with
the code with the command line so if I
do this you can see that there are
several commands that you can use that
you can use with Visual Studio code for
instance you can even just use Visual
Studio code as a diff editor but today
I'm just going to open one file which is
which has a Java file in it and as I
opened the Java file you will see that
there is a warning that is shown set
class pad is incomplete and only the
syntax error will be reported the reason
for that is is twofold at this point
this is just a single Java file it's not
even in the correct package directory so
if you look at the package for for this
Java file but many of the users of of
adjusted your code actually prefers to
be able to open just a single file do
some changes and then run a build so for
those cases we have enabled a special
mode for for Java files so that we can
actually provide with all the Java
tooling we can provide on a single file
what I mean by that for instance if you
hover over any of these imports you will
not get anything and if I actually
change the import to be something else
that doesn't exist you will not be
getting any errors but if I actually go
here or just go here and delete the
semicolon I immediately get that it's a
syntax error so anything that we can do
without knowing more about the prowl
without knowing more about the classpath
we can't we try to provide them for
instance if I do this I get an outline
view of the file and I can move between
the different symbols and of course you
still have content assist so let me just
and you get the content assist for the
Java JDK class files but anything
further than that any of your
dependencies any of the for instance
this one uses springboard classes you
won't be getting any of those and if you
look at the general layout of the of the
tools and you will notice that there is
a command line comment window here which
you can actually invoke to do different
things for instance if you want to
configure your coloring you can just do
it from here and another thing is
interesting thing is the get wrap up get
support is built-in and there is also a
debug view and you can actually have a
lot of extensions so that pretty much
gives us a quick introduction into what
the BS code looks like and while this is
referred and interesting I'm going to go
back to my slides and say that and look
at how we are providing the Java
language support on on Visual Studio
code because that's actually an
interesting piece of technology that
that's we are reusing so in the whole
Java support that you see on on you have
seen so far is provided by what we call
the Eclipse JD TLS project
it's a language server that uses Eclipse
Eclipse and Java to link behind the
scenes and exposes it as a server and
the what that server talks is what we
call language server protocol and the
way the protocol works is when the user
opens the document on the tool we just
via code in this case that tool sends a
message to the server says a document
has been open and then in turn the
language server initializes its Java
tools and when the user starts to edit
the documents the server in turn starts
to calculate things like Diagnostics and
code completions and whatnot and sent
back for instance for Diagnostics oh
just display these Diagnostics somewhere
and then that's when the Regis digit
code for instance post it read school it
looks quickly line underneath the lab
error and this is all based on language
server protocol so that means actually
you have the exact same set of tools for
something like them and and actually we
do have that as well
one of our community members actually
integrated the language server into them
so you pretty much get the same sort of
Java support nowadays on web as well the
Java language server the Java language
server protocol is open-source and it's
based on JSON RPC 2.0 and you can
actually just go to the github page and
request our comment on the on the
features and it's the implementation
date that we have done depends on
several Eclipse Java related projects
like this LSB for Jay
is the eclipses implementation of the
language server protocol Eclipse JDT is
the Java tools we use enthu project to
process maven and we use build ship to
process Gretl and we kind of start to
call this our secret plot to get used
tipsters to use eclipse the tools are
available on the marketplace and they
are pretty popular we pass 200,000
downloads it's going pretty strong and
without further ado I'm going to hand it
over to Fred so that he can show you a
real application rather than just an
editor layout thank you for him so we're
now going to try to see what the
workflow looks like when we're
developing a real java application real
in the sense of a dam okay so I'm going
to close this one I'm going to open a
full-blown maven project with from the
command line so it's going there box
this one yeah yes that should be fine
okay
so we have here a complete maven based
project it's a spring boot application
with several classes a you I was UI
resources as HTML pages
it's a maven based project so we have a
panic settle here okay so if we open the
same class as before so that was the
message controller we can now see that
we have access to types that are
available from the class path defined by
maven so
by hover over the controller class here
again the Javadoc for this class works
for all dependencies that have been able
to that the other tooling has been able
to download sources for and of course we
can navigate to these classes so if I do
command click here I open the model and
view class which actually belongs to the
spring WebM PC release jar so all these
all these sources are downloaded
completely transparently for from a user
standpoint by the tooling behind the
scenes ok so we have a easy navigation
we can jump to different classes in the
inner project so message devoxx
application come in command click
navigation as well we'll resaw b5 for
instance if I break one of my classes if
I change the the type of the disk
interface and I save it I will see right
away there's a bunch of errors in the
problems view what happens here is
whenever I save my file because under
the under the hood I'm using we're using
the Eclipse JDT project it in itself
uses the Eclipse compiler which is an
incremental compiler which gives us
instant feedback whenever we break our
our code so in the same way that I broke
my code I can fix it I save the file and
all my errors are gone everything has
been recompiled and this is really
instant so this is really cool we have
here and unused import and if I if I
click on it normally I should see done
it's probably there if you just do
control and stop command and dot okay
doesn't work but you can see it in this
setup but we provides a few quick fixes
to for instance delete unused imports in
that case I can delete it manually as
soon as I say that all the problems are
gone so I got I'm now in the state where
everything's perfect
okay so I got a pretty nice Java setup
so as I said this is a maven based
project so how do I run my maven based
application okay first of all I can
build it so the build command in you'll
see your code is command shift B so I
try that
I got no task runner configured so click
on the configure test Runner and here
there's a maven menu I want to click on
that so these mevin templates is
provided out of the box by visual secure
code not by the visual studio code
extension Java for now it's that they
need to be part of the main distribution
alright so I got a couple tasks in my
task JSON file now close that and I've
got a build command which will call the
verify goal for maven I'm going to
actually call the dot slash event M VN w
the maven wrapper that I have somewhere
in my tree here and I'm gonna skip test
so add dash d skip tests there so this
is my built command and I got a test
command which is
just test the sorry test command which
is this test so let's build it first
command shift B and the bill is running
successful perfect so let's test it now
okay I don't have any command forward
for launching the test so what I'm going
to do is add a shortcut and the
preferences keyboard shortcuts and
define a binding oh it's all right here
okay pretend you have nothing here you
define a key binding with command K
twice we want to assign the command
shift T to the binding and we want to
assign that command to running test so
I'm going to type probably something
like looks like test command control
space and I got Auto completion on the
available commands and this one seems to
match all right I'm going to save my key
binding station file and then when I do
command shift T I'm running the tests so
it looks good so far
now the next step is how do I run my
application so if I want to run my app I
could define a new task
the problem with defining a new task is
that Visual Studio code only supports
one running task at a time so I can't
have a long-running task and then try to
if I want to build it or run test while
my long-running task is still or is
already running I'm going to add some
problem so in that case I'm going to
jump to the terminal and I'm going to
call maven w Springwood because this is
a spring boot application and I'm going
to run it
so this is a really nice working with
spring boot in particular because it
starts in 3.3 seconds here so it's going
to be a really nice to have a quick
turnaround from visuals to your code
hacking the code seeing all the results
instantly instantly it's promising so
let's see how it looks in the browser we
have a super duper messages app I can
create messages there hello there box
what's up save it and I got my message
Khalil devoxx and delete that before the
demo forgot to delete it okay no problem
heading back to my code so let's find
come on T let's find my messages okay
I'm going to get rid of the Explorer
Thank You binding okay I don't see
anything that relates to this message
here but I know this is a class that's
used by something else this is a message
uh I don't I don't have the cool dances
here for some reason we're going to skip
the code lenses okay missus repository
no session controller I've got this line
that doesn't have any purpose so I'm
going to just delete it and save the
file and look what happens when I save
the file nothing
nothing happens okay so what happens see
modifier sick too and it doesn't work
awesome yeah okay
I think it's didn't so normally if the
demo gods were with us you could see
that saving the file would because we
have a incremental compiler saving the
file will just trigger spring boot to
restart and because spring boot dev
tools is in a class path on my app it
would reach start in less than one
second and and I would have very nice
turnaround with all the all that might
changes would be already visible here so
this is not running for for some reason
I can try to kill it and restart yeah I
think that will fix it now can you
restart vs code when I see okay we can
do something like message let's see get
summary and put it in upper space you
know it's the vs code needs to be
restarted
yeah it looks like I'm good desire it
look like the Java language server is
dead
sorry then okay can do that
which doesn't happen too often like
never particularly for for this demo
this is awesome
alright okay so do we have a good code
Lancers yeah they're back okay they're
back alright so I can see with these
code lenses for instance we can see all
the references of the message class in a
workspace I know that the message is
being called within the message
repository class controller devoxx
application and I can double click on
the code lands and open the target file
directly ok let's try again
call the spring boot
so I'm going to enable library load
because live reload is enabled
automatically was the dev tools in
Springwood okay so make it smaller all
right
let's go back to or can't see anything
okay let's go back to messages all right
so let's do something like get summary
here to oka case so we can see something
happens so I save the file and
Springwood restarts instantly and
reloads my page with putting everything
in okay class and your interface so the
turnaround is really really fast it's
really nice so I believe that in the
future Visual Studio code for Java is
going to be used more and more for
particularly particularly that that kind
of a experience take over sure all right
I think I have a couple of more slides
go ahead
so so the execution is just me running
the Maven wrapper so it's just a moving
bill the fact that it's colored is the
is me using the latest maven build which
has collagen output now during if you
look within the editor if you have a
hovering so what happens is whenever
we're trying to get for instance Javadoc
the language server returns markdown
Mardin formatted javadoc and then the
client which is visual to your code just
as the the the coloring of that Javadoc
which is pretty nice yeah yes so what's
next next step think the next big thing
that we want to add to this suite of
tools is a Java debugger so that you
will be able to debug and even run so
the run the run experience for a java
application will improve as we add Java
debugger they're sort of related we will
be adding more refactoring we don't have
rename and support yet but we will be we
have a new limited number of code
actions for fixing very common problems
and also the we started to get a lot of
requests for exposing preferences and
formatting options to to the users we
are still trying to figure out a good
way of doing that whether to expose them
directly as Eclipse preferences or
Eclipse kind of preferences or come up
with our own method or but yeah we will
be doing that next
so you can try vs code and gels for us
code they are free they are available
you can contribute to the projects we
have two projects the Eclipse JDT LS is
the language server and we have vs code
- Java project which is the extension
that you see that we have denote here
there are other editors that support
language servers Adam Emacs when they
state have support for it we already
have support for it on Eclipse che
eclipse Ryan who else album is sort of
new like a few weeks new so it's
spreading and the email code you can
find on Fred's github URL and that is
alright so if you have any more
questions yeah go ahead you got yes
so so you you want to deploy a nap on
the server from geocode
so basically you want something like
Java EE integration currently this is uh
this is not implemented at all where we
are not supporting Wars or web apps in
general deployments well actually when
we started building this tool the the
first use case we had in our mind was
was micro services things like vertex
and a spring boot is the runtime so we
we didn't really start with the full
Java EE application on mind so right now
our kind of focuses on for that type of
applications
any other questions all right thank you
then thanks for attending oh that's one
nope not at a moment so the question is
any other support for other languages
deviant languages and no we're thinking
about how would how would other jvm
languages would be integrated with our
Java language server this is actually a
tough question we we don't have a even
the idea of how to make it work properly
we're discussing it but currently only
Java is supported</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
