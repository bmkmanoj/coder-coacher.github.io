really nice to actually see people here
come listen to the talk I don't there's
a lot of competitions I'm glad I'm glad
you made it here
I'm Technical Evangelist with AWS that
means I go around talk about technology
yeah
traveling and talk it's one of the
hardest job in the world so I always say
actually the best job in the world but
nonetheless I've worked about 10 years
with AWS technology from various
companies and people like to either call
us developer advocate software engineer
technical enemies whatever is of for us
it's all the same what we like is code
and showing things how how to build
things today I'm going to talk about two
technology that I'd love serverless and
an AI and especially like those because
you can build things very fast in
experiment you know you've got an ID and
you want to take an idea to you know out
there very fast without investing too
too much money so we're gonna talk a
little bit about you know what's a I
very briefly and then we're going to go
through about four demos and hopefully
those demos will allow you to take
things home and maybe inspire you to try
something in your own business and see
how you can apply alright so when we
talk about server list is one paradigm
that is absolutely fundamental is even
driven by when we talk about even driven
we talk about having an event happening
on on B or a and triggering C in that
case right so it's very simple and it's
very natural in fact most of our daily
lives is around even driven but
nonetheless is not the paradigm that is
used very often type wise used very
often no I think you're all familiar
with the classic poling indefinitely for
studies updates and
- this is totally the opposite is that
you know when something happened when a
change of state happened basically you
know to find a person right and
basically in service it works very well
and especially if you think about lambda
which is our server less computing in
AWS lambda is it was initially built as
a glue between services basically as a
message passing between services but not
just message passing really a message
passing which you can run compute on
right so basically connect services
together as even happened so it's very
easy to stitch things together right and
I'm gonna try to to do this to that with
you and if you think about lambda in AWS
really it pretty much connects or all
the service one after another so if if
you want to try something and if you
want to have an experiment it's very
easy to setup and the good thing is
because it's server lies you don't have
to pay for it all right the classic use
case and that we're gonna see a little
bit about this of event-driven and I
think one reason is very easy to
understand is say you have a storage s3
bucket and then you have your user or
your application uploading content
they're basically your state of the
bucket is changing which is then
triggering event and then that's the
moment when you can hook along the
function to act on that data that has
been put in the bucket a very classic
use case and one of the most used one is
if you upload images or videos in this
s3 bucket then you do some nailing you
do metadata extraction you do all these
kind of things like so major companies
have used this a lot to index the
content without having fleet of
instances of worker doing that and if
you work 10 years ago and in that domain
you probably know what I'm talking about
and of course there's always you know
people in the room that when we talk
about so lesson
there's servers on the hood right and
yeah a servers on the louver right but
that's actually that's not really the
point what we mean and what we think
about when we talk about service is
really the fact that you can scale your
application without having to change or
do anything in the infrastructure you
push your lambda function your lambda
function will work very well for one
invocation but it will work as well for
thousands or even millions of
invocations right because it scales as
you use it so that's really the
fundamental difference another one is
that you don't pay for Edel so because
if your is no invocation then there's no
cost incurred basically in lambda
function you pay by the hundred
milliseconds of invocation and of course
there's four turns built-in because
lambda function as a service is built
across several availability zone so if
there are problems
there's always redundancy in that so
basically your service is highly
available and it fits exactly I think in
the in the even driven paradigm because
even driven really means that if
something happens you want things to
happen right and circle s is right spot
on there so you know that's what we're
gonna talk about today and especially
when I love server less in AI because I
think it's like salt and pepper they
really go together very well you know
they make very juicy the food very juicy
and very tasty and that's the same I
think for software and if you think
about AI we've talked about AR for about
70 years really uh it's started in 1950s
with the perceptions and all this kind
of stuff
but is really with the advent of cloud
computing that since that happened if
you're a little bit aware of AI
especially deep neural networks they
take a lot of computing run Danine exist
enormous amount of CPUs or GPUs to be
able to to be processed right to be
calculated and ten years ago it was
simply not possible for
so for people in their garage to just
you know spin by or invest in the data
center that would cost about ten ten ten
million dollars simply to compute some
some neural networks we start computing
now you can simply start thousand
instances try to experiment and shut
everything down so basically when you
look at the advent of AI with cloud
computing it really is much made in
heaven the you know the the the second
thing is 10 years ago there was very
little data available as well especially
data that you can use to train your
network and if you think about neural
network again very big problem with
neural network is they need a enormous
amount of data to be trying to be
trained efficiency and ten years ago
there was simply not enough data to do
this and again with block computing the
advance of the advent of very cheap
storage it's very easy now to store all
your data and then trying neural
networks for that so basically a lot of
companies now started to use a are
simply because storage and compute is is
much cheaper than before
and of course it's the same announcer
Amazon has been using AI for about 15
years almost 20 if you think about the
first machine learning algorithm but
lately you've probably heard about Alexa
which is our home assistant or we even
experiment with drone deliveries and
things like this the latest I think very
cool thing is Amazon go which is filled
with AI in a shop you just enter pick up
the food and leave there's nothing that
stops you there's no no one no cashiers
and everything it's basically tracking
you text stuff and then go and all these
are packed with AI and in Amazon fashion
way what we've done is we've exposed
this ai to consumers so basically
nowadays this tons of AI running on AWS
from consumer size if you think about
Pinterest Netflix c-span or other things
like this and whether it's a
recommendation engine like Netflix or
more admins
systems they all are running on on AWS
so if we talk about AI and deep learning
on on our stack is really made to feed
the whole group of developer whether you
are pretty much like me that you like to
try things very fast so you can go with
ready-made service stitch things
together and get up up and ready in a
couple of minutes or if you like to do
it yourself you can also start AI
frameworks and deep learning Amazon
image directly on the network on the on
your account and start building your own
neural network I'm gonna show you both
end of the spectrum and goes through
some example or things like this all
right so let's first talk about voice
enabled application I'll put this down
so that we can we can start playing a
little bit the first one first service
that I want to talk about is Polly
Polly's are text-to-speech synthesizer
the idea is that you give it a string
and then we compute voice like sound all
right so a good example today in Seattle
Washington it's 11 degrees Fahrenheit
right so you might see that we actually
fed the the string today in Seattle w8
11 Fahrenheit and Polly takes that
context and notice we not saying outline
w a or 11 F we actually say if
Washington or Fahrenheit so Polly is
able to do this but let's jump writing
onto them into the console so this is
the Polly console so if you want to look
at it let me put this a little bit
better and there's about 40 different
languages the voices in 27 different
languages so it's quite quite a lot to
play with so let's play with some Dutch
for example boy my name is not Italy L
could text 40 year in 4th Y you can you
know add just your voice and you can
really for example here you say
well let's see what's saying there I
live from divorce I'll leave as I'm
alive instead but anyway I'll leave
let's say in London and we are live so
something like I live in London and we
are live from a concert all right so we
can you can generate a bunch of voice
like this that means that you know the
the API is just are very simple and you
can make an API call with a string and
then we returned an mp3 or a stream of
voice well it does as well it supports
markup language so for example here I
can say to Polly that I want my name to
be spelt out loud the spelling of my
name is AD Rin so we support during the
markup language support a lot of stuff
for not for music live from the Madison
Square Garden but the spelling of my
name is ATR I am there's a bunch of
different things you can do like phone
numbers address and things like these
numbers so very very powerful the API is
super simple to use really a PR poly and
then you call the synthesized speech and
wind your string and then the voice ID
is simply the voice that you can see
from from the console here so Russell or
things like this so what can you build
with that well there's a lot of cool
stuff that you can build and actually
customers have started to build a lot of
stuff do you know the application so do
lingua some of you know that duolingo is
an application that allows you to learn
languages they are powered by poly so
the entire duolingo application uses
poly to synthesize this the text so that
you can learn from it another very good
use case which I'm coming demo today a
little bit is this one so media
companies have for a long time tried to
synthesize their webpages so for people
to read on the go or so for blind people
to be able
to consume right it's not easy with
especially with mobile phone to consume
webpages for blind people so voice is
natural thing right so it fits very well
in that and I'm gonna show demo there
and all the demos and the slides will be
available on github so you can play with
it if you want but the demo goes like
this we're connecting an RSS feed to a -
lambda' and what does a lambda does it
will parse the RSS feed and simply for
each of the paragraphs called Polly to
synthesize that and then I'll store the
entire thing into necessary bucket and
also compile an XML file so I can play
actually the the whole thing inside
iTunes right so let's look a little bit
that at the code so my the code the
lambda function is like this lambda
function always has the handler and here
it takes basically an URL as the event
so a bucket and then a URL where I can
extract the RSS feed and I'm using feed
parser so it's a library
that'll basically go through the feed
itself and then I create a hash of every
entry so that I don't have to reprocess
every entry every time the lambda
function runs and then every time I have
an entry I'm really calling calling poly
and synthesizing the entry and then I
store that into an s3 bucket so really
my code is a couple lines of code these
are simply libraries to be able to parse
the feed now when you deploy application
you have a bunch of different ways to do
that a lot of people use different
framework
I like the serverless framework which is
actually a third-party library that
supports a bunch of things I it supports
very well
AWS and this is how it works so I just
create the service name here it's gonna
be podcast a box and mention the
provider the run time and then the
timeout and then my region where the s3
bucket air these are the statement that
I need to say to for the lambda function
to access other services so I need my
lambda function to access poly to
synthesize to synthesize the text but I
also need the yes access to s3 bucket
and you you see there's also x-ray there
x-rays be able to trace the calls
between services it's very nice if you
want to debug your lambda function and
then also create logs
what I also do here and you see I'm
using a Mac so lambda function works on
Linux so if you compile your library and
you dependency in Mike a Mac you might
have some problems so what I'm doing is
I'm using docker inside my Mac to to
create to query my libraries and create
the package so here I just stipulate the
artifact so basically the server like
spray mark will not zip the package it
will take the one that I'm providing
here okay so let's let's take a look
here
so what I can show you directly in the
console because I've already deployed it
this is my my handler here and it has
basically uploaded the code and you see
my handler here is podcast on handler
everyone sees at the end right it's ok
good
this is my timeout this number of memory
I need and that's pretty much it
your environment variable to just say
the location of my bucket then what I
can do I can run some tests I can
configure some tests and here you see I
actually put an RSS feed so this RSS
feed is simply observing wrong it's the
narcisstic done by Feedburner
of the AI blog so basically you can
access the
higher blogging in RSS feed and these
are things that I like to follow the
problem is I travel a lot so I like to
become also on my phone and not you know
read all the time so let's let's run
that
so my extra bucket you see here it's
empty currently this is where I'm going
to store all the information and I'm
just gonna run the test here so there's
two ways either I can invoke the
function directly here so I can invoke
my function and you have a local event
here if you look at it that actually has
the same thing and this is good thing
what I really like which is Olivette
serverless framework is you can invoke
and test your function directly from the
browser or you can put the test there
but let's invoke from here let's hope
the test gods are gonna be with us today
because we have a lot of demos and
basically yeah it's already started to
work so it's it's extracting the the RSS
feed and start to compute all the
different files so there's quite a few
are we going to wait a little bit and
then the last part of that is creating
the podcast on XML which basically has
the entire set of all the post-it will
both their address and then is the one
that I can open in iTune and this is
exactly exactly the same way that
Washington Post has done so basically
they have lambda function that are
scheduled every every other hours to
extract information from different part
of the jaw the news or different blog
posts and then provide the audio files
and what they do is actually allow
people to simply listen to the to the
news so we are almost done and this is
very this one I like is you see my
function here is only invoked when
created when I need I can create
triggers here for example so if I want
to have a trigger that does an event for
example that creates to start every
every every day at 12 o'clock I could
put the cron job type expression the
same way as I've done that so that
lambda function would be basically
launched automatically on the platform
yeah every day our clock cool so we are
down here I'm sure no there's still a
couple of files
yeah deleted all the files before so
let's say it should be fast now come on
I'll warm up I tune why is this
so let's open subscribe to a book
podcast it's much longer than I expected
and there you go so I have my podcast
here so the what the the framework does
as well the the application the
surveillance application does is it
transformed this s3 bucket as a server
as well so basically I can use their URL
of that one and fit this into into iTune
here and what this will do well where's
my let's reopen this from scratch at
least you see I'm doing real stuff so
it's cool so here I have my podcast
there and it's basically loading now the
podcast and then I can start playing
streaming them new post author Derek
Graber title understand movie star
social networks using Amazon recognition
and graph databases Amazon recognition
is an AWS service that makes it easy to
add image analysis to your applications
so yeah this is pretty straightforward
and pretty fast to those things eyes so
it's understandable they're actually a
lot of customers that's starting
starting to use that very successfully
and really the architecture is dead
simple there's really nothing there and
in fact is really very easy for you to
get started and and I had some extra
extra power to your already build
applications another part that is very
very popular especially with a our
services is to do image analysis right
and we have a service called recognition
which was launched last year and what
recognition does is that you feed it an
image or reference to an image stored
somewhere and it can do object in scene
detection it can do fashion analysis and
return phase comparison if you give two
pictures you can compare versus faces
between pictures it can detect some
celebrity
and you can also do image moderation
another thing that is very powerful is
if you have your own collection you can
tag people in there and recognition will
be able to detect those same people if
you feed them the image of that person
so you can create your own custom
collection and now similar to do poly
the recognition API is extremely dead
simple to use here this I'm using to to
example the detect detect labels that
recognize recognizes objects in the
scene or the detect phase so let's do an
example quickly so I have a an image of
me that is stored in s3 with which is a
horse so this is really detecting the
label in that in the image I'll show you
the image because I think it's makes
more sense so let me go into my three
buckets
so this is me in Iceland cool but if you
go to Iceland you have to try the horses
the Icelandic horses they are phenomenal
they're crazy but they're also yes so
this is what it returns so I'm just
returning basic labels and you see a
score that is returned for every label
and basically that's a confidence score
so how people use that is and quite
common is they accept the label if it's
above 70% so I'm not saying that's what
you should do
always assess the services and tools you
are using but nonetheless I've seen
customers using this and they accept the
70% as a cool stuff that's the model
that's a service that we train ourselves
right it's constantly trying with our
own images we never train it with
customer images and we always try to
improve it
so results that you get today might be
different than tomorrow so how do you
use it
because it's so simple so a lot of
customers of course are starting to use
that especially in the media space so a
customer like binder is using that to
tag all their media assets and you know
being able to know what what they have
in the image c-span has done something
quite funny is this direct iframe from
videos and they send that to recognition
so they are able to this lets the tag
videos right so what's in their videos
every eight seconds they do stuff like
another company in in India shadi they
use recognition for moderation is the
tinder of India you can think they don't
want people to update to upload trashy
pictures right so what they do they use
recognition and if there is some new DTS
things like this they just discard
discard the image and it's very simple
to use let's do a demo so this demo
works like this I'll show you it's a bit
more complicated than the other
but it's still very simple I'm creating
a test test app that he's gonna run on
my laptop
it's no js' app what it does is connects
to s3 and dynamodb as threes are storage
as you probably know and a dynamo DB is
a database where we can it's no SQL
database that you can use to store
information when you put content into s3
it does an even triggering and it what
it does it triggers a lambda function
that calls a service called step
functions a double step function a
double step function is the service that
connects other lambda function in a
workflow right and it works like this so
hopefully yeah it works like this so you
have a start and then you can for
example do sequence or sequential steps
you can do parallel steps so if you have
your workflow that is executing a bunch
of things in parallel you can you can do
it or you can do branching steps which
are independent of each other as well
and then you regroup all those results
at the end the step function workflow
we're using for this demo is that one so
the application takes an image uploads
that into s3 what we do we extract right
away the in the exif metadata of that
photo we do an image check so whether we
it's an image that is compatible with
with our system and then we store the
image data metadata and then we call
recognition on every image to extract
tags and we also do some nailing and
then we add the tags that we'd extracted
with recognition into dynamodb and then
we have our application that is able to
to extract us information so it works
like this this is let's call a user ID
box system is always the hardest one is
to find names when you demons
so let's call that demon super super
super great and there my application I
can start taking photos well it's not
this one not that something be cooler so
let's say that for example I'm uploading
this photo and in real time you'll see
now also the implications are they
happen so now the s3 is being the photo
has been uploaded interest rate the step
functions is being called executed the
step function is really a state machine
basically right so that we we call and
what we do then we create the some nails
and then we add tags there so here you
see I have have tags created
automatically and this is super super
useful photographs or companies that
have image data banks and things like
that want to you know tag their and
their codes and create a simple
application and really this was nothing
super complicated to build I can show
you part of the code so here are a bunch
of lambda functions so this is my node
Java no no no GS JavaScript lambda
function that basically add at the tags
from that I've been extracted from
recognition to to dynamodb you see I
have a database then I just put put the
tags there I have another lambda
function that extracts the metadata here
alright so again it's like a bunch of
lines of code that you can can reuse you
know is those are in a way micro
services that do very simple jobs one
and another and then you can just tie
them together and this is the Java
JavaScript function that calls
recognition right so again extremely
extremely extremely simple to use
one line of code related to called
recognition the rest is preparing the
data so this is how it works it's very
it's fairly simple to use what you do is
you know just create your workflow using
step function and you can do this with
code so it's a JSON file that you can
you can you can do and here it is so
I'll show you that this is my
CloudFormation template to deploy the
entire tire set of of the demo and it's
available on the on github if you want
so you can have a look look at it how it
works and how especially I'll them the
step function flow works so this is the
definition of the step function workflow
that has it happened and for each steps
I have a start add which gives me the
where to start after which step and then
I have an end right so it's very simple
to do come oops right so another another
cool things is that I want to demo as
well and it doesn't doesn't need any
lambda or compute simply unnecessary and
this is this demo so if you want to go
on the on that URL you can actually with
your mobile phones play with it and you
can access it as well
so what it does is you can take a
picture so let's do it live let's take a
photo
but actually it's like follow of the
audience if it will detect something
cool use photo I'm gonna upload that and
hopefully the the same will work so this
what it does is cause calls Polly call
recognition extract information from
from the images you didn't find any
faces so that's great demo effect cool
let's do another one I'll take my face
let's see what kind of expressions I
have it's uploading the photo calling
recognition detecting face and let's see
so you can see here I look surprised
with some sign confused happy let's see
if it gets to speak yeah wendy is the
cable it doesn't doesn't want to speak
for some reason but if you try it on
your phone this is gonna stay up and
sing life so you you can play with it I
want to show you quickly the code that's
work because it's that simple
first I want to show you the
architecture well this is bill this is a
bill I have a web page an index.html
that is in s 3 s 3 is our storage but
the cool thing with s 3 is that you can
turn this into a web server as well so
if you enable web website for s 3
basically then you can use this as a as
a web server and what it does is this
calls three service the first one is
Amazon Neto Cognito is a serve an
identity provider in here I'm using
canítö to give unauthorized tokens so
unauthorized access but basically it
means that you don't have to give your
logging and six- that anyone can can use
but it also means that I have very
strict policy that that talking can only
call recognition and Pali and especially
don't call anything else right so I'm
getting that token and then upload I
send the reference of my data of my
image that has been set into s3 to
recognition detect the label detect the
face and then I speak but I'll remove
this because now the demo is done so
cool so yeah you can play with it I
think it you know it's just just to show
you how easy it is to build very even if
it's a bit silly like this as a use case
but I've done that demo a lot of time
and then I've had a customer that
actually said that they've implemented
very similar things for buying people
that take image every every few seconds
to be able to give a lot more context
into what's around right so even though
it sounds silly like this I take a photo
of myself but think about a use case of
someone that use this in real time right
so it's very powerful another thing what
I want a torque is really on the other
side of the spectrum right so we have we
have service that allows you to launch
an Amazon machine an instance like
basically a full-blown instance which is
called the deep learning
ami and what it what it does is it has
integrated within this ami a lot of
frameworks frameworks like MX net tends
to flow Chrono Cross cafes so you can
launch that in one click inside inside
your environment and I'll show you how
to do this and then you can start using
it so let's say if I go on to ec2 and I
can launch any instance there's
something called the marketplace there
and this is where we put our what we
call deep learning deep learning a mine
and then you have to select the Amazon
one and basically you just have to
select and launch it so I've done that
already so we don't have to do this but
then what you can do is something like
this let me find
yeah oh so now my deep learning mi is
launched what I do is I just create a
tunnel to it so that I can connect
locally as well and then I launch
Jupiter right so then I can like to
access my Jupiter notebook locally here
nice slide is and what it is is really
is very really cool because you get
access to all the frameworks like that
right away and I'm not and I'm not a
deep learning or PhD how anything like
this though I still very I'm still very
interested at being able to use them so
what I've done what you can do for
example if you go into MX net you can
launch some examples and here you have
lots of different examples on how of the
algorithm right so you can do some
Bayesian methods if you want you can do
you know CAPTCHA Kafka or cap cap
capture things like this what I think is
very cool to play with is what's called
the neural new neural style what neuro
style does is a deep learning algorithm
that you give an image as reference and
then another one to style and then it
will style the second image based on the
initial image you gave and here yeah
this is what I love is like you get
access directly to the code how things
are done step by step and then you can
run it so basically this is my style
image which I've provided and this is
the one that I want to style
I'm extremely bad at doing painting so I
have to use the deep learning to do that
then you can you know simply play and
learn how how things work and then you
know create your own own style so this
is really powerful
just to get started and learn how things
are right you're not gonna do
breakthrough but at least I think it's
very a very good way at the beginning to
get started and then move forward and as
I say you have access to all the
frameworks right on the edge of you know
and you think fingers something your
tips so you can do tensor flow you can
play with a cafe and all this kind of
stuff out of the box
another cool stuff that I like I like to
demo is this so there's if you if you
are aware of o MX net dot IO basically
is an open source repository where
people put their findings and what
they've played with and what you can do
is I don't know if you've heard about
image net image that image net is a is a
library of images where people and
especially in AI have tried to crack
down and for many years so there's been
lots of competition trying to compare
algorithms to humans and how you tag and
recognize images and only lately a
couple of years ago algorithm are a lot
more efficient than human to annotate
images and so you can you can finally
you can actually access all the
algorithm that I've been used to to do
those tests and people even have put
their models so you don't even have to
compute the models yourself so for
example here you see I'm using I'm
looking at the ResNet algorithm and you
can start testing it with 18 layers or
up to 200 layers at 100 layers would
check probably a couple of days to to
train and here it's it is there for you
to to use it's a bit a bit big but
something still that you can play with
so what can you do with that
some use case that you can do for
example with deep learning and I think
Stanford is one of the great example the
the of deep learning application is this
is an image of a back at the back of the
retina right and basically what it shows
is figuration in the blood vessels in
the back of the eye can help you detect
diabetes especially diabetes the type of
diabetes that is called by blindness and
what they've done is for many years it
was it has to be specialist and there
are very few specialists around the
world that I able to do that and
diabetes as you may know is actually not
listen it's quite dangerous so if you
detect at the early and early age you
can prevent it and what I've done is
they've trained the neural network a
very large neural network with images
that I've have been annotated by
specialists and now they are able to
feed images wherever in the world to
that algorithm to detect diabetes right
so this is very very classic use case of
of using deep learning algorithm to
detect things another thing is
autonomous driving systems so this is a
company called two too simple and what
they do they use a max map similar
algorithm that you have accessing the
deep learning am i of course they're
they've tweaked it for you know for
themselves but you can get started and
try to understand and what they do is
real-time real-time tracking of of cars
especially for real-time segmentations
also of environment so so that
autonomous driving system can work so
I've shown you that they are there's a
directory of a lot of treatment models
that you can access here and now the
question is how do you do this right so
a very classic way of using this if you
wanna start playing with it is getting
that train model
from from this repository and uploaded
into s3 right and then you can use
several s several s models to to query
your model so in that case just for the
demo I've used this rest net deep
learning algorithm resonant is basically
quite quite good at detecting and
labeling images and it's been used a lot
the lambda function is in the I can show
you the code but since I have this slide
I'll show you that as well
it's also in github so you can access
all that there but basically the lambda
function calls to functions which is
predict and load models load models take
the model from s3 and then initialize MX
net and load the model in memory since
you're in lambda there is some limit in
terms of the size of the model you can
load this is 500 Meg but you saw that
they're actually the 101 layer model was
simple already 270 max says it's
something that you can use and then the
predict function simply use that model
and then to run a prediction and when
you deploy that we serve less you can
then you know call called the endpoint
and basically get prediction so it's
something like if you want to train your
own neural network and or if you want to
use similar system than recognition but
actually being able to recognize things
that you own your own things right it's
something that you can do yourself like
that of course you would need to train
the model but then once your model is
trained you can push it into s3 2 to be
able to end to use alright and really
the the sense of of this talk and the
demos is just to show you that AI is
here right it's not it's not the future
it's actually already today and it's
very simple it's much simpler to use
than people make you think it is of
course if you want to complete your own
model and
and tweak it and make it and build an
autonomous driving system yourself it's
not gonna be a three-hour job that's not
the point
but if you want to understand and things
you know you get inspired up you know
you may maybe start something new and
enhance something in your business give
some functionality voice or image
analysis there's a lot of different
service that you can use here only the
mode three of them and we have a full
spectrum of AI services that you can
just use out of the box
whether it's machine learning or poly or
recognition or Lex that is a bot so that
you can use in real time as well to do
congressional interfaces all right on
that note I want to thank you very much
for staying here first there's very few
people that left which is great and then
I'm happy to take take some questions
and if I don't have time to take
question you can always ask me out door
or on Twitter or sending me an e-mail
directly thank you very much is there
questions I'm happy to take a bunch of
questions so that's a shy audience is
great I was in Israel two months ago and
I started the talk and after three
minute there's already ten questions I
didn't even start talking there was
already questions so it's very different
it's cool anyway if you shy of asking
the question here I'll be outside taking
questions as well thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
