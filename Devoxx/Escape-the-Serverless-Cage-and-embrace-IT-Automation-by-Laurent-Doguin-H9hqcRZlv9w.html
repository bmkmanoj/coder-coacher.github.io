make sure hello and welcome to escape
the servo less cage an embrace embrace
80th mission Omaha's a bit of clenched
world two states and French this is me
our four clever clouds there is a lot of
bearded people at leather clouds and the
one with the red circle I used to work
for catch basin next year now I've been
working for clever crowd since DevOps
France which was a month ago
one of the few people that started a
conference by mounting one boost as bass
boost and dismounting the clever cat
this was our Sun and you can find me on
Twitter get up LinkedIn what I always
this handle right there so I'm off at
clever cloud what does clerical I do we
basically take your code and make sure
it runs in production it's a very easy
concept some people call this platform
of service you just get push your codes
we will build your code we will deploy
your code who provide you Ruby
deployments automatic scalability or
result all vertical and a good thing
about this is that it is IT automation
so you don't have to write anything we
also make your code you have to use some
API or SDK or nourish your codes
automated by our robots arm that's just
how we do not to learn anything that's
that's what we do we have like 20,000
more application running on our cloud
right now for a team of five five person
you know technical person and English 27
application which is a good indicator
that our robot army works and we do see
lots of goats you know on support team
and gives us a good idea of what people
do what people maybe should do more than
shouldn't do so we see a lot of things
happening and we usually we we give back
to the community right you know all the
experience we've acquired by supporting
our customers we give talks but not
today this is a very specific sponsored
talk so I'm going to be all vendor ish
and this is a you slightly opinionated
talk about what is server let's because
I do IKEA automation I'm going to talk
about several s will hear us here heard
sorry about it several s
not everybody okay fine
geez good and so save less depending on
who you ask can be a complete different
answer so I asked to advocate unquote
for what it said less basically he says
that if you can spin up a machine or an
application in under the second
basically you are said less clever that
is not several s we use VM it takes us
four seconds you have a fully deployed
and ready VM which is not two version of
VM of a bad reputation that for second
is perfectly acceptable especially if
you do Bluegreen deployment there's no
downtime you know it's fine so we are
platform as a service but not a stat so
not service that's one way to define
settlers there's another trend on
several s that's called bass back end as
a service yes like some problems I come
from cash base I used to work in the
database world and in the database world
latency is extremely important and this
is very good
latency example if you do back-end as a
service it means that you have your
back-end on someone else's cloud usually
when you have a back-end you have an
application connected to that packets so
you're going to try to deploy it as
close to your back-end as possible
because there is one Latin see that you
cannot diminish is the size of the
network cable between you and your
database right so if you do back end as
a service know that you will have some
latency because you computer you're
sorry your application is on another
network then your database unless some
people direct your automation and lets
you deploy whatever you want with also
backends so if you use a Mongo at last
you know you have a number nine that
great then you have another application
somewhere else not on the same network
latency lessons is bad for my database
experience that's what we try to avoid
there's another issue is back end as a
service and as where do you where do you
put your data and it's a very sensible
topic right now it's about data privacy
you want to host your data anywhere in
Europe there's a low coming up SCADA GRP
and this real basic
they tell you that sensitive information
should be stored locally either on your
machine or this on in your country and
by canon service that known as we have
you know a data center in every possible
country special europe so you know pack
energy service privacy issues that's one
way of defining several less back in the
service and and the other more common
way that we have these days with WSM
dies functional service which suffers
from pretty much the same issue that was
a latin see example same problem you
have something run on the clouds it's
far away your data is far away you are
picking somewhere else this network
hasn't seen in the middle to avoid that
until you need to run your stuff at the
same place that's that's just how it is
again into the size of the network cable
there's no other way around it so
fortunately the service as this issue
this is the most important side of the
conference with the the best content but
as its function as a service it's a
complete black box so you have no idea
what i what it is why it runs that's
another problem for functional service
usually it's an open source project and
then you have a proprietary API on top
of that open source project you have no
idea what it is and you have to use that
that's super api without knowing what's
going on you cannot SSH on the machine
you don't have access to the logs you
get a debugging you know some some very
thankfull stuff so if you don't have
access to this at least you would like
to test these things and testing
function as a service is a complete
nightmare because basically if you don't
deploy it on the function of the service
lab then you cannot really test it so
you have to mark the whole testing API
it doesn't get a project called a WS
mark and it's yeah it's painful really
painful imagine mocking the whole API
just to test so it's very sad another
thing that I don't understand about
function as a service we all do
applications usually there's an
application that is database going on
there's a HTTP such as TCP connection
and the server list way would be ask for
a function to be executed that's
function milk as to database
from scratch because you'll be bring
something new so you would do another
TCP handshake couldn't find better
picture and a TCP handshake is very
expensive usually what when you connect
to a database you create a connection
pool and you reuse your connection if
you do function as a service you create
a new application all the time which is
extremely expensive and you know in
again for real-time database people is
that's how things should work sort of
things should be so in some cases it
makes complete sense it's not it's not a
real-time application you're just doing
like some crunching do crunching you
send one request on a function as a
service that's fat clad with lots of
process of compute power here it makes
sense for a normal application that's
like a web application which is I assume
what most people do this database
involved you don't want to recreate that
connection all the time it's not it's
just very expensive
I never there's a lot of people that
tell you about function as a service
there's nothing new to learn we support
every languages we have an SDK for every
languages so saying this is actually
saying you have something to learn if
there's an SDK for every languages then
that's proprietary API you need to learn
that API it's something new and you need
to modify your code to make sure that it
actually runs on that cloud so there's a
ramp ups that's painful which again it's
really easy to find animated image of
bad things happening I discovered the
whole world of bad things happening
during this slide deck so Ju deploy
something you have to learn the API
doesn't necessarily work on someone
else's cloud that gives you into your
locking position where if you need to
get out of one server less vendor you
may need to rewrite your code so that it
right it works on another vendor which
is what people call lock-in situation
and if that's fine with you that's great
if you think you get married to one
particular server less vendor and
defined for the rest of your lives
that's that's that's beautiful but you
hope that doesn't happen all the time
sadly that's such is life so there's
less fortunate service
it feels to me like it's just a
stateless architecture but that's
managed by someone else with very poor
design choices if you ask me what
service is that's what I'm going to tell
you but again this is a slightly
opinionated talk about several s so you
take that with caution do I hate to ever
less this again there's some very good
reason to the server that's one of these
collaboration I'll give you one example
google has this great image recognition
service and it's based on machine
learning so the more it works the more
image is tended the better it becomes I
spoke to a friend ever start up in
London called synod's two great startups
and they used imagery condition API and
the error rates that was acceptable at
the very beginning well I went to a free
person so if you want to go on two or
three percent error it's a you know
slower so local if you accept a twenty
percent error margin then it's much
faster and basically after two or three
years of reading the same algorithm with
lots of photos collaboratively
collaborating with everybody else then
you you you become much more efficient
and because of that he went from the
free person margin error to twenty
percent and was much much much faster so
there's a less if you need to share or
collaborate with those people especially
mutual eyes data resources it's it's
it's great especially on the resources
side of things like would you want to
pay for a very large computing power all
the time and use it like each time you
need to run that function doesn't
necessarily make sense all the time so
that's also why server less is great not
only collaboration but there's a scale a
thing the other reason service is great
is that it's managed it's no ups as
people say it's magical because you'd
never touch a server the word CLS is
extremely misguiding because there's
always a server somewhere but because
you don't manage it you can call it
several s which is probably actually the
best definition of service there is a
server but you just don't manage it it's
magical and that's pretty much the same
thing that happens when you use a key
automation the goal of xeo to mission is
to
for you to just write code and then no
ops automate everything so you know you
don't manage and server which is the
good thing about several is that you
might want to do when you do normal
application
the other cool thing is that there is no
black box we also make the code that
you're writing so you know exactly
what's running you can test it you can
adjust it just about automating things
it is very close to the DevOps culture
right you probably have heard a
vegetable of Chef of puppets you use
these to automate all your tasks and
what's clever clouds purpose is that you
just have to write codes you don't have
to write an uncivil script you can have
to write the chef or the bat recipe you
don't have to write a dhaka pharaoh or
doctor compose you just push your code
and works that's that's the beauty of
set of that energy automation and you
never learn anything new because you can
adjust code so the ramp up so there is
very very very few successful image of
people using ramps we just let it be
known so there's the ramp up is less
hard because you can even have to learn
anything you just automate your code and
you can of course use whatever runtime
you want because again you decide what
you run and that's what level clouds
report by default of course we support
all the things just need to ping the
support to ask us support for Alex here
and Alexei is a common framework that
people start using Java is not there but
we should podcaster ever been included
lots of interesting things so there was
a very simple plug for clever clouds and
energy automation if you want to fly
clever clouds by default when you
subscribe you have 20 credits if you use
this coupon you'll have more credits
just by devoxx UK's coupon and you'll
get more more and more credits so that's
it we have a boost at devoxx
at the boost we have the best teachers
and the best kickers that's one of them
thanks for listening and if you have any
question you have like two minutes left
so a happy the answer thank you
yes so we have 27 epic the question was
how do we manage our things we have 27
applications
300 new application every week
additional we monitor everything does it
that's a decent amount of stuff to to
store we use something called WEP then
it's a dupe based geospatial time
service database and it just just cares
really so we have all our demons running
on every machine that sends data on
RabbitMQ in RabbitMQ to send everything
back to our reduce machine and we use
what tend to do the graphs and
everything and to send alerts and when
something bad happened me because of
that you know something bad happen we
can restart your application we can
scale it automatically as well that's
how we we do it so it's called what then
it's dupe time series by a French
company called citizen data and that's
to me the only extremely scalable time
series solution we're going to come from
the database world you can do time
series whiskas and while you can do it
we can selectively you can do it gasp a
pretty much anything you want something
that really scale and time series disk
lots and lots and lots of data the Duke
is a great solution loser so it's
vertical lexicalized Hadoop solution to
the temp service there's an API to to
collect all those logs yeah if you want
to get your personal personal your
applications metrics and the machine
runs on metrics there's an API to get
all of that then just when you connect
to the cloud as a single weather a
single page web apps which is just an
angular app they call the REST API we
also have a command-line tool and they
both use the REST API have scenes
available using the rest of the act
the next person speaking after me is
called Chico alcohol is a former casbah
employee and then Mongolian mapper and
his talk is about IOT and it's great and
you know if you don't know what to do
it's a decent soak thank you very much
and see you at a boost yes okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
