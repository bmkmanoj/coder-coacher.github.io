really pleased to be joined by my good
friend Mark heckler mark thanks very
much for taking some time to come and
see me I know you just finished a
session so you probably get a little
fatigued so now's the time for me to ask
you two really difficult questions right
sure what could go wrong oh but actually
you're on a bit of a tour of Europe as
well aren't you so I mean we're in
Bucharest this week last week you were
in Germany yes visited Java land in
rural and then went from there to
creamin and I was able to speak at the
the Bremen jug and just had a great time
just saw a lot of things and talked
about a lot of things and got together
with a lot of really deep deep
development deep developers on deep
development topics so yeah it was a good
tour perfect and I know you're busy so
I'm glad that you've taken a little bit
of time to talk to us now um you've done
two sessions here yeah this week so
yesterday's was yes inexplicably I was
invited to keynote that was that was
crazy because I think they you all had
even seen me speak before so I don't
know anyway very very very happy to
accept that just really appreciate that
and got to talk about how to kill a
monolith so how do you kill them all the
very very carefully you have to sneak up
on it mama'll it's a very low base piece
yes literally and with a spoon they're
like dragons no I
you know everybody I think expects the
answer to be well you just unplug it and
then you rebuild and and of course that
ignores reality right because most of
the time when monoliths are in place
they're making our organisations money
they're keeping our organisations afloat
they're very vital pieces of our overall
systems portfolio but of course in many
many cases we understand that that
different functionality within that
model that evolves at different paces so
we need to be able to to peel out the
more rapidly evolving the more dynamic
bits of functionality so that we can
accelerate the development accelerate
their deployment
and we need to be able to scale them
differently because some bits of
functionality that maybe never need to
scale can can be maintained with a very
small number of connections and a very
small amount of resources shouldn't be
dragged along for the ride when you have
to scale everything else it is in high
demand so it makes a lot of sense to
plan for that monolith to remain and
then start breaking out functionality
using what I call scaffolding or
different enablers that help your micro
services to still interact as you as you
build your portfolio of micro services
of course but to help them still
interact with your monolith but yet
start gently and in an orderly fashion
building your portfolio of micro
services that can then again
independently be developed in scale and
and deployed absolutely because you're
never going to take something that's
been functioning for years and doing
everything that you need for the company
and just say let's replace it
immediately
absolutely so it's interesting to hear
you use the terminology peel outs I
think that's really it's really
descriptive way of talking about that
yeah and in pragmatics I mean again you
you kind of have to it it does no one
any good to ignore the realities of
things so if you can't start peeling out
or teasing out that that functionality
do you really need to to treat
separately that is kind of a different
beast within the the larger piece it
makes sense to do that yeah so one of
the common mistakes that people make
when they were approaching a move from
one more left to microservices well I
don't think it's unique to this but I
think it's the the classic
underestimation of the effort it will
take and the overestimation of our
abilities to I guess to kind of make
magic happen and heroic ly stand up
something in a short amount of time that
will replace all of or at least a
greater amount of functionality I think
we tend to overestimate a lot that's why
you know a lot of our industry you know
gets into the fixes that we get into but
if you if you apply
and I'll point to domain-driven design
I'll point to to fully assessing a a
separate what I call nugget of
functionality that you can peel out and
think small hmm you start teasing out
things at a very small scale then you
minimize your your risk profile you
minimize your your surface area for
where things can go wrong as well as
focusing on a few interfaces with the
monolith versus trying to recreate
several different maybe tens or hundreds
of interfaces before you go live with
your new system so one of the great
things about all conferences if they're
good and they've got good content is
that regardless of how expert you are
how experienced you are you always learn
something when you go to one sure so
with that in mind and also the work that
you've done in terms of Micra services
and everything else within the the
springs back over the last few years
what would your 2018 self tell your 2015
self wow I think that's tough I don't
know that we have enough time for them I
am trying to think of a nice way of
encapsulating all of this because I
think there is much more focus as there
should be on you know deploying to the
cloud then there was maybe your I mean
obviously it was talked about in 2015
and far before but I think it's it's
it's like the snowball it just
accelerates and of course when you're
talking about cloud deployments you're
also talking about in many cases
microservices because in many cases a
lift and shift of a vast monolith onto a
cloud platform doesn't make a lot of
sense so then you start peeling out and
dealing with micro services and then you
see look at bits of functionality and in
functions and how far down can we go and
where does it make sense and when what
do we get for the added complexity that
all of these steps require so I danger
Will Robinson I think that's probably
the best summary because I think that
again it goes back to that
underestimation I think youyou and it's
human nature you you naturally appear
into something you say that's easy we
can do that yeah that should take us a
couple of three months
and it's just to fully explore things
obviously you have to move out on things
but but to be ready and be ready to
adjust course and to again minimize your
risks and when things don't go right as
they inevitably don't go right the first
time or the second time you try to do
something you can easily adjust without
bringing down the house and so I think
you just come out of another session
that you give in today as well tell me
about that springing into Kotlin and and
I kind of talk about that because well I
do talk about that because with Spring
Framework 5 which was released last fall
Kotlin was one of the three main pillars
because Kotlin achieved or retained full
first-class support in Spring Framework
five so obviously Spring Framework is is
heavily Java oriented but with Spring
Framework and spring boot over the past
few years you've had Java and groovy
support Kotlin is an important player
because it has great functionality it's
highly interoperable with Java so it's
not an either/or story and yeah so I was
talking about how to leverage Kotlin
where it makes us to start leveraging
Kotlin in existing spring applications
and how to to kind of move forward long
term by incorporating that into spring
boot applications perfect so we're
running out of time now but I know that
anybody interested in learning more
about either of those subjects can watch
your videos from this week on YouTube
and from other events that are good
they're the folks posted them online as
well but also you tweet incessantly you
know there's lots of things what lots of
ways people can follow your journey and
and and your learning as well cuz I know
you're keen to yeah that with with the
wider community yes I feel like every
time I speak at a conference I get more
than I give because there there are
always so many things you can learn from
from even the most innocuous of
questions somebody says hey simple
question for you it's never simple and
that's good that's how we all grow but
Twitter I even sleep tweet so yeah m'kay
heck follow me there and
yeah I looking forward to any Vox days
or DevOps conference that I can attend I
have happily be there and happy to meet
you
great</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
