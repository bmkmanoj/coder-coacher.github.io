good morning how we all feeling a little
bit uh a little bit tired from last
night I hope you had a good time today
I'll be talking about the geeks guide to
leading teams I'd like to find out how
many of you are actually currently
leading a team of some sort so if you
could put your hand up okay that's good
so for you I guess you understand some
of the experiences and challenges of
maybe leading a technical team for other
people who maybe aren't yet sort of
leading a team what I hope to give you
is a set of expectations of how you
might prepare yourself to deal with
those situations you might find yourself
in I've done a lot of sort of training
of people who've been moving into this
role and I think what's quite
fascinating is a lot of the experiences
that you have as a developer don't
really prepare you for the experiences
are leading for a team and it requires
quite a different set of skills and I
hope to impart with you some of those
ideas about how you might go about
approaching it as well as some tools
that you can sort of draw upon so I work
for a company called salt works and
thought works you probably might know
through a couple of the things that we
sort of created like continuous delivery
you might know about Martin Fowler who
writes a lot on his sort of website and
we've also produced this thing called
the technology radar and we're a global
consultancy and the tech radar is our
kind of view of what we're seeing with
clients around the world it might be of
interest to you as technologists to
understand what industry trends that
we're actually seeing with clients and
we kind of end up classifying those
sorts of tools techniques into sort of
different areas and then also give
advice as to what things you might be
interested in adopting or trailing or
maybe putting on hold as well so it's an
exercise that I'd highly recommend you
run with in your own company as well to
help sort of create a direction and it's
something that you might be interested
in in terms of understanding what the
current industry from our perspective is
now I work as a technical lead most of
the time when I work with our clients so
what that means is I'm also leading
development teams and as a consultancy
one of our roles is actually about two
upskilling people in that sort of
perspective as well throughout this
process I've actually talked to quite a
lot of people and it kind of ended up
resulting in a book called talking with
tech lead
and for me it's quite an interesting
experience talking to a lot of people
who've been through this journey I kind
of talk to people who are on their
beginning journey and that sort of shock
value and maybe for people who are
currently in this role you can kind of
empathize with that which is the oh my
goodness I was a developer and now I'm
leading what does that actually mean and
then I also talked to a whole bunch of
people who've been doing this role for a
while and understanding about how they
go about approaching it what they
emphasize and I think a lot of this is
really about sort of some lessons learnt
and also understanding that there isn't
a real one true perfect way of being a
tech lead and I think that's a really
key element of when you actually take on
this role of being comfortable with
yourself your approach and understanding
that people have different ways of being
an effective tech lead I guess I want to
start off with maybe asking this
question about well why is it that we
actually need a tech lead do we even
need one what happens if we just get a
bunch of developers together and just
let them go off and the analogy I tend
to think about this is when you're
actually working your own sort of
personal project so maybe you have
something that is your own sort of open
source sort of project something that
you're hacking together at home
something that you're actually doing you
have this goal in mind and if it's just
you you know you have this idea about
what you'd actually like to achieve you
don't really need to explain it to
people you kind of work in small steps
towards that goal of what you have and
hopefully you end up achieving whatever
it is that you have now in a lot of our
sort of environments so the companies
organizations we don't get to work by
ourselves a lot right so software is a
lot more complex today there's a lot
more moving parts and it requires a
whole bunch of skills that it's very
difficult to develop by yourself and
also to scale that really rapidly so
it's very rare that we end up working by
ourselves and we often end up working in
sort of teams of people and what that
means is that we kind of have the same
goal but there's a whole bunch of people
that also need to understand that and so
when you're actually leading a team it
might be really simple in your head
about saying okay you know here is what
we're trying to achieve and you sort of
say that once and you sort of expect
people to sort of understand what that
goal is and in your mind you kind of
think
everyone understands what that is and
they know how to get to that goal pretty
clearly and so people kind of think
about how actually everyone's working
towards this environment now this is a
really nice idealistic sort of world and
unfortunately that's not what really
happens in the real life so often what
happens is you have this whole bunch of
people and people are starting to think
about maybe what that goal is and what
it means to them and you know they've
been thinking about other things and
what ends up happening is that everyone
has their own sort of priorities and
people start moving off in different
directions
so one person might be thinking this is
the chance where I get to implement
react or angular another person might be
oh this is my chance to understand how
to do TDD properly because it's the
first time I get to do things for other
people it might be I just get to work
with a whole bunch of people and learn a
whole bunch of things and you might have
that one person that remembers what that
goal is and understands how to get there
and if you've ever worked on a team like
this and I see this all the time it can
be really frustrating right so people
are working different things there's not
really that sort of sense of priority
and maybe you don't experience this in
your current team and I think that's
really great and I think it's just
important to understand that not every
team is exactly the same and you might
think that this doesn't really happen in
the real world and I think this tweet
summarizes are quite well so Julian's a
good friend of mine and he talks about
how I had 10 guys in my last project all
of them had opinions and all of them
were expressed in the codebase how many
people of you might have seen something
like this right so what happens to this
leadership of the common understanding
about what we're going towards and also
how we get there together and for me
this is really a simple test that you
can think about if you're being
effective so if you are being an
effective tech lead then my question to
you is does the codebase look like it
was written by a single person so in
reality it's never really going to look
exactly the same so even as developers
ourselves we learn we grow we probably
understand some of the different
patterns and we might evolve it over
time but when I look at sort of code
bases what I'm really looking for is
maybe a through sort of a bit of a
squinting kind of view just generally
does the codebase look kind of some
and this isn't really about sort of code
sales or that's part of it it's also
about how we approach those problems so
do we approach things like persistence
in a common fashion do we approach the
same types of problems in the same sorts
of fashions or do you end up seeing six
or seven different implementations of
solving that same sort of core problem
and I think what's really hard is that
you know we put a lot of pressure on
team members to go and write features
and functionality and often we don't
help people understand the guidance and
connect them to other people who've
maybe implemented something like that
and it's a challenge right so every
developer likes to create everything
from scratch we get this buzz from
solving problems constantly and
particularly if we get to solve it in
our own way we like to have our own
personal style but that personal style
starts to create problems when we're
actually talking about it at a larger
scale so if we think about
maintainability if we have the ten
different ways of doing the same thing
in the codebase the next thing that we
do might be really hard to actually add
because we have to make a change to all
of those ten parts and so we actually
care about consistency at the team level
and this is hopefully something that you
as a technique can help Shepherd and
guide the team to actually resolve so
this is your kind of simple guide and
test as to whether all your being
effective but what do you actually focus
on as part of this role and throughout
this talk I kind of want to talk about
three main areas to help you understand
where you focus your time
so we're tech leads and naturally that
means we're technical right so there's
an aspect of the development side the
programming that we actually have to
care about and one of the first traps
that you might fall into is the first
time tech leaders focusing exclusively
on the programming set so as a developer
you know you might be kind of falling
into your habits of wanting to fix and
create all the sort of problems in the
sort of code base or solve the new
problems that are coming up but it's not
the only element of what you should be
focusing on in this leadership role and
it's brings us on to the people side
which is we actually have to make sure
that we devote explicit thinking time
and time to make sure that we understand
the team that we have and are they
working towards the same sort of vision
and finally I kind of want to cover
sort of the process or the environment
in which the team works so it's not
really enough to just simply think about
the technical side or people
individually but also understand the
sort of system in which everyone is
interacting it will cover each of these
different areas one by one so the first
one we'll talk about is really about
programming and my first question here
is do effective technical leaders need
to code who says yes okay who says no
okay
bit of a mix so in my experience I find
it it's very helpful for a lot of people
to write code and I'll talk about why in
a second the next question that often a
lot of people have is well how much time
is enough and my rule of thumb here is
kind of thinking about this kind of 30
percent time a minimum of 30 percent
time spending time with the code and my
guide to you is not necessarily writing
code 30 percent explicitly it's really
thinking about how you spend time
understanding what's going on that code
base so if we're going to get feedback
about is the team heading in the right
direction we have to give a sense of how
many different ways of being added to
the code base of solving problems in
different ways and to do that we
actually need a pretty good
understanding about what's happening as
our code base is evolving so I contrast
this often when I think about sort of
your ivory tower architects sort of
pattern which is you know people who
have kind of established some ways of
working of how the team should actually
design and implement things but then you
go to the implementation and you
actually see it's quite different from
what was kind of whiteboard diagrams or
so the archetypes and then sort of Visio
diagram and what we're really trying to
do as effective technical leaders is
really trying to reduce that feedback
loop of understanding when things are
diverging away from this vision to what
the reality is and we're really trying
to reduce that sort of feedback cycle
and so this is where I'm actually
looking at this 30% of time of really
trying to understand how well is it that
people are understanding the directions
as a team and how consistent are they
and it's very difficult to do that if we
don't actually understand the code there
is another element to this and I go to
an article it's actually quite old now
but still highly relevant from 2009 and
it's called the unspoken truth of
managing geeks and in this article but
also kind of talks about how the respect
is currency of the realm right and one
of the sort of patterns or labels that
you might get named as a sort of tech
leaders that you know you're in that
sort of post Technical Account and if
you think about that post technical
label you have to think about what does
it actually mean what does that mean in
terms of respect from the development
team and when I actually hear a lot of
developers think about that it's kind of
sometimes users of a contemptuous way of
saying oh you don't really know what our
problems are today and you know the
advice that you're giving us isn't
really relevant to what we actually have
and that's one of the traps that we can
actually fall into when we're actually
sort of suggesting solutions that don't
match reality of the problems and so
this is actually one of the things that
I'm very conscious about is that when
I'm sort of working with teams one
really great way of actually gathering a
respect is actually by understanding
what the teams are struggling with in
the codebase the concrete problems and
making sure the advice I give is
actually relevant to the problems they
have versus some theoretical problem
that the teams don't really understand I
think the other flip side of this is
that understanding how our technology
landscape is constantly changing and you
know it's very difficult if we talk
about the sort of three areas around
people programming and process to
understand how you focus on developing
yourself in understanding the latest
sets of tools and technologies coming up
and this is actually where you actually
need to have some time with the code as
well which is understanding okay given
some new tool or framework how is that
different from what I know previously
and so we actually also need to be other
keep our skills to a certain degree
up-to-date so that we build respect for
the team and we actually understand the
implications of what those tools or
choices are the other side of this
article is actually talking about the
amount of respect and IT prope someone
is a measure of how tolerable that
person is when it comes to getting
things done and I think that's quite a
fascinating anecdote that this author of
this article kind of points out which is
sometimes in development teams you'll
have team members who are maybe not
necessarily socially skilled and the
team don't like interacting or having
come
with them but they're actually really
talented at writing and solving
technical problems and the author kind
of observes how actually a lot of teams
would rather put up with somebody like
that then a really nice person that
can't write code now if you think about
it as one of your sort of team members
would you prefer somebody who can
actually write and solve affective
problems but maybe has problems
communicating or actually somebody who's
creating a lot of mess that you might
need to clean up after some time and
this is the challenge with our to the
industry is that it's very hard to get
good technical people and so one of the
reasons that the author is kind of
talking about this is that actually you
need to demonstrate your competence in
order to gain respect from technical
people otherwise they'll sort of slowly
put you into the non-technical camp and
so one of the reasons another reason I
guess I want to make sure that I'm
actually sort of working with a team is
making sure that they understand that my
skills are relevant and I maintain that
respect for that sort of team now you
may have the challenges of trying to
understand how you spend time with a
code and I have a few concrete
recommendations about how you go about
sort of approaching this so how many of
you adopt sort of pair programming here
okay it's about maybe 30% so one really
great way of doing this is maybe doing
pragmatic pair programming so you know a
lot of pair programming some teams go
full-blown where two people are sitting
next to each other 100% of the time I
don't believe in that model all the time
but actually there is a value in
actually having people work on something
around the design aspects and trying to
bounce ideas off about how you actually
do things as well as a continuous review
process and so in your role as a tech
lead you'll often have your time split
across a lot of things 100 percent pair
programming model won't work for you and
so one way that you can actually do this
is actually through a pragmatic sort of
pair programming or a sort of model
where you know somebody is starting to
kick off work you work with that person
to maybe talk about how you might
approach it you understand maybe the
steps about the sort of tasks that might
need to actually be done and then you
might let that person sort of go off do
that for a while and then you come back
and sort of check in with that person
and so you're sort of getting a
pragmatic view of actually understanding
what's going on with a particular
problem and you get the elements of
pepper
roaming without necessarily programming
full-time and when you get the time
hopefully you can actually contribute
things as well other tech leads I know
spend time with the code base you are
actually doing a lot of sort of code
review logs so somebody might actually
go through sort of the sort of guilt or
subversion whatever sort of source
control that you're using and actually
just go through the the commits just
understand how things are changing
throughout the codebase I think it's
quite useful to do that just to get a
sense of how things are moving I also
would like to flag a warning here though
that you don't always want to simply
just go to somebody after you've been
reviewing commit commit logs and say you
know why did you do that because people
will think that they're being constantly
observed and watched it's more a bit of
feedback for you about how the team is
actually evolving rather than for
feedback for individuals now we're
actually thinking about the code base
structure one of the things that I'd be
thinking about is really this idea about
consistency over cleverness and so this
is really trying to balance out you know
the individual creativity of somebody
who wants to be clever and sold things
differently with understanding actually
we care about how easy it is for the
entire team to be able to do that and so
developers will naturally optimize for
themselves whereas a tech lead you're
kind of worrying about the whole team as
a whole so you kind of want everyone to
be able to move to different parts of
the codebase and part of that is making
sure we have a consistent sort of way of
solving things so I'm hoping that you
never have any of these sorts of
arguments about tabs or spaces to spaces
or floor spaces camelcase or underscore
brackets or not curly braces end of line
or next line type arguments and believe
me I've been on a lot of teams where
people will argue passionately about
these sorts of types of discussions I've
been even on teams where people will
actually check out code
okay Auto format and then check it back
into their own personal style and for me
that's telling me a there's some passion
which is really good but be the team has
kind of maybe focusing on the wrong
sorts of problems so syntax should never
ever really be a problem on a team of
some sort and your task and challenge is
really helping people understand there
are more interesting problems to solve
rather than formatting problems so
rather than talking about stylistic
things we should be really talking about
how do we solve a closed
a business problem with its elegant
algorithm or implementation how do we
make sure that we minimize the amount of
accidental complexity we add to our code
in the patterns or the ways that we're
actually using things rather than
arguing over where those curly braces
land and this is one of those things
where if you don't actually challenge
the the discussion
nobody will and those conversations will
go on and on and so you know if you
haven't ever sort of run a what do we
expect out of our sort of team as a
development group discussion it's really
important to talk about that to come up
with conventions and so the code
conventions are one aspect to that but
also patent implementation conventions
so how do we go about poaching things
about configuration how do we go about
approaching security elements and how do
we do that consistently across the group
there are other ways that we really
should be thinking about consistent
approaches and making sure that we align
on them now culture plays heavily into
the sort of the development team and so
when I'm thinking about the technical
aspects there are technical aspects of
the culture which I'm always watchful
for so if you've ever done sort of
continuous integration this might be a
common problem which is how long does
the build stay broken have you got a
culture of the development team saying
actually as soon as the build goes red
somebody on the team says no more
check-ins you know we really need to fix
this problem or do you get the other
side of the oh no our tests take forever
I don't really know if it's actually
going to be worked but you know I'm
going to check in my own code because
I'm pretty confident it'll work and so
that's actually telling you something
about the development sort of practices
and the values that your team upholds
about do they really understand the
principle of continuous integration or
are they just doing it because somebody
has told them to do that I often look
for if people are avoiding conflict as
well so one really healthy sign of a
good team is actually you should be able
to have conflict and be able to resolve
it so there are two sort of symptoms of
a very unhealthy team so one is you have
conflict and it just keeps escalating
till you can't solve it the other one is
that everything is very happy there are
no conflicts here but actually there
happening in the background somewhere
so you know you might have people sort
of checking out code and the
reformatting as an example and sort of
sort of rechecking that in
or they might be other sort of snide
remarks around implementation details
about maybe something that goes unsaid
and so actually this is something that
we need to foster which is actually a
open way of solving problems because we
need different opinions in order to
solve a problem really effectively I
look for whether or not people are
actually offering new ideas so earlier I
kind of talked about how industry is
constantly changing and it's really hard
for all of us to say on top of all of
the trends in the industry and actually
you know we all have personal interests
about what fascinates us so it might be
around say home automation so the
Internet of Things type things it might
be around hacking raspberry pies might
be around infrastructure automation and
we'll have our own sort of interests
that you know we might read about you
know in sort of personal time but we're
not tapping into that potential if
nobody brings up those ideas in the work
context about what can we actually use
in a play is there some new approach
that we should be thinking about
adopting or are people just sort of
saying okay I'm just going to do the
work that I've been asked to do
do people flag for help so a common
pattern that I see if you're doing sort
of daily stand-ups is you know a dev who
might have a sort of user story of some
sort and say you know I'm 80% done with
a story I'll almost be done the next
sort of day it's the same sort of story
I'm almost there there's just one more
thing that I need to fix and then the
next day is the I'm almost there I still
have this one thing to fix and one
that's actually telling me is that
there's probably some technical
challenge that they don't feel safe
asking for help and actually there'd be
a lot more effective if they went to
somebody and said hey do you know about
this this sort of problem how do I fix
it and they could actually progress it
as well and the biggest thing is really
also creating a atmosphere of
vulnerability and so you know do people
feel okay to admit being wrong now the
most powerful thing you can do as a tech
lead is actually say when you've done
something wrong made a mistake and that
actually creates an acceptance
environment or saying actually it's okay
to admit when things were wrong we can't
be right all the time you know I always
try to make sure it's literally in front
of the team I admit my mistakes because
it makes it safer for people to talk
about maybe the problems they're having
and the mistakes they have
and that means that we can actually
create a culture of faster feedback and
faster failure which means we can
correct those problems earlier rather
than let them sort of hide and build up
now the final aspect around the
programming is really asking yourselves
what is the vision that you're actually
having for what the development team is
heading towards so I believe in like
today's sort of industry we're actually
quite bad at really talking about
architectural vision what is the big
picture around what we're actually
trying to build or contribute towards
you know we're very good at sort of
taking of bite-sized pieces extra
features extra functionality but how
does it actually work towards this
grander vision of what we're actually
having and I think it's really important
that people understand where we're
heading towards because if they don't
have that sort of common picture then
you'll end up with the ten ways of doing
things so you might end up having to
reverse and rework sort of parts of the
system because it's not heading to where
you have and so one of the sort of
exercises that I do whether the teams
that I work with it's really making sure
that at regular periods so it might be
say every couple of months is that we
get towards together as a team and we
try to draw out poorer what we think our
system architecture is and how we're
actually evolving it over time because
there will be different parts of the
system which will change significantly
and people's mental models that system
will really change and unless we
actually get it out we won't be able to
see where there are differences so think
about maybe how you're articulating your
vision to the team if there's even a
vision on your team and if not what is
it that you're doing to help compel
people to help build something that
they're really excited by so we've
talked about sort of the the programming
side I'd like to move on to the people
side and this is actually probably one
of the most hardest things for a lot of
technical people so one of the reasons
for this is that you know nobody's
really given us a lot of training or
support around this so for the people
who have been playing this or the tech
lead role you've probably been like a
lot of people I've talked to thrown into
the role because you've been maybe seen
as the most experienced or maybe the
most trusted and suddenly there's a
whole bunch of pressure and you know
suddenly actually have to think about
everyone else on the team what they
bring how that actually works together
and we've often not given a lot of
support in this kind of role so
one of the key lessons I've learned over
time is actually appreciating that
people are different and unique and in
this is that there's a whole bunch of
things around strengths and weaknesses
that people bring that give us diversity
and I think it's really important that
when you actually think about your team
how diverse is that team overall one of
my favorite books in this area is a book
called strength signer it's written by a
couple of people from the Gallup
Organization and they've done a lot of
interviewing surveying with lots of
companies around the world and they try
to focus on what is it that made people
successful in their roles and one of the
interesting things that they did with
this book is that they notice that
people really focus on what their
strengths were rather than trying to
address their weaknesses right so often
were thought about when we actually
think about personal developments like
oh I'm not good at that maybe I should
invest some time in doing that but what
I actually notice in this book is that
people who are really successful really
focused on their strengths and amplify
their strengths in the context of
whatever the role they were doing and
they worked on the weaknesses by working
with other people who had complementary
strengths so actually that means we
actually need a whole bunch of different
types of strengths and sometimes working
with people who might have a different
style from us but they offer something
different from what we have and so this
is really interesting when you actually
think about your team and the diversity
of the team of how many different types
of strengths exists within the team as a
whole because if your team has say only
five strengths there's a whole bunch of
things that they're probably not going
to be good at as a whole I'll give you
some concrete examples of some of the
strengths that came out of this book so
we're is one of those strengths that
they talk about or chance for winning
others over you probably know people
like this right so they can sort of go
into a room of random people talk to
people about some idea and suddenly
people are convinced that's the right
thing to do it's a very rare skill
apparently only one or two percent of
the population actually have it but
really good if you're trying to convince
people to maybe adopt a new approach or
win others over for something that you'd
actually like to have maybe you're lucky
enough in your sort of role of the
technical leader that you already have
the woo strength
analytical people are quite important in
our industry right because there's a
whole bunch of things that can go wrong
and analytical people are thinking about
all the possible cases of what things
might actually happen and they're trying
to understand all the situations get a
lot of information understand the impact
between them and that's really useful as
we have more complex ecosystems or sort
of servers and applications working
together you have maybe two activator
strength and activated strength is this
thing an ability about getting people
started on something so this is really
about maybe they're energizing sort of
aspects of getting their team enthused
about maybe a new working practice a new
technology or tool and sort of keeping
this to the energy sustained perhaps you
have people who have the intellection
strengths about people who you know
aren't necessarily interested in about a
specific tool or technology but they're
interested about the implications of the
philosophy or the topic behind it so you
know they may not actually care so much
about say AWS but what they're really
interested in is what does a cloud
enable us to do and unleash and what
does that have in terms of our
architecture you you probably and I
hopefully have some people who have the
strength of achievers and achievers
other people who have this this drive to
have a sense of progress the sense of
getting things done and achiever
strengths can be really useful
particularly around tight deadlines
because you need people to make sure
things get done otherwise you know the
business will often come calling perhaps
you have their strategic strengths and
strategic people think not necessarily
in the terms of like what's coming up in
the next one or two months but they're
really thinking about what's going to
happen to our industry in the next two
or three years it's another one of those
rare skills apparently only 2% of the
population have this strengths as well
but it can be quite important when
you're actually thinking about our
technical vision about where we're
heading to and what does that mean about
what we might need to do now to prepare
us to be ready for the future and then
you have people who have maybe the
strength of input which is making sure
that everyone has a say and gathering
lots of information from lots of
different areas now the book has 37 of
these different signature strengths so
there's a lot more but I just kind of
wanted to point out actually what's
interesting about strengths and
diversity is that strengths give us a
better ability to cope with lots of
different situations so you know around
tight deadlines it's not really useful
to have a team that is only
intellection and analytical because
they'll just be thinking and talking
without actually ever getting anything
done at the same time you don't want a
whole team of just achievers because you
might get the wrong thing produced
because they haven't been thinking
thoroughly enough about what the
implications are what they're working on
are and so these are whether different
strengths actually come into play which
is actually understanding different
scenarios where those strengths are
actually applicable and it's not that a
strength is bad it's just it's more
useful in different circumstances the
other warning side and the challenge for
us as sort of tech leads is also
understanding how strengths can also be
a source of conflict so I'm an achiever
so one of my strengths is an achiever
and when I'm working with somebody who
has say an intellectual type of strength
I notice that we have different styles
working and very early on I would always
kind of assume are well you know we're
never going to get along because that
person just wants to keep thinking and
talking and never getting anything done
and I just want to get started right and
actually what I realized over time is
that these aren't necessarily about that
person is about how they prefer to
approach problems and one of the really
great ways of seeing people through a
view of different strengths it's
actually a bit of empathy I'm not saying
that person is bad or wrong but actually
understand they have a different way of
working and actually that can help
people find a better way of actually
working together rather than sort of
just continually butting heads about
different styles of working so for
instance when I'm working with somebody
who has that intellection and I
recognize that you know we talked about
maybe having some time off to let that
other person think about how they might
approach a problem and then we get
together and then we talk about how we
might actually start making progress and
they also have to acknowledge that I
also need a sense of understanding how
we're making progress so I can get a
sense of achievement so diversity can
bring a lot of strengths and and sort of
give us ability to handle a lot more of
different situations but also gives us a
challenge of understanding where things
might be conflicting and we have to deal
with that now this is an all just
theoretical as well a lot of this
strength in diversity is actually backed
up by research so in a commercial sense
there was a study done which was around
looking at 14 500 companies
looking at the composition of the board
and if there were three or more women on
the board you actually had significant
improvements in all aspects of the
business this was from 2007 so it's a
bit old but there was one in 2012 done
with just one female - the member on the
board we actually improved the return on
a curry from 12 to 16 percent and a lot
of that's really just about this idea of
diversity of a different way of
approaching problems a different way of
backgrounds and trying to understand
where diversity comes from if you'd like
to read more about this I recommend a
book called the difference it's written
by a professor from University of
Michigan's called Scottie page it's
quite a complicated mathematical formula
which I honestly don't really understand
but can be simplified to understanding
how the the strengths of the group is
really about how how good the group is
at its core so the average accuracy as
well as the diversity of the group so
I'm not saying that you can go off to
the street and say you're right you'll
compose the best team by just grabbing
random people on the street
you kind of need people who have a
background in writing software and
understanding how to build software but
actually if we have people who have
different backgrounds in writing
software so people who understand
algorithms people who understand data
structures people who understand
infrastructural automation they bring in
different elements your team as a whole
is much stronger and ready to cope with
many different problems as such but
there is a little sort of caveat which
is the star there and this is really
about this ability to integrate and this
is where your role comes in which is
really making sure that there is some
diversity but also the ability that
people respect each other that you can
talk about these things and find ways to
actually integrate different sort of
solutions to make sure that you make
progress now the other side to people is
really about how you go about a sort of
achieving that and this is really about
sort of trust building now I think when
most people think about Trust they think
about sort of those one day off sites
where the team goes away and they do
something like high-ropes and it's all a
lot of fun and then everyone goes back
to their sort of environment and then
they go back to how they were working
before and my key message for you is
really thinking about what are the trust
building exercises that you're
encouraging to help people understand
besides with each other on a sort of
weekly or daily basis it's not like you
can go off and send a team off for day
and assume that suddenly they'll be the
best team over time it's actually making
sure that you invest ways that help
people build relationships so you know
think about feedback on your team about
how often that actually happens amongst
the team that you have talked about how
often people talk about their strengths
and what they're actually doing and what
their personal goals are thinking about
about their personal interests in
allowing them to talk about that in the
work space and people grow an
understanding about who they're actually
working with which brings us onto the
next sort of topic which is really about
your responsibility now I sort of talked
about there's this sort of move from
being a developer which is your maker
mode to being this leader and it
actually shifts significantly from doing
that you're making to being a multiplier
you're really there to also amplify the
effectiveness of everyone on the team
and this is where I like this model
which talks about how you sort of grow
people so there's this sort of model
called flow and it's kind of thinking
about how people grow and learn over
time so on one axes here you can sort of
see the challenge and then you also have
maybe some of these skill in in their
ability to solve that challenge now when
people had take on something new for the
first time and they don't have a skill
you end up getting very anxious perhaps
you've been in this on your role to
being a tech leader for the first time
what do I do
how do I approaches am i doing it right
at the same time if you do the same
thing over and over again you end up
being kind of bored right so oh I can't
do another MVC web application I need
something else to do and so there's this
channel in between which is actually
this flow channel of us growing and
learning so in order for us to get into
this sort of state of flow we kind of
need something that pushes us out of the
comfort zone this is something you could
offer to people on your team give them
something new to do that they've never
been done before give them a challenge
and give them support so that they're
not there to fail but actually when they
succeed they'll get into this flow zone
right so they'll get this buzz of I've
learned something new I've done
something different and therefore I'm
learning and growing however you need to
watch out for people doing the same
thing over and over because they will
end up sort of getting bored and what
they need is a new challenge to bring
them into that
zone and one of the warnings of bored
people is that blood people will quit
they will look for a place where they
can grow and learn and this is something
you really want to be thinking about on
your sort of team so really trying to
find ways that people can try something
new a new task activity they've never
done before new technology and support
them and help them grow into this sort
of flow zone and this is I guess the
idea of really being a Maximizer and
multiplier and what I tend to think
about with the individuals on my team as
I try to build up a mental model of of
those sort of different perspectives of
what they have so what are the skills do
they have or what do they bring what are
their strengths what are their sort of
goals and ambitions at a personal level
and what are they interested in outside
of work that maybe might be relevant and
what I'm really looking for is something
that aligns well with what they want to
do that they're good at that they have
strengths at and it'll be really
successful and it'll help your team as
well so even if it's something that
maybe I as a sort of a technical person
might have been able to solve if it
actually hits this sweet spot
I'd rather give it to them because
they'll grow they'll be really enthused
and you'll help helping to multiply
their effectiveness and we can actually
influence some of these things so with
skills we can actually you know send
people to conferences like this send
them on training courses and Sue's
people around that we can help them
maybe build interests or help them maybe
establish concrete goals there's maybe
less about what we can do around the
sort of strengths and around this is
really thinking about how we encouraging
learning on us at a team environment so
these are just a broad spectrum of lots
of different ways that you might think
about learning in your team and it's
such an important aspect of making sure
that your team is constantly growing so
in order for us to keep up to date with
all the changing technologies people
need time to actually do this so you
might think about the Google's 20% time
but you can actually think about how you
spread this out over time as well so how
often do you get together as a team and
do code reviews and learn something
about the code base maybe share Beth's
best practices that are already evolving
but not yet multiplied across the entire
team there might be external things like
books or video clubs where you might
take conferences videos like from this
and then sort of show this and then talk
about how it's relevant to what you're
doing as a team and so through that way
you're encouraging learning as well the
final aspect of people is probably one
of the hardest ones to deal with and
it's really an important thing to
remember which is being aware of the bad
apples so there's a paper which is here
called bad is stronger than good and it
talks about our sort of human bias
around how in order for us to have
offset a bad experience we kind of need
about ten good experiences to kind of
levy that out and so if somebody is
actually acting negatively and having a
bad impact to your team they can
actually have a much more significant
impact than what they're actually doing
to you because they're having a negative
impact on the rest of the team as well
and so by you not doing anything about
that you're actually explicitly allowing
that behavior and you have to think
about what impact that's actually having
on the team and ultimately you're
responsible for the effectiveness for
the entire team
and you have to be prepared to have
difficult conversations with that person
about maybe the behaviors are there
they're demonstrating all the things
that they're saying and the impact that
it's having on the rest of the group and
so it's really important that you really
think about what you do about that bad
Apple often they're not really bad there
are circumstances in which you might be
able to work with them on but you're
really responsible for dealing with that
situation because everyone else on the
team will probably avoid that sort of
conflict or situation overall so we
talked about programming talked about
people I sort of want to move on to the
sort of process and one of the hardest
things that a lot of first sunset leads
fall into is is it okay to tell people
what to do so as a first time tech lead
a lot of people will be thinking I need
to make all the decisions I need to tell
people here's how you go solve this you
know as a developer that's how I behaved
I made all the choices so is it okay to
do this and I see kind of two extremes
of yes or no and actually there's a yes
but it depends kind of sort of answer
and one of the models that I find is
really is for around this is really this
one called the situational leadership
model so you can kind of think about
four types of behaviors of what you can
have to help people solve problems and
it kind of goes through sort of
backwards curve which I'll talk about in
a second so we can be very directing
which is actually about maybe mean
telling you
what to do in breaking things down step
by step or we can take a bit more of a
coaching role which is actually about
asking people questions to help them
find the problem a solution that
actually they could actually implement
themselves sometimes we can actually
take supporting behaviour where we're
actually working on a problem together
contributing both perspectives and
experiences about how we do things or we
don't tell people what to do and we just
simply delegate so people decide what
they'd actually like to have so there's
a spectrum of behavior of how we
actually interact with our team members
it's not just we tell people what to do
we let them do whatever they like in
order for us to actually understand this
we actually need to understand maybe
where we actually go about applying this
and part of this model is describing
where these behaviors actually are
appropriate and part of this is really a
function of how good that person is in
terms of particular skill set that
matches a particular activity so this is
thinking about whether or not somebody
is developing or developed around that
particular skill so if you're sort of
don't yet have any competency in a
particular area but you're really highly
motivated this is where directing
behaviour makes a lot of sense so a
really good example is we hire a lot of
so University graduates who you know are
really excited because it's their first
time in industry and maybe learnt about
some of these sort of theoretical things
but they don't really know what it means
in the real world so they're really
highly motivated but they don't have
that competency yet and this is actually
where breaking sort of things down into
tasks and actually saying here's how you
solve that problem reduces that anxiety
of them learning something new and for
me it would be very similar so if
somebody said okay I need to start
setting up a you know machine learning
sort of thing using such-and-such
platforms then you know if I'm not
familiar with those tools I want a bit
more of a hands-on guide about how I go
about learning this step-by-step
directing behavior is okay but we can't
just always operate in that mode and so
as somebody develops so those competence
and skill they'll start to ask you
should we be doing it that way and this
is where you move into your to the
coaching mode of actually asking
questions to help them find the solution
themselves other points then once you
actually have sort of mixed competence
and variable commitment that's where you
might move into you're sort of
supporting mode of actually code jointly
solving that problem together
this is we're actually working with that
person brainstorming solutions testing
out things maybe writing code with that
other person and then if somebody has
the skills and is highly motivated this
is where delegation works really well so
you know people will do the job and do
it well and you don't have to worry too
much about it from your perspective the
other bottle around teams that it's
really important to know is around this
thing about Tuchman so it's quite an old
model that talks about the stages of
group development so a lot of teams will
sort of get together and that sort of
first stage is really this forming stage
right so you are now a team and
collection of people working towards the
same goal and then what naturally
happens is people start to understand
people have different ways working they
work differently for me or they think
differently for me and that's where a
lot of the conflict comes and a lot of
teams get stuck in a sort of storming
phase and this is where this is your
leverage point as Leeds is actually
understanding what's going on in this
part and trying to surface up those
conversations to agree on maybe ways of
working agree on code standards agree as
a whole about what's important for you
as a group to agree on and that's really
about then establishing these norms and
then hopefully when you actually have
norms it's only really the time where
teams get the benefit of actually
working in teams and that's at
performing stage now the model
originally had these four stages and
what they kind of observed is that teams
don't really last forever right so they
form for a purpose and then they sort of
dissolve and I actually notice there was
this adjoining phase right and you
probably know this when a significant
team member has left you have like a
farewell party you know you kind of
grieve to a certain degree because
there's somebody leaving that you kind
of liked working with and that kind of
was this earning phase but interestingly
what happens with this is that you
actually reset the entire team process
again so if you add somebody or if
somebody leaves the team you actually
end up with a completely new team
because the dynamics of that system are
quite different there'll be different
responsibilities that maybe the new
person wants to overtake that somebody
already has and maybe the person who
left was doing things that nobody else
is doing so there might be a gap or a
vacancy and so this is actually where
the team will start to restructure and
understanding well who was doing that
and so you need to actually think about
going through
this phase and accelerating that once
again when people get added or removed
but the key message that I want you to
take away is that a lot of these tools
are just models and I really like this
quote essentially all models are wrong
but some are useful so hopefully this
helps you understand how you structure
your thinking about solving specific
problems around programming or people a
process and my final set of words for
you is really making sure that you make
time for yourself so when you're
actually thinking about this role you'll
end up with a whole bunch of meeting
invites there's a whole bunch of things
that you feel that you need to do and it
could often feel overwhelming so you
never have enough time to do anything
and actually to be effective it's really
important that you carve out time to
think about how you're approaching a
role how are you being a multiplier
rather than just a maker and helping the
whole team in these three different
aspects of what we were talking about
and so you really need to find this kind
of thinking time and everyone has their
own ways of doing it but it's really
important for you to be effective you
really need that time to think
explicitly rather than just simply
reacting to all the things that are
going around and I will say from a
personal level that you will probably
struggle with this because as a
developer it's it's very hard to not
feel productive unless you're writing
code and when you're in this sort of
leadership role you don't really have a
tangible output with when you're dealing
with people the process so you might
with the code but it can feel really
hard because you're not getting any
concrete output of what you're expecting
but this is where actually you really
need to be thinking about on your sort
of reflection time where you're spending
that time and what effects are you
having that you feel that you're
actually making progress in so as an
example this is kind of a snapshot of
how I tried to think about mice at a
time which is both of the start and the
end of the week so I try to really think
about booking our explicit planning time
in my diary so I sort of decline invites
to meetings and make sure that people
understand it's really important for you
to be effective in order to have the
time and you need the time to actually
think about it so in conclusion the tech
lead role is a really important role to
help amplify the effectiveness of teams
and to be effective you really need to
think about those three aspects of
balancing the programming people and
process
hopefully some of the tools and models
that I've talked about today will help
you in your role or help you as you
transition into this role to not feel
overwhelmed thank you we have a few
minutes for questions if anyone has any
so the question is how did we solve the
formatting issue on a sort of
company-wide sort of level and I would
say we don't have a company-wide
consistent level because when we work
with clients we kind of adopt whatever
the coding standard is for that group
and so when we work with clients the
first thing we'll do is a if there's an
existing one we adopt it otherwise we're
introducing a different way or if it's
not then we try to facilitate the
conversation around okay what is it that
we care about we know that we'll have
differences about how we format that
let's agree on that and also let's
automate that process as well so both
Eclipse and IntelliJ have sort of
settings that you can actually configure
to make sure that everyone has the same
sort of consistent formatting styles so
the short answer is we don't solve a
company-wide because for us our software
is very client dependent and so we
really try to align with our clients on
what they'd like and if they don't we
help them establish one yes
do I have any advice on team sizes so so
I prefer kind of smaller teams in terms
of the classic 5 plus or minus 2 kind of
level but I've been on teams that have
been quite large as well but what it
means is that you end up having to
really monitor a whole bunch more people
of understanding what things are going
on
so obviously the team size will mean
that the code base moves a lot quicker
so you'll have to be doing a lot more
code reviews but if your pair
programming often you end up sort of
trading off speed for quality so you
might end up with less code but the code
will work really well so actually you
can scale up a little bit more with pair
programming because the number of sort
of code commits tend not to be as high
and also you'll have a lot more
consistency as well so I would sort of
go 5 to 7 people but it can go up a
little bit more in terms of developers
if you're doing pair programming at
least in my experience
yes middle
yeah so the question was is there a way
of maybe balancing about getting people
or try to find a way that people can
work on something that they're really
good at but also something that they'd
be really maybe bored out and actually
that's where I try to encourage people
to really rotate and an expectation of
people should try normal things or
rotate that so really common one is
maybe you get to work on the things that
you're interested in but also we have to
rotate something that nobody really
wants to do so you maybe nobody wants to
be the build master of making sure the
build is green chasing up sort of things
and we sort of rotate that
responsibility so part of that is really
just an expectation with teams about you
know what are the things that we need to
do every day is that maybe nobody wants
to do but we all have to do it it's not
fair to maybe put it on one person but
actually for us to have that we can
split that responsibility but also then
you also then that means you get to work
on things you'd like to do as well so my
times up I'd like to thank you for
coming along and I'll be here after the
break so thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
