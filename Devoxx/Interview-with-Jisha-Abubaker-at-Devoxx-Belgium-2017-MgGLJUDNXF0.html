talking to Jesse he's just given a talk
very kindly come straight from your talk
about Google cloud platform and spring
integrations so what excites you about
this project I believe you're a
committer yes I am so we just released a
milestone release of this and we're on
github it's spring cloud GCP spring -
cloud - tcp and the exciting part is
that you can actually just start using
Google cloud platform services to just
add a dependency rewires through
annotations and you don't have to
rewrite your code that that just sounds
amazing to me so that's that's really
the really best part about it and some
of these integrations it's come together
in less than a year it's actually a
collaboration between the Google and
pivotal engineers and there's lots more
in the works so I'm really excited where
it's going and what's the best feature
about it oh if I were to say well the
best features are so many cool
integrations and there but I think I'm
what I like the most is the one for
cloud sequel so Google cloud sequel as
Google cloud platforms managed to sequel
and yeah and the greatest part is you
don't have to whitelist any IPS you
don't have to basically do anything
different right you just include the
dependency you provide the configuration
and you can just use like in Java
everybody's so used to JPS or hibernate
now that that's all you can just use all
that right there's nothing in your code
that is vendor locked in that is awesome
it's really easy it is so you know in
the top we kind of did that walk through
applications and then deployed it and so
hopefully everybody got that just yeah
what kind of integration is DC coming in
the future can we get a sneak peak on
anything we're well we have logging
sorry we have like tracing at the moment
and definitely that is like a highly
requested one which I know will
definitely be out soon is tying in good
the tracing of distributed tracing and
making sure your logs reflect that as
well the others I'm not really
or they're definitely again it's it's
it's an open source repository so we're
also welcoming people to submit feature
requests so that we can help prioritize
and there any features that you'd like
to see
truth be told as a Java developer I I
guess to me it's like I should not I
should not have to question which
service exists here in terms of an
integration all the services should be
directly available and they're mostly
are to the extent that they made it easy
to work we do have Java libraries and
it's easy enough to even use those
libraries if with the existing
integration so it's it's almost there
but again it would make life so much
easier
I think famish thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
