you into a talk about drum racing
my name is Stefan these are my two other
colleagues Nick and Jill we would like
you to introduce in a new exciting new
sport of drone racing on which we think
it's the next big thing and by any
experience we can tell you it's awesome
now one video is more than a thousand
words and this is what we are talking
about no audio
one technical issue one moment a dense
fig till start them up
and okay
do have your attention so let's talk
about the drone themselves most racing
drones are available as skits this means
you basically have to buy all the parts
and put them to sell and put them
together yourself
the drone racing community is amazing
and very active online so you can get
any information need to different
channels we talked you in this
presentation through the belt of racing
your own and show you the different
components so I would like to give the
word ethnic okay I'd like to talk you
through the build of a racing drone
first of all we start off with a frame
this is a mini H frame the frame is call
that way
because of its shape it's in the shape
of an H and it basically puts the
propellers more to the side so that you
don't have the propellers in your view
so you can watch everything what is in
front of you the frame is completely
made out of carbon fiber which is very
light and also very strong and that's
exactly what we need because we don't
keep them in the air as often as you
might think we have two bottom plates
and there are two four arms mounted in
between on top of that are eight
standoffs
with the top plate on top and in between
that actually goes all the electronic
parts the small piece on top is to
mountain yeah an optional camera like a
GoPro to record your flights which as
you saw in the beginning movie then we
have the esc s and brushless motors the
ESC or electronic speed controllers
basically giving the signals to the
bridgeless motors so they can turn the
brushless motors are used a lot in
you control aircraft yeah airplanes and
drones because of their efficiency power
longevity and one other thing and
because they are really lightweight so
there are a lot better than the
traditional burst motors then we have
the flight controller the flight
controller is actually the brain of the
drone it processes data it gets from
gyroscopes on the board itself and
converts them to signals which are later
sent to the esc s so the data processed
makes the drone fly in a certain angle
so that it doesn't doesn't have another
course then we have the RC transmitter
and RC receiver which are needed of
course to communicate with between the
drone and the pilot the more modern
receiver sets also provide telemetry
data back to the pilot itself telemetry
data like battery voltage or radio
control signal strength so that you
don't go idle out of range and lose your
drone then another important thing the
batteries the batteries used for racing
drones are lithium polymer batteries
they are used because they are
lightweight and they can provide a lot
of current at one moment for racing it's
really important to choose the right
battery you don't want a heavy battery
but you want a lighter battery but you
still have to make sure you can yeah you
can complete all your laps with a
battery of course to show you of what
you might need or need to do when
building a drone yourself I'm going to
show you a little built video I made
myself and you will see what you'll need
right so as you can see it involves a
lot of work to put a racing drone
together once we have this part of the
racing drone we have to talk a little
bit about the the first-person view in
the FPV because the video downlink is
what we need to get the drone up and
running in the air fpv stands for fpv
first-person view so basically it means
that it's you are inside the aircraft
that's the meaning of it we have two
cameras one is the CCD camera it's
frequently used in security systems and
we use it in our drone to pilot them
through the air we have the video
transmitter it's it stands for the
downlink the video through your goggles
as you can see over there so it means
exactly what it says it sends a downlink
of the video to your goggles and you're
inside the aircraft when you fly it also
a lot of pilots use a GoPro or another
action camera to record the the flight
sessions and put it on the popular
channels such as YouTube or a female in
order and Orick things like that
what we will see next is a DVR recording
this is what you see to your goggles the
reason why there's so many artifacts in
the video is that it's analog 2015
analog what no it's analog because of a
few reasons first of all is the latency
in the video an analogue video feed is
almost instant and doesn't freeze or
lockup in most violet wireless digital
video applications there's quite an
amount of latency and you need quite
some bent white and this have a steady
feed when you are racing the Drunken
reached speeds were about 100 kilometers
an hour had those speeds even the tenth
of a second is about two meters in delay
so when the latest C gets higher than
that the drone feels like it's lagging
and controlling itself see in the brush
quite often we would like to talk about
the tracks we are flying the tracks we
set most of the time we set them up
ourselves and it can be very different
we basically have three types of tracks
the natural tracks the Agra tracks and
the indoor tracks you will see here an
example of a natural track consist of
nothing but objects darah
are in the flying spot one can fly
between the trees around bushes over
hills anything goes really one thing you
have to keep in mind when flying between
objects is that you are able to keep
your radio and video link all the way
around the track objects like trees and
bushes can cause your link to be very
poor and just making it harder to fly
also we have the air gate paragate track
you see a video of that here very
popular and I get track on the other
hand consists of consists of gates
through which the pilot has to fly this
brings in the difficulty of handling the
tour dimension
Hite because of the fact that the pilot
has to fly through the air gates the
altitude of the flight never is very
high about 1/2 meters at max the pilot
also has to take into consideration the
other pilots are constantly trying to
get out to take over since every pilot
is flying through the gates the space is
limited and crashes might occur also the
egg a tracks are usually set up on an
open field that provide enough space to
create a track layout from scratch
there has been very creative design
slated lately using multiple airbase
next to each other on top of each other
of even entire tunnels to make it even
more challenging to race then the last
one the indoor track fairly popular in
Belgium because of the weather indoor
tracks have been popular since some
pilots became very great if they find a
location during winter times bat rattle
kept the pilot grounded and looking for
alternatives probably the most popular
indoor locations are parking lots their
wall provides very good lightning and
are really exciting to racing on the
other end they cost a lot of money for
the the drone racer because they're
really unforgiving when making a mistake
you have a ceiling you have the floor
and then you have the poles between so
it's you find yourself rebuilding your
drone every time you use off you fly
this track okay Nick okay let's talk
about erasing the racing is done in
different ways we have basically two
types of racing we have time trial races
and tournament style races the time
trial racing is very straightforward you
try to fly a certain track from start to
finish as fast as possible most of the
time the pilots have a couple of rounds
to improve their time on the other hand
time trial can also be very challenging
you have to put everything in one lap
there's no strategy you just have to go
as fast as possible also your most of
the time the only pilot flying so you
have a whole crowd watching you the
other pilots from the event too so if
you make a mistake you can do the walk
of shame to retrieve your quadcopter
again and it's always fun as long as
you're not a pilot doing the work so
then we have a tournament style racing
it's a little bit more about strategy
tournament style racing has become very
popular the last couple of months
because there is an increasing number of
pilots that register for these events
internationally we had around hundred
twenty pilots registering for an event
so if you are going to do time travel
then then yeah it's it's it takes just
too long to let everyone fly one lap
after each other so yeah they convert it
to a tournament style event and then a
tournament style event you have a couple
heat where you fly with other pilots at
the same time and every eat you can gain
points by finishing first second third
fourth and of course support the points
did the points you get more points if
you finish first in a second of course
after a couple of rounds the points are
added up and determine your position in
the tournament most of the time the last
races are done in the final so for
example the last 16 pilots advance to
the finals and they there are several
elimination races so that the first two
pilots will only go through to the next
final until the first positions are won
by the pilots so as I said tournament
style racing is more about strategy
because you're rather finished seconds
and gain some points then raise the
whole eat first and crash in the last
lap which you don't get points for of
course
so that's the main difference between
time trial and tournament also with
tournament style racing there is also
the custom that you have a secondary
person right behind you we call it a
spotter he or she watches the racetrack
for you and it can determine where you
are on the track relative to the other
pilots because for example if you are
racing in the semi-finals and there are
already two pilots crashed and you are
one of both pilots still flying you can
take you can take it easy and just
finish our laps without having the risk
to crash of course so a lot of work has
already been done to organize races now
they even have some software to track to
time track you when you're racing in a
race it's basically it works with the
transponder once you you go through a
gate they take lock your time that
you've done so it's really handy and
because there's no discussion who's
faster or whatever so it's it's growing
pick it's growing really big maybe yeah
that's it
we also have already a lot of events in
Belgium it keeps growing every week
there's a race in Belgium and in the
Netherlands also so every week we can
subscribe to a race in Belgium we have
the drone racing Belgian crew they
organize a lot of races indoor in rank
they do it most frequently around the
world we have also the drone racing
nationals
that's a very big event if you win there
you can win $25,000 so that's a lot of
money this year it will take place in
Hawaii it's around the world right now
they doing qualifiers in every country
of the world and you can qualify by
winning a race here in Belgium and then
you can go to Hawaii in September next
year
be part of the drone nationals we also
have a racing simulator it's for
practicing you can do it basically in
your chair and practice on your
television screen it works really really
good
it's called liftoff it's been released
today there were before a lot of
simulators that weren't so good as this
one this one is really realistic it's
produced by Lucas studios and we think
it will be the next big thing especially
in winter when the weather itself
outside is not so good you can sit in
your chair inside and play the game very
realistic
so as Jill said they're releasing the
game today through Steam early access
there are a couple of features that are
really interesting for us especially
with the weather like Jill said we have
free flight modes we have three
different environments we have custom
parts which we also in real life change
a lot if we want to try a different
setup we can try it we can also connect
our fpv camera no not our fpv camera
with our fpv goggles video goggles to
the computer and have actually the the
the real experience because the
simulation also simulates the fpv camera
noise and distortion you'll get when you
fly behind objects there's also support
for our see transmitters so if you are a
pilot yourself you can just connect the
RC transmitter to USB or different USB
game controllers everything goes
actually there are a lot of features
coming soon the guys are working on a
track editor and also on a multiplayer
feature which is of course a lot of fun
when flying with a couple of other
pilots we have a bit of the early access
game footage for you to watch
can you receive
you can change every part of the racing
drone to select different motors can
select different four colors which also
translate into a different flying
behavior in the game itself
there you see the glitches and the
artifacts that you also had in the DVR
recording we saw previously the overlay
is an on-screen display which a lot of
pilots also use basically lets you see
the horizon we're really looking out to
the multiplayer mode of that that game
okay - and we would like to invite you
for a little demonstration here in the
hallway we'll be flying for a small time
but then we also like to invite you to
the parking lot in the building next to
this one where we have a little bit more
room and can show you a little bit
better what the races are about so I
would like to thank you very much for
being here and yeah see you later thank
you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
