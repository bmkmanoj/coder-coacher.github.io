quickie on the spring framework roadmap
actually have a full-length session on
modern modern chava component design
pair with me here coming up right
afterwards which is going to be a more
extensive discussion of the design
behind the spring from a component model
and some of the more recent features
that are available in current versions
of spring so it's a design discussion
source code based design discussion
you're highly welcome to to go there in
this short presentation I'm going to
take just a couple of minutes to discuss
both what we've done very recently and
what we intend to do over the next well
12 to 18 months really so in all brevity
this is some of the Giza some of the
focused topics in springtime work for
the two this is already available when
GA end of July we're currently working
towards photo to that three plenty of
stuff in there so in spring framework we
tend to have feature releases of a very
rich kind right so a folded one for the
two a photo 3 release actually brings a
lot of features on to the table with
actually more than you would get out of
major releases in in some other projects
it's just a version terminology that we
are using so in fuller to for example we
have support for default methods across
the framework now we detect annotated
Java 8 default methods we have a rich
event listener model with / method
called XO an annotated event method
model in folder to now with ordering
with an option to combine it with a
synchronous execution everything you
would would expect to be possible in
combination with other spring features
we spent
significant effort on a revision of our
annotation Elias model our composable
annotation model where you are able to
combine out-of-the-box annotations in
spring into custom annotations of your
own and there's a lot of flexibility now
in how you can express attribute
attribute references between your
annotations and the spring annotations
that you're using more than that in my
modern Java component design session
afterwards the support for chase are 354
is a little bit ahead of its time but we
took the opportunity to support the
monetary amount type in the currency
unit type in 354 out of the box so if
you're using spring data binding and you
happen to be one of the early adopters
of choice of 354 anything will work out
of the box for you as you expect to
write just use a monetary amount bind to
it render it out we were trying to
naturally follow the rules there of GSR
354 for the money and currency types
just like you already used to for joe de
time and JDK 8 java dot time the same
kind of rules apply we have significant
improvement in the web space which is
the second half he writes so the support
across original requests and in
particular the revision of our HTTP cash
handling might be strong enough reasons
on on their own to upgrade to for the
two we also have a support for can for
streaming responses and service and
events in particular so sse support
first class in spring MVC handler method
endpoint previously you could do this
quite easily yourself but it wasn't very
expressive very first class now you're
actually able to return an sse emitter
from a spring MVC handler method and the
framework treated for you we have
support for JavaScript based web views
which actually goes along with a
revision of the hgs a two to three
supporting course spring which is the
scripting engine the scripting
abstraction we
support in particular nastran the Java 8
JavaScript engine in particular but
that's of course generally usable with
any other scripting provider right and
the htmlunit integration is a special
purpose topic in the web space oops yeah
well it's can't be inverted
unfortunately I have the animations
mixed up a little here but actually not
too bad we have a spring framework for
the three coming and I'm already let me
already at this point this is the last
Jadakiss 6 and 7 compatible release that
you can expect to come out of spring
land spring framework for the three is
the last for the dicks feature for the
decks future release there's not going
to be a for that for the next thing
we're working towards the spring filmic
52 though which is as we way I'm going
to mention in a second is going to be
Java 8 based so spring framework for 3
is a spring for feature release has the
same system requirements works on six
seven eight and even early snapshots of
nine as for the two does right now and
works on server containers back to
server to that five plus so you can use
it on web cs7 and tomcat six still even
for next year's spring framework for 23
for the fries plan to have an open
extended open source support life a
little bit like spring framework 3 to
the X right now right we're already
working towards 32 16 the the idea is
that if you are a jdk six or seven user
or just happy with your existing spring
framework usage in your target
environment spring framework for the
three is what you're supposed to upgrade
to because that's the one with the
extended support life for the two will
only have regular support until for the
freeze-out plus a few months as we
recently have as a policy but for the
three is going to be supported until the
2019 easily so what's plant there quite
a bit of stuff it's actually a lot of
ideas combined for smaller refinements
in the dependency injection model there
are some some ideas some things you
cannot do yet constructors and
configuration classes automatically
consider a constructor auto
if it's the only one in a democratic
target class there are a couple of ideas
we're also exploring which kinds of
convenience annotations we could be
shipping in addition to the ones that we
already have but most of the annotations
that we ship right now are basically
building blocks they can be combined
semantically combined and they could
even be combined out of the box so we
are wondering whether we are supposed to
shape out of the box coping annotations
pre-built request session scope
annotations instead of leaving it up to
you to specify sculpting with that scope
we already have a precomposed annotation
which is at rest controller if you ever
bumped into that one which is a
combination of a spring at controller
endpoint indicator endpoint stereotype
and the ad response body annotation to
consider return strings from handle
methods as bodies to be turned into a
rest response this is the kind of way
we're going so imagine just out of the
box combinations of certain things you
can already express in a natural way
with an opportunity to find a good name
for it so custom annotations compose the
notations of this kind even if we ship
them in particular if we ship them out
of the box we have an opportunity to
find a good name for it and I suppose
some of those could be very commonly
used in practice and we have a couple of
integration upgrades coming newer
versions well actually not new versions
were compatible with the latest in
Jackson chest by repos hibernate and so
forth already but more like baseline
upgrades we're going to raise the
minimum a little easing some of our
integration allowing us to avoid the use
of deprecated methods so spring
framework for the three is an important
wrap up release in the folded X line but
it's actually open for community
requests right if there's anything you
would really like to see in spring
framework photodex still by all means
now is the time to raise it we are in
the process of defining selecting the
concrete spring framework full of three
feature targets and we'll create the
actual sort of three branch and start to
work towards snapshots there in december
so it's open for feature requests to
some degree right as much as we can
deal with until q2 so sorry for the mess
up I'll fix it this way next up is
spring framework 5 and spring fight back
five aimed to be released towards the
end of next year q for next year because
it's supposed to follow JDK nine so a
central topic is comprehensive JDK nine
support to the degree that we can all
right we're going to do everything we
can to support module arrangement we're
going to do everything we can to support
in you HTTP client if it actually makes
it into jerky 9 we are already testing
on the latest jdk 9 snapshot so there's
the actual runtime compatibilities are
already there and spring framework for
the two will in particular be there and
for the three this is about explicit
first-class support for new jetta canine
features not just tolerating jdk nine at
runtime but rather embracing it at the
same time we're going to raise the
baseline to jdk 8 plus requiring to a
decade-plus across the framework
allowing us to use java 8 source code
style all across our own code base a
very important enabler since we can use
default methods job a default methods in
our own api and spi interfaces we can
use landers internally it's in an
important step to take to prepare for
further innovation to follow and to ease
our maintenance in 5 to the X feature
releases there are a couple of specs
that we're tracking a GFE further
revision plant that's the java detect a
java extra inject package we're tracking
servlet for the dough we are tracking
stuff that's happening in the JMS and je
cache space where we already have
existing support and spring pretty rich
supporting spring we might chip early
support for this in five todo already it
looks like we're actually going to be
ahead of those specs so some of the
actual GA support might following a 5
that one then but we are known for doing
things as early as technically possible
so we might already do some of this in
52 though we have a pretty strong HTTP
two story when we're already starting
this we are working on some things now
already we can already use spring
framework for the two with chatty number
three and using HTTP to there so
we are trying to embrace HTTP to enabled
web containers web servers very early
this is going to continue in five with
the jdk nine HTTP HTTP client and just a
general focus on proper HTTP to use
between clients and servers everything
we can possibly do to make that happen
will will also make it into 520 at least
if we can into full of three to some
degree enabling reactive web
architectures is a pretty central topic
in its own right the idea is that in
spring 5 we ship a core spring reactive
module with support for reactive streams
out of the box it's a spring MVC like
endpoint arrangement so it looks like
syntactically is very analogous to a
spring MVC endpoint model but you're
actually working on a reactive engine
running on Nettie currently there's a
prototype already the spring reactive
project on github but it's going to be
decomposed into a spring framework five
feature theme where we do allow you to
have an HTTP enabled web pocket am a
reactively enabled web architecture
where in in terms of what you're
interacting with you know that you're
living in a reactive world you can
return publishers you you can do things
in a natural reactive style it is not
about trying to adapt spring MVC as it
is onto a reactive engine it's about
taking the spring MVC syntax and
development experience and having a
separate but similar endpoint model
running on the reactive engine
underneath and there's also going to be
some reactive core support all over the
framework where abstractions that we
have already will be opened up to
support back pressure and the end result
ideally of course is to allow for
completely reactive processing call path
from the HTTP endpoint down to the data
store and back up so we also tracking
what's happening with the MongoDB and
posts rest drivers those things make
most sense if you can
use them of course in combination with
reactive data store drivers the idea is
that you're not necessarily building a
fully reactive application you might
have a micro services arrangement where
some of the micro services would really
benefit from a reactive processing
arrangement those you will typically
then build with the spring five reactive
endpoint model and the rest of the
application many parts of the system
might actually work in a more
traditionally oriented processing
architecture that's perfectly okay he
might microservices arrangement the
micro services movement allows you to
combine basically the best of those
worlds for the different purposes that
you're building your micro services for
so it's not an it's not about all or
nothing it's not an ideological
arrangement where you now suppose to do
everything reactively it's about opting
into reactive nests in places where you
actually benefit from it with a very
familiar and elegant syntactic endpoint
model that feels like a spring component
model to you where you can translate
many of your existing and of your
existing understanding of spring
component models just right there and to
allow you to do things reactively if you
need to all right well so much really
for the purposes of the wiki talk 30
seconds left so next up is four to three
we're working on that right now coming
next week food spring framework for dot
3 which have discussed before lust for
the next feature release coming the
target is in may 2016 and spring filmic
52 dull more loosely planned towards the
fourth quarter like end of next year
based on on the plane that I've outlined
thanks for your attention feel free to
join me for my modern channel component
design talk in 10 minutes but in some
other room if I remember correctly
thanks
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
