about typography in programming
languages this is a very difficult topic
because most of the editors or
programming languages do not support any
kind of aesthetics this is said the
story begins actually with the writing
and the reading and you don't know how
long things you write have to be read
and so it's a very good idea to do it in
a very fine manner and as you can see a
long time ago someone wrote this and you
see a very fine structure for example
you see lions and maybe other structures
can be seen and they I don't think that
they assume that this will that the
information will be kept for a few
thousand years so with programming i
think it's not for that long histories
but it would be a good idea if our
programs would also look very good most
of the things we learned our from the
Romans the Romans themselves didn't
invent anything they stole everything
from the Greek but this is very
important for us because we are still
using these letters so when we see a
fund new times Roman then the Roman
refers to those Romans so this is a
style we use almost 2,000 years ago more
than 2,000 years ago when Gutenberg
started printing with movable letters he
could also have done it like the Romans
did it but he wanted not to change what
was standard then at that time
everything was written by hand and so he
chose something which looked
written by hand this is why he chooses
he chose that fund it's like with cars
the first cars looked like carriages
with other horse and so it's the same
here now we were able to publish things
a lot and even if paper or parchment was
very expensive you see that aesthetics
played very big role there they had a
lot of space on the right side and they
didn't use the space because they
thought the golden how we say schnitt
the golden ratio is very important so
everything had value it was very fine
they used it for several hundred years
and there was no reason to change it to
choose a different font doesn't matter
really it's a good idea to have a front
which has specific characteristics so
that they can be read very well they can
be remembered very very so you can
choose the proper front for your
purposes for a newspaper for example
it's not very good to use these hemp
writing things because you can read it
so fast as you can read for example the
times font and people had thought a lot
of about this how to define characters
it so that they allow your eye to flow
above the text and to comprehend what's
written there The Times is very
important for us because x is The Times
New Roman font is a font which is very
popular for example the German telecom
or epic for example use the times font
and you recognize it so if you see
something written in x and it remembers
you of epi or then you know it's times
the ability to print led to the wish
that we can print also for single copies
and the single copies sorry they wanted
something which typed correctly so you
don't have a handwritten thing you have
a printed thing but you want only one
copy and this led to the invention of
the typewriter the typewriter head
problem because if you write as we write
then an eye for example will need less
space than an M and this is not very
practical so the inventor of the
typewriter said ok let's use letters
which have mah no space have a fixed
width so we have a monospaced font and
the Mon of spaced font come a few
problems but we'll see that so this is
an example for a fond you see we have
the whole alphabet and everything has
the same spacing so the m m is very
narrow because it has to fit in the same
space and the eye has additional linings
which are not necessary but are
necessary otherwise the space would be
too big but we will see that also for
example you have here for different
fonts you have a fond with the reefs
these are the small things at the
letters you have a font without those
series then it's called Santa reef and
you see that the eye and the M have a
totally different spaces and if you have
a monospaced font then everything looks
the same but it doesn't look as good for
example the spaces between the g and the
are in one of the Mona spaces monospaced
fonts are very it's divided
and if you take a look at books or
something then they try to give you
let's say some sort of grey appearance
you don't have black spots and white
spots you want to have something which
is yeah very convenient to look at the
reason why you are using who a few uses
proportional fund in Eclipse so a font
who of you uses of no party it didn't
have to ask who's using a monospaced
font yes and who of you have the column
limit set to 80 in eclipse a hundred and
thirty-two okay something about that the
reason for that you might have chosen 80
for example comes from the IBM punch
card the IBM punch card had 80
characters and the age I don't know why
they've chosen it because there were
other punch cards which had 60
characters but they have Eddie
characters and if you take a look at
programs from the 50s you see that they
are all built for those 80 characters so
for example and Fortran program you are
in a COBOL program you can you ignore I
think the first eight characters and
then your program line starts but they
don't didn't hit the problems we have
now this structured programming tap you
lied to us that we have blocks which we
intend and they didn't know about that
so 80 characters seem to be very fine by
the way to store information in this
format was a very advanced method and it
didn't take so much space other document
formats used for example here you see a
4 gigabyte flash drive you have 20 rows
of pellets in this room each row of 15
pallets white pellets stacked at least
two high each pellet contains 45 boxes
each box contained about 2,000 cards
every card had about 80 characters so
you see you could store really a lot of
stuff ok the next limitation comes from
the terminals and you see the most
famous terminal started with 72
characters but all the programs were
written in 80 characters so they had to
change that and you see in 1975 you had
a terminal which also supported 80
characters and those terminals you still
find in your windows or in any operating
system this seems to be in the standard
of information display and this can't be
right okay so why are you using a
non-proportional font yes you can draw
pictures this is a very important method
because the only way we can draw
information we can describe what we are
programming is doing ascii art which is
horrible i can't understand it but
that's the way we do it maybe you do it
you can also draw pictures with a
proportional fun but then you have other
problems you have to use the tip the top
is usually for spaces oh no maybe eight
spaces some said in or three spaces so
you have a lot of problems and if you
change the resolution of something it
everything changes so it's not a very
good idea so let's keep the monospaced
font but you see there are a lot of
problems the one the digit 1 looks
almost exactly like the small letter A
and this leads to a lot of problems if
you don't have color for example then
some people write things like this this
is okay but it's not looking very good
what's the problem here the problem is
that we don't put a space before a comma
never and we don't do it since 400 years
maybe eight hundred or thousand years so
why do this now and another problem you
should do it right and to do the things
right is if you have any punctuation
they
is almost never a space before that this
is a typical Java program the semicolons
are missing but you can see here that
the the fund makes things not so good as
they could be for example the minus
greater combination should be an arrow
but this doesn't look like an arrow
because the minus is too low so we have
to change the font you have to find the
font which supports this special line so
that the minus is on the same height
like the the lion in the plus sign and
if you instead of using create if you
use you copy or who you knew then you
see this looks a lot better but there
are still a lot of problems using a
monospaced font you see that the space
next to the parenthesis is too large yes
this is not good and there are a lot of
other problems and for example you
cannot have spaces as you need them to
make things good look to make things
look good yeah for example you see what
is available in the Unicode character
set you have different spaces so you can
align things properly and you need for
example if you set numbers and you put
after every three digits you want to
have a small space then you use a small
space you really use a small spaces thin
space or a hair space it's visible for
you but it's not so big as a normal
space because the normal space is huge
if you choose a proper font it would
more look like this but you see that the
minus becomes too small the reason for
that is that the minus is actually a
hyphen or a combination of hyphen and a
minus this would be look this looks much
better
but what's now the problem that's not a
minus that is a minus but it has a
different unicode then the hyphen minus
for example if you have monospaced font
these four characters look almost the
same you see little differences but the
differences are not big enough to be
appreciated and if you use a proper font
it looked like this you see the hyphen
is very small the minus is longer and
it's slightly bigger the end ish is a
little bit smaller and not as thick as
the minus and the em dash of course is
longer in a monospaced font you have
those you can't have this
differentiation so this is a problem and
if you had a real programming language
then you would do it like this way so an
arrow would be an arrow and a mapping
arrow will be a mapping arrow and so on
this is an example with the coloring use
by eclipse and yeah this is what we
write in Java but what we would if you
change the font it would look like this
and as you can see the minus sign is too
small but if we could do it right it
would look much better and it wouldn't
only look much better it would be more
understandable for beginners because the
not equal sign for example is something
they have learned in school they know
what this is what an exclamation mark an
equal sign means we don't know we have
to learn this and we wouldn't have to
learn it if we could use a proper font
and this is the way how we would like to
do it next year there will be a
programming programming language which
supports typography and you can write
things like this and it will be
calculated correctly and you can use the
sum and you can you will have whatever
you like and especially in documents in
the documentation you can have pictures
and whatever you need now I have to
close so
thanks for your attention use
proportional funds also with no series
because the the display resolution is
high enough to make it right today and
because we're here antwerp you can go to
the museum I don't know how to
pronunciate it it's a very good museum
and you can see everything about
printing and aesthetics and funds
whatever you like but thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
