15 minutes let's get right into it
welcome to this very first spring
session on this at this main conference
here at devoxx this is actually a well
it might serve as a bit of a teaser at
this point it was meant to be a sort of
bonus after my themes and trends session
so we kind of inverted the order here so
let me start with pointing out that that
there are several full our spring
sessions at this conference this
afternoon we have why spring laughs
Kaplan highly recommended at 2:00 p.m.
this afternoon by my colleague Sebastian
we have the spring buff this evening
8:00 p.m. we have my spring format five
themes in transition tomorrow 3:00 p.m.
ish and we have for example D reactive
spring session at the spring boot to the
DOE web application sessions right
before in that trek tomorrow so plenty
of spring content coming you away what
are we going to talk about today
something slightly out of the ordinary I
called this hidden gems because it's
stuff that I slash we usually do not
talk about not that often not that
explicitly it's of course about Spring
Framework 5 so just summarizing what we
always have to summarize or it recently
released its already GA JDK 8 baselines
Java EE 7 plus baseline and embracing
JDK 9 and Java EE eight already
basically right after after their
release this is this is what's always
being said right this is spring thermic
5 we always do major releases when we
raise the baseline so this major version
number really means something to us and
there's a lot of goodness following from
this that we'll be talking about some of
the design considerations the decisions
we've been making and the sort of stuff
that we enable going forward I'm going
to talk about what all of those things
tomorrow about JDK 9 about the HTTP 2
topic about functional API design and
of course about reactive architectures
actually reacted our reactive story is
much more comprehensively covered in the
two preceding sessions spring boot to
the web applications and the reactive
session anyway those are the topics
basically the main topics in all spring
five presentations and I'm going to go
through them tomorrow so what about
today we have quite a few things in
Spring Framework five today that don't
immediately materialize or don't
immediately show up at the surface level
for example we revised our locking
approach but not as radically as some
people wanted us to there's the good old
problem of comments logging formally
formally Jakarta comments logging now
basically a regular patchy comments
thing still for better or for worse lots
of the spring ecosystem are coded
against the comments logging ap is not
just internally but also in class
hierarchies in extension points where
logger variables are being exposed to
potentially user declared or third-party
declared sub classes so we are in a
binary compatibility situation where we
can't easily change the locking API type
that we're exposing in several places
and for the for the better for better
migration story in the ecosystem it's
also a very nice thing to do to keep
existing logging code in action so what
did we end up doing we implemented our
own comments logging bridge so if you
start using spring thermic five over or
spring boot to the dough which is built
on it you'll actually get a different
default logging bridge it's not the
standard apache comments logging
implementation but it's not JCL over SSL
foj either it's a logging bridge of our
own called spring JCL the only required
dependency that spring hoe comes with
these days and it comes with a few
really nice benefits it does what
everybody wants us to do in terms of the
overall context provide first-class
support for log4j to of course still for
SLA for jane lock back and for Chavez
you till logging everything else is
end-of-life at this point
so we implemented that directly in our
bridge there's no need for custom
excluding your pumps no need to exclude
comments logging from the spring code
dependencies just bring in JC a little
vessel foj basically remove all of this
no extra bridges no custom excludes the
standard bridge the default bridge that
we're shipping in Spring Framework five
should actually work for almost every
regular use case if for some reason you
still want to use JCL over SL foj as
your bridge of choice exclude spring JCL
and include JCL over sender for j as you
always did it so we're not taking
anything away either
as you might notice there's lava j2 is
actually the most important driver here
because the complications between lock
back and lock fatigue who said that
we're really too much to impose on
anybody right so it's a much much more
streamlined arrangement and keeps the
entire spring framework based ecosystem
in place exposing the same good old org
Apache Commons log Commons logging log
references to them as we always did all
right
different kind of problem but also a
little bit infrastructural component
scanning this is this needs to be taken
with a grain of salt but classpath
scanning any kind of class but scanning
can be slow depending on your deployment
environment it's particularly slow long
in some managed environments like in
Google App Engine it can be very slow
with a security manager anything that
interferes with i/o because what class
of scanning really does is it asks the
class loader to find certain packages
the famous base packages in spring and
it searches the class path from their
downloads
it relies basically on class loader
resource resolution and depending on the
speed of this and the depending on
security checks in between this may
become an issue our usual recommendation
narrow your base packages right now that
the whole point of the base packages
mechanism in spring is be as specific as
you can in terms of where do you want
your components to be found
where should we look for them and where
can we just skip
entire search because there are no
components to be found there anyway
right so you can search from the root
package download so not specify base
package basically it's not recommended
it actually works for small deployment
units it works for certain scenarios but
generally speaking that's not
recommended people still do it
nevertheless do it so we recognize that
there is an alternative improvement that
we can provide and that's what we're
doing in 5-2 though now we're providing
a components indexing mechanism
basically a Build time step generating a
spring dot components file which does
the search at Build time lists all the
component file resource names so we
don't have to traverse anything and on
startup we detect that in the charge
that we're searching your is that sort
of spring components file and we
automatically translate your components
can instruction on to that index if the
conditions match so you if you didn't
specify custom includes or Xcode filters
or the like so instead of searching the
class path through the inclusion of a
pre-built index file you can help the
framework to skip certain steps of its
startup procedure of its search
procedure in particular for wide-ranging
searches so in particular if you do not
want to narrow your base package if you
do want us to search most of your class
path this is highly recommendable an
alternative mechanism the components
index lives in the sprinkle context
index and module and it's basically an
annotation processor for for your
compilation step different kind of
problem closer to the source code
experience now the ability in in
traditional java code of course we are
used to two nulls right now is passing
in trying to pass nulls in some we're
getting mouths out of it
the getting notes out of it out of an
API return from an API is a particularly
hard hard one right so we we had we had
the topic loosely on our radar for quite
a while but we have a strong driver now
and the drivers actually coupling since
there was a coupling session in this
room right before the drive is actually
copying because in the coupling language
malleability the
the assignment to a non-null declared
variable is actually and a pretty
important fundamental mechanism in the
language if from a coupling perspective
you interact with the Java API it is
enormously helpful if the Java API has
explicitly declared malleability if the
Java API explicitly says this can be now
this cannot be null the Coptic cutting
compiler makes assumptions about what
you can do with the outcome of a java
method called in a piece of cotton code
so what we're doing here is we are we've
introduced another bill annotations all
across the code base the entire spring
from a code base works with a null
ability approach where most packages are
non null by default they include a non
null API and run all fields marker so if
not explicitly annotated you shouldn't
pass in now and you will never get mad
out of it if we deviate from this and of
course there are plenty of places where
you can get null because of the API
design the existing API design in spring
we add at nullable like it overwrites
basically a an annotation giving you
some help about about the the outcome so
even from a readability perspect if you
looking at spring source code this can
be quite helpful it's a formal
declaration of malleability not just
hidden in the Javadoc somewhere we use
this extensively ourselves in for
example in IntelliJ IDEA it has the
constant conditions and exceptions
inspection that you can trigger which
basically validates your null ability
declarations if you have them against
the code right can the code flow ever
result in null or are you trying to
check something whether it's now but it
can never be null anywhere right so it's
trying to Optima to improve your code
catch potential null pointer exceptions
but also removing unnecessary checks
right so we are making heavy use of this
ourselves and of course by shipping this
in our framework code base you may also
use this in application projects if you
code against spring api's they come with
explicitly declared null ability this
can be helpful even for Java development
it is enormously helpful for coupling
development
so among the major once a fourth one
coming your way and I've got the three
bonus ones for you
data class binding it's also coupling
inspired actually but again it's not
cotton specific the place is where we do
data binding in spring for example
spring mu C parameter binding handler
method declaring in arguments and spring
by default trying to bind incoming
parameters or properties against a
target class this is actually smarter
now it has a code path where it detects
that this is not a set of getter style
target object our definition of a data
class is basically what matters to us or
actually to the binding facility in the
in the spring framework if there is no
default constructor just a different
list style constructor with several
arguments and you are declaring this as
a binding target to us for example in
the spring MVC handler method then we
assume that you want us to go into
constructor binding mode we basically
date a class binding mode because code
negate the classes or also long Bach
data classes as sketch down there are
all designed like this a single primary
constructor listing all basically the
properties taking them at the
constructor level and then being read
only from there and the parameter names
of the constructor declaration really
measuring parameter names do matter in
coupling they can matter in Java if you
compile with their parameters or dash
debug which I strongly recommend for
many reasons
you can also overwrite them with an
explicit declaration with each other
beans at constructor property sanitation
all of this just allows us to perform
data binding for you through a
constructor having an immutable data
class instance afterwards instead of
having to design set a getter style
mutable being instances so it's a quite
interesting facility can work in Java
makes a lot of sense with kopplin in
particular with the data class concept
in coupling and it's also commonly used
with Lombok quite a lot of spring users
or at least a significant number has a
certain love for Lombok so
we make some explicit steps and I guess
you can infer the design perspective
here and we're designing a feature so
that it makes sense in several contexts
does make sense in Java might even might
make even more sense in other languages
and other variants alright quick random
few things we've been doing we've been
revising the object provider mechanism
if you know the way of this let's say
look up API you can do add auto white
object provider of a beam of yours with
smarter interaction against which
variant of that object you want right
with there might be several such pins
you're trying to identify a certain one
look at the new signatures
that's the Java 8 Java util function
mechanism in action with Java util
function supplier and and consumer being
in use here so this is oops I'm sorry
this is this is our new Java 8 baseline
in action right we can finally expose
overloaded variants even as default
methods to you using the new Java util
function interfaces as arguments like
get if available if not available call
this supplier to give me a default
instance this is a a a part of our
functional story that I'll go into more
detail about tomorrow functional as in
Java 8 stream Java util function style
functional API design alright
and in given given the remaining few
minutes here's the few additions to the
resource API so in case you're using the
resource abstraction in spring heavily
that might be a good reason to have to
upgrade to Spring Framework 5 on its own
right
very close niño to integration there by
all means and i/o to available since
Java 7 and onwards is a key piece of the
infrastructure that we have in the JDK
these days we're trying to maximize our
use both at the API level there is a
readable general writable Channel
additions to the resource abstraction
but also internally we are
can internally improve your interaction
with some of our for example file
copying mechanisms that sort of stuff
and last but not least we also took Java
time in Java 8 as an inspiration there
are several new signatures for example
the schedule methods in spring filmic 5
exposing overloaded variants instead of
Long's and dates now taking instance not
instant and duration is arguments to
Java the time value objects so we're
trying to be as friendly as we can to
Java 8 based code well your code might
already use Java the time where your
code might integrate with completable
future and providing the best possible
direct adaptation with no seams between
our code in a dejar a Java based code
and the spring framework based
interaction so we really mean the
fine-tuning of those API is in several
places in in spring filmic 5 those are
just examples there's plenty of fine
tuning all over the code base so in
Spring Framework 5 we actually have a
ton of refinements if you look for at
since 5 the dough in our Java doc or in
our code base you'll find several
hundred new overloaded variants new
little classes that make a lot of sense
in certain contexts so by all means this
is just a few examples in those 15
minutes or 16 in the meantime maybe so
thanks for for listening if you are
considering upgrade to Spring Framework
5 to tho explore our Java doc very
exhaustively there's lots of little gems
to be found in there if you'd like to
hear more about the general spring for
Mach 5 design about reactive in
particular about the functional story
copying interaction there are the other
sessions that I mentioned at the
beginning
enjoy enjoy the overall conference and
maybe join us for the spring buff
tonight thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
