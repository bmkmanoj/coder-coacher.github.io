you for being here and listening to me
rant about the hardware stuff I'm not a
Java developer so confession but um I'm
more on the iOS side of things but I do
like hardware prototyping it's been
something that I've been playing with as
a hobby and more recently as part of my
work for the last five years and I'm
gonna talk about a little bit about my
story how I got into it I don't have any
previous electronics experience any
hardware experience so I'm coming I came
to it from a very software perspective
and I hope that will inspire you and
seem interesting so by day I work at a
company called hippo you're a product
consultancy company we work with
startups to build software products so
we're very much software oriented
solving solution you know finding
solutions to product problems with
software that's mainly what we do and by
night I usually have no idea what I'm
doing dealing with hardware stuff so as
I said I'm not an expert at electronics
I don't have any formal education so
take whatever I say with a grain of salt
but I did do some interesting projects
so I hope that will show you that you
can find your way through trial and
error in this crazy world of hardware
and that's kind of the point that you
know other people can also get into if I
can do it you can definitely do it
so I really like this photo because it's
it perfectly illustrates my impression
of the hardware world before I got into
it right I mean it's it's scary
inaccessible and weird and it's a
complete nightmare for an OCD software
developer like myself I think this was
definitely true maybe 10 maybe 15 years
ago even and it was very inaccessible
but um you know in 2005 this little guy
got introduced to the market in Italy it
was a research project
and you know Arduino basically transform
the the the heart very hobbyist market
for the better and the the idea it was
to provide a a prototyping tool for
artists for hobbyists to be able to get
into electronics to be able to teach
electronics and it's it's it's it's
completely transformed the market so um
so thanks to this it's now much easier
to do stuff in the in the hardware world
so today Arduino is not the only option
there are lots of different platforms
available and lots of different options
and also that brings a level of
confusion I think because you know
people talk about certain platforms as
if they were equal which they're not and
people talk about hardware prototyping
as if you could do it on any platform so
I'm gonna start with that and give you
an high-level overview of what's out
there probably one of the most well
known options today is Raspberry Pi and
and it's definitely an amazing platform
and and you can do a lot with it and
it's it seems like a great entry point
for most people to to get into hardware
because it's basically a complete Linux
PC with hardware i/o ports and that's
great and it's very powerful but it's
definitely not a prototyping platform
because this is already a miniaturized
PC so you can't really miniaturize it
further so you can't really being you
know if you develop something on this
and you know it's working well you're
not really gonna be able to take that to
an hardware engineer and say well you
know let's manufacture this it's gonna
be impossible so they're gonna have to
redo that whole prototyping work again
so it's not really something you can
iterate on and also you know running
Linux and then being able to you know
talk with hardware I of course is great
like being able to write the Python
script for instance and just talk to you
know different devices and sensors
that's awesome but um but it's really
not hardware is done because there are
issues for instance garbage collection
there are issues with a lot of other
things that you wouldn't have on a real
IOT platform like Arduino so just beware
you know it's
it's totally okay to use Raspberry Pi to
do hardware projects but it's not really
how I would recommend someone get into
it if you really want to do hardware
stuff
another one is Beagle bone very similar
even much more powerful miniaturized PC
and it's great as a small computer but
it's not really something that you can
use for something like you know what
Arduino can do and it's also very
limited in terms of additional modules
that you can use a better comparison
point is something like the tehsil it's
great for an introductory you know foray
into art where it's a module right
JavaScript hardware platform so it runs
JavaScript you can write JavaScript
firmware on it that's pretty awesome you
know it makes it easy for a lot of
people to get into it but um the it's
it's very it's turned into a very
simplified product so you know you can't
just buy some modules on Adafruit or
sparkfun and just integrate them into
tehsil it's really hard and in some
cases even impossible because they have
their own modules that they sell so
you're very limited by your options and
what you can do with it so that brings
us to our Dino I mean so why is it so
powerful well first of all it's it's an
open source and very simple device so
it's really built on this microprocessor
and it's really an exploded so instead
of miniaturized it's an exploded version
of a very simple hardware board
electronics port so at the heart of the
Arduino there's this AVR chip
it's an atmel atmega models different
models have different chips and and it's
all open source hardware so you could
actually buy this ship separately and
build your own art you know if you
wanted to and you know all the
schematics are up on the Arduino website
and it's actually pretty easy to do I
don't want myself and it's not that hard
to do they really explains very very
carefully but um but you don't have to
do that you could just buy it very
cheaply but with the understanding that
this is like an exploded expanded
version of really small device so it
just gives you the option to easily plug
in things and then start prototyping
that's the whole idea in terms of
firmware it runs C or C++ so they don't
have the greatest IDE but there are lots
of options out there for using eclipse
for using you know other like sublime
text even simpler editors to be able to
run further on it or write Furman for it
the compiler is fairly simple so from a
software developers perspective it's a
very limited platform but the nice thing
is and this is something that I that
will be recurring in my talk is I don't
think we should be thinking about the
software that we can run on this thing I
think we should be thinking what we can
do with it and then how we can work on
platforms that we already know about and
how we integrated those there are a few
different models of TR do you know this
is the mega it's very similar to do know
that I showed it's it has more i/o pins
a bit more memory more processing power
so it's better for some more complex
projects but um but overall is very
similar where as a new addition to the
Arduino models UHN is actually a
compared to something like raspberry for
instance because it actually has a
miniaturized computer inside so there's
there's a separate Intel processor
inside that runs the the Union unit so
it comes with integrated Wi-Fi and all
these things all these you know bells
and whistles but again you know you
can't really use this for prototyping so
just something to be aware of there are
all these different arduino models but
really if you if you're looking to do
actual iot work or something similar
then you gotta go with the mega orduno
at the moment at least and there are
other options available like there's
like free do enough for instance on
arduino clone there is you know tiny do
you know the like really miniaturized
version of the arduino so there are all
these different options that you can
always look at so how do you get into it
when you search for intro to Arduino
tutorial or whatever on Google this is
usually what comes up right classic
intro project it's an LED blink project
you know just blink the LED it's super
boring it's completely pointless and and
I really don't know why people do this
but um so from if you if you come from a
hardware background and you don't know
much about software this actually makes
sense because you know you already know
your resistors you know how an LED works
you know how the Arduino works so you
just attach them and now you kind of go
and the software side of this is really
simple so you just within the loop you
just called the LED so if you're in a
getting into the software part of things
into writing firmware for instance it's
a good starting point but for us is
ridiculous because we know we handle the
software parts in five seconds and then
you deal with how to you know attach
this thing how to you know you try to
understand how groundworks and what kind
of voltage you should choose and what
can register you should add and every
step of the way they warn you you know
you could fry your board and if you do
something wrong it's gonna burn and like
cause a fire or something so it's really
scary
from you know software perspective
software developers perspective so I
suggest you don't do this I don't think
it's a good idea I don't think it's a
good starting point for for software
people I suggest starting its answers
they're great they're cheap they're
abundant you can buy you know
temperature sensors humidity sensors you
know carbon dioxide sensors like all
kinds of sensors are out there available
on various sites and they're really
plug-and-play they come with their own
little software libraries that are super
simple that you can you know read the
source code for but um in terms of
attaching the hardware it's super simple
you just attach it you don't have to
think about resistors or anything
and now the nice thing is these are
really complex from a software
perspective because now you have to
write the firmware that talks to this
thing even though there's a library you
still have to think about how to get
that amount of data from the sensor you
know how often do you Paul what do you
do with that data how to display it you
know these are the more interesting
questions from from a software
perspective so I really recommend you
start with something like a humidity
sensor or a temperature sensor for
instance
you know they're tiny this is one from
Adafruit I believe and you know you
attach that to a breadboard this is what
you use for not having to you know
solder every every connection every pin
that you have to use and you know I know
that soldering is something that people
are really scared about as well but it's
really simple and you can get away with
not doing it for probably months or
years like I didn't learn how to solder
until I was two years into hardware
stuff so you really don't have to know
it at the beginning and and even when
you do learn it's actually really simple
to do so it's not a huge deal and you
need lots of these you will use a lot of
pins and cables during prototyping so
you know an example project you hook up
a temperature sensor to an Arduino and
then you have this LCD module that you
buy and it's easy to hook up it has a
lot of connections but it's not this
super simple and and then all the rest
the software so once you're done with
the hardware prototype you just jump
into the compiler and start writing
something and you know even if it's
simple there's something as simple as
this you can do a lot like you could for
instance think about how the you know on
such a limited display how do you
display the data you have to think about
the UX you have to think about you know
do I add like a motion sensor to this as
well so when I come by the the LCD comes
alive and I can see and then after a
while I turn it off so you can really
iterate on this and it's a great way to
challenge yourself it's a great way to
think about these limited hardware
systems and to understand their
complexities and limitations so this is
for instance one of my first projects
that I did it's a again basic humidity
sensor or something like that I paired
it with the with an iPhone app so easy
to build hardware and then I had to deal
with the complexity on the iPhone side
where I knew what I was doing so you
know I paired it though I paired this
with a bluetooth LE module which I will
talk about later and this was a sample
app that's you know once connected it
could display live data on the screen it
could graph it and of course this is a
very you know
simple and horrible interface but you
know then I could iterate on this and
make something much more interesting and
and the nice thing is you get abundance
of data with sensors so that's what we
love right you have all that data now
what you do with it is totally up to you
a better example was something that we
built at the outfit is basically our
office or home monitor with multiple
sensors on it it worked on Wi-Fi it was
very challenging from a network
programming perspective because you have
to deal with stuff like what happens
when the you know there's a problem with
the connection what happens how do we
send this the data to the server side
and how do we graph it how do you
visualize it so suddenly you have you
know from a very simple device you have
all these software problems that arise
and those are the real challenges so
I'll keep talking about my projects for
a little bit before jumping into other
stuff so at my company at hip or we have
these hack days every month one you know
one day usually Hardware hacks everybody
drops what they're doing and approach
you know something a hobby project from
a software perspective and try to solve
a problem you have to present the
project at the end of the day so it can
only take one day so you have to you
know know your scope know what you can
accomplish and and some interesting
stuff came out of that so I'll talk
about that I'll bet so we love giving
IKEA like names to our internal projects
this is this is door
it's basically an app driven door buzzer
so we have this buzzer for the entrance
to our office and the problem was we
would all go out to lunch like twelve
guys two girls and and we wouldn't be
able to get back into the office because
everybody would have left their keys
that actually happened so so we thought
okay we can solve this with software and
hardware we can find a solution to this
so we start with the simple Arduino
device they are do you know no we got
one
and we attached a relay to it now a
relay is a very simple module that
allows you to control 240 or 110 volt
circuit with a 5 volt signal so it's
basically an electronic driven you know
light switch you can think of it like
that
so once we attach this to the buzzer you
have electronic control of the buzzer
what you did with the actual switch
before you could do through the Arduino
to that we attached a ble module a
Bluetooth le module now blue Sudeley is
a kind of next generation of Bluetooth
it's been around for a few years now and
it's pretty much available in every
mobile device in most max I think iPhone
4s and you were have the module in it so
so it's not really bluetooth because you
don't need to pair the devices so you
can just once you see the device you can
connect to it and send signals to it so
if you know how to talk to the device
it's almost instant communication and
it's very low range but it's very fast
very low latency so once we have the ble
device now the artena became a wireless
receiver of messages and then you know
we could implement a simple Android and
iOS app and just send a message to the
ble the ble sends it over to the Arduino
firmware which just takes it and says ok
I'm gonna open the door and you know it
decides to activate the activate they
rely based on the request so this was
the basic basic prototype this was ready
at the end of the day this is you know
less than a day project that you can do
with Arduino but you know we've been
using it every day since then it's super
useful and really nice to have and it's
a really fun project to work on we
decide to iterate on the cell bit so we
thought ok wouldn't it be nice if we
show the app icon on the lockscreen when
you come to the office so you don't have
to you know search for the app to open
the door so we used an ibeacon there are
lots of ibeacons available now you know
it's just the Apple provides this thing
on iOS where you can actually pop the
app icon up on the lock screen and it
registers the ibeacon signal so we added
that that made a little bit easier and
then of course we had to do an Apple
watch up so we did that why not and
funny enough the Apple watch up is the
one that everyone uses now because it's
it doesn't even need the iPhone it can
because Apple watch has ble as well it
can talk directly to the Arduino device
so you have direct communication even if
you don't have your iPhone you could use
it I'll actually show you a video of
this because I'm it's interesting
so it makes more sense than your outside
but we had to shoot it inside I know you
caught that but yeah so and then someone
added that Mario team because they
couldn't resist it and now every time we
entered the office we have to listen to
that for the school so that's one and I
mean you can see it's very iterative of
course not all of this happened in a day
but overall this was like two or
two-and-a-half day project that you know
everybody collaborated on and it was
really interesting to see it come
together just you know it's a mishmash
of different technologies and different
things available and but at the core of
it is the Arduino and I think that's
what really makes it so easy to Twitter
it on because you don't have to think
about you know a lot of other complex
things these platforms are ready to go
for you just kind of plug and play and
then you know deal with the complexity
on the software side where you you
actually know what you're doing another
one is bulb so this is a light control
system obviously it's but the it's very
similar to the first one to door but um
the challenge with this one was we
wanted it to work remotely and the
problem was you know being able to see
which lights were on at the office
because we have a few different floors
when you're leaving the office it was a
bit of a chore to you know figure out
where - which floor to go to on like
close things so we want to work remotely
so we could you know check if the lights
were on at the office for some reason or
you know turn them on or turn them off
or like schedule lights turning on and
off now of course could be you know by
an existing solution for this of course
we could we know we can but it's an
interesting challenge for software
developers to jump into a problem like
this because you know you can really
over engineer this and some people
suggested that we should or you could
approach it very simply like we did here
so it really depends on you know what
kind of problems you're trying to solve
you know you could have like a internal
server
runs at the office and then a remote one
and then you know the internal server
kind of controls these sub machines that
are you know more simpler simple IOT
devices or you could have you know every
IOT device just connect to the internet
unlike register for service and just
listen for certain messages so that's
that's what we ended up doing just
because we didn't want to blow the scope
too much but um so again we started with
a few Arduino knows one for each floor
and you know again we had a relay
because we need to control multiple
lights so for every lightbulb that you
need to connect you need another relay
and but then we had this in some case
Ethernet in some cases Wi-Fi shield that
we attached to the Arduino so in case
you don't know what the shield is is
basically a module that's the same size
as the Arduino that just connects on top
so it's it takes control of some of the
pins of the Arduino and then it still
allows you to connect more if you need
to so it's like again an exploded
version of a small device in this case
you know we have a Wi-Fi shield that
just connects on top so you you know you
have the Arduino connecting to the to
the Internet to the office Wi-Fi through
this connection and now once you have
the Arduino connected how do you know
which ones are available and how do you
send messages to it obviously you don't
want to expose you know certain high
keys from the office Network and all
that stuff so there's a lot of
complexity that comes into that that
infrastructure so we decided to use a
service called pusher they they are
basically a pops up service that allows
real-time messaging to IOT devices they
say but it could be any device really or
it could be any service the idea is the
Arduino devices in this case register
for notifications from specific channels
at the pusher service and so whenever
they're online they're ready to receive
those messages and then your app or your
service basically sends a signal to
pusher saying you know on this channel
sense the send this message
and all the devices that are listening
to that channel are automatically
notified immediately and you know our do
you know part of that message makes a
decision activates or deactivates the
relay turning on or off the light bulbs
now there's this is much more complex
than the previous one because you don't
have to be in the same same room with
the device you know you can control
remotely and also again Wi-Fi
connectivity especially network
connectivity in general is very fickle I
mean anything could happen you know you
could drop some packets or you could
just drop off the Wi-Fi network again
you have to because our dinner is so
limited in terms of its software
capabilities you have to deal with these
things and and be able to you know
continuously test the service to make
sure that because these things happen
over time so you know some bugs came up
a week later we start using this and
other bugs came up a few months later so
it's import to battle test and it's
important think about you know how to
defensively code firmer and that's runs
wellness on the device so again I have a
little video just to so you see how it
runs on our test bed
hey iris turn on all lights
hey iris turn off all lights
hey iris turn lights on at first floor
hey iris turn lights on at second floor
so we later on added this little voice
recognition module to the iOS app but
you get the idea basically and because
Siri is not available we call it iris of
course you can resist but uh so the idea
is you know you send a message the
iPhone app makes a decision on what you
want to do
turns out message into something that
the pusher will understand stands it
over and then the the Wi-Fi connected
device basically parses it again and
then makes the decision so fairly simple
usage and that's great because it means
that for the user this is a very simple
thing to do but behind the scenes you
can see all the things that are
happening and all the duration that you
stop and so it's really interesting and
it's very challenging from a from a
software perspective that's what I like
about so those are some of the office
projects I have also been dealing with
simple robotics while I don't know if
you can even call it robotics but anyway
like simple robots right and and what I
was interested in was not really the
mechanical part of it because that's
really beyond you know what I can spend
time on but more the complexity again in
stuff like for instance Pat finding and
intelligence and you know how do you
write software for something like this
where the hardware is super simple and
super limited but you know the software
can drive it in a way that is like
somehow intelligent or can you do it so
you know I've been dealing with this
kind of stuff for a few years now and
this is one of the first I think is the
actual the first one that I developed
and you know it just uses this acoustic
sensor that tries to figure out the
distance from the next object in front
of it and it has a little servo
underneath so it can like turn its head
a little bit and and it's driven by an
Arduino again and of course in this case
you have to think about things like
battery and power and I will talk about
those things a little bit down
down in presentation but um you know
there's there's a lot more complexity
involved from that point but really once
you build it and the motors are running
there isn't much to the hardware I mean
it's you know it's maybe a weekend
project but after that now you have the
ability to you know burn different kinds
of firmware on this and see how to react
so you know you let this go you know on
the room and just like walks around and
you see how to react to certain things
then you just manipulate the the
software and see test again and iterate
and see how it reacts you know to the
things in front of it how how does it
find its way does it just completely go
berserk and like try turning around in
circles or does it actually able to find
its way around the room and and I really
like this idea because this doesn't
depend on anything else so it's very
self-contained
so this was my first foray and and the
problem that you run into it sounds like
this is for instance the noise in the
data so you get data but you don't know
if you can really rely on it so how do
you normalize that again a software
problem you know how do you visualize
that again a software problem so those
are the great things about this another
robot that we built at the office it's
this this is actually much simpler from
from a control perspective because it's
a remote control bluetooth LE robot so
you just control it from the from the
iPhone app but what was interesting
about this was I decided to use the
accelerometer in the iPhone to make the
robot look around so that was really
interesting to see because it showed the
capabilities of the of the ble protocol
it was super fast so you could really
Drive this thing remotely and just like
look around and and we had this video
stream running from this little iPod
touch attached to it so you could
actually see what the robot saw so it
was really interesting to play with I'll
I have a video of that too because it's
just fun to see
so you get the idea again you know a
very simple project but you know using
it was really interesting because
because the the effect was so instant
you could really feel like you run
control of this thing and you didn't
have to be in the same room it could you
know you could have it go to the next
room and like walk around the office and
so it was an interesting challenge from
that perspective and the last month the
last robot project I'll talk about is
one that's actually in progress so
there's this technology called lidar and
there was a Kickstarter project for a
lidar modular cheap lidar module
recently last year and so you know I got
one of those and it's really interesting
because light arts are basically you
know they're they're laser driven you
know distance measurement units and the
really expensive big ones are used in
you know for like 3d mapping whole
terrains or 3d mapping buildings you
know the Google car uses one on top of
it so the you know three four thousand
dollar ones are super capable but this
little one it's then it's literally like
this big and it's you know it costs $60
is really interesting because you could
still get some data out of that and it
was quite capable so I built this little
robot that was super simple and I just
wanted to act like literally like a dumb
client to a Mac application so that the
mac app would run the robot just gather
data from the lidar unit and say okay
now go here well it can't even go say go
here because there's obviously no Google
Maps for this thing so it needs to say
go you know forward this many
circulations on the motor and then you
know go turn right and go this much and
by doing that try to map an environment
and see if we can visualize the incoming
data now again this was really
interesting because I could ride the mac
app that did this and I didn't have to
really do much with the hardware after
that so you know I just recompile the
mac app and see how it reacts and Rico
in rate so it was really interesting
from that perspective the latest version
kind of looks like this so it's similar
to this but um again there's a lot of
noise a lot of stuff you have to deal
with and you know how do you turn this
into an actionable map where the idea is
you can click on and then use path
winding intelligence to to go there but
again you can see you know going through
these different marks of robots you can
see how you can iterate and like go
forward then find the next challenge and
do some really interesting stuff so
those are more or less all the projects
I'll talk about but um I think it's
really inspiring to you know talk about
other people's projects because it kind
of gives me other ideas so I hope that's
that's interesting but the another way
for me to get inspired is to just talk
about the modules and the sensors that
are available out there and it's also
really because there's so much choice
and it's kind of you know endless world
of different electronic devices with
obscure names it can be really hard if
you're just getting into this world so
so I'll talk about those a little bit
and as you've seen from these examples
probably the most interesting thing is
is the communication part because
without that the Arduino is just like
this isolated thing on its own and you
can't really do much with it because of
the limitations on the firmware and the
the actual hardware memory and
processing power so so let's talk about
communication options this is the one
that we used in that bulb project is
it's called this a de fruits CC 3000
hi-fi's shields so it just connects you
to the Wi-Fi super easy to set up
because it's a shield you just connect
it you're done and don't be surprised by
the size it's actually the actual size
is this so this is what they call the
breakout module so it's the exact same
module but it's in breakout format so
you know you can either buy this which
is the miniaturized version
or you could buy this one so in any case
depends on how you want to use it but
it's not as you know big and complex at
it as it looks now it dis comes with its
own Wi-Fi library which is fairly
capable it's not bad at all and and
there are some competing libraries as
well that you can find open source
available so so it's great if you just
want to you know connect your server you
know either by a TCP stream or you can
even do HTTP requests and you can upload
images you know you can do all these
things fairly easily that's probably the
easiest way to get into some kind of
communication with the arduino another
one that I've been using in a lot of
projects is the bluetooth LE module so
as I mentioned it's a progression of the
Bluetooth but it's not really bluetooth
because you don't need to do pairing so
it's very impressive it's fast and the
the only downside really is the
bandwidth so you can't really for
instance over blue to tell you you can't
really transfer images for instance or
any kind of large amounts of data it's
just too slow for that but for sending
small signals or small amounts of data
it's very impressive and bolt on iOS and
Android there are very robust libraries
for integrating with Bluetooth le
modules so so it's great xB is an
interesting communications platform it's
probably the oldest so this has been
used by people who are you know building
drones or any kind of remote control
device for years now they're basically
paired modules so you just pair two x PS
and they literally just replace the USB
cable that you attach to your Arduino so
you could you know build everything with
the USB cable take it out put into XPS
you're done you don't need to do any
software it doesn't need a library it
just communicates over the the serial
communication port from the for the
Arduino so so it's a great tool and
there's a huge variety of XP modules so
there are really cheap ones that are
fairly low bound
and low range and they're really you
know industry scale fast high bandwidth
and you know very high range versions
Sparkfun has a great wiki page on the
different XP modules comparing them so
if you're interested in getting these
it's a good idea to check that out a few
new ones so there are some newcomers to
this area which is um I think there's
gonna be a lot more advancements in this
area in the next few years so this is um
Nordic semiconductors now the name is
and rf2 for l01 so this it doesn't
really have a name but um it's basically
you know Nordic does these really
impressive communication modules this is
a 2.4 gigahertz thing that can actually
has a bandwidth of 2 megabits and and
100 meters of range so it's this cheap
module that you can buy it's a bit hard
to integrate but it gives you both
bandwidth and range and and its really
impressive and you know you can
integrate this with an Arduino and have
a robot that you know runs very quite
quite far away from the actual device
another one that recently came out and
this if you do some research research we
will definitely run into this is this
this $5.00 Wi-Fi unit
it's called ESP and there are different
numbers like esp8266 ESP
something-something super low power
direct connection to Wi-Fi and super
cheap and and it's really amazing and it
also comes with its own micro controller
so you could actually use this without
an Arduino so you could just buy this
thing attached to a sensor and write
firmware for it that understands what
the sensor does and just deliver that
data over to the cloud server or to
whatever so very impressive like you
could buy a ton of these you know put
them around this room and then like
monitor certain amounts of data really
easily and cheaply so it's very
interesting to see stuff like this
coming out so relays I talked about
moving on from the communication stuff
there are some other interesting modules
that we can talk about
so relays allow you to you know control
right lights switch electrical
appliances really simple to integrate
you know they run on five volts and then
can control anything on a higher voltage
so so they're great for home and office
automation if you want to do any kind of
robotic stuff this is a model shield and
can drive to DC motors independently
now the model shields are really
necessary for you know driving any kind
of motor because um you can't really run
the motors on the on the arduino power
because the motors require quite a high
voltage of power so these shields allow
you to isolate those power sources so
the motors can run on a separate battery
pack and then you know your Arduino can
run on a different one and driving
models is actually surprisingly a
complex thing to do you know you would
think that's something simple like this
which you know I used to play with when
I was a kid I used to like rip out the
motors from my toys and for some reason
play with them but um apparently driving
them in a sensible way it requires you
know a complex architecture and and even
then you will run into power issues and
really for myself at least the problem
that I run into most planned building
robots was the battery issues and like
how how much voltage did you need and
you know how do you use it intelligently
it's a big problem and you know there
aren't there isn't a lot of information
on it out there yet at least there's an
interesting you know the screens and UI
stuff that you can buy this is an OLED
display it's really small it's tiny but
there are bigger versions of this you
know one thing that you could do for
this for instance is actually make a
face for your robot for instance like it
could like move around and show a smiley
face or a sad face it's really cute and
and because it's all that is super low
power usage so it's really interesting
this is the lidar that I talked about
earlier this was a Kickstarter project
but now it's available super affordable
easy to integrate again the problem
becomes
how do user data that comes from this
thing this is a GPS module is fairly
cheap I think this is on on Sparkfun
super small it can connect like 60
something satellites and and you know it
actually has a standalone tracking
capabilities inside so it can log the
locations inside and you can retrieve
them later so again so many options out
there and you know every one of these
modules could be the reason for a new
project for something that that you
could play with or iterate on that you
know I was thinking of for instance I
bought one of these GPS modules and I
always want to build like a standalone
tracking for four runs so whenever
you're doing it run you could have a
separate device that I should record it
you know a high resolution info on the
on the round it could be really
interesting so lots of options out there
now the last thing I want to talk about
about modules is I used to be really
afraid of small components that you
could buy so this is an this is an
EEPROM I believe it's a 128 kilobytes
memory bank right so this is literally
something that you attach on the
breadboard and now you attach the right
things and then you can stream data to
it and then stream data back so it acts
like a Redis cash that's physically
available on the on the breadboard it's
really interesting and you know there
are versions of this that can actually
store the memory inside and on versions
that actually erase the memory like a
ram once the powers out
so this is actually super easy to
integrate I was working on a on a video
camera really a baby camera project for
my for my daughter because I want to
build my own baby cam and it was of
course a folly because it's very complex
to do but I underestimated the amount of
data that the VGA camera the simple VGA
camera would deliver every you know
every second and no Arduino device is
capable of delivering streaming that
kind of data is just a there's no memory
available so you can't really buffer
that information anywhere
so after much research and you know a
lot of pain I came to the realization
that I had to build my own memory bank
because you can't really do this on a
simple device like the Arduino now you
know if you just want to skip to the
conclusion and you know find a solution
you could of course you use like a
Raspberry Pi but that wasn't the point
the point was you know how do you
transfer video information on a simple
IOT device to to a remote server or to
murder to a remote device
hopefully wirelessly so you know I
bought a few of these they're like 30
cents each or something is ridiculous
and and they arrived in this like little
capsule and this little tube and they're
super tiny they're like you know just as
big as my nail or something like that
and they look really scary but then you
read the schematics you need just like a
few pins you attach them next to each
other and then that's it the rest is
just software you just you know find
your memory bank right to it and it's as
simple as you know splitting strings and
just you know writing numb to the right
place and then reading them in the right
order so you know I for me at least the
lesson from that was don't be afraid to
buy you know small components they're
not that hard to deal with and they can
actually really augment the capabilities
because you know if you wanted to take
something like this and actually
manufacture it because you use these
components that they would actually use
in manufacturing you're gonna be able to
say well yeah let's just use this
component and you know design a board
that just works in the same way that I
prototype and you can actually
manufacture that right away
so is this pretty impressive so beyond
short cut beyond modules I have a few
shortcuts that I want to talk about
because especially when dealing with
mechanical stuff like robotics you have
unexpected complexities that that arise
and these are not usually from the
actual electronics but like you know you
would prototype this thing and it would
be a mess on the table
and I you somehow have to enclose it or
put it together in a way that makes
sense because we can't even carry it
around and you know how do you solve
those now you know the very obvious
solution that comes to mind is a 3d
printer but um you know they're slow and
expensive and they're not really there
yet in my in my opinion so it's very
cool but you really don't have to go out
there to buy a 3d printer or even use a
3d printing service because there are
lots of other shortcuts available that
you can use my favorite is for us you
know it's the best place to find dumb
robots so you don't really need to buy
one of the robot building kits that are
like really expensive you know the
simple robot kit is like $200 if you go
to Toys R Us and buy like a toy that
looks the same for ten dollars so you
know you can buy cheap dumb toys and add
intelligence it's a lot of fun actually
another one that's my favorite as a tool
is the Dremel I think they're they're
also available in Europe they're
available everywhere
um they're basically you know you can do
anything with a dremel it's like a drill
with different tips so you can you know
cut into plastics even metal you can
polish things you can you know drill
holes it's super useful if you're doing
any kind of enclosure design or even
just you know putting things into and
like attaching them to a box and you
know I love using like old sturdy you
know modems or stuff like that you can
just take them apart and just use the
enclosures because they're they're
really strong and you know they're
really sturdy and you can you can fit a
lot so they're really useful and of
course glue guns or double-sided tape is
your best friends now I want to talk
about the software side of things a
little bit because integration with
these devices is super easy serial
communication is the easiest thing you
know on Mac for instance there are two
commands it's open and sorry it's just
read and write they're literally just
called read and write you just open a
TCP stream you just open a you don't
socket from the USB board port and you
know then you just
read and write that's it there's no
other you know super you know library or
SDK available so you have to really be
disciplined in terms of your
communication because the it's for
open-ended you can really go crazy you
know building crazy protocols and doing
lots of things but it's it's easy to
fall into that trap so look for software
my a few rules I have is first of all
keep the firmware as dumb as possible
because the firmware is very limited the
device is very limited the language is
very limited and you know the amount of
stuff that you can do on the Arduino is
is going to be limited by its
performance bytes you know battery power
bars memory so treat the hardware like
like a mobile application it's basically
a dumb client that just gathers data or
does something and then just you know
gives it back to you're much more
intelligent server or much more
intelligent iPhone application and do as
much as possible you know over there
so logging can be something of an
afterthought on a device like the
Arduino but um but it's easy to do you
know you could buy a simple memory
module you could buy for instance the
Wi-Fi module that I showed you comes
with an SD card slot so you could
actually use that slot to write to an X
the SD card so it's actually really easy
to you know have like a log file that
just keeps track of what happens so it's
think of it like a web server log and
this comes in really handy when you
battle-tested so you know when you take
this device you know let's say you have
the the simplest you know home monitor
device you just put it out there you
forget it for a month and then you just
monitor it and see what happens you know
and if it stops working you go there and
you check the logs as I mentioned
earlier you know if you have a Wi-Fi
connected device you are going to have
issues where the connection just hangs
and you know these devices these
libraries are not clever enough to say
well my connection is hanging so I'm
gonna timeout it actually doesn't
timeout it just stays there so you have
to deal with those things and you have
to understand that you might have to you
know have the device reset itself in
some case
and it's not that easy to do so you know
you have to really defensively call the
farmer in a way that handles those
situations and the best way to do that
is to just test it in an environment
where it just runs over a long time and
you know design simple but versatile
protocols so you know for instance this
is an approach that I sometimes take
instead of comp like sending certain
messages to the Arduino and saying you
know you should understand this because
the Arduino is you know encoding and
decoding capabilities are pretty much
non-existent you could just say you know
I want you to turn on this pin like this
this Hardware i/o pin on this on this
port so instead of saying it's stuff
that it should parse you can just tell
it stuff that it will just understand
without having to parse it so that's
that's one approach that you could take
so that way you know you don't have to
really burn new firmware into the
Arduino every time you add a new feature
or every time you know you have to
change something or you find a bug
because all the complexities don't know
salt beside the are dinner is just
taking that info and saying okay I just
you know say on or off to to this pin
and it doesn't really care about the
meaning of it so yeah just you know the
wear that of that idea of like low
bandwidth low memory low processing
power so the last thing I want to talk
about is open source because it pretty
much doesn't exist in the hardware world
as I mentioned you know the the world of
hobbyist hardware or hobbyist
electronics is a world of hardware
people mostly still and it's changing
but this also comes with the side effect
that you get a lot of these you know
hardware tutorials on how to connect
things but there is no real you know
good open-source software out there that
we can use so my approach this was you
know let me do all these projects and
I'm just going to put everything up on
github
and and hopefully other people will use
it and you know I was thinking who's
gonna use my stupid robot code because
it's just a hack but you know to my
surprise for instance last year I
received this email and it pretty much
made my year Jared here is a special
education caregiver in the US and he
actually used the code we open sourced
for one of the robots in autism therapy
for kids so they actually built this
robot and and it was teaching kids how
to empathize with other objects and it
was they found that it was a really
effective way so he want to turn it into
a robot that you could he could remote
control because it was easier when there
was no other adults around and but you
know they can find a way to control it
and then he was searching on the web and
he found my repo and he just used it
because it was ready and available and
was ready to use and you know they were
done and then he sent me a thank-you
note and you know I think this is why
it's so important to share your work
even if you think it's not good enough
because other people will find a way to
make it useful and hardware community
really needs software people even if
they're hobbyist even if they don't know
what they're doing to share their work
and to talk about it and robotics are I
think a great tool for teaching you know
just in general not just electronics but
teaching art you know teaching small
kids how to how to get into software so
because you can actually physically see
the results of your work so it's very
interesting in that sense so I still
have no idea what I'm doing
but um it's okay you know you learn by
trial and error and so I'm pretty
confident if I can do it anyone can do
it and I hope this inspires a few of you
to get into it everything that I talked
about today is open source available on
get up on these repos if you want to
reach me I love talking shop about
hardware so email me ping me on Twitter
I would love it and and yeah I hope you
enjoyed it thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
