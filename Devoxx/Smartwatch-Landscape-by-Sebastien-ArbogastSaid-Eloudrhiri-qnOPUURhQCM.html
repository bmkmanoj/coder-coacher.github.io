ones who stay for the last presentation
of the day and resist the temptation of
the beer that's cool for us a lot for me
they are birth yeah okay please don't
leave me so we're here today to talk
about smart watches and give you a
little bit of landscape about yeah a
bird's-eye view of the landscape of the
smart watches I'd say before we start
just a little survey to know a little
bit about more about you guys so who
owns a SmartWatch 10 loans as well 15
people ago let's go sorry o meter that
nor don't own one who is an Android
developer in the room okay about the
same but not the same guys interesting
who is an iOS developer I know it's a
Java conference don't feel dirty guys
okay who is a pebble developer it's
amazing we always lose those ever what a
pebble what who is a Rolex developer
Raleigh key that's why i thought i was
already written the SmartWatch up I
think quite a few nice me too who is a
member of the Nights Watch you're in the
wrong room ah there you know nothing
just knew anyway a few words about us so
I've been a Java developer for about 10
years now iOS developer for five years
actually I wrote the first devoxx
schedule appt back in the day and I also
wrote a couple of pedal apps so just in
case we have some people get peddlers I
was a proud owner of one of the first
tick tock lunatics you know these boxes
where he could actually put an ipod nano
on your arm yeah that one two guys and
i'm currently vp of engineering for take
it easy by the way so it's the fastest
growing startup in belgium and by the
way we are hiring so if you're looking
for a job then come to me at the end
thanks and syed
so my name is site as you can see see it
in the slide all right Oh connect to
this connection I'm a developer since
1992 you you remember the screen where
green and number and I'm mainly an agile
coach and trainer University compost
eaten on the wall divx for kids helper
trainers or provide some labs on
pharaohmon storms and cut Koba who knows
the watch for kids I'm sure everyone
yeah and I have some side projects just
to be you know just to not lose the
technology reality I do some mobile
development such this application that
we are going to show you smart walks and
I have to mention it because I am
obliged to do that I'm a husband and a
proud father of three kids Nora Ryan and
Jenna and Ryan is also a trainer for the
divorce for kids so yeah just a little
disclaimer we are not related to google
app Apple or pebble in any way we're
just curious developers and blah blah
blah and if you have any question please
talk to our lawyer yeah he's in jail no
ok so uh I'm sure if you're here you're
not some of those guys who think that
smart watches are just for I mean
gadgets for geeks right no it's more
than that you know it if you don't we'll
show you why it's interesting to develop
for smartwatches not just 4get come pick
me up that one so a few interesting
features about the platform before we
dive into the differences between those
platforms first glint the glanceable
aspect so it's very important on a watch
to consider that it's not a mini phone
on your arm it's actually more
complicated than that and you have to
take into account that a watch is not
supposed to be looked at for more than a
few seconds
and you have you have to take that into
account in your design it's only two or
three seconds at a time and then people
will forget about it if you have if you
force them to raise there are more than
that you will have problems and people
will get in get in hospitals and so on
that's not what you want another
interesting factor they are all full of
sensors and it's not just like sensors
and your phone it's not let just gps
accelerometer and all that in your phone
because those sensors are on your users
are at all times so there are plenty of
things that you can do knowing that you
have a heart rate monitor that you don't
have on the phone of course because it
doesn't make any sense you have yeah
plenty of sensors that are there all the
time and that you can take advantage of
in terms of not only data but also user
interaction they integrate very well in
the Internet of Things which is all the
rage right now or at least has been some
height and for example there is an app
to switch off the lights in your house
or to change the color or anything okay
this is very geeky but it works and
another thing that's also very important
their notification dream rent so it's
not something that you well you can
develop apps that you actually have to
launch and and use and browse and so on
but most of the most interesting apps on
app on smart watches are the ones that
allow you to react to a notification so
for example you receive a message and
you want to reply quickly or know who it
is or whatever if you receive a meeting
you want to accept the meeting invite
you want to accept or reject the meeting
something like that and for example
there is also very well-known example on
the smart on the Apple watch of a health
app for doctors and physicians can
actually see the the heart monitor
results and so on of their patient
directly indentification so you can do
some pre advanced our house is using a
smart one of Korea it's a little yeah so
do please it is a small screen which may
appear as a constraint but is actually
is actually pretty interesting forces
you to be creative and to be
very very concise in the way you design
the in display information because you
cannot yeah you cannot install this kind
of things on Windows 95 yeah the
interactions are also completely
original of course you have a
touchscreen but you should not use it
too much because when your finger is on
the screen then it takes pretty much the
entire space and it clutters view and so
on so you you're better off using all
the user interface elements that you
have in user interaction elements for
example on the Apple watch there is the
digital crown on the side there is there
are the buttons you can use vibration
you can use plenty of things and go go
for that and also it's like a
handkerchief like a toothbrush like the
thing in Inception it's not something
that you let other people use it's just
the owner of the watch that's going to
use it and it's really interesting what
you can do knowing that so today we'll
go over a little bit of as I said a
bird's-eye view of the landscape of
smartwatches will there are a lot of
platforms around probably the most
recent one is the Tizen platform from
Samsung but it's still very marginal and
only a few phones and watches support it
so we'll focus on the most mainstream
platform at guess that's the Apple watch
the Android wear and a little bit about
the pebble even though I think not a lot
of you will be interested anyway it's
good to know that there are those
platforms Samsung will not agree with us
they have yeah of course is there
anybody from Samsung sorry so let's talk
about the ID because after all we are in
the room of developers right so IDs on
for the Apple watch well it's the same
as for iOS apps it's Xcode there are
alternatives like app code from
jetbrains for example but it doesn't
have any app watch support for now so it
only works on iphones actually fine ILS
apps so in Xcode you have an emulator
you have
a pallet of of components made
specifically for the watch you have code
editors refactorings all that get
support integration so it's a pretty
powerful IDE even though it's still
lagging behind in some respects
especially with refactorings actually
but yeah it's there and it's complete
well for Android where we have Android
studio who already used android studio
hope you enjoy developers in the ROI of
course everyone what it is so with
Android studio of course you can create
android application and also other way
where application so the learning curve
is very fast what is missing on Android
studio is the layout editor the widget
that you have to use for the photos
smartwatch are not included in the
palette and I think that on Android
studio they have to improve the way to i
will say deploying debug the application
between your phone and your SmartWatch
because you have to to play with the
android dev a girl come online and 24
outs imported satellites really show you
that after yeah i will show you and so
if you would like to try yeah so that's
the element is exactly a DB minus d 4
rtcp blah blah blah blah blah blah in
order to to deploy and to test your
application if you use your real phone
device and android android wear emulator
no I'm just joking because our necks
code is just it's fully i phone emulator
watching me later they are all connected
without any of this asshole so in that
regard yeah x co dis pretty it's pretty
easy to use so who is using eclipse for
android development ok so you have to
know that Google try to promote Android
studio and Google is a is leading the
development of ADT android development
tools anyway on
eclipse the there is a project called
anymore and this project is a intended
to to focus on Android development okay
so it's still an option even though it's
not yet supported for the future a day
for pebble well it's kind of different
they you can I mean soul see development
so you all you need is a text editor and
a console basically you have all the
tools in the common line but there is
something called cloud pebble that
allows you to create your projects and
edit your files directly in a cloud
environment and actually as you can see
on the upper left you even have an
emulator directly in the browser so
close to them it's pretty advanced stuff
but it's still c code so it kind of
ruins the body anyway in terms of
development cycle so on the Apple watch
as we say it's pretty easy when you
start a new project with the with the
Apple watch kind you get pre-configured
emulators all you need to do is to
select the the Apple watch scheme to say
okay I want to run my watch app you have
to select your emulator configuration
and you can add as many combinations as
you want and you run and that's it and
you can actually launch a debugger on
both the iphone emulator and the watch
simulator and for example if you have
some communication going on between the
two you can see the messages the logs
and so on for both so it's pretty
interesting and pretty powerful and we
have to install some libraries to
nothing you when you install xcode it
comes with the SDK comes with all the
libraries pre-installed it's too easy
for Android you have to install android
wear on your phone in order to you know
to pair your and your SmartWatch you
have to create the we're emulator and we
recommend that you create emulator for
different form factors round square and
ranch in we'll see that in few slides
and you have to play with the Android
debug
bridge just to ensure that your phone
can communicate with your SmartWatch you
have to pair of course your phone with
with the with your or your watch and you
have to deploy the application on both
the watch and on the phone and so you
have to use a physical phone with the
software emulator it's no you can you
can try to use a phone emulator with the
Android wear a meal at all but you have
to play again with the the ADB comments
doesn't come for free now well on pebble
as I said it's pretty easy if you if all
you need is the pebble app itself then
you can just use cloud pebble for
example or you can use the camel the
common line if you're really in a geeky
mood if you want to communicate between
the watch and the iphone you have the
pebble up on you on your iPhone or your
Android by the way it works with both
and you can just enable communication
with cloud pebble and it does the rest
and if you want to communicate with the
phone actually comes from the web to
your phone sorry impressive stuff let's
talk about the available watches on both
platform for Apple it's pretty simple
there are two watches right now I mean
to form factors and to I mean of course
there are plenty of combinations you can
have the gold one goes from four hundred
fifty euros too thick sixteen thousand
euros i think but they all have the same
resolution they all have the same
capabilities it's just how rich you are
and that's the only difference it's just
a mark of you know how rich you are
anyway so the resolution is 312 and by
sorry 3 12 x 320 on the 42 millimeters
and 272 by 340 on the on the 38
millimeters and that's that's all there
is yeah for Android wear you know you
have only to mod Elsa we have plenty of
others
welcome fragmentation and we have round
square almost round and yeah it's
amazing because we talked about it
earlier and we noticed that there were
only six or seven manufacturers doing
Android watch right now android watches
and just those six or seven could not
agree on one form factor we have to do
three different ones yeah so this is the
from factors that we have and I love the
the last one ranching you know the flat
tire design but it's a beautiful watch
the Moto 360 and yes maybe even if you
develop an application on the square
watch you are not sure that it will work
in the all square watch because it
depends on the you know the resolution
density etc so it can be huge challenge
but anyway we have the choice you have a
choice when you have only another 100 a
few hundred thousand devices on the
market that's very good idea to give
that management that much of a choice
anyway for the pebble there are five
models right now they all share the same
resolution the only differed only main
difference i'd say between the classic
steel on one side and the time and x 2
on the other side is the color and it's
actually very limited number of colors
so it's not a big deal they just added
the time around which adds the same kind
of problems that we have with the round
vs square form factors on android where
you still have to customize your designs
even the menus tend to change because
they want to do something fancy anyway
the sdk for the round is still in in
better so yeah you get some level of
fragmentation but not too much and yeah
the old models are only black and white
so it simplifies design quad summer and
yeah the resolution is the same for all
the square version 1 44 x 168 so it's
little smaller than all the retina
screens that you have on those so let's
talk about compatibility for Android
wear what can we do
for Android where you need to have a
phone with the Android 34 dot 3 or
higher and you can also use an iphone
for that so you can pair your smart so
your Android wear watch with your iPhone
but you will receive some notification
but you know today it's really limited
and it's not working with all all
Android wear watches you have to to buy
a LG urbane or moto 360 second edition
or the latest one the tag that was there
released a few days ago sixteen hundred
euros and for Android Android for some
fun gotta watch what watch was simple it
only works with iphone that's it all the
questions oh and for pebble it's more
it's a little richer than that because
you can actually pair a pebble with any
smartphone I mean any mainstream
smartphone Android or iOS and there they
even have SDKs for both platforms if you
want to integrate your pebble app with a
native app to make them communicate with
one another but if you don't want that
you can also use just a pebble app to
communicate and i'll show you there what
that means so that's probably the one of
the most interesting aspects of this
platform is that when you do a pebble
app you can go you can reach all the the
smartphone owners so let's talk about
inputs and outputs as we say it's pretty
original on smart watches and it's good
to take them all into account on the
Apple watch you have the the the
gestures of course so that means the
screen is a is a old touch screen so you
can touch it and do some things like
that so it's very nice because at the
end of the of the day you have plenty of
noisy traces on your screen and you can
treat time anymore but ok
you have the force touch so just going
to show you a little bit here for
example if I just tap nope sorry forgot
the video there we go so if I just tap
on the screen I'd knowledge in action
but if I tap strongly i launched another
one so here it's to customize the watch
face for example and basically the force
touch is used mostly for context menu
that's the main function of it so just a
way for them to avoid having yet another
button around the watch but you do have
also the digital crown on the side that
can be used in application to scroll
through lists instead of having to do
swipes on your screen and you can also
click it and there is a side button to
click but that's mostly a home button I
mean to come back that's the equivalent
of the big home button on your phone you
also have the taptic engine that's more
of an output the reason I mentioned it
is because it's actually a little richer
than the usual vibrator that you're used
to you know the boot that you forget
when it's on your side table when you it
when you sleep anyway here is really
discreet and it's more sophisticated you
can have some really advanced patterns
that you can recognize for example when
you launch navigation you can actually
detect when it says up or down on the
watch so that's some things that you can
use as well and it has a microphone and
a speaker so if you want to use sounds
or give it orders or I mean for text
input it can be used so that's really
nice and amongst the other things that
you can use you can also use
accelerometer to detect movements in the
watch and it has a heart rate monitor
beside by the way funny thing is that
this heart rate monitor is also used to
authenticate you so as soon as you
remove the watch the sensor detects that
the watch is not on your arm anymore add
maybe in an unsafe territory so it locks
to watch or you are dead or you're dead
it's also another option and then it
doesn't call your physician because yes
there's a watch to be taken
and it has NFC the reason I put it in
brackets is because we can't use it
anymore yet sorry there is no api for
that but you can already use some
applications to pay for some things you
know with contactless payments you can
use it to open doors in certain hilton
hotels so yeah but someday we'll be able
to access that and use it for our own
apps for android where we have a lot of
a lot of features we have a touch screen
and its really useful we have check
moves this is something you can buy a
movement you can swipe application you
can change features etc so they cure
Parkinson's and you have a button that
you use as a button that you can press
or not equal yeah it's not a wheel it's
a button you have the ambient mode so
it's really useful no it's serious it's
useful you can hide your watch and your
watch can in turn ambient mode so why
not you have a microphone you can say ok
Google bring me a beer you have the
heart rate monitor the same i think that
Apple but cheapest way you have
gyroscope accelerometer compass
biomatter I don't know why you have to
use it that an NFC and GPS it depends on
model for example NFC gps is provided by
the Sony SmartWatch 3 but not by the LG
urban and you know you do to the
fragmentation the risk is to develop an
application that required some features
so to ensure that the feature is
provided by your watch say the the API
you can use a meter that will that we
tell you if the gps is provided or not
so you have to do this this method and
on the pebble do you have a
non-touchscreen so you have a screen
that's cool
it's an e-ink screen so it's the pretty
low resolution and it doesn't have a lot
of colors when it has some and you have
four buttons three on the right side and
one on the left side so that's the
cancel the up/down and ok buttons
basically you have a vibrator okay it
can be useful and you have a microphone
in the latest version so in the pedal
time I think and the pebble time round
you have a microphone that you can start
to integrate to use some voice control
or something and that's pretty much it
so let's talk about design principles
because they don't have the same ones of
course that would be too easy for Apple
I mean design is kind of their core
business somehow so you have the human
the human interface guidelines the same
kind of documents that you have for the
iphone you have another document for the
Apple watch and they really insist on
three key principles the first one is
lightweight interactions so everything
should be only a few seconds and when I
mean when I say few seconds or twenty
two or three seconds max so all the
interactions should be very efficient
and all the information that is
displayed must be carefully selected so
that you don't force people to okay
where is the information I'm looking for
so this is really important the second
principle is holistic design so that's a
principle that says that you should take
into account the entirety of the
platform all the inputs and outputs that
you have at your disposal to design your
apps and not just the screen and the
touch like you would do on a on a phone
so it's really important to integrate
like the vibration the the digital crown
the force touch and all that just the
goal for the watch was to blur the
limits between software and hardware so
that's kind of their thing the last
principle is personal communication not
totally sold on that one but it's for
them the Apple watch is really a
personal communication device so they
have all these things where you can send
drawings of your on your watch to your
friend
we all know what I will draw first right
you can send your heart rate to your
loved ones okay very interesting but
yeah anything that you can build into
your app to make the communication with
others more powerful is favored I'd say
what about Android so for Android we
have what we say the context stream so
the contact stream is a list of vertical
cards each time an application has to
warn you about an information so in 15
minutes you have to turn right or there
is a bar on the left side etc you will
receive an information this information
will be pushed in the the context stream
you will have to navigate through the
different context stream is similar to
Google now if you don't find the
information you can ask Google to find
this information this is the notion of
cue cards for example Google beam me up
I'm not sure that it will work the
erosion of glanceable of course it's a
providing the minimal information for
the user and the 0 although interaction
that means that on your cards you have
you can put some action button that will
launch a specific activity on your watch
or on your phone octavo so pebble has
some guidelines and patterns but those
are mostly patterns they would didn't
really theorize too many too much on
that so you have a notion of cards that
you can use to display information that
is really relevant you have the the idea
that you should use lists with menus to
display information I mean array
information I would say and this is
easier to bros with the side buttons
because you have the up and down button
and when you found the correct selection
you click ok so there's the notion of
focus also by the way you have to use
the action bar once again it's not a
touch screen so you have to use the
button on the side and there are special
components to help you do that
you can prompt a user action on the
phone so for example if you need to
communicate something with the phone you
link to launch the application on the
phone to do something you can from that
with special components as well the time
and relevant data can be shown status
bar so there's a status bar like on the
phone and you can show alerts and get
decisions with the model windows I'm
going to details about that and yeah you
can use vibrations and haptic feedback
but it's much less rich than on the
Apple watch of course so on all those
platforms you can develop different
kinds of apps it's not just the main app
like you might be used to on the Apple
watch the first kind of apps that you
can do is the just a fool on app that
you can launch from the launch screen
can show you real quick so here I've
done a little bit of cleaning up I don't
have that many but you can see all of
them with the just zooming with the
smart the digital crown so you can
launch an app like that but it's as I
said it's not the primary way that
people are going to interact with with
your app the second way is by you
customer using custom notifications so
of course if you don't do anything all
the notifications are sent to your phone
are going to be sent to your watch as
well with with the default layout if you
want to customize it add some custom
actions for it you can do that as well
do some custom notifications and there's
the notion of a glance so once again i'm
going to show you what it is if you go I
mean from the main watch face if you go
just up with your finger for example
there is this this sorry this glance
that I can use to launch my application
but also just to display quick
information and I have plenty of such
widgets if you want to display some
key elements and that is also something
that you can use to show quick
information and doesn't force your user
to enter Europe sorry and the last one
and I think that's one of the most
interesting ones is the complications so
I know the name is not perfectly
shoulder chosen it's kind of confusing
but it comes from the world of real
mechanic watches wear those little thing
is on the on the frame are our cold
complications because because they
complicate the mechanism here of course
it's just software so doesn't really
complicate anything but the really
interesting thing here on the screen
shot you can see time travel is
activated so I can show you if you go to
the main a watch face and you start to
play with the watch you can see that the
time goes by and all the complications
on the screen will adapt as I move in
time so here you see the temperature has
gone down and so on so you can sort of
travel in time to see the data evolve it
can be interesting so going back to
slides and the Android wear okay so I
can show it on on the phone on the watch
sorry an Android we're sorry you have
the notion of food in green up my hard
work yeah yeah this is proof it's happen
this is a full screen application this
is what we we have developed for this
session you have also the notion of
notification here is a custom
notification have you seen no it's not
clear enough light with an action that
allow you to learn something on on your
mobile and what you have this is the
notion of context stream sorry that the
watch is too poor for right for
okay we're just gonna show ya special
slide so the first going up notification
you know you can receive notification on
your watch without doing any codes if
your phone is providing you notification
you will receive them on your on your
watch custom notification this is why I
have tried to towards you this is a cart
you swap your card and you can have
additional action button and of course
it's a watch so you can install custom
wat watch faces do you have this feature
an apple mm-hmm you know there was a guy
in France his name is a jak dziala he
says if you don't have a Rolex by the
time you reach 50 then you have clearly
failed in your life check ok I admit her
with a last I to have that not to fail
my life and on the pebble well there are
just two kinds of apps really full full
on apps and you can also integrate in
what they call the timeline which is
pretty close to the to this time travel
aspect for the Apple watch and you can
see on this video just by interacting
with the up and down button from the
main watch face you can navigate in time
and see future events the evolutions of
weather and you can actually inject some
data in there she can be interesting so
let's talk about languages because after
all we are software developers and so
for the Apple watch the main preferred
language is Swift who has already done
any Swift ok be proud of it i sell--
don't feels dirty one again once again
so they do support objective-c like on
iphones but it's clearly not the
favorite way because it will fade away
at some point and swift us so many
features that can be interesting to use
for for the Apple watch so all the API
is all the a sample code that you can
find online are all documented in Swift
so it's it's good to switch to Swift
and for Android where we can use how do
it where of course you can use Java and
if you know Java if you already have
developed android mobile application you
will you will be able to create an
Android wear application in a day so the
learning curve is really fast or you can
use Kotlin or I never tried it groovy or
ribbon ocean so you have plenty of
languages that support Android wear yeah
and actually we even forgot that you had
also some cross-platform languages like
xamarin and stuff like that for pebble
well it's mostly see and when I say see
I mean really see not C++ not C sharp
just see with structs with the static
methods all the way basically your
programs end up being long text files
like that it's all it's awful navigating
that it's just hello world yeah you can
also use a pebble pebble GS GS it's a
JavaScript framework but it's more
limited because it's just a way for your
phone to remotely control your watch and
it's really weird really limited but it
offers some ease of use especially when
you want to communicate with the
internet so that was for the languages
let's talk a little bit about yeah the
components that you can access so I'm
going to go into the demo actually so
this is an example on the right you can
see a palette of all the components that
are accessible in Xcode in interface
builder they are really specific to the
watch so even the table view for example
is it's very specific if you are used to
doing uitableview on iOS it's not the
same at all this isn't just an example
that shows how to initialize a table
there is no delegator is no data source
is just plainly setting the number of
items and then configuring each row
independently and yeah all the
components are really specific to the
Apple watch I won't go into the demo so
here we r i'm going to show you
what we can do in terms of layout for
another area where so here we have a an
application of you that should be
displayed on the square from fat or
around the ranch in form factor so
everything is done on the on the way out
so here we have the watch view step that
will allow us to define the sub sub
layout one for the square model so it's
called Ratbat Square and one for the
round model so the first one for the
square one is the easiest way to do
because you know it's easy to to set the
different views the title the button etc
so it's a standard relatively out so if
you know Android development it's the
same thing by the way you can deploy the
application on a mobile phone it will
work and for the round one you have a
specific view provided by the wearable
API it's called what's inside layout and
it will help you to set your element in
the square to avoid that some text will
be hidden by why the around layout so
when they say that watches who are
supposed to be around maybe when it was
just needles you know for digital
doesn't work so this is some view that
are provided by the rebel API and work
for pebble you have the cloud public
editor you I editors once again say you
are it's a web interface in which you
can start to you know tinker and place
your components and lay them out but in
the end it does generate that oh so
that's just to place a label with those
four digits in the middle of the screen
that's it this is done in just one line
of Java Oh swifter and three hours yeah
so in terms of Internet connectivity
this is really interesting because there
are some major differences here for the
Apple watch if it works automatically if
your phone is in the neighborhood of
your watch and your phone has a good
internet connection then it uses your
phone the the the requests go through
your phone to the Internet if your phone
is out of battery for example or if it
doesn't have a good connection the watch
is connected to the Wi-Fi directly and
can call your API is directly so that's
really interesting and all that is
transparent for the developer you don't
have anything special to do you can just
use the nsurl session framework which is
the same as on the iphone and it does
the rest for you if there is a commit
some communication sorry some
communication going on with the phone
it's transparent that's pretty nice and
really effective way to you to program
with the network with android of course
you can pair off your watch with your
phone using bluetooth but you are you
have also a Wi-Fi device integrated in
your your watch but don't try to connect
your loop remote server with there with
your watch through Wi-Fi it will not
work because Wi-Fi is just a fallback
solution if the the phone and your watch
is outside the blue range range yeah
okay so so here just a simple to to
illustrate that for smartwatch we have
used a retrofit library from square saw
the phone connect to the devack's rest
api server and well it's just an
illustration i don't think that we have
do this is actually on the phone began
on the other than exercising it is some
setting everything to connect but that's
just standard android stuff yeah okay
won't go to that on the pebble well it's
basically the same except there is no
Wi-Fi in the bevel so you have a cable
no yeah you have to plug you don't like
that anyway and so you have to exchange
information with the phone via an API
called app message and I'll show
cool it is actually if you don't want so
you have two choices if you have a
native app on the phone with the pebble
sdk integrated in it you can communicate
with that otherwise you can also
communicate with the JavaScript module
that is loaded into the pebble app on
your phone that means that when you
release an app for the pebble you have
to wait for an update of the pebble app
to have your JavaScript module in it
very clever as if the the Apple review
time was not long enough so you can
exchange information with jaz module and
then the GS module can connect connect
to the internet using edge xml
httprequest and then of course the
message has to go the other way so just
to show you I don't expect you to read
the code that's just to show you how
complex it is this is just to send a
message from the watch to the phone to
pass three parameters and then the phone
goes to the Internet in JavaScript comes
back packages all the information in a
byte array yes you heard me right that
is a hashmap with only did integer keys
and then you have to send that back to
the watch and interpret it on the other
side so it's really really cumbersome
and actually this is one of the reasons
why we didn't have time to do the the
app that we are going to demonstrate on
the pebble in terms of phone
communication that's where it comes
interesting especially when you need it
to go to the Internet there are four
ways to communicate between the Apple
watch and the iphone the first one is
using application context this is just a
way to synchronize your iPhone app with
the your Apple watch app so every time
you send an application context the
phone it just over writes the previous
one it's just a sink message another way
is to use sand message but this only
works when your phone app is on and in
the foreground if it's not then you have
to fall back to transfer
userinfo and this is interesting because
it is cued so if you send messages and
the phone is not on or the app is in the
background for example it just doesn't
process anything and when you launch the
app on the phone it dq's everything in
processes the messages so it can be
interesting as a pattern and of course
you can transfer files if you have to
send some images or the Titanic movie if
you want to watch the Titanic movie in
those days four hours short interactions
and yeah this is just an example to show
how it works so you can you have to
check if the session is reachable if it
is then you can use send message if it's
not then you use transfer user info this
is just an example actually extracted
from the code of the app that we are
going to demonstrate so on Android the
we have some API provided by the google
play services and if you know how to use
them you are ok you can create
application and communicate with with
your phone and vice versa this FBI are a
message API data api and api we will
illustrate how our they it's working
your device it can be your phone or your
watch has to call it to the google play
services using a Google API client to
use to connect to the Google API client
you just have to connect and disconnect
on start and then i'll stop method so
it's a really basic basic principle on
an android development then if you want
to send a message a one-way message to
to your phone or your phone to your to
your watch the better way to do that is
using the message api the message API
will send a small payload of information
to the remote device and each devices
are identified thanks to the node API
for the message API your notes has to be
connected if the remote node is not only
available so
it will fail we will see that there is
another way to to send message in a a
synchronous way so the send message so
as you can see the in this in this code
will receive the what we call the the
data path and the message payload the
data path will be used to identify
uniquely identify the message that you
are sending and it will be used by the
remote device to detect who is sending
the message and the meaning of this of
this message and in the for loop we send
we both broadcast this message to all
remote devices when you process the
messages on the phone for example the
watch has send a message to the phone on
the phone there is an unmess ajay
received a metal that that is that is
called because we are in the we are
using a wearable Easterner service
though the wireless Turner service is
used to in fact to to detect all message
that are sent to the data layer
something has been received a message
received is launched and here the the
code one is using is extracting the
message event parsing the message event
and saying yes here I have to retreat
the the schedules I have to send the
schedule to the to the remote device the
data synchronization is another way to
to communicate between the devices here
are the difference in that the message
that you sent is structured as a data
map and the other advantage is the fact
that if the remote node is not online
the message will be purchased in the in
a local cache when the watch will be on
it will receive all the other pending
messages so this is a subscribe you will
have the slide you will have the time to
review
okay in terms of caching it's
interesting to consider because once
again we are on a watch it has some
limited capabilities in terms of
processing power in terms of battery and
so on so the less you go to network the
better so you bet you'd better cash
everything there probably are some more
sophisticated mechanisms to catch on the
Apple watch than what we used but for
now the probably the most documented way
is to use core data so you can actually
have a database in your watch mind blown
so it's pretty complex core data it's
kind of like hibernate on iOS if you
want it works with an SQLite database
usually and but it's pretty complex to
set up and well this is just an extract
of the code I won't show you they move
that because we have a lot of ground to
cover yet and on Android what can we do
yes here we use the data API mechanism
to retrieve the data on the cash for
example for smart parts if we require
some information we're not going to ask
the phone hey guys give me the the list
of torch the list of speakers it's a
trap and each time the phone has to
connect to to the remote server so the
first time that will receive the
information the data API will will store
this data on its own cash and what we
have done on smartphones is to say I
have to display the I don't know the
detail of the talk so the first step is
to check the cash the local cash the
information is there so I can display it
it's not there sighs I send a message
using the message API and so it's a
little more advanced is more dramatic
than exactly core data okay we won't go
over demo last thing that's important
once you have finished when she are done
developing all that of course you want
to know how you can deploy your
application the Apple watch you have the
iTunes Connect back in a back office
sorry well you can do everything and you
can upload screenshots and and upload
your binary your app your Apple watch
is it is sorry its encapsulated in your
iphone app so you cannot release an
Apple watch app without a companion
iphone app that's an interesting thing
to remember on Android where I think you
can hide it but we have talked about it
and so you package the Apple watch with
the iphone app you release the iphone
app like any other you wait for review
and then you wait again and then you
wait some more and that's the type of
review process just for the other story
I we submitted smart box well I will
watch 8 I mean on Friday last week and
was only accepted on Saturday right in
time so on Android wear yes it's quite
different so the application has been
published and reviewed in a couple of
hours sorry just the time to drink your
coffee so before releasing your up on
google google play there are some
warning you have to be sure that the
permission that you have set on the web
module has been defined on the phone
module 0 otherwise it will not work and
you have also to ensure that the package
name and the version that you are using
is the same for the phone and for the
where when you generate the design APK
APK sorry you just have to set the
mobile because the mobile will embed the
where APK so this is the structure of an
application you have what we call the
companion application this is the the
mobile mobile application that contain
the APK of the the phone and for the the
wearable which you can hide it on
android yeah for smartwatch you have no
visible application on the on the on the
phone and don't don't forget that when
you are in the publishing resort with
art you have to to check to set a
checkbox it is lost in then the page
it's not quite clear but you have to say
yes and publishing another way they are
calling you for and if you forget you
have to wait another two hour
two hours another another coffee and
yeah this is the the distribution so 20
installation has to go through the phone
and then the filter fault and the phone
will deploy your application in all of
your watches so I'll have 33 watches and
that's the same on the iphone and on the
bubble you are you actually have an
apple sorry a pebble appstore that's
integrated in the pebble app and you can
release your apps there it's pretty easy
to do is the same principle you have a
web wizard wizard where you can do
everything the as i said the interesting
thing is if you have if you're have app
has ajs module that needs to be deployed
to the pebble app then you need to wait
usually a few weeks for pebble to
release an upgrade of their up so that
your app can work and then you can flip
the switch so yeah there is this option
so let's talk a little bit about smart
Vox so smart folks is the this
application that we developed Express is
specifically for dev ox so if you didn't
know about it yet good thing you still
have two days to use it it's it's
actually useful not just for the demo
but also for just browsing the schedule
and doing some interesting stuff on your
SmartWatch if you already have one so
you can go to smart folks calm where you
can find some links to download it by
the way the site is responsive so it
will work with your with your phones as
well and
just to show you how it works yeah so we
will go back there and just show you
where it how it works let's try to be
leave the screen up as you can see there
are already some traces so this is just
the list of schedules okay i just
received notification from spotify this
is just a list of schedules i can just
select today for example okay it will
load the first time it will load
everything in the cache then it will be
faster because the data will come from
the database the talks are color-coded
by topic okay what's going on that's
demo effect anyway and you can scroll
through all the presentations all the
way down and if you want you can of
course select an individual talk you can
see more details and including details
for the speaker just to be sure that you
are in the right room can be practical
and of course from the screen of the
talk itself you can force touch to use
the favorites management feature and
when you do that it actually
communicates with the phone to schedule
a local notification 10 minutes before
the talk starts so you will receive a
custom notification 10 mins before so
yeah this this place looks like on Apple
watch on Android it I will use my moto
360
so you have the list of schedule okay
you choose a day Wednesday you can have
some information on the for example the
keynote open keynote savory so it's not
clear but it's working believe me as the
list of similar the list of speaker but
on Android where we have a bonus you can
open the Twitter profile on the phone in
order to follow the speakers and it's
free well down there and you can also
sorry you can also i don't know i will
choose a talk for example add your your
your toll to the calendar here okay if i
check here my calendar but hello okay so
when you add a talk to your favorite on
the android version it actually it's
actually stored in your calendar so that
you can use the reminders inside
somewhere I like that it's not practical
that are using a bun with the dentist
tomorrow Sam yeah don't forget okay so
that was just a small demo of course
just a few words for the end so as we
could see there are some huge
inequalities in terms of development
platform ease of use obviously apple
took some time to perfect their craft
and that I think that's why it took them
about a year and a half to release the
SDK after the Android wear thing was out
and it shows it really shows in terms of
development expressiveness the learning
curve is shorter on Android wear yeah
because it's a language that a lot of
people know about need java language
compared to Swift that a lot of people
actually have to learn for the first
time but on the other hand the tooling
support is not up to date on android as
we said the the palette of components is
not adapted yet stairs
work to be done on Android side and
apparently they are not investing that
much time in it on both platform
documentation is really really behind
lagging behind even on Apple when they
do documentation they do it well but it
takes time and not all apps make sense
on SmartWatch that's probably the
biggest thing that we want you to take
away type of app types of apps that
works that work well and smart watches
everything related to countdowns and
timers oh sorry so everything ready to
countdown timer status checks okay
what's the temperature now I think it's
okay 35 yeah in the room yeah but
outside is 13 degrees okay everything I
mean related to watching anything
basically remote controls as i said i
developed a pebble app for example to
shut my electric shutters at home what
is very well because i'm a lazy guy and
it didn't want to go on all the buttons
but you can also use integrated in
Internet of Things devices every kind of
notification responder is a good is a
good pattern and data trackers of course
especially health data so if you want to
use it to track your runs or every
exercise that you have it can really be
interesting kinds of apps that don't
work on smartwatches games of any kind I
mean even I mean recently I was really
really into a game called lifeline don't
try it you will waste plenty of hours
it's really addictive but it works kind
of works on the Apple watch anyway but
yeah it's really hard any long kind any
kind of long reading so news books all
that doesn't really work too much text
of course we would buy something from
their watch all right pay for something
that's the last thing but by directly no
any kind of video or image viewing I
don't
understand why Apple integrated a
component to watch videos on photoshop
for where yeah that's the future okay
and and anything that requires any kind
of text input because you don't have a
keyboard you can use your voice
sometimes but it's really cumbersome kid
come pick me up just one more thing so
the app that we showed you just now
guess what it's available on github so
if you want to try it out if you want to
see the code it's available in black
black and in white so you have the
github URL right here and we are right
on time thanks a lot thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
