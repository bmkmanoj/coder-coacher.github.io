okay hello everyone so if you're here
for Alexa you're in the right session
otherwise you can quickly leave before
the door closes but then you have to be
really quickly so I'm not working for
Amazon I'm not trying to sell you stuff
from Amazon I just like voice
recognition and Amazon was one of the
first that started selling it and I have
a lot of open source going on around it
as I will show you in the next 50
minutes so it's not like a sales page to
make you buy Alexa device but it is a
bit of a sales pitch up it shouldn't
listen it is a bit of a sales page that
voice recognition is the future
basically and it's it's already here so
content for the next 50 minutes I put
questions at the end but please feel
free to interrupt me in between and I'll
try and answer your questions
immediately so first to start with
what's like the Internet of Things I
mean you hear a lot about it lately -
really popular term and often it
involves a bit of computing and it often
involves some kind of network often
Wi-Fi or whatever and but the thing is
that there's a lot of stuff sold as IOT
because it's ahead term and it sells
product I was at a conference where
someone introduced the concept of a
light bulb which changed color based on
humidity and the temperature and stuff
like that so you didn't have to look
what the temperature is in digits you
could see it from the color of the light
and there was really great concept and
it looked quite nice he had designed it
quite well but after like I don't know
45 minutes somebody asked the question
like but how do you connect it to the
Internet and the guy said basically it's
not yet connected to anything and then
he said yeah and basically the light
changes color randomly so basically it
was just LED with somebody sold us an
IOT device without making any sense so
be careful I mean people put Internet of
Things
logo stickers on garb
ganz trying to sell them to you so it's
a bit of a vague term it's not really a
specification for it and I found this as
the infrastructure of information
society it's still a bit vague but I
mean it's all about the communication
using an infrastructure to get data
around and do something useful with it
so how does home automation fit in and
what home automation I mean probably if
you have something automated in your
home you use your smartphone to control
it maybe a Philips hue lights or
something else that you connect in your
home and you control it with your mobile
phone so what other things except for
just some light bulbs that you can
control and a colleague of mine actually
had a really great idea on what you want
to do with home automation okay so he
had two rooms and only one television so
it is really useful of course I doubt if
this is any cheaper than just buying a
second television and but okay I mean he
had a lot of fun and I asked him like
during the summer can you make it spin
quicker because then you also have a fan
but he didn't try that out yet and so
basically you can automate anything in
your home and then control it with your
smartphone most of the times at the demo
time where that so what's our motivation
then for me it's just a subset of IOT
it's some stuff that you do around your
home which is automated but there are
some challenges to it I mean if your
mobile phone is on the charger yeah you
cannot use it or you have to walk to it
to control your home and probably with
this phone you have other challenges
than just charging it but okay and
whatever reasons smart phones have the
tendency to break everybody I know as a
broken screen basically that's nowadays
a feature I believe instead of a book so
when it's broken you cannot control your
home anymore and there are other issues
if you're having dinner with your wife
your kids or your your husband and
sometimes you have a discussion or at
least I have sometimes have a discussion
of course for you that's not the case
but we sometimes argue and and then I
think that I'm right and my wife thinks
exactly the same and then of course you
can pick up your smartphone and start
googling it but it's a bit impolite and
your dinner gets cold so it's not really
a good option then and if you're lying
on the couch just relaxing you have to
get up to get your smart phone to do
something like put on the lights or
whatever it's not really convenient so
for me smartphones are a little bit like
Batman they were cool in the past but
they had their best days and nowadays
there are better options like the echo
dot from Amazon and this little small
thing on the right you don't get the
Lego with it unfortunately it's this
swing now you have some other model
modules that are bigger but this is the
cheapest one actually so what does it do
Alexa basically is a voice recognition
engine so it's not a girl sitting
somewhere behind the desk trying to
answer your questions it's a fully
automated process with artificial
intelligence in it and all kinds of
things and you can basically ask
questions to Alexa or you can ask Alexa
to do things so I can also a lecture
like light unin radio I couldn't tell
how you'd like to rate this song please
try again for example say I like the
electroscope Alexa play tuning radio
getting the last Union Station you
listen to dance
FM UAE Alexa Wikipedia Java programming
language Java is a general-purpose
cookie you can control music where your
room isn't a sport object or video and
basically anything designed to have
electron implement stop Alexa stop Alexa
Alexa stop and so you can use it to play
music and then in between ask other
questions the music is simply passed and
when the questions answered or you stop
it then it will simply continue with the
music so it's really convenient to do
basically anything with it that you want
to do within your home and the fun thing
is you can buy this thing off the shelf
and then and then it's nice and cool but
I was really interested because it's no
fun buying something which works out of
the box I'm a developer I want to do
stuff with it and try and fix stuff but
then Amazon released an application and
instructions and the application was
written in Java and some instructions on
how you could run basically sort of the
same software that's running on this one
on your own Raspberry Pi so what I did
is I bought a Raspberry Pi
it's down below with a small microphone
you can use smaller ones and a speaker
and then it's basically the same as my
echo dot funny thing is Amazon sort of
will release an echo dot with a
touchscreen but I did it already like a
year ago so they stole my idea I'm still
waiting for my money so that's a bit of
a pity and so you can use really small
microphones as well there is an official
guide so it's really well documented and
you can just use it like the echo dot so
to show you how it works and where's
Chuck Norris you won't know until it's
too late
where can I hide a dead body I take the
body to the police so you can ask all
kinds of useful questions you already
know that what's the weather in
Amsterdam in Amsterdam Netherlands
it's 22 degrees with clear skies and fun
stop so up to the process
and so you see that here I have to press
a button with Alexa one I could just say
Alexa and then it will start listening
shouldn't listen but it will start
listening here a press a button but they
already released a new version which
allows you to also use the wake up word
so you don't have to press that button
anymore but I didn't install like yet on
my Raspberry Pi so yeah what's a bit of
the options you have within the echo
world you have the one that came out
first which was like 180 bucks later you
had the echo dots which is a smaller one
over here I have some thing that's
rechargeable one you can do stuff with
that and the thing I built costs around
80 to 90 dollars
I think that's excluding the touchscreen
so compared to the original echo dot and
the more expensive one it was quite well
value for money but I think two weeks
after I configured this thing and added
up and running they released a new echo
dot which costs only fifty bucks so it's
like a man now it's from price
perspective not a really good solution
and in the beginning they also had they
lacked some support like playing music
didn't work well on the homebrew
solution they fix that as well as I
mentioned in the beginning you need to
press the button but that was fixed as
well so it's a project that is evolving
and they're adding features to it to
make it more comparable to like the real
echo dot I think the biggest difference
is it will take you quite some time to
set it up the normal echo dot you just
buy it and within a few minutes you have
it up and running and connect it to your
home network and this Raspberry Pi stuff
of course you need to assemble all the
hardware you need to setup everything so
it takes a bit more time but it's it's
fun to do so money-wise nowadays I think
buying one off the shelf is a better
option but the cool thing is with your
homebrew solution you can do anything
you can tweak anything so I can change
the software because it's open source
some people are concerned that the echo
dot is continuously listening Amazon
tells us yeah we
only less than a few after you say Alexa
but I mean who says they do that maybe
they listen all the time to it if you
use your own software you can of course
simply configure how it listens and what
it sends to the cloud and so it's a lot
more flexible you can do anything with
it
I won't advise this for most developers
probably will not end up really well and
so how do we do Alexa with home
automation I first simply show a movie
of it because it is a bit hard to bring
some home automation to a conference if
you have to fly so my colleague actually
made a movie about it and so what you
see here is he's using the Sun screen or
is using Alexa basically to control the
Sun screen I've wait a little moment we
can see that it's going down so here you
see how the home that he previously
already automated before Alexa was even
there we'd open up which I will talk
about later is now connected to Alexa so
it doesn't use a stab letour smartphone
anymore he can just control the home
with his voice so the lights temperature
sound he could control basically
anything within its own so now you see
all the lights going on okay you
probably get the idea and to do that we
use open hop somebody already using open
up here a cool
few people so it's a java application
basically that allows you to easily
create a central dashboard for all your
home automation stuff I mean if you have
stuff from Philips and from other
vendors and you do that on your
smartphone you probably end up with like
30 different applications to control
everything individually we open up you
can integrate everything within one
application and make it look more or
less like this it's in Dutch but I think
you get the idea here you can see how
the lights are controlled at
temperatures control volume etc and that
works quite easily what is happening is
we can create
items we can send commands to it to it
or turn it on or off or maybe put on the
lights at a certain percentage and and
we get status updates so and the nice
thing is you can make it that way that
for instance if I first put on the
lights with open up and then with my
smartphone I turn off the lights then we
can make sure that open up and the
interface shows that the lights are
turned off although it is controlled by
another device so that's really nice it
gives them nice overview that you can
use the version that's currently used is
still a bit yeah you call it it's it's
okay for developers if you have a bit of
developer experience you can set it up
quite easily so you define some rules
and and some other items and you can
connect everything to it and create a
nice dashboard for it but for the
average user without technical
background this is still a bit hard to
set up but luckily they are now working
on a version which is easier and more
drag-and-drop like instead of
configuring and coding everything so to
give a small example of how it works
I brought a smart plug which is
basically the thing over here and the
smart plug basically controls whether
there is any power going through it or
power as being shut off so here my
laptop which is connected with this
cable receives power and here it doesn't
receive any power so if I say wait I
should close my presentation now you can
see at the bottom this is a my laptop is
charging and now if I now say Alexa
Alexa trigger switch off sending that to
it now we see it is it stopped charging
it's not getting any power anymore Alexa
trigger switch on sending that to IFFT
and it's on again and to do that I made
use of f anybody else use it here some
more hands so if this basically a
service that enables you to a couple two
things to each other so I can say if
Alexa if I say Alexa no don't listen
ever say Alexa sent me an email or what
I built was Alexa add this to my to do
list and then with EFT I would receive
an email with all the items on my to-do
list
so I couple Alexa to the email action
and it looks like this it's simply a
website which you can use and here so if
I say trigger switch off then send the
command I should see some more details
so the phrase we have to specify what
we're saying in this case switch off and
then a command is sent to open up which
basically switches of that item so there
is a coupling between Alexa am i open up
instance at this point in time and I can
also so this is my really simple open
off instance and if I now say Alexa
Alexa Alexa ignoring me it's quite
annoying Alexa trigger switch on no
trigger you missed it was already on
Alexa trigger switch off sending that to
IFFT
so here we see that the interface is
also updated when I use Alexa it nicely
shows that the switch is off and I can
simply enable it without using Alexa so
you're not completely you don't need a
lecture basically you can still do it
through the web interface but you can
also use Alexa for it don't listen to me
so that's basically how it works I
already show this and in a bit more
detail it works like this so we have the
Alexa or the echo dot it goes to the
cloud where the Alexis stuff is running
then it goes to if it goes to a my open
app instance which is also running in
the cloud and then it goes to the open
up running on the Raspberry Pi which is
over here and then basically the
switches either turned on or off and as
you saw it's almost real-time even while
we're here at Beijing Network and
everything is connected to each other
it still works basically real-time and
and that's quite nice considering that
we're using all these different vendors
and services from the cloud at demo we
already had that so I used it to
basically add functionality to Alexa and
but you can also create skills and
skills is basically a name for small
application which you can use with Alexa
to add extra functionality and there are
a lot of skills available already and
you can compare these skills to apps on
your smartphone so you can simply
install them and by that get extra
functionality and functionality you can
mean basically anything I mean there are
even skills that allow you to order a
pizza by basically just saying Alexa
order my pepperoni pizza or whatever you
want and then I'll actually
automatically order it there are two
type of skills custom skills or
smart-home skills I use the custom skill
and in the rest of the presentation and
how does it work then if we say a phrase
to Alexa like Alexa ask or tell doesn't
matter which one first skill hello then
first skill is the implication name of
the skill so by that
Alexa can figure out what skill to call
and hello is the utterance so basically
the skill will process hello and do
something with it and these are maps all
the the utterances are mapped to in
tense and to show you how that works
it's probably better to just show some
code so what I what we see here is that
I have a my first intent and that's
hello
so hello was the utterance that we used
and I could say that to my skill so here
we see again that there's only one
intent and that's the my first intent
and then when we look at the code
basically that there is some code that
you can override so we implement the
speech lit here which is stuff from
Amazon and then you can simply implement
a few of the methods that are being
provided to you and most important part
is here where we can say okay if it's
something from this intent then call
this method and in the method I can then
do the logic that I want to do so I can
say that hello and hi and good morning
and all those words which is basically
the same that they all map to the hello
intent and then if somebody says hello I
can return hello and the name of the
person or whatever I want to do so
intent is basically a collection of
different utterances and the collection
can be one as well now as seed
so how do you create these skills Amazon
tries to push you to AWS lambda2 deploy
them AWS lambda is basically for server
less computing and you can simply upload
your jar if it's a java application or
if it's a JavaScript application you can
even type it in the browser and then it
is basically run and you pay per request
and per computing power you no longer
pay for an instance in the cloud which
you don't use for a large part of the
year you just pay for the usage and
which is typically useful if you have
applications for instance in a bank
there is a lot of load after each pay
date or after Christmas or just before
Christmas the rest of the year there's
not a lot load on the servers but they
have the same hardware for the entire
year so they pay a lot more to handle
those peak moments if you use a lot dos
Amazon will scale them automatically for
you if there is more usage to them so
it's a quite nice way of working you
don't have to worry anymore about
scaling and stuff like that and you can
program them in lots of different
languages but the fun thing is you don't
need to use AWS lambda you can also
create a web service which you run on
your laptop or maybe in some other cloud
environment and simply use that to
create a new skill but I focus on AWS
lambda cuz I quite like it I never
worked with it before so I thought it's
a good reason to start experimenting
with it and it works quite well what you
do is you pick up the jar you go to the
website from AWS lambda the AWS console
and you can just upload the jar file and
then from Alexa through the developer
portal I go to my custom skill and that
works quite well okay show you how that
works
and so if I create a laptop function I
can simply say I want a blank function
it will be called from the Alexa skills
kit and now I can say ok it's a Java of
course we don't want all kinds of freaky
JavaScript
and I can upload my artifacts and then
it will be deployed automatically so
this this works perfectly but of course
if you do like continuous delivery and
stay you do mall modification to your
app when you have to go to the website
every time and upload the artifact it's
not really working professional it's a
bit hacky so there are some better ways
to do that I will show you how in a
moment oh wait first one other thing and
if you deploy a skill like a jar file or
a java application in AWS lambda then
it's simply a piece of code and to make
sure that you can use it from your Alexa
you need to enable it and the Alexa
portal will show that in a minute as
well but then you can use the skill and
the skill basically then uses your AWS
lambda application to execute whatever
you want but the tricky thing is if you
don't do anything security wise then
everybody can access your AWS lambda and
as you have to pay for requests then you
get a bill which will cost you quite
some money so it is good that to have a
moment to look at that so I use this
this is really simple then there's no
security everybody can access my stuff
really convenient but it can cost you a
lot of money but with quite a simple
setting you can make sure that it is
secured by using the ID of the Alexa
skill so then the idea of the skill that
you created needs to be supplied when
you call AWS lambda and otherwise it
will not do anything so this is all yet
still it's nice but not really
professional development so we try to
improve on that and actually there was
already a maven plug-in to deploy your
maven artifacts to AWS lambda and that's
really convenient because then yeah you
can use your current maven project do a
bit of configuration and deploy it
however it's a bit more difficult than
with just uploading the jar file you
need to do some extra things
you need to create a bucket and s3
bucket which is basically storage in the
AWS cloud and you actually upload the
jar file to the s3 bucket and then later
a lambda function is created from it and
to be able to do that you also need some
security rules or actually one security
ro and then you're good to go and good
thing is this is a one time step and
this is also one time step so you
configure it at once and then you just
run maven every time and your artifacts
are being deployed automatically so
let's see if we can deploy something
we're now in London and if I now say
deploy hopefully it will deploy
everything so deploy basically what it
does is I provide some access keys to
the AWS so that it can upload everything
for me and then we're good to go of
course I didn't use this file there is
another file where my credentials are
put in but I don't show them to you and
of course not so let's see how far are
we
we're uploading the skill so let's see
if we can create already something so I
already showed you that to use your
laptop function you also need to create
a skill and that lacks our developer
portal and that's what I will do now
first if it's working
yep so we need to provide some some
names and some configuration so this is
basically my third skill the invocation
name so the name for the skill if I want
to call it I simply call it third I
think fancy over here and let's see
where are we I think I click Next but ok
we have to specify the intense
so here I have a my first intent I was
lazy I didn't change it to my third
intent but you probably I get the idea
and this is basically used to see how
Alexa can process your request and route
them to your skill and I also need the
utterance there's only one so that's
easy that's also configured and now I
have to specify where my skill is
running and to do that I need the idea
and should be in my lot by now it's over
here
don't quickly use it and next and copy
place the wrong thing apparently
let's see because it's also deployed in
AWS lambda so we should be able to see
it over here now as well so in AWS
lambda I can have a look at the
different functions that I have and I
should have a third skill yes so this is
the third skill and I see the a run over
here as well so I can use this one let's
see if that works better we don't care
about the rest Alexa Alexa asked third
to say hello
hmm I don't know that one of course and
a demo something has to go wrong Alexa
tell first I don't know
stop Alexa stop hello from my first
skill yeah but that wasn't the one I
wanted to try Alexa asked third to say
hello Alexa asked third to say hello
hello from London so that's nice my
stuff is deployed first time it takes a
little while it has to warm up the
application or something like that ever
ask it a second time Alexa ask third to
say hello hello from London so now it's
immediately basically first time it
takes a little while and then it's it's
good to go so you see that with just a
little bit of configuration and a little
bit of code so this and this is all the
code that we need we're good to go
and the most important important part of
the code is this so here we say what the
response is and I'm simply gave giving a
hard-coded requests and responses but
you can also say then disable it for a
minute
Alexa give me number 3 or something like
that and then you can parse the tree
from it and use that in your application
logic so it's not that you have to ask
it fixed stuff you can also customize
anything with it and and what we see
here is I create a card and on the card
I said normal response and actually when
we look in the al-aksa application so
this is an application you can also run
on your smart phone or you can simply go
to this URL it will show you what you
have asked Alexa and how it has
responded so probably also see here is
my switch off command so my complete
history of commands is visible here and
then you have you can see all the
information about it basically so that's
what cart part of the code is used for
so this part you don't need to specify
it you can simply say ok I'm not
interested in the information in the web
interface I don't need any cards just
give me a response and this is the part
which will give you the response so it's
only a few lines of code basically
because the stuff over here
it's simply figuring out what the intent
is and that's it you can make it much
more advanced so you can also do a
dialog like
Alexa I want to start a session with you
and then it will start up a session and
you don't have to say the name of the
skill every time now when I call my
skill I have to say asked earth to say
hello I'll stir this after that but if
you're in a session you don't have to
say asked earth because it already knows
you're in the third skill and so you can
simply say ok say hello or something
like that so this is really simple
example really quickly to build and get
started but you can do really advanced
stuff with it if you want the demo we
actually already had that I created a
small github project which includes the
amazing plugins so with that you can
easily upload your own skills to AWS
lambda and and this is official
repository with examples of Alexa skills
written in Java so there are a lot more
advanced examples in it as well but they
didn't use any maven integration here so
you manually have to upload your
artifacts so that's the reason I created
a simple repository for it um see people
taking pictures so I'll wait for a
minute
funny thing is I mean I've used EFT to
connect Alexa to open up but with the
newest open up there is also a skill
available so you can just install the
skill and you don't need to use Alexa or
sorry you don't need to use EFT anymore
so preferably if you're looking at Alexa
you're like ok I need this functionality
the first thing where you should look is
is rescale available that I can use then
I would prefer I would advise to use
that skill if it's not available then
see if you can use EFT or another
service to couple the things that you
need and if that doesn't work either
then it's probably best to start
creating your own skill and or if you
just want to have fun of course you can
create a skill for anything you want but
if there is already one available to
save you a lot of time so lots of
positive
about election are there are also some
disadvantages and it's still bit growing
up so some stuff isn't working as well
as I thought and for instance the region
I mean you're lucky to be in London you
can buy a laksa here or the echo dot I'm
from the Netherlands I can buy them I
need to ship them through a third-party
broker to get them in the Netherlands
and then there's no support I cannot
enter my home address so if I ask what's
the weather I get the weather of a city
in the US because it was a US model and
I cannot configure it to my own local
address so I missed part of the
functionality I when I want to ask for
the weather now I have to say okay
what's the weather in Amsterdam or
whatever town you're living in and there
are other features like you can use it
use alexa to ask how much traffic is
there between my home and my work but i
cannot enter my home so it's a bit
difficult if you're not one of the
preferred countries that amazon
officially support supports and it's
getting better because first it was only
available in the US now it's also
available in the UK and in germany so
it's getting better but and it's a bit
unfortunate for the countries that miss
out at the moment if you have a bit of
accent and it's difficult you're simply
ignored nowadays we're all used to
Google so we simply put in something in
Google some phrase which has all kinds
of errors and mistakes in it and Google
will simply give you the correct result
and some other results as well and Alexa
doesn't give you like other results you
either say it correct and she
understands it and will respond to it or
she will ignore you
so that's sometimes a bit harder and and
there are some dark clouds for for
instance privacy I mean everything I say
to Alex I'd upload it to the cloud and
available for everyone so that's a bit
of yep some people are less amused by
that so it's something you have to
consider for yourself and also like
security wise alex has coupled to my
account with my credit card from Amazon
and everybody can use it
doesn't do anything with your voice so
it can distinguish between my voice and
my wife's voice or my daughter's voice
and there is some functionality for
instance to order the lost pizza again
by simply saying Alexa or the lost pizza
again so if my daughter figures out how
to do that and she says that 10 times or
100 times I end up with a big bill and a
lot of pizza and and so that's really
something which you should be aware of
it's really nice and convenient that
it's integrated with your credit card
and with all the Amazon stuff but yeah
you can get massive with that locally
there also some advantages it's new it's
cool of course but it's also really
useful you can do lots of good things
with it and the colleague of mine who
used it at home for his home automation
at first his girlfriends are like what
do we have to do with that all the
Technic stuff I don't like it get it out
of my house I don't want it and I think
he had it for two weeks or even less and
then he returned it to me and he told me
that his girlfriend was upset that it
got away she wanted one herself so you
really quickly get used to it and it's
really easy you no longer need your
smartphone for all kinds of tasks you
simply shout through your house and
things happen and so I think it in one
way it will mean the end of the
smartphone maybe not for all
applications but lots of things that
we're currently doing with a smartphone
are easier with a voice recognition such
as the echo dot but yeah Google Apple
they all come with the same range of
products basically but what I really
liked about the Amazon part is they open
source a lot of the stuff and it's
really easy to build your own things in
either the AWS lambda functions or you
host your own service or you build your
own one with a Raspberry Pi so they're
they're really open you can do with it
what you want I believe in a new Mac PI
magazine they even released a kit for
home usage where you can also build your
own echo dot for a few bucks so if you
want to build yourself
you can also see if you can get hold of
the magazine for a few bucks so yeah
it's really easy to integrate my
colleague spent I don't know an hour or
something like that to connect it to its
open health engines at home and could
then control everything in home with
Alexa instead of a smartphone so it's if
you already have some stuff going on
which is already connected it's easy to
integrate it with Alexa yeah I already
told you it's something you get used to
really quickly and I think it's a lot of
fun I mean playing with AWS lambda it's
really nice the first I don't know how
many requests are free so if you do it
for home usage you probably won't have
to pay anything for it and it works
really nice it's simply uploading some
jar file and you don't have to care
about anything like scaling or whatever
and the fun thing is that you can even
say Amazon if you like my skill you can
publish it in the store so then your
skill will become an official skill and
everybody can use it so there are lots
of options over there there so that was
a really quick introduction to Alexa and
how you can do fun stuff with Java in
relation to Alexa so any questions about
that
yeah so the question is if you use the
open hop skill do you have to say Alexa
open up blah blah blah
yes for every skill that you have you
have the trigger word basically or the
invocation name you need to say that to
enable that skill I don't know if there
is a way around that if you could
integrate it more tightly I yeah I use
trigger proof so the question is did you
use the trigger word to activate the
power plug yes I did yeah so you always
have some word that you need to tell so
that Alexa now
what it has to do to respond to your
question yes yeah exactly yet so the
question is would Phillips you you can
simply say turn on the lights
yet now yeah probably they have a
special deal or something like that so
maybe you can create skills without
saying the word but then it will get
confusing because if two skills can
respond to it you don't know which one
to choose
so it's my skills I've seen they have
the application name but I think it's
possible to create them without it
because there is some functionality
available from other parties yeah yeah
the question is could you use Alexa as
an input device for OPC and then you
mean that I no longer want to type my
code I simply talk to Alexa and I say
okay indent this line with two spaces
and three tabs and yeah of course you
could do anything basically with it so I
can record all input you're saying in
the application and then redirect that
to a file or something like that so the
Java program that you saw you can use
any Java framework or library that you
want inside it so you can store stuff in
files or make Network calls or whatever
you want basically yeah so everything
you could do in Java you can do it with
Alexa that's basically the case yeah yes
yes so the question is how do you see it
expound in the future I think it's being
integrated now in lots of devices and
it's actually a good question because I
forgot something so this is a tablet
from Amazon as well and that also has
Alexa on it I have to press a button
here because they want to minimize the
power consumption ask tester to test so
I got them to my second skill see you
next time
so basically what you saw here was Alex
are running on my tablet and it is
besting the skill that is running on my
echo dot because with things like this
testing is a bit hard you can of course
unit test it but you don't know if it
works with the implication name and all
the configuration in the cloud so
basically you need to test the real
application and you can do that by
letting two Alexa devices talk to each
other and that's what I forgot to come
back to your question it's integrated in
almost anything now so they integrate it
in tablets but also and they have some
sort of chrome costing and they call it
a fire TV which you can use to watch
YouTube or whatever you want that's also
now powered by Alexa I think they will
enable it in almost any device what they
will ever sell and of course for them
it's simply a business model that they
hope that you buy more stuff from Amazon
and by using this stuff you can easily
say like Alexa don't react Alexa ordered
this from Amazon and then it it can send
the stuff to you so it's really
convenient for them to sell stuff and in
general I see voice recognition
replacing most of the things we're doing
with smartphones now so why would we
have a smart phone well we could just
talk to a device that's always listening
if I want to call someone and I can
simply Alexa call that person and start
talking that's much easier than having
to pick up your phone and say ok call
that person
and so I think it will replace
smartphones in a large area yeah yes
yeah the question is how about electron
gaming you can do some games on it so
there are some games created for Alexa
mostly basic games and I heard from
yourself that you use it to activate
some games and stuff like that so you
could maybe use it to retrieve
statistics while you're playing or
information about your own opponent or
something like that I forgot the name
there there is one or two larger games
that have some support for it as well
but I can't remember the name of it I
think it can help you because then you
can ask for extra information and it's
just spoken to you instead of having to
go to an extra screen and losing focus
on the game
so I think there are some areas there
which are useful but on the other hand
it will be difficult for game developers
because they have to support Alexa then
and probably the stuff from Google the
stuff from Apple so I don't know how far
that will evolve or if there maybe will
become some kind of a standard which all
the vendors use but that's a bit far in
the future I think so another hand yeah
so the question is how can i integrate
Alexa would open hop you have to open it
up for the outside world because there
is a call coming in and normally or the
advice way is to use my open up which is
a cloud service and you couple them I
open up to your local open up instance
and then Alexa is basically talking to
the my open up cloud environment and
then the requests are routed fir so it
is a potential security risk because
you're putting some stuff on the
internet but I think you can secure some
stuff there as well yeah does that
answer the question ok nice and thank
you all of you have any questions later
- feel free to just ask them Anna have a
good day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
