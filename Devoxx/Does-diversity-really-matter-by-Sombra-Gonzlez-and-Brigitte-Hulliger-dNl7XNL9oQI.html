without any without demo failures no
guys almost no guys non architecture and
without any methodology related topic
does the relativity matter thank you for
coming and enjoy the next few minutes
along our visual journey through
diversity let's start with some
questions how many of you work in a work
with women in a technical position oh
great when was the last time you've been
in a meeting with more than two women
some some of you have been so lucky you
so somewhere and I we both are women in
tech with several years of experience
for this talk we try to make a
retrospective of our last year's in IT
not everything has been as easy as you
may think but it's not that difficult
either having been part of the gender
diverse gender minority for years now
the question still is does diversity
really matters or shall we just forget
about this topic and back accepted the
way it has been anyway we like to share
with you guys some of our favorite
stories and anecdotes Lee came along but
remember all names and kept and
characters are fixes all similarities
with reality are completely intentional
though for example imagine you know a
woman who has been working in IT for 15
years just imagine let's call her Sarah
completely fictional name let's go back
to the beginning of her career when she
considered working in IT once upon a
time Sarah came across her first tough
business decision
had to choose a career path I love math
and figures but i'm not a nerd or a
gamer and i'm not that good a guy
additionally all my girlfriend's ink and
weird and isn't it a dead-end job anyway
contrary to all external advisors she
decided to give it a try anyway on the
very first day of university Sarah
started hearing voices look there's a
girl she must be in the wrong room I bet
you won't last more than two weeks what
is she doing there again contrary to all
expectations Sarah got through
University and to even made some friends
what did you do after university let's
find a job or a non-paid scholarship or
an unpaid apprenticeship or something
else not paid it's not that there are
not plenty of open positions out there
but finding one not searching for ninjas
or geeks has taken a while after finding
the position getting the job done was
not that hard after all what company can
afford not having a woman on a team
right Sarah was aware of that fact so he
was prepared to work a hundred and fifty
percent to prove herself and guess what
she actually did it after a few years
being ignored in all promotion rounds
she saw herself good enough for the next
level in her career so she asked for a
promotion be aware that opposite her
male colleagues she had to ask for
promotion in order to get one
genting chops every once in a while is
considered a good thing if you're
pursuing your dream but changing job as
a 32 year old woman is close to suicide
despite the fact that companies are not
supposed to ask the pregnancy question
it is usually sell the elephant in the
room where as a military career for men
is still considered normal don't you
want to start a framework what do you
think about inheritance after working
several years in cool projects and with
big clients Sarah did get pregnant she
did start the family and she did a toy a
maternity leave and after that guess
what she did come back after only four
months and the company was so
considerate with her situation at home
that he only got easy project without
responsibility because everybody knew
she would leave again anyway and even if
not she's a mother now she has other
things to do don't she some years later
Sarah came across another crossroads in
her career she got the first executive
opportunity she took the opportunity but
in you if it again be hard to be taken
seriously actually the easiest way would
be to become a man after all she must
there must be something wrong with her
she looks more like an assistant doesn t
as you can see Sarah's journey has been
hard maybe only comparable with that one
through motor carrying a heavy ring and
without any food but as we said that
everything has been so bad actually we
haven't been in order in our lives but
our unicorn moments have seen his curse
let's imagine as hopefully not so far in
the future world where everything is
possible unicorn exists and a jelly tea
actually works let's get back to those
days with Charles Hodge about the
possibility of a technical career
questions about boy
gals job didn't even came to her mind
it's only a matter of passion without
any stereotype are you still there this
is some unicorns in the back let's go on
imagine we are back to university days
thursday at university there are almost
the same number of girls and boys in the
class yet like in a party where
everybody wants to stay and even
professors are equal divided between men
and women the best you're absent is not
immediately detected just because of
your gender you're not longer the girl
of the class the after enjoying a few
highly interesting and rewarding years
at University Sarah started her job
search there are so many appealing
opportunities that he had a really hard
time just to thin and after one elite
interviews I mean now Human Resources
women technical women it was even harder
once you started in her new position
honey her new place in a team was not
even considered challenge she was there
because of her skills starting
automation since it fits so perfectly in
her team and she had no pressure proving
health herself continuously she could
concentrating her skills and duties from
day one therefore she got considered for
a promotion in the first round nobody
else why everybody instead was asking
why not and I think Mordor tangi job
every once in a while is still
considered a girlfriend in this rainbow
unica world but opposite to Mordor there
are only unique earth there are no
elephants in the room no questions about
family planning no awkward pregnancy
questions no forecast for your next ten
years are required only your skills and
your experience are considered yes for
men furthermore the maternity and
paternity leave is equal to men and
women's that means those appendix lives
in different for the reason are now
considered a professional disadvantage
and after please more than just four
months maternity leave she deserves to
leave her daughter with his father and
do you know there are already rainbow
countries in Europe where you can search
your maternity leave with your partner
unbelievable and after had time out she
managed to work part-time during job
with somebody in the company a different
personal situation but same
responsibilities nobody asked her if she
would like to work less because
flexibility is over present ISM enough
to use working hard continuous education
being a working mom see we can achieve
double play whatever officer that's all
there is no questions no pain no we're
looks just normal and remember bossy is
the new sexy so if you have seen Sarah's
journey it's been a little bit more
enjoyable that the murder the tss fix
use of the one through model let's
forget about all those evil orcs and
colorful unicorns and let's take it a
little bit more serious now you have
seen two different walls of women in i.t
none of that corresponds to reality
hundred percent but they're not pure
fiction either for example son of the
statements from the modern world above
are based on our two experiences let's
take a look to some numbers we like
marks summit in the last few years to
having published many reports and
articles about this topic a quick
outline from them we haven't made any
big progress in this last decade
let's start with a relevant factor the
percentage of computer computing
occupations held by women has been
declining since the 90s means we have an
improve at all even words there are
fewer women in tech since fostering the
interest in technology and science
earned early age is absolutely necessary
it'll so many girls are interested in
STEM fields science technology
engineering and mathematics few women
complete bachelor or master in this
field say the number seventy-four
percent of golfers interest in those
fields but only 18 of the undergraduate
computer science degrees and 26 of
computer jobs are held by women what
that means for the service well we are
missing a lot of women interested in
those fields in between but once you get
a job you need a suitable environment to
develop your career sailing as a rudder
Abby's is hard really hard not everybody
will Holland lon in that situation that
sees numbers thirty percent of women in
private sector IT jobs said they felt
extremely isolated at work and therefore
return soon is not as good as you may
expect many women leave their career in
i.t soon quit rate is more than twice
like around forty percent for women for
men and the relevant note women are not
exceeding their careers in ninety
Premier League because of family
concerns so if we take us reference
those previous extreme loads like mortar
on your left and rainbow unicorn the
right based on our experiences and the
numbers we are so where are we now are
we suffering mortar or enjoying the
rainbow unica well well I could say it
could be worse but we still has a lot to
accomplish we often hear parity is not a
man's problem women are just not
interested in tech we disagree to a
certain point after all we chose to take
worked ourselves and we strongly believe
that it is absolutely important to
include all kind of people in the
development of our future independent of
gender age colored culture and religion
although the diversity issue has been
worked on for several decades now it is
still among us we are all part of the
problem and two solutions but how can we
foster diversity as an individual be
aware of unconscious biases we all grew
up with and avoid to perpetuate them
especially as a woman in IT make your
work and your passion visible share role
models and participate initiatives about
this topic of the company do not only
think about quotas and positive
discrimination create a safe and
suitable environment work environment
for all your employees giving equal
opportunities you can also support
organizations and projects that foster
diversity for example girls who code
chango girls rails girls and so long as
a government support education
initiatives and to avoid biases develop
specific programs to foster the interest
of both girls and boys in technology and
science at wish I checked the Swiss
network for women in tech and innovation
we care about diversity and we encourage
you all of you to join us and at one of
our regular events and Zurich and Bernie
you can find out more more information
about reshape tech online on reshape top
tech or follow us on Twitter
our handle is a t-shaped tech we are
sombra and Bridget both women in tech
who travelled motor and the unicorn
world and experienced both motor and
unicorn moments as we said in the
beginning not everything is easy as you
may think but it's not that difficult
either some guy is working as a software
engineer and there is a multi tasking
mom I am a former software engineer and
current co-founder of a small small
startup based in Bern furthermore we
both are members of reshape tech burn
and we want to increase visibility for
diversity in tech because in our opinion
diversity really does matter thank you
very much for coming and listening to
our talk if you have any questions now's
the time
thank you thank you for both of you to
foreign visa so I'm taking revenge
Reggie phone book i preciate you talk I
have more big fittings and number about
some of your points but maybe we shall
discuss afterwards and I have a
practical question for you we organizing
the conference in Geneva it's smaller
than Hancock saying maybe 200,000 we we
received last year something like 80 or
100 abstract of others they were known
for more and we are thriving about
trying to find ways to get more to do
push up to change the lines and so on
yes okay and we don't know how to do it
shows maybe a couple of emails when girl
get no answer and frankly we have we
don't know what to do it's a really good
question and actually we are working on
a 2-1 is initiative we took just at our
last event of we created an open stage
for for women who want you can practice
speaking in front of people I think
speaking in front of people is still
pretty hard for all all of us but women
are especially shy probably so what we
try to do is just give them the
opportunity to have a practice area and
to do that but maybe you can exchange
contacts so if you ask if you want to
have a contact for for next time but
conference so we can share it on our
network too I thank you very much for
this presentation and follow what you
said women maybe perhaps a bit more shy
to share so yourself is great at you now
you are here in front of everybody else
on the stage but another kind of event
and also work our own conferences where
everybody's on this stage and everybody
can Sharon and we got separated here in
Switzerland and there are any other
events like this one that can actually
help we got an international conference
called Jake Crete where everybody can
share that information is the same thing
is the Sun on conference and this kind
of event will also help you in the
geneva area well I mean about what did
ya'll said one of the fences three men
you can see in the Cyrus way is like as
young girls we are also already said
that do you don't have to stand up to
don't have to be in front of the people
you have to yes beyond abacus you have
to be a good girl and actually you grow
up with those things in your head and to
stand up and say even in the meeting or
whatever aight that is what i think or
luke and half a proposition they want to
do it it's really difficult and we have
to work with maybe does techniques or
those i mean like kind of conference
make this easier for women yes to to
trust themselves I mean and to say yeah
it's not that difficult i mean everyone
can do it it's not like men stuff with
women stuff everyone can do it so we're
out of time actually much and we're
going to be better you know again do you
cut it all to want the pretty much thank
you thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
