already because I'm clearly not okay it
always feels a little bit weird for me
to me to be at that kind of you know IT
/ web / yeah / people wearing ties
conferences it felt weird because I come
from the video game industry and among
you I feel different
so please not hate me because even if we
are not from the same world I still love
you anyway please don't throw things at
me anyway the more I come to that kind
of conferences the more I discover
people like you and I realized that that
we have a lot of common passions we love
programming we love fancy computer
science stuff and it's funny because at
one point in a time we all had the
opportunity to become rock stars and to
make very cool things and you decided to
have a boring job and it feels really
weird to me because I made the other
choice and it it's clearly not the good
one but I made the other choice and when
I started making video games I
discovered that I had absolutely no clue
on what a video game is or how to build
one and then I understood that we both
you and us have a pretty force idea of
what the other is doing and you have
false IDs on what the video game
industry is and we have a lot of false
IDs maybe on what you guys are doing in
your industry and we don't have someone
to create a bridge between our two
worlds because even if we live in
different worlds they are not very far
from one from from
and I think we should talk about that
and so please don't throw things at me
because I will talk about you and I will
talk home about how as video game
developers see you
LT developers please don't hate me it's
just for you to understand where we are
going and what video game is and this is
you and you are pretty unsung and that's
a good point because a lot of you in the
room not everybody but a lot of you in
the room it's pretty unsung and yeah
this is you you are kind of happy with
your life I guess and you have a great
suit anyway and to us you don't reach 30
years old not because you died but only
because your goal is to become a manager
if you are not manager at 30 you are
kind of a loser and it's sad really um
it's probably not true but it's what we
think and you want to be a manager so
you develop a very rare disease forcing
you to wear size and fancy suit and it's
weird really even if some of you try to
be cool today I know when you are at
work you wear ties I know it anyway also
you have fancy clothes but you write
with dead languages it's I'm sure and
don't laugh at this because I know a lot
of you are still doing Java and we can't
really laughs when we sorry sorry anyway
and all these dead languages to do what
to do I can think software I don't know
why are you doing that I don't know it's
it's weird enough and I know it's false
and I know I know these are false IDs
and and bias and I know that because now
I know you but it's how you are seen
in the video game industry and yes it is
sad but if we have a false ID of what
the IT world is you have a false idea of
the video game industry and and we also
you imagine us differently to like this
is us ok maybe you don't see the
difference with the previous image but
so I can show you yeah not a lot of
difference
I really maybe the chance so although a
penis I don't know anyway it's how you
see us and it's look at me anyway and to
you we don't leave after 40 years old
especially because we die before and you
think that we play all day long
and it's not completely false but we'll
go home that later
we also have a weird disease the disease
forcing us to wear the clothes we had
when we were 15 we do that
and you try to do that also we are
creative a lot of creativity creativity
everywhere
we only work for children because only
only kids buy games it's it's it's a
fact anyway we also work only six months
a year because we are lazy bastards and
it's also a fact and and when you sell a
game at $50.00 and in you sell 1 million
units you are bloody rich so let's get
back at this because it's not completely
true it's not completely false we don't
go over 30 years old and it's true
because the not because of the
creativity we don't do that too much
anyway
because it comes a time where you have
responsibilities and you won't have kids
and buy a house and maybe a dog and a
cool life and it's very difficult to
make video games
and have responsibilities because in a
lot of countries it's not well paid in
France for example it's if you work in
the computer science if you do a team or
a video game the difference in salary is
so huge that people from the idea don't
believe me when I say how much I earned
when i was in working on on Triple A
games and for a fact because when I
started working I I worked something
like three months in a ite company and
it was funny and anyway I work free
month in that company and the people
there when I applied didn't believe me
when I said how much I heard back then
and it's very difficult to get hold and
have responsibilities when when you when
you are part of the video game industry
and yes we play all day long and it's a
fact but we play all day long the same
game so when you develop a game and it
takes something like three years to
develop you are getting pretty good at
this game but it's not fun and you don't
want to play the same game eight hours a
day during three years
trust me - the clothes
it's almost true cocaine never don't do
that even if you are part of the
marketing team it's too late for you but
please don't do that it's not good for
you and remember that I love you so
please undo that we work for children in
fact it's false because as you may know
everybody play video game and you can
find video games for adults and grownups
and and and you add games for almost
everyone and we work six months a year
it's only because we tend to announce
game six months or a year before the
release because you don't want to have
your IDs stolen by the other developers
so you you try to announce your game
when it's almost over and it happens to
be a six month or your before the
release and I don't know why people tend
to believe that because it's announced
six months before it takes six months to
make a game and it's completely stupid
but people anyway and of course it's
like for your companies when you sold a
lot of Units it's the people of the
marketing get all the money to buy
creativity anyway
of course the publishers and and the
people on top of the of the food chain
always get all the money and not
necessarily the developers any it puts
us in a versus mode when you when we
just want to be in a co-op mode
I draw hot because I love you and you
have to understand what is a video game
and first of all it's not a product most
of you are probably working on a
products or service or something like
that and we don't do products we do
special thing I don't know what it is
exactly but it's something that players
want to have for themselves only and
it's weird because when you guys are
developing I don't know accounting
software anything it's pretty rare that
people feel insulted if you put some
bugs in your software and you don't have
people complaining about I don't know
how much they were expecting your
software and how disappointed they are
it's pretty rare and it happens all the
time with video games because people
love video games and they don't want it
to be a classic software and I think
it's not one but it's very difficult
it's clearly not product it's probably a
media some people try to think like it's
hard it's something like it's a debate
that we can have but it's clearly not
product it makes a lot of difference
between our two worlds and if you take
Triple A games for
against that you probably know like GTA
or assassin's creed this game are not
built like a product it takes five years
of development for every game so it
happens that every company for example
the company behind Dishonored
it's called Afghan and yeah I said it in
French and they only work on this road
when they work on Dishonored we don't
work on several project at a time so if
you work five years in a row on a game
you only do that and it's funny because
when you develop a game you can't talk
about it before it is announced so if
you are here at the very beginning of
the of the development you have to wait
four years and a half before being able
to update your status and say hey I
worked on that and it's very frustrating
and and it takes a lot of time to make a
video game and it takes also a lot of
people to make a video game it takes
something like two hundred people and
some games need require more than 1000
people and it's crazy if you take gta4
it for example it's something like ten
years of development with 1000 people
it's crazy and it's a lot more than it's
often a lot more than 50 million budget
and it's really because a lot of video
games don't reach the return on
investment and it's crazy because the
money making a game is so expensive it's
mainly C++ so I don't have to make joke
about Chara and we don't have direct
clients and this point is very peculiar
because when you guys have an idea and
you want to develop something a software
or service something you build it and no
one asks you to change anything probably
you will have a client coming and as
in you to develop something for him and
it will be his product so if he asks you
stupid things are stupid feature you
will tell him it's stupid you will say
I'm paying and you will develop it but
when the software will be a failure it
will be in the end of the clients when
you make a video game as it costs a lot
of money of course not all the
developers have 50 million dollars so
you need to ask someone to pay for the
development and here comes the big
publishers so they pay for the game and
at the very moment they have paid for
the game they can ask anything and the
problem is that they will ask to put
things to sell more and not to make a
better game and you will say ok I want I
think this is stupid and we should not
do that but he is paying anyway and in
the end the game will be probably filled
with stupid things but it will be your
name alongside the title so people will
believe that you made choices and stupid
ones and made a stupid game and in fact
it was just the guy paying you to do
that and it's very peculiar because you
come with your ID and your team and
someone else takes the decision and it
happens all the time in the video game
industry and when you see games filled
with bugs and made bad by huge companies
you can be sure that some of the
decisions didn't come from the
developers it's very very special but
the good point is that we do silly
things and ok someone else is asking us
to do something but at least we do it
crazy and I envy you for a lot of things
because I I saw developers here and and
some talks are very interesting on all
the fancy techniques and all the fancy
stuff you guys are doing that we don't
do and we
do for example we can't do unit testing
we don't do that and we should but we we
don't and there is a specific specific
reason for that we do regression all the
time
all the time because it's the heart of
the development of a video game of
course we don't go agile and we can't
test and deliver viable products why
would why don't we do that especially
because nobody knows what will be in the
game at the end of the development
because it's impossible to make a 5
years planning it's not possible and we
are in an industry as I told you it's
not a product so you develop a game
let's say a game about unicorns and and
and maybe ponies and and you develop
your game and it's cool and you have all
the features you want and you you have
the game ID and the the very image of
the game in your head and and someone
enters the room and say oh yesterday I
saw a great TV show it's called Game of
Thrones and there are a lot of dragons
in there
we should have dragons because people
want dragons yeah marketing guys anyway
at that very moment the guy asking you
for dragons clearly don't know it
doesn't know sorry what it implies to
put dragons in game because you will
have to design them you will have to
create 3d meshes you will have to
animate them you will have to create the
dialogue for them you will have to
integrate them in the game you will have
to create an artificial intelligence for
it for them and you will have to put
that in your game and with a stupid idea
like let's put dragons in our Pony game
you will probably add six months of work
to the team and as we are impacted
directly by all the other media the TV
shows that the cinema the books
everything we can't plan
plan in advance what will be in the game
for example when I joined Ubisoft in in
2009 and I quit three years after when I
joined the game they were pitching me is
was so different than the game that they
have released years after it's crazy the
only same thing in the game is that we
will have cars and that's it
I worked something like three years and
a half for them and I make a pretty
complicated system but interfaces and
stuff and I quit and then the game
evolved and the idea evolved and when
the game was released at 95% of what I
did wasn't in the game only because at
one point in time it's not because it
was filled of bugs and stupid but only
because at one point in time the game
didn't need this feature anymore because
we had changed dialogues and we had
changed some story and and probably some
visual rendering things I changed and we
needed to skip it and do something else
and we work in research and development
all the time always and you can't do
fancy unit testing on something you know
it won't be in the game and we don't
plan that and I know some of you will
try to convince me don't try it because
I cry when you do but we clearly can't
do that because it's video games and we
we don't have the same needs like you
even if we use the same techniques or
let's say let's talk about artificial
intelligence we use a lot of AI in in
video games but we don't use it like you
do because I don't know if you guys have
ever noticed that but in video games
it's probably the only field of computer
science using
I that doesn't try to reach a perfect
one all of you working with machine
learning and and I you are all trying to
reach perfectly because if you if you
build a self-driving car you ya need to
be sure that he won't kill anybody
because it's important I guess and we
don't do that because it's frustrating
it's just because of that if you build a
perfect AI you will end up with this and
this is nothin and nobody wants to play
against that and it reminds the it
reminds us that we are just bags of meat
and and we have very slow reflexes and
we come to things
while it can annihilate humanity and we
don't want to do that and it's easy to
see that on this shift because because
it's mesmerizing and it's a mechanical
and you have probably not listen what I
said during the past three minutes I
can't blame you I did it during three
hours preparing this talk anyway if you
apply that to videogames it looks like
that
it's going to be fast but later backflip
a shot this is no fun
we can't do that and even if we work
with artificial intelligence we don't
try to have the best one possible and
it's because we do things differently
and even if we are using the same tools
it's because we do things differently
that we can't apply all your fancy
techniques and all awesome stuff that
you guys use I will just change it
because you don't listen to me obviously
for example we very few video game
developers use get it's it's it's stupid
I do but I regret it every time that one
of my artists makes a binary file that I
can't merge
I did they do that all the time they
always try to create machines and they
always try to create PNG and want to
merge them and it's not possible and
that's why you have a lot of developers
still using subversion and we've gotta
bite off of branches that can't be merge
anyway so we can't use all your fancy
tools because we do things silly and yes
the video game I told you about that but
the video game is and never changing
beasts and you always have to think
differently because someone else came
with a crazy idea that is sometimes a
good idea but your code was clearly not
prepared to so great idea and you have
to adapt all the time and all your
techniques even agile and and and scram
and and and crazy things like that is
not prepared for what we do because we
do think sorry really um but there are
some things that we do better than you
and that's cool because we have to solve
problems you'd never imagine really
never and it comes from the fact that we
often we don't have the the ends on the
platform when a client comes and ask you
to do something or when you decide to
make a service or to make something you
can decide what will be the machine how
many memory the disks the OS the
language we can't do that if you want to
release a game on let's say console like
PlayStation 4 you will have to run
something on the PlayStation 4 you can't
ask people to add memory to the
PlayStation 4 it's you can ask but they
won't do that
but you can ask and it's cool and we
have to solve problems with the same
machine and the same box and it's very
interesting because if you if you see
the quality of the games launched with
the console and and the games made when
the console is shut down the gap is
incredible so even if we use the same
machine and the same computer we can
improve and find new techniques and new
things to get the most of it and it's
crazy because it makes us very prone to
try to give our best and not be as lazy
as we like to be and we forced to think
differently because yeah because some
sometimes someone arrived with a crazy
dragon ID and it was not planned and we
don't know how to do that and we have to
think on how to implement it without
trashing all the game and starting from
scratch all again also we learn that
Fanning can be fun because let's face it
bugs bugs are boring always but bugs in
video games you know you know the yoga
yoga this one is cool
I'll sorry this one is yours not mine
anyway
sorry but making games teach you that
Fanning can be cool
of course we have stupid bugs like you
and we spend hours trying to find I
don't know a missing coma or something
like that but sometimes we have fun with
our bugs and I hope you guys do and I
hope guys you working in the banking
system making very important softwares
often with your bugs
I truly hope it forces us to be creative
always because creativity is at the very
core of our work and we I'm I'm truly
thinking that no one invents anything in
videogames at least not in game design
but you use some bricks and some BOTS
made by other ones and try to change
them just a bit and and and and probably
merge them to create a new game and to
create a new appeal and something like
that so we need to be creative because
we have the same tools and we fight on
the same platform so we have to be the
most creative possible and it's very
interesting and it's something that it's
probably the best part of our job
because when you see someone making the
exact same game and you know that your
game is better because you you have this
idea it's really great and also we know
how to guide people efficiently because
it's the core of our work if you give a
game to someone and and the player just
doesn't understand what he is supposed
to be you won't sell game and you don't
have to you have to explain people you
have to make them and
ten things without explaining and it's
very tricky but nobody tells you go
right I'll go left or you can jump yeah
oh of course you have tutorials and you
have button and and things like that but
in most of the game you don't need to
learn that because you already know oh
it's so obvious that you can learn
easily and it's very important and I
truly think that video game development
can bring a lot of things to you in the
IT when it comes to guiding people and
and explaining stuff without explaining
and this is why you should make video
games and because let's face it almost
everyone here at a moment in your life
you said are video games is they are so
cool I just want to make one but I don't
know how to make one don't lie to me
please even for one minute you all said
that yes you did
anyway you should make games because you
you know how to make games it's just
that nobody told you that before it's
easier than what you think I bet that's
what you do in your work every day is
way harder than making a video game
almost almost everything at least you
can make books too and it's pretty cool
and we share that same passion for for
books too but yeah it's easier than what
you think and a lot of people don't
think that there's a lot of math in of
course it's elves but I have to admit
and confess that I suck at math and I
made games for ten years now okay they
are pretty they are pretty pretty
 games but nobody buy them and
it's normal because I suck at math no
seriously no math is involved in video
games you can do great games without
knowing at math really and in fact
you can even make
game without knowing how to code and for
Java developers it's pretty cool I think
remember you promised to not throw
things at me thank you
yeah no code involved because you use
some tools like twine you can build up
stories interactive stories and create a
game a narrative one without having to
write any single lines of code and it's
pretty cool also you have powerful
engines available for free if you take
engines like unity 3d or unreal these
are free and you can make awesome games
with with them and it's really crazy
because I bet with your knowledge right
now of programming or computer science
or and just your logic right now you can
take one of these and with the awesome
support and community you can build a
game in less than one hour and I it will
be a shitty game sure and and most of
your first games will be shitty I have
to be honest with that but you can do it
and its really impressive and you should
give a try to this one and of course the
main reason why you should make games
it's because it's way more interesting
than your current job and ok it's
probably just a joke let me just show
you something remember now really and
it's not because it's it's really more
interesting or your it's not because
your work is boring or anything it's
just because it's different it's from
the same family because it's a software
development thing but it's different and
making different things will change your
mind forces you to think differently
forcing you to solve problems
differently with different tools and it
can improve a lot of things in your
everyday life really because it will
make you a better programmer and
better IT people wearing a cool tie and
a cool suit and it's cool really anyway
and you can also have fun with your
coworkers because making a game is cool
but making game with a lot of people
it's even more cool because then you
have multiple factors to create bugs and
it's very cool thing to add bugs in a
game now seriously when you try to
create a game if you do that with a lot
with other people and especially your
co-workers you will understand a lot of
things about their way to think and
their way to work and it can be very
interesting for you and for them to see
you with a new eye and not only in the
box of the usual everyday work and this
torture is almost over now I just have a
yeah I I tend to try to to to give
people some reading advice if you are
interesting in making video games this
one is about game design so you will
learn a lot of trick on how to
communicate with players without using
any word and it's a basic it's it's
really cool if you are more into
programming you have this series of
books it's very interesting you have
professional game developers and
sometimes legends writing for this small
articles tackling just a problem a
specific problem and you will learn for
example how to create a galaxy composed
of hundreds of stars all with the same
names and making this game available on
floppy disk
and okay we don't have this use anymore
that is crazy and and the trick is to
use random efficiently also if you are
not into programming are creating you
can read this it's the false fake true
story of the studio called Rockstar the
studio in charge of GTA 5 &amp;amp; 6 obviously
and with this book you will learn why
Rockstar is called rock star and it's
all about creativity for real this time
and for those who don't know how to read
you have movies because movie is a cool
indie game the movie will show you the
life of free independent team because we
have talked told about triple games but
small teams represented in this movie
and these teams are bloody rich so I
think they are successful enough to buy
creativity and it's very interesting
because you will see how hard it can be
to make a game but how hard it is to
release it and minecraft the story of
mojang I think everybody knows minecraft
because it has been sold for two billion
US dollar to Microsoft and it's the
story behind the game and the story of
the its creators and on YouTube
if you are broken don't want to buy for
a movie on YouTube you can find the
Double Fine adventure this guy is pretty
cool
Double Fine is the studio behind some of
these games beyond this game sorry and
it's this guy is a legend yeah I'm sorry
oh sorry yeah I don't have room for
monkey alone sorry anyway this guy is
pretty cool and and they have made a
video
during the production of one of the
latest game and I'm not totally agree
with them or how they do things but you
will see what happens behind the door of
video game studio and a real one trying
to make a cool thing and also you have
this channel on YouTube the guy is
talking about game design and it's
pretty interesting
I'm not to agree with everything but at
least it's also that a lot of very
interesting concept and and some things
that you don't necessarily think about
when you play the video games and now I
think it's your turn it's your turn to
make stupid things and and you should
make games really I I please try you
have tons of tools and you have the
knowledge and I swear that you will
learn something out of it and you shoot
me games don't let me be alone in this
room pretending I am the only one who
makes video games please thank you and
if you have questions and I hope you
them sorry if you have questions please
shoot only question you have questions
hi ha the question is what is my
favorite bird except the one that I did
I think Ubisoft is known for having
spectacular ones and especially in the
Assassin's Creed when you have you know
the the melting face you have only the
eyes and in the mouth of the character
and it's curious and I love this
one this one is pretty cool yep
you have the question is how much
cutting is left when you use engine like
unity or in oil and the answer is a lot
because even if the engine takes all the
physics rendering stuff you will have to
create the logic and to connect
everything together and you will have to
throw things at the right moment you
will have to understand the players
input and transform that into real
content and real things a lot of things
to do and it will abstract all the
boring stuff because you won't have to
create your own physic engine you won't
have to create your own sounds engine
you will you won't have to create your
rendering engine and it's pretty cool
because you will be able to only focus
on the game and at the end of the day I
think it's what matters as a question
don't do that sorry the question is what
should be advice - for people like you
to join the video game industry and
really don't do that it's you have a
great work a great job I'm sure and you
are earning money and money is important
in life if you want to buy food and food
is cool and that's why I'm here because
food is free and now seriously if you
want to join the video game industry
adjustment games prove people that you
can do games and you know what you are
talking about and it's not necessarily
awesome games or sell games just make
them and and and prove that you have the
basic knowledge needed to make a game
and it's not that complicated really and
you can make a game
on any platform even a web or something
like that and and it's just enough you
just have to prove that you know what
you're talking about
questions yeah please don't make me cry
yeah the question about unit testing is
some some studios do that but a lot
don't understand how making the same
thing twice
can be interesting when you are not sure
that the thing you are developing will
be in the game it it means that if you
need to test a feature you you will
create some code okay and if you have to
trash this feature you yeah it means you
created code useless code because the
first one was useless and I think if you
want to really create unique tests and
and and really and do things monthly you
would have to wait for sometimes when
you are sure that the feature will be in
the game to create unit test and there
is no point in that because because we
don't know how to plan things and we
don't know how to manage people and and
we do silly things and and that's why we
don't do unit tests because we see that
as a lot of time and I know it's not an
eye but I don't do them because I have
no time for them and it's stupid it's
like when you IT guys did that something
like 10 years ago and and or maybe 15
when nobody no-nobody did the unit test
we are at this moment in the video game
industry I we are old some questions
no no more yes
no we don't we tried to tweet totally
honest
when I was at Ubisoft we tried and only
our small team tried to do screaming
things and it worked so efficiently that
we were so ahead of the other teams that
we couldn't work with them anymore and
it's something that we we can do that
but it implies that all the team and all
the company does that and when you start
it you have to start it at the very
beginning of the project and and as you
don't really know if the project will
survive the prototyping test and the
prototyping phase sorry you don't do
that and you do all things silly things
with Excel and and subversion and stuff
and it lost right after any and I'm sure
it works for a small companies like mine
because we try to do that but for
companies when you have 1,000 people
trying to build a prototype it's so
completely and and people are still so
used to change everything every time and
for them to them the way we are doing
thing works so why change but in fact it
doesn't work and no one is ready to
accept the fact that it's not working
and we just don't do that yeah we there
are a lot of Studios trying to do that
and and and doing that and the problem
is that the most successful ones and the
big ones like rock star or something
said don't do that and the other studio
said okay if they don't do that we don't
need to do that but it's not because
it's working for once to you that it's
working for everyone
we should learn from agile and we should
make these things but we don't take time
to do that and and its really because
when when I talk about the difference
between your world and how world it's
I'm usually I'm the only game developers
in these conferences and because we
don't merge knowledge and we don't try
to share knowledge and a lot of people
in the video game industry are
absolutely no idea on how you do things
and and it's obvious to me that yes Jaya
is pretty cool and there are cool
aspects of it that we can borrow and we
can use but we just don't know because
we don't know it exists questions no yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
