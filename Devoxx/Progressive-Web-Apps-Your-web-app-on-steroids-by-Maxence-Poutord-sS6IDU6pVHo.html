I'm pretty happy to be here in Indiana
this is the first time for me and for
now I I really like the city so it's
really cool we can attack for I'm gonna
talk for the next hour about the the
progressive web apps yes all of my slide
everything this is my slide deck max
bootephant slash torch I'm gonna give
some some numbers etc so if you want to
check the source even if you want to see
back the slide after go go here after
you just need to select the correct the
quest torch which is a progressive way
body okay so this is the starting points
of of my torch months ago I read the I
start to find on the under on Twitter on
some blog post we're talking about
native apps and are calling some people
they were doom
so I start to to dig into into that and
I find some interesting studies
interesting statistic a ballot first of
for 50 percent of the American user
download 0 app per month then only 10
percent download one up amounts and
after one other 10 percent etc okay I
also find that most of the time we spend
on our smartphone is under three on the
top three app and also as points it's
more about revenue it's pretty hard if
you are doing an active application to
get revenue from this if you are out of
this disability also or the Google or
etcetera
there is another a problem if if your
company got an app it's art to to reach
people what I mean is an every step you
got on every step you are losing 20% of
the user so you have to find an app you
lost 20 user then you click on the
detail you lost 20 user etc etc etc so
at the end if you want to reach 1000
user at the end maybe 262 according to
the study 262 it's an average but gonna
use the app and on this 262 this studies
say 5050 75% of the user don't know Dan
app use it once and never come back on
the day 2 we get we are more than 80%
tack tack tack tack until add three
months after or even yeah three months
after we got something close to 5% of
the user we still use your application
the the reason is one of the reason is
sometimes we have to to download an app
and we don't really want it when I came
here in Jena I had to install the an app
for four routes fans I think I'm just
gonna use this app once and look it's
yeah he was pretty similar or something
like forty megabytes just to show one QR
code to the yeah on the airport that's
only why I need an app for this after
there is some use case it still
relevance about about which ability also
because of all of this friction it's out
for you to to get new customers on the
on your app and under hostile a mobile
with the web it's pretty more simple to
to reach new customers
that's that's you got synapse you
probably you probably know that the
users spend more time on the under
native app than a mobile application why
the answer is pretty simple you got
notification the user got already the
icon on the on the desktop so yeah there
is more engagement so let's summarize we
got two things we got the mobile app on
the website we with the mobile app we
can do a lot of things there is a lot of
capability etc but the reach ability is
really hard and here my web app I can
reach a lot of people but I cannot
retain them so some people mostly from
Google they they start from from this
starting point and say ok all to put out
to increase the my website and get
something with more capabilities so
that's that the main the main reason to
to you to switch to something called the
progressive web apps so we're gonna try
to put at the same level in terms of
functionalities a native app unavailable
the progressive web apps it's just a set
of of correct rule that your web apps
have to add to reach so take care you
don't need to update your your LinkedIn
profile right now you probably do some
some of them the first one one of the
first rule is get links one page occur
one inch
welcome to HTTP protocol something it's
pretty basic so I'm not gonna stay
longer on this slide I was talking about
HTTP we could add an S you recognize the
lock here for years people didn't switch
to HTTPS because of Mona's did not want
to buy a certificate I have a good news
since 2016 now there is something called
lesson scripts and now this organization
provide free certificate no it's not
from hipster beatniks rugs there is a
lot of look this sponsor I mean we can
trust this okay
the third points really basic as well
responsive you still not know what's
responsive remember this picture from
Stephanie water MD
she said yeah content content is like
it's like water so don't want to put all
the data from this screen to the you to
your mobile it's do something yeah
responsive to adapt to to the device now
we start to reach something a bit more
interesting because you probably already
follow all this dessert yeah this three
step the first the first one is getting
something more up like so when you are
using a progressive web app you should
not think about I am on the web I am on
the app now it should see it should be
the same experience there is something
interesting called the application
channel architecture so given I'm I'm a
shop and I want to to show some to show
some clothes judge that come did that
they cash the puts this and the left
sorry the left the left screen so all
the architecture cetera you keep it's
it's instant that instantly loaded and
then you do a synchronous request to the
network and you go and you fetch the
data on when the data are air its feed
it feed the screen you got something
pretty similar if you are using
Microsoft teams it's an equivalent to to
to slash and there is also this I think
in in Facebook when you scroll really
really fast you just see the
architecture you're also an interesting
study George don't come reduce the page
load by 3.8 by using this so it's
something interesting yeah the fifth
points the fifth point is getting
something progressive there is the
framework I'm using which is called with
I'm using in my company is called UGS
and they say it's a progressive web
framework it mean you can use this you
can create some small component in this
technology in old-fashioned websites
without breaking everything etc so it's
kind of the same there is a lot of
diversity of browsers so if you want to
add something fancy
in your browser it should not impact the
the whole browsers because yes
unfortunately not every border are the
same this is a screen from Firefox
Firefox 58 so as you can see I cannot I
cannot do some Bluetooth USB NFC
excetera
but if I check it with my chrome here I
think I'm gonna get something slightly
different
yes I don't see yeah for instance this
and the back background saying etc it's
not the same in Firefox than in in
Chrome the six points it's getting a
fresh application fresh by fresh I mean
always up-to-date there is something
here and you were service workers I will
come back in this notion just after the
idea behind this is to get an
application always up-to-date Arish you
see this is my not from my bank I
updated four days ago and they already
asked me to to do an update well
sometimes it's it's not a big deal but
when I need this app I sometimes I just
need it right now like this is what I
get
the other day I came back from from work
and I just wanted to to play to my race
game and I got this Korean say not today
when air it's ok it's 48 megabytes but
sometimes it's even more
and it's pretty annoying so the idea
behind this is to use something called
the background sink to use some tasks in
background to update your app if you are
using some browsers like Firefox Chrome
it's they are working like this you get
an update and you just say Oh next time
you're gonna you cannot reload the
browser we can I get you can I get a new
you're gonna get a new a new version but
the that don't block you so this is the
idea the seventh point is about
installation as I say before um
something good with your with native
apps is you get the icon on the screen
so here the idea is exactly the same you
should be able to get your web your web
icon on screen oops this is the
progressive web apps I did with this UGS
framework and it's based on the github
API so I could get web if you see here
there is a small house with a plus so it
mean it's a progressive web apps you can
install you can install this app so if I
click here I will get something like
this do you want to add this application
on your screen I click on add to add
screen and here I got it like this so
this is my phone
you got two icon here in the middle one
from Firefox and there is a one from
Chrome and the difference between this
and the shortcut goes you know some time
you can just take a shortcut of the
website and put it on your on your on
your home on your home page but here
it's considered by your own by urinary
your on your operating system as an
application which means I can have to
find it if I want to find an application
in my phone there is also something so
this slide are progressive web apps
friendly which means I can also install
them so I'm on chrome here and if I want
to to install my application wait
I just need a click Add to Home screen
and it doesn't work oh no my bad I
didn't so look there is a add this
application to your shelf so you click
Add and my browser is doing more effects
ok let's restart this ok inspect I go
under application at home screen hard ok
I to add to your desktop so here this is
how it's working Ubuntu and after I got
something pretty real here so I click I
said trust on lunch and tada
I got my slide and in slug-like it's
look like an app and look I can also
here put it on my on my dock you got
something pretty similar on OS X I
didn't test on on micro site on
Microsoft I didn't test it on
Microsoft's so yeah every every browser
got a different way of honoring this
dismal house the the install button I
think in in Opera it's on the left and
also look like it's there is also a plus
in Chrome
you must visit the page to time to get
this yeah that's it oh you you might
think ok it's good oh can I get the
displays button on my on my website
there is something called
the manifesto JSON it's it's a web app
manifest and it's allow your application
to be discoverable so the web app the
JSON it's it's a file where you can put
some different some different
information about your about your your
web apps we get the name a short name
the short name is for the its to put it
on the on the screen on the on your home
screen then you get a set of icons as
far I remember for Chrome you need any
con with 500 pixels something like this
start URL it's the entry point check out
I put source equal on screen if you if
you check the spec of the of the web app
manifests they say you can you can do
this for analytics so after if you got
some Google Analytics or something like
this you can say ok I got 10% of user
using this this web apps from the screen
also display the screen if you check on
my web app on my when I when I check
just before the installation
Juden and so the you didn't so order the
panel from from the browser and mostly
the most important Eretz we don't see
the URL bar so which really look like an
a real app from from your phone and
after you can put some background color
and time quorum I got another example
here so I'm still on chrome if you want
to check your web app manifest on Chrome
you got the the developers tools and you
just go on manifest you will see the
name the short name etc and the Add to
Home screen so if something is wrong
Google will that the tool will tell you
and say oh I cannot add it under screen
because of this disease so here I put
this some colors and I got all of my set
of icons something cool there is a lot
of website you just put one icon and
they generate everything including the
the manifesto JSON so it's pretty easy
to do also I was talking about Microsoft
I said I don't know all of did they
manage the this but I got two good news
Microsoft want to crawl all the
progressive web app from the from the
web convert them into something weird I
don't know what is a PBX but after what
what they want to do is to to put them
in the Windows Store so as a real
application I think it's something
really cool but look I put a scientist
here so it's it's still in draft so we
have to wait they say 2018 so I think
but it was in September so I think we
have to wait something like six months
and after maybe we're gonna see some
application in the Microsoft Store so
here for to reach new customer it can be
pretty good
another point to increase the engagement
with your customers is the the
notification you probably saw it already
in some website well sometimes it's a
bit annoying because when you open a
website say oh okay can I send you
notification so you accept or decline
and it looked like this so you have to
turn off on here when I click I got some
notification from from the yeah the
operating system and here say okay so
you got you got a notification from the
application called PWA
this is the website this is the message
and now the about connection because the
10-part the this point is about yeah
making a websites offline because the
the best request is no request it was my
face when I saw this I say whoa I have
to do a website offline yeah let explain
oh it's work
oh no before why why well we are in good
country with very nice internet
connection but unfortunately it's not
the same everywhere so yeah you know
Sarah it's pretty good I'm working in
Ireland it's pretty good too but if you
check in some country in Asia in Africa
in South America it's not good well even
in France it's one of the best but I'm
sure when my parent gonna see this
torque on YouTube they will not see it
in HD because you got a pretty pretty
bad connection and also something that
we have to keep in mind it's 45 percent
of the world population it's still
untouched network so we have to think
about these people it's very still
people in in Africa the download what
the name the non trade up and after they
can give them to each other in by USB so
yeah unfortunately not everybody got
really fast Wi-Fi so how does it work
there is something called serviceworker
this is a webpage and the network
something really basic if you want to
see the page you do an HTTP GET to to
the network and something is coming in
the in the browser well it's already
here but the document from the w3c is
still in draft but it's already
implemented in all the browsers
basically you got your webpage if you
want to exit to the network there is
something in the middle core
serviceworker
it's not only a proxy some people resume
a service worker as a proxy but it's it
can do much more but the interesting
part for from this point is what we can
do with a service worker so I want to
access to the network and the service
worker say oh I saw this request maybe I
can put it in the cache so then if you
want to get it again you just need to
call the cache and all of this is
browser side when I saw this I say wow
it's pretty cool because now I can do a
lot of things in my in my application
Jake
Archie bar wrote something called the
offline cookbook in this offline
cookbook in gave us some some pattern
from offline strategy
this one is sketch first you want to
load a page so first you ask to the
sulla cache if there is no nothing in
the cache then you fall back on the
network there is another one it's the
opposite its network a network first
otherwise Uganda cache yeah for instance
if I'm a shop and I want to show the
product I can use this but maybe from
real sensitive data like the price or
the availability maybe I want to do
something like network only so no way
you don't put anything in the cache some
more interesting the cache then network
so look I asked in parallel to the cache
and to the network the cash return me
the data and then the same time I'm
going on the on the network and after I
can read through the data so while I'm
navigating on the website the data so
first at t0
the data from the cache and after while
navigating the data are getting a to
date something pretty similar it's my
favorites it's style while revalidate
you always so the the assets but from t
minus one from the last time you you
were on the on the website it can be
interesting for assets like javascript
files CSS etc so first page the users so
the when the user go in your website is
so that the result from yesterday or for
the last time you went to your website
and etc but if you had a single page
application maybe it doesn't make sense
but if you don't have a single page
application a web site like Facebook
usually you don't do only one click you
dis it you reload the page several times
so on the first page you get two version
from yesterday maybe but the page load
instantly and on the second page you get
the some up-to-date data so I gave you
some few strategy for offline there is
much more in the in this website in this
cookbook I recommend you to take a look
and yeah you can also follow this guy
check Archie bar is pretty good guy from
from Google now how does it work or does
it work all of this oak or I can do that
on my web site
this is some JavaScript code basically
everything is based on promise but I
don't know about you but sometimes it
can be a bit annoying to to write very
huge text huge huge code code just to
manage my assets there is something
called Warbucks Warbucks it's a pretty
good tour sponsored by Google by the way
basically it look like this so on the
first parameter of this function so so I
defined some roots and I say okay
everything which look like PNG gif etc
all the image I want to apply cash for
strategy
I can also put some fancy name like the
name of the cache gonna be image you
honest or sixty sixty image and for a
duration of thirty days or if you want
something way more simple you can do
something like this here I want to store
all the HTTP calls from the github API
and then I want to apply the network
first strategy I'm sorry for you there
is no you have to deal with reg X so if
you are nuts if like me you are not a
big fan of reg X it can be a small issue
now let's switch to the eleven points
single page application now I'm checking
and hopefully there is a lot of people
or they say you have to be you have to
build a single page application to do a
privacy web apps it's wrong and it's
something pretty cool because building
and single page application is hard so
no single page application so let's
summarize this is my definition of a
progressive web app it's just something
really cool like this so you go to a
website under privacy web app but it's
not really professional so let's switch
to to another definition from Alex
reason another guy from Google which is
working on policy web app it's saying
it's a PW way it's nothing else than a
website which take the good bit I mean
what are these good vitae mean so let's
summarize it's something reliable so
HTTP you can get it even if you are
offline also it's fast thanks to the
service workers and you can get some
engage you can better engage the your
your customers with by installing the
application
getting some what the name notification
etc another great tool to help you to
build the best PWA its lighthouse
lighthouse you get it by default on
Chrome so I opened the dev tools here
and you get a pan core audit and here
you can click to perform an audit you
select what you want so yeah let's
select everything and light house we
scroll your website check about
performance or performance it is an 2g
network so blah blah blah and after it
will it will give you a report so here
I'm probably gonna blame me for the for
the performance cuz I got a lot of image
and I did not really optimize them maybe
also gonna complain for some stuff
because I put some CSS in ditch it's not
really nice but it's not the goal do I
need to wait so yeah you can see what
he's doing and here I got my result here
so I'm 64 compliant with progressive web
app so there is problem because my
application doesn't register
serviceworker I don't probably break
something
err you can also get some the first
meaningful paint this is really
interesting even if you don't want to
build a PWA you can get some good
insight from your websites say okay I
have to optimize this this to get a
better ratio something good with
lighthouse you can also put it in CLI so
by using it CLI it's mean you can use it
in your in your pipeline CIA CD X
and other points really important it's
speed matter I like this picture this is
the team from Red Bull they are changing
four tires in two seconds while the
average page load on the 3G network is
19 second Wow
19 second it's very slow I don't know
why well no we know basically it's
because of the analytics non
optimisation etc something you have to
keep in mind about speed if half of the
purse of the earth of the people expect
website to load in less than 2 seconds
and if you website load in more than 3
second yeah
3 second you lost 50% 50% will bounce so
it can be something really nice if you
want to sell PWA in your in your company
check the bounce rate but unfortunately
today there is things that we still
cannot do in your inner progressive web
app like I cannot access to NFC to the
calendar to my contact list so we have
to wait if you remember the the screen
from the the screen I show you about
what the web can do it's changing it's
moving it's moving really fast so I
discover yesterday something called the
no not just a rabbit's few weeks ago at
something called web payments API there
is a lot of friction today in a in your
application if you want to sell
something basically on my phone there is
something pretty good is when I want to
buy it's already linked to my Google
accounts it's pretty fast to buy
something on on a mobile on a mobile app
but on the web you have to take your
wallet the credit card etc so yeah
to avoid this friction they are
developing
this payment request API and I think I
did this in some really few line of
JavaScript you can get something like
this
so here I give you a link if you want to
buy an iPhone for 10 euro it looked like
this and I got something from the
browser here I got the detail of of my
bills here I can put my credit card
and I just need to click on pay and
that's it I don't need it so I will not
pay it also unfortunately the user yet
are not really used to this to this
install button so I don't know maybe in
few years people will use this but for
now there is still a reflex to go on the
on the store so they have to work on it
if you check the first version of the
install button and what is it today it
change a lot so that they're still
trying to find the best way to engage
user through this this button now the
last part is about feedbacks some
company moved to the pro se web apps and
they gave feedback to the community
the first one is Twitter if you remember
the map I show you I show you in Africa
for instance there is no the network is
pretty low company like Twitter want to
keep this market and want to better
reach this market so they create
something called Twitter lead
it's it just Twitter but you in a HTTP
request you just take what you need to
so the there is less less less more
requests I think the the full on page
only took one way one megabits one
megabytes to load it's much more for the
other app
um yeah when they did this up afters is
they take some metrics it's pretty
interesting to see that because the app
is better there is better performance on
the with the browser etc so the user use
more the applications 65% it's a lot so
and also people people use more that
they tweet more and they come back more
often the 20% also Bob did something
pretty similar as a switch to PWA plus
100% engagements it's pretty good it's
well it's awesome
the user use more the application yeah
you get the the source it's also on
developers.google.com it's a really good
resource to switch to bwa or to get some
insight from company that switched to
PWA so it's yeah the developer blog from
google and also the last one is what
pinterest did pinterest from it's the
the most most important study from from
them so they say okay let's go to PWA
and they realized that people stay more
and up they consume more they get more
money because they are Bazin they use
advertising fortunately unfortunately
for us there is more engagement and
after they also did something
interesting at they compared the
statistic from the native app and from
the web app and they realize that it's
kind of the same so if you remember at
the beginning I was showing you this
diagram so today we're here it's in the
same level it's not in the same level to
be very honest but it's changing a lot
there is a lot of improvement from the
browser it's changing fast so maybe
yesterday you did not want in a native
app for some reason but now you can do
it because
your web apps can access to your
positions your localization you can also
buy a new mobile etc so keep an eye on
keep an eye on these websites what web
can do the 2-day etc because yeah it's
moving it's moving really fast thank you
I think I got time for some questions
yeah no so your question is is it
possible today to be in the in the
application store application store you
mean the Android store and the iOS one
for now the answer is no there is
nothing already check the only thing is
plan is from the Microsoft Store to put
PWA after I think there is a reason
there is a reason why they didn't talk
about it it's also because because you
have to follow some rules muscly for the
I think the iOS for iOS the scan or the
scroll your your application etc and
follow for a web app it's a bit harder
to to check what's inside and so for me
it's it's the reason after maybe it's
gonna change I don't know any other
question
so if it's the end the question if it's
if it's the end of the native app well I
don't have my crystal ball
some people say native apps are dooms it
was the the introduction I truly believe
that today the progressive web app on in
few years they gonna get challenged mmm
does it still relevant today to build to
build native apps yes for some companies
it's they're making all of the demo a
year after also saw some even some
application they were only on native
apps and this which also two web apps
like tinder the switch to PWA there is a
nice blog still on Google and start
giving some insight
so people so people are switching to to
this because there is a need I don't
know if if it's going to get replaced
mmm
from my point of view yes but I'm pretty
and not very good for prediction so on
also puts if you check on on the slide I
put some some tools or also there is a
one color PW a builder they help you to
generate your manifest there is what
they webpagetest.org to measure the
performance of your website yeah also oh
yeah you are asking if it's to relevance
the native apps it wasn't my backup
slide this is the trend from from
Facebook so the world go on mobile so
yes it's relevant to still building
native apps but PWI from it's also been
interesting because the the mobile on
the web it's still the same it doesn't
decrease
okay yeah well I think you can so it's
when here so your question is what's the
website about your privacy right so if
there is - I think it's there yeah you
got it in Chrome settings so you can see
here for instance your web app can
access to your geolocalization without
asking you I was a bit scared when I saw
this I say well they can check a lot of
things yes your GPS localization she
doesn't need to ask you they can access
it directly
so here the notification by default here
I are oh but you can also block them but
the most important things to watch is
what you can get by default so yeah here
the camera
well not ill the location it's the
default so they need to ask maybe it was
on Firefox it's by default I don't
really remember so yeah after you have
to some stuff are blocks for some of
them they are low by default so you have
to keep an eye on it but yeah something
good also with your native apps you know
what what they need is a transfer to a
question yeah yeah I think it's okay for
that time maybe a quick last question no
it's okay okay thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
