computers are coming my name is Alistair
Collinson I'm a senior software
developer for zendikar technologies and
blah blah blah you don't really care
about any of that do you there's one
thing really that you have to know about
me I'm a nerd I'm a huge nerd in fact
I'm so much of a nerd that my colleagues
call me a nerd and they're you know
other computer scientists and
mathematicians and physicists now
personally I'm not a physicist not at
all last time I had any formal education
in physics is ages ago but I am here
nevertheless to speak about quantum
computers and the good news is you don't
have to be a physicist anymore to get
into quantum computing it's the time now
where being a nerd is sufficient and
that's really good news because in
looking at you here you're probably not
gonna need quantum computers for your
job yet you're sitting here watching a
talk on quantum computers chances are
you two are nerds okay so what is a
quantum computer let's get started with
a very basic term and the easier part of
that is what is a computer well this is
a computer rather older than what you
probably use I hope this one could argue
is the first computer ever at least the
first electronic digital programmable
computer that Souza's it three and
digital or binary is a big point there
when we think of binary we normally
think of zeros and ones but that's not
really true is it we don't have zeros
and ones in our computers we have two
distinct States and four we care about
it could be a green circle in the red
triangle as long as they are distinct
that's fine now computers nowadays work
with transistors well smaller than those
more like the
here built into small trips and the way
the transistors work is basically that
depending on their input they either let
a current go through or they don't two
distinct States wonderful and this is
great for loads and loads of problems I
mean the fact that we are where we are
with computing technology nowadays is
due to the fact that this is such a
versatile versatile tool but it's not
great for everything and I'm going to
show you an example of something it's
not great at as nodes you may be not
that familiar with this but nature ok so
nature is not binary let's have a look
at a closed part of that and try to try
to determine where we have forests so
this part that's clearly forest this
part clearly isn't forest but what about
that part I mean you clearly have some
trees there right but most of it is
grass so where do we draw the line when
do we call it a forest and that question
where do we draw the line we have to
draw an arbitrary line we have to decide
how much say trees per square kilometer
or whatever counts as a forest and when
we have to draw such a line when we have
to make a decision
we are artificially making our world
binary binary problems are great for
computers non-binary problems not so
much okay so that's the computer part I
think we're all up to speed now the
quantum part so quantum as you may have
guessed is based on quantum mechanics
quantum mechanics was first introduced
by Niels Bohr and Karl Ivana Karl
Heisenberg they worked together in the
1920s came up with quantum mechanics and
what they called the
the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum
mechanics named after the city where
they work together now I am NOT going to
explain all of quantum mechanics partly
because as I said I'm not a physicist
and partly because even if I were we
would need more than the time we have
available so I'll give you an example
and the example is imagine we have an
atom in fact we don't care about the
whole atom all we care about is the
nucleus here and let's say that our atom
is radioactive
what does radioactivity mean it means
basically that at some point it will
decay which means that part of it will
radiate away this radioactive particle
and alpha particle in this case will
leave the nucleus and what remains will
be some other element so assuming we
have our particle our atom and we wait
for a certain time if we look at that
particle there are two states we could
imagine it being in either it hasn't
changed at all or it has decayed right
according to the Copenhagen
interpretation of quantum mechanics it
can be both at the same time that is it
can be both at the same time until we
actually measure it now don't be
confused by those eyes I'm not stating
that there's any connection between
consciousness and physics looking is one
way of measuring it but anything that
relies on its being in one State or the
other accounts so nevertheless this is a
really really weird thing to imagine how
can something be in two states at the
same time and so Schrodinger here in
1935 he thought there was this was
pretty weird so he came up with a
thought experiment showing how
absolutely weird the the interpretation
was that Heisenberg and Bohr had come up
with
in this experiments which you may have
heard of he has a cat and this cat is
totally fine it's healthy it's not
likely to die within the next hour of so
of natural causes and he puts this cat
into a box the cats however is not the
only thing in the box what else do we
have
well we have a radioactive source of
some kind this is very similar to the
radioactive atom we had previously it's
just more of them and this source has
been chosen in a particular way so that
if one hour passes the chance that any
of it has decayed is 50/50 okay what
else do we have well there's also a
flask filled with cyanide gas in there
cyanide gas of course highly poisonous
it's better if the gas stays in that
flask but he added a 1/4 thing he added
a construction which consists of a
Geiger counter that if it measures any
radioactivity
we'll use that hammer and what will
happen there well dead cat so if we
again imagine an hour passes what are
the states that we could have well I
thought the radioactive isotope has not
done anything it's not decayed in any
way and the case is fine or well the
cat's dead two possible States and
according to the Copenhagen
interpretation we could have both of
them together we could have them at the
same time I mean how can cat be dead and
alive at the same time right
Schrodinger wasn't thinking of zombie
cats as far as I can tell but it's
definitely a weird concept and so he
came up with an alternative
interpretation because he did believe
that the maths behind quantum mechanics
was correct he just thought that the
Copenhagen interpretation was nonsense
and the interpretation he came up with
is called the many-worlds interpretation
now before I get into what the
many-worlds interpretation means I have
a small disclaimer for us for our
purposes the many-worlds interpretation
is a model it helps us understand
certain aspects of the topic it's really
good at that if it's chosen well but
models have something else often models
are wrong in many ways and that's fine
as long as they're wrong in ways that we
don't care about and the many-worlds
interpretation for our purposes is right
in where it counts it may or may not be
correct in all of all I don't know I'm
not a physicist and I think even
physicists are unsure about this it
certainly rides in the ways we care
about okay with that just came out of
the way what does the many-worlds
interpretation say well it says first of
all take everything that is the world
the galaxy the universe it couldn't find
a picture of the universe but the
galaxies here will work and in this
universe among other things you have
your cat now when this radioactive event
happens this quantum event so to speak
you don't get your zombie cat situation
rather what happens is that you get two
universes and basically they're carbon
copies of each other with one exception
and that exception is the result of your
quantum event and everything that
followed from that so in one universe
you
have a live cat in one universe you have
a dead cat and of course this can happen
again if you have another radioactive
event quantum event giving you four
universes and again giving you eight
universes you get the picture now one
thing you may notice on this slide is we
have rather many dead cats and well
that's not that Pleasant thing is we
have this situation because of biology
in our universe at least and probably in
all other relevant universes if you have
a dead cat and add more cyanide you
don't get a live cat that's not how
biology works or chemistry or anything
luckily for us cats and quantum
computers are different in that aspect
so now we're getting to the actual meat
of the matter what we see here is called
a Blas fear and it's a represent
representation of a qubit a quantum bit
that's the equivalent of your zeros and
ones your bits or your there is a
current and there's no current your
green circle and your red triangle this
is the equivalent in the quantum
computing world so what states can we
have in there well first of all you can
have a zero state which is represented
by your vector pointing to the top there
you can have a one state which is
represented by pointing to the bottom so
that's simple enough but you can also
have something that looks like this now
this isn't zero and it isn't one it's
not really between the two either at
least not in this visualization it's
somewhere on the sphere and
mathematically speaking this is actually
a combination of the two base values
we're using now if that math confuses
you because I mean zeros at the bottom
at the top ones at the bottom how can
some of that be somewhere else
ignore the math we don't need it for the
rest of the talk it is a combination it
makes sense in the mathematical model
the Bloch sphere is a three-dimensional
representation of four-dimensional space
it gets mathematical we don't have to
care about it what we have to care about
is okay assuming we have this qubit what
can we do with it and if you want to do
something with a qubit you need a
quantum gate so let's go through a few
quantum gates first one I want to show
you is the so called Hadamard gate so
the Hadamard gate operates on a single
qubit and basically it imagines that
there's a further axis between the x and
the z axis and it then spins our vector
around that axis now if you are
measuring a qubit if it's at the zero
position it will give you zero all of
the time binary value if it's a 1 it
will give you 1 all of the time if it's
somewhere in between it will give you 0
and 1 with certain probabilities so if
we were to measure measure it's at this
point in an ideal quantum computer at
least you would get 0 and 1 each with
50% probability this state where you can
have 0 or 1 as a readout is called
quantum superposition and we'll need
that very soon another gate I'll gonna
I'm gonna show you is called the power
Li X gate now the X gate is much much
simpler to understand than the the
Hadamard gate because basically if you
have it at 0 and deploy an X gate it
just takes the x axis and spins it
around there by a hundred and eighty
degrees giving you the opposite value so
this is basically just a knot around the
X X
is not is easy enough to understand
right but it gets more complicated if
you go to another gate which
incorporates part of what you know from
the ex gate now so the conditional not
or C not gate is where things get really
exciting and basically this operates on
two qubits we have the the control qubit
at zero here and we have the target
qubit and if we apply a C not with the
control qubit at zero nothing happens
everything stays the same if we have a
one on the control qubit and apply the C
not it will flip so basically this is
the behavior we know from the ex gate
but what happens if our control Q gate
is in superposition if it could be
measured as 0 or 1 we get something like
this so we now have two arrows in that
second qubit basically it's a bit like
this because if you were to measure
either of the gates you would get the
value of both gates they are combined
they are locked together if you have 0
in the first one you'll get 0 in the
second one because nothing happens if
you get one in the first one you'll get
one in the second one because everything
happens this is the situation we had
with our radioactive isotope and our cat
earlier this is quantum entanglement and
quantum entanglement combines with
quantum superposition is what makes
quantum computers and quantum mechanics
in general tick now we don't actually
have this until we measure before we
measure we basically just have both in
superposition
and as long as they're in superposition
we can do some really funky stuff with
these qubits now I've shown you a few
quantum gates namely the Hadamard and
the con C not gate I've shown you one of
the three Paola gates there are y&amp;amp;z
Paola gates as well they just spin
around their axes by 180 degrees those
axes just being Y all's ed there's also
stuff like the identity gate which is
the most boring gates ever because it
just does nothing there are phase gates
which are pretty exciting you can do
some pretty neat stuff with those I'm
not going to get into the phase gates
today but you can read up on them if you
like I'll have some material some links
for you later
and there are many many other types of
gates you can imagine so
okay we now know roughly how it works
but why do we need this what are the use
cases and there are quite a few use
cases actually for example the big one
that if you've heard anything about
quantum computing you've heard about
this it can break encryption and it can
break encryption because at least in
theory it can break it because it's
really good at prime factorization
quantum computers can factorize numbers
much more efficiently in theory at least
then your regular binary computers can
do it if you want to know more about
that check out Shor's algorithm
something you may not have heard of
various companies including Google and
Volkswagen are using quantum computers
now to assist them in engineering tasks
you could simulate molecules and atoms
on quantum computers you actually have a
quantum states there so you can easily
work with quantum
at ease and this can be really useful in
research in physics and chemistry and
medicine of course so this could be
really really exciting other than that
how about AI or machine learning there
are quite a few attempts to use quantum
computers in those areas and I think
it's pretty safe to say that those will
be some of the first fields that will we
as developers will really meet quantum
computers at least in the wild then you
can use it for weather prediction you
can use quantum computers for pretty
much any field that is nowadays aided by
heuristics because heuristics are just a
shortcut because you are unable to
calculate everything but quantum
computers will allow you to calculate
well not everything but much much more
than you can nowadays financial fraud is
another use case that some people are
looking into again a fields where
heuristics is large NASA is using
quantum computers early quantum
computers and admittedly in their
engineering tasks so that's similar to
the Volkswagen case and just to jump on
the bandwagon quantum computers could
break Bitcoin so if you have bitcoins
you probably save for a couple of years
until we have quantum computers that are
powerful enough but don't wait too long
to sell them okay so these are
interesting use cases I guess but
there's much more that could be done now
most people who nowadays are into
quantum computers are scientists
physicists as I said engineers etc and
they come up with solutions to the
problems they know we are the ones who
will have to program them eventually so
we need people who
are in the programming field who are in
the software development field to have a
look at quantum computers try them out
work with them see what they can do we
will come up with other use cases use
cases that so far nobody has thought of
and this is basically why I'm doing this
talk today because we have to get into
quantum computing and we can so that's
why we as a community should get into it
why should you personally get into it
well there's this wonderful quote from
Venkat basically if you want to learn
something new learn something that's
totally different from anything you know
because it will help you think
differently it's a wonderful quote and
believe me quantum computer programming
is different from what you know so I'm
going to show you two examples today of
how you can actually today start
programming for quantum computers the
first one I'm going to show you is the
IBM quantum experience so iBM has built
real quantum computers early prototypes
but they are real nevertheless and
they're basically offering them as a
kind of quantum computer in the cloud
service how does that work well first of
all the computers they built look
something like this and if for the
moment yes I hope they'll shrink
considerably actually this part here
most of that is a freezer but a cryostat
but basically a huge freezer the chip
itself looks something like this this is
a seven qubit chip those are the qubits
here and it has to be cooled down to
well basically as cold as it can get
because they are based on super
conductivity and super conductivity well
it works best if you have really really
cold states now you can use this quantum
computer well
that specific one but once that they're
providing via their website this is the
entry sites to the quantum experience
they have great learning materials there
by the way so if you're interested in
this later you can check it out it's
great
once you log in what the place you'll
spend most of your time probably is this
this is called the quantum composer and
up here we have information about the
quantum computers that you can use they
currently offer for free by the way two
different five cubed computers that
anyone can use they also have in their
quantum experience in theory a twenty
qubit quantum computer that's only open
to their partners and it gives you some
information about those computers now
think it's difficult to read but the top
quantum computer it's cooled down to
0.01 to kelvins that's colder than in
out of space that's why they have this
huge cryostat that's huge freezer and as
you'll see very soon that's still not
really enough so the main parts however
is this part the composer interface and
it's named so because it looks like you
know a musical score and you do call the
programs often quantum scores also you
have here your cue gates now you'll
recognize some of them they're ours the
h4 Hadamard there's the the plus symbol
that's the C not you see the green X
that's the X gates and there so are some
other ones as well so let's say we want
to implement an algorithm in this and
we'll go with something we already know
Schrodinger's cat very simple algorithm
to implement not much longer logic in it
but it's a start so what do we need
apart from the cat well we need our
radioactive matter we need our modified
Geiger counter
we need our cyanide and all of those
have to be linked in some way they have
to be entangled and if we lay that out
in our quantum composure it would look
something like this so the radioactive
matter we already learned that is in
quantum superposition so we can achieve
that through the Hadamard gate we then
link all of the other items so the the
Geiger counter and the cyanide and the
cat through C not gates cause basically
if if the Hadamard reads out as one that
means that the radioactive matter has
decayed and in that case all the other
qubits should also flip they all start
out as zero and if the first one flips
everything should turn to one and
looking into the box is basically this
pink symbol here the measurement gate in
fact let's measure all of the gates we
are modifying here and see what we get
now you can run this as I said on a real
quantum computer its sense to their
quantum computer there's a schedule
system etc and after a while you get
back your result and your results what
part of the result will look like this
so what does this mean at the bottom we
have the various measurement values
ignore the first value because that's
the qubit we didn't measure and what we
see is here this is the case where
everything's zero nothing happens so
that's a big peak back here we have the
case where everything happened
everything's a one cat's dead and each
of those two results come to about 30% I
think I ran this test a thousand times
and you get 30% each which leaves 40% of
these results so what are those well
those are measurement errors
see this is still an early prototype and
it makes mistakes and quantum error
correction is actually a huge research
fields right now things are getting
better but you do have to keep in mind
that you can't believe all of the
results at the moment that you're
getting there is some randomness in
there basically due to the fact among
other things at least that it's not at
Absolute Zero it is those you know 21
millions above zero which isn't much but
it's still a bit too warm so that's the
quantum experience the other tool I
would like to show you today is the
Microsoft quantum development kit now
this the the IBM quantum experience is
basically a drag-and-drop editor you can
write regular code as well they have a
programming language and it translates
back and forth between the graphical
interface and that language in most
cases at least for learning purposes you
will probably use the graphical
interface the quantum development kids
by Microsoft comes with a language
called cue sharp this looks much more
like in the code we're used to and as I
said it's from Microsoft so initially it
was only available for Windows and I
thought during the preparations for this
presentation
I'd have to tell you well if you have
anything but windows tough lock but
about a month ago they said hey it's now
available for linux and mac OS as well
so everyone could download it everyone
can start playing around with it yes
okay so you can do it let's have a look
at what it looks like if you actually do
do it so the language cue sharp is
heavily inspired by other dotnet
languages as you would assume and it
does actually run inside a dotnet
environment
here we have a very simple program most
of its blurred out at the moment it's
not something about your eyes it really
should look like that and we'll go
through the program step by step so what
do we have first of all here we are
applying a Hadamard gate to our isotope
H isotope and then we apply the C not to
the isotope and the Geiger counter and
another C not to the Geiger counter and
the cyanide another C not to the cyanide
and the cat you know this and it's just
written down as code it's the same
algorithm as we did before what else do
we have because there's obviously more
code well first of all we define a
mutable value what we would call a
variable in most languages most things
in Q sharp are immutable by default they
want this to be mutable and this
variable is supposed to represent the
state of the cat is it alive or is it
dead this is a simple one it's not a
qubit value this is a binary value here
we check in the box whether the cat is
alive or dead M is the measurement value
this is the pink thing you saw in the
quantum experience same concept and then
at the end we return you know is the cat
alive or is it dead okay simple enough
what else do we have
we have boilerplate basically so here we
say this algorithm needs for qubits we
have to state explicitly how many we
need they will be provided by the
language then we give them proper names
normally you have an array of qubits and
that's fine initially but you can't
throw best practices out of the window
just because we have a new language is
language here we do have to give the the
qubits names so we can understand what
we're doing
then we initialize them all to zero the
quantum experience did this for us
everything was initially set to 0 Q
sharp does not do this for us we have to
do it manually and at the end we're
setting them back to zero
now the reason we have to set them to
zero initially and at the end is
basically decay quantum decay means that
a qubits will always strive to some kind
of equilibrium State
we want to make sure it's not in
equilibrium but rather it's in a defined
States that we can work with and you
could leave out language-wise
the initializing to zero then with you
would just get random results q shop
forces you actually to set them back to
zero when you're finished and that's
basically all of the Q sharp code now
this runs in the dotnet environment
which means we can access it from other
doughnut languages and so here we have a
few lines of c-sharp code which
basically say well here create a quantum
simulator to run my algorithm in run the
algorithm in that quantum simulator and
then tell me what the result is and you
can run this code on your computer it
runs it just this once
in this case and it'll either tell you
the cat's alive or the cat is dead and
that's it this will run on your computer
so we have quantum simulator here and
that may beg the question then why don't
we just simulate it white do we need a
real quantum computer it obviously works
so why don't we just simulate everything
and don't have those measurement errors
that have the hassle it's a huge
financial investment that companies like
IBM for example
and many universities are taking on why
do they care and I'd like to go back to
a previous slide to answer that question
remember this slide now in theory the
slide is designed in such a way that
when I press my button here it will have
a smooth transition from the dead cats
to gravestones
I clicked yeah that wasn't smooth my
computer is having difficulties with
PowerPoint and what stress would a
quantum computer put on a binary
computer well
IBM actually looked into this issue and
they published a paper last year they
had two quantum computers that they
simulated one of them was a 49 qubit
computer and they needed to form a half
terabyte of RAM one of them was a 56
qubit computer and that needed three
terabytes of RAM note that this wasn't
the same algorithm and maybe the
algorithm they used for the latter was
more optimized it's still much more than
we have on our development machines
there are computers with that kind of
memory available of course but you don't
have them sitting at home I would assume
if you do let me know I might come by so
this was a huge success and you'll see
why it was a huge success with this line
here previously those kind of
simulations would have needed eight
petabytes of RAM for the 49 qubits
machine and an exabyte of RAM for the 56
qubit machine let me repeat that one
exabytes of ram can you imagine how much
an exabyte is probably not so let me
break this down for you one exabytes is
thousand petabytes which is a million
gigabytes terabytes re which depending
on whether you speak British or American
English is a mill yard or a billion
gigabytes that's ten to the 18 bytes of
RAM so intensive hits CD 18 bytes that's
hard to imagine our universe according
to current estimates is thirteen point
seven times ten to the nine years old
that translates to four point three two
times ten to the seventeen seconds
that's less than half the amount of
bytes we have in an exabyte so the
improvement that IBM made thereby
getting it down to the terabyte range is
astonishing but as the number of qubits
grows that you have to emulate or
simulate and as the algorithms grow that
you want to simulate on those
simulations of quantum computers things
will get well even more unrealistic than
they are right now so at least for the
time being we are stuck with actual
physical quantum computers now this here
is a 50 qubit quantum computer over to
IBM built and until recently I thought
this would be the largest machine I'd be
able to show you about two weeks ago
Google came along and said hey we have
this thing here we call it Bristlecone
and it has 72 qubits and apparently very
low error rates now when they announced
it the testing wasn't fully completed so
we can't be absolutely sure what the
error rates look like but it's promising
note the the 50 qubit machine I showed
you I think that was from earlier this
year this is from two weeks ago things
are moving really rapidly and IBM and
Google aren't the only companies in the
game here for example intel is also
working on quantum computers at the
beginning of the year they introduced a
49 qubits quantum computer
after some previous iterations the
largest one in the picture is the 49
cubit one and Alibaba the Chinese
Internet giant's announced in early
March that they were offering a quantum
computer in the cloud similar to what
IBM is offering now as I said earlier
IBM to certain partners offers a 20
cubed computer this here offered by
Alibaba is an 11 cubits computer which
is the second-largest one available at
least it's available to some people I
registered with Alibaba looked for
anything and I could only find this
announcement so apparently it is
available in theory but only two or
probably members of the university with
which they are doing this or a research
institution I should say but things are
gonna happen quantum computers will
become more and more available in the
next months and especially years and so
this is the breaking point this is the
point where people like us have to get
started and can get started with quantum
computing so if you want to get started
what can you do well as I said earlier
there's the quantum experience you can
register there it's all free and they
have great learning material here's the
URL I will make the slides available
online so you don't have to remember
that you are old right now
great a great tool for learning there is
as I said the IBA their Microsoft
quantum development kit available for
yeah sure sure I'll still speak about
the next slide
there's the Microsoft quantum
development kit available for Windows
Mac and Linux
this also is absolutely free of charge
and available under this URL if you want
to take pictures
that would be the time and also about
one and a half weeks ago Stack Exchange
who run this tiny this I told Stack
Overflow you may heard of they opened a
private beta for a quantum computing
site now it's a private beta so you can
only join by invitation if you want to
join let me know I can I can get an
invitation to you and that's well the
site is at this address of course my
invitations aren't but just let me know
and well apart from that I would say
it's how to explore try these tools play
around with them read the tutorials
there's much much more than I got to
cover today in the information material
provided by for example IBM and
Microsoft and of course other sources
play around with it and hopefully we'll
get some really cool results and now ask
your questions that adds two numbers
that's a good question if you want to
add two numbers well in theory a very
simple adder would be just the C not if
you have zero and zero you get zero if
you have zero and one you have one if
you have one in zero you have one here
one on one you get 0 because of overflow
but you always have the problem of
measurement error here you probably
don't want to build something like an
adder in a quantum computer the profile
of quantum computing applications for
one as I said earlier is anything that's
nowadays ought many things at least that
nowadays you would improve with curious
six so you'll probably be able to
improve those with quantum computers
among these things are well prime factor
prime factoring of course you can you
can do that nowadays you would basically
have to try all possible combinations
and you can improve that with heuristics
but it's it's difficult another issue
that can be solved with quantum
computers is unstructured search there's
an algorithm called Grover's algorithm
where basically if you have a data set
and you know nothing about how it may or
may not be sorted with any regular
binary computer which you would have to
look at each separate entry and check is
that the one I'm looking for is that the
one I'm looking for
it's that the one I'm looking for if you
have n entries you'd need potentially n
tries it's certainly an O of n Grover's
algorithm can do it in oh of square root
of n basically by using this this state
of superposition and looking at several
values at the same time so anything that
goes into the area of breadth search is
a potential candidate as well and there
are probably many many other problems
you can look at that so simply nobody
has really looked into yet I'm pretty
convinced that it's possible to write a
proper sorting algorithm with a quantum
computer I haven't seen anyone do it yet
and I haven't been able to come up with
one myself
but I do think it's possible we just
have to find the proper algorithm okay
okay so basically the question is can
quantum computers help with floating
points decimal representation infinite
floating points
the answer is I don't know maybe there's
a way I haven't seen anything about that
so far in theory I would say it is
possible because you could choose some
kind of representation within the Blas
fear where each points on the sphere is
a possible value and that in theory at
least would be infinitely many values
measuring those is a bit more difficult
because you get either 0 or 1 so I can't
think of a way to represent infinitely
long binary number floating point
numbers off the top of my head but that
doesn't mean that there isn't a way to
do it yeah
okay so basically how do you represent
numbers at all in a quantum computer
basically the same way at least you can
do it the same way you do with a binary
computer because when you measure your
values they will be 0 or 1 you don't get
a value on the sphere you get 0 or ones
with certain probabilities there may be
better ways of representing numbers in
quantum computers again I don't know
it's something you can certainly look
into there probably is a better way to
do it but we're in the early stages
where that kind of question is still
something that as far as I'm aware
hasn't been fully answered so you can go
with a basic representation where zeros
and ones give you your results just like
with a binary representation on a binary
computer and anything from mertha
onwards is up to research yep
okay so how do qubits work on a
technical level I'm no expert in this
field basically I can tell you that
there are at least I don't know four or
five different ways in which people have
started building qubits the
superconducting method that is used by
IBM and Google and quite a few other
hardware manufacturers is currently the
most successful method how exactly that
works I'd have to check myself there are
some other ways that don't necessarily
require supercooling and those could be
very promising in the long run because
basically if you want to have a quantum
computer with you if you want to have it
your laptop in your car in your phone
you don't want to have you know a huge
cryostats that you have to carry with
you you don't want to have to call it to
as close to absolute zero as you can get
currently to my understanding at least
those technologies aren't as as advanced
as the superconducting methods and so
we'll have to see where those go does
that answer your question
great any other questions yeah sure sure
with Microsoft yes
with IBM you can run it on a simulator
basically you have two options when you
have your code in the quantum experience
you can choose the simulate button and
then it'll run automatically it will run
immediately on a simulator and you'll
get back your result in no time you can
say run it on the real quantum computer
and they have a scheduling system I'm
not going to get into it it's easily
explained and then they do send your
code to the actual quantum computer they
have in their facilities will run your
code there and after a while you get
back your result and this is actual
quantum quantum computing happening
that's what we saw when I showed you the
results where we had all those errors if
you run it on the simulator you get much
nicer results which is great for testing
but of course if you want a realistic
image you should run it on the real
device ok anyone else yeah
can a quantum computer generate truly
random numbers my guess is yes it can
I'm no expert in randomness I must admit
so you would have to ask someone who's
more familiar with what constitutes to
randomness but to my understanding yes
it can
okay anything else that case thank you
