the comparators talk alright so in the
second half I'm going to move on to
someone higher level constructs and a
lot of this is going to be about what we
call the Combinator methods on the
comparator interface and so one of the
features that was added in Java eight
was the ability to add static methods to
static methods and default methods to
interface and so in Java eight the
comparator methods sprouted a whole
bunch of those and so the idea is that
these what we call the Combinator
methods are useful for constructing
comparators out of out of lower-level
constructs so if you could take some
fundamental comparison operators and
compose them to make comparators with
more complex interesting behavior and so
I've already in the first half of the
talk I showed you some of the pitfalls
you can run into even writing
comparators that compare primitive
values and so you can run into many of
the same problems when you get into more
complicated comparators so the
Combinator methods are really useful
because it allows you to express complex
behavior much more concisely than
instead of writing out custom logic so
there bunch of them here I'm not going
to describe them right here but
basically we have this thing called
comparing which takes a key extractor
and also we'll compare a into long end
doubles we have something called reverse
that will take a comparator and provide
and return a comparator that's the
reverse operation there's something
called then comparing which will
construct a two-level comparator for you
nulls first and those last will provide
special case treatment for nulls and
natural order and reverse order so
natural order is what I talked about
earlier which is a comparator that is
implemented using the compareto method
of the comparable interface and reverse
order is the reverse of the natural
so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
explain most of these in a series of
demos and the demo is going to use a
very simple Java object which I'm
calling player imagine some kind of
online game or have a player who has a
display name players might also have
nickname which might be null and then an
int value which is the number of games
played and then a double value which is
a rating of some sort
alright so I'm going to switch over to
the demo here alright so basically I
have I have often another file I've
something that generates a list of
players it's not really very important
it's just there's really nothing
interesting about the player object
itself and then basically this method
here sort demo takes a list of players
and it's responsible for sorting it and
then so my main method all the way down
at the bottom just gets this list
shuffles and in a particular way sorts
it and then prints it out so if we run
this without sorting I'll just show you
an example of the output Princeton
nicely nicely formatted output here so
we have the display name a nickname the
number of games played and the player
rating and you know they're just some
made-up names here and made-up nicknames
and a bunch of numbers all right so
that's unsorted and so let's set
ourselves a little task here which is
sorting sorting by the display name and
so I call this the long form it's kind
of funny because this is a lambda
expression the long form that you had to
use before Java eight was you'd have to
say you have to write an anonymous inner
class you have to say new comparator
open brace and so forth you know public
int compare and so with and then you
have to write this inside of it so
already this is shorter than it used to
be but basically this bleh name is a
string and string is comparable so we
can compare one string to another so the
way to write a comparator for this given
two values a and B we get the display
name out of it and compare it to B's
display name
so if we run that we can see that this
produces correct results here and so you
can look down the left-hand column it
looks like it's sorted in alphabetical
order and that works just fine but we
can do better than that because notice
there's a very this isn't very complex
but you can already see there's a little
bit of duplication in here the the the
common thing that a comparator does when
comparing two objects like this is get
something out of the first object get
something on its second object and then
compare them either using the objects
natural order or using another
comparator that's been provided so it
turns out that there's a library routine
that does that
it's called comparator thought comparing
and it takes what we call a key
extractor function so I said get
something out of the first one get
something on a second one so that's a
common routine and so instead of having
instead of you having to write that that
method call twice
what comparing does is it says give me
one function that tells me tells me how
to extract the value that you want to
compare I'll call it twice and then do
the comparison for you so that's what
comparator not comparing does okay so we
run run it again and we get exactly the
same results so we get the names in
alphabetical order and what's nice is
that we have static imports so we don't
even have to write comparator anymore we
just say player list dot sort comparing
players display name and so that's kind
of nice because it tells you exactly
what's going on and it's not much
shorter than the lambda expression up
here but I think it reads much better
because it's it's more descriptive about
what it's doing I don't think I need to
run this because it's basically the same
thing as before but here I'm going to do
something different so now the variation
is play your list dot sort comparing
player get display name and then I call
reversed after the end of it and indeed
we can see the output is sorted in
reverse order by the display name so
that's pretty neat
okay so there's another thing here which
is comparing int so here we're calling
get games played which is an int value
and so instead of calling a comparator
for this if it has an int value if you
used objects that was written it would
result in boxing and then using the
natural order comparator of integer so
it's much more efficient if you say
comparing int because then it then it
calls the minute does the in comparison
directly so here we can sort by the
number of games played and so here you
can see that by the number of games
played the it's an ascending sort by the
the number of games played so here's
another one where we have a
floating-point number which is the
player's rating and so again it's
comparing double so we can extract a
double value from each player object and
then compare the double values directly
as primitives and in this case what
we're doing is we're reversing the
comparator so we will revert we will
sort them from highest rating to lowest
rating so you can see the rating of this
highest player and then we have a
descending sort down here so I think you
can start to see the flavor of these
which is that if you have if you have
some you have some value that won't you
want to sort an object on it's very easy
to just really whip together a whole
bunch of different comparators and use a
key extractor method just by combining
mining things in very simple ways all
right now things are gonna start to get
a little bit more complicated so the
nickname let's sort players by a
nickname all right what happens here who
looks like an exception stack trace
right nullpointerexception so what
happened here was that remember I said
the nickname is nullable so what
comparing does the the comparing method
doesn't know any better
it says we've handed it a key extractor
method called get nickname so it says
get the nickname from a get the nickname
from B and then call and compare them
using compare too well
one of those is null and so it's trying
to invoke a method on a null value which
gives a nullpointerexception so we have
to we have to do something extra to deal
with nulls and so for this example what
I want to do is say okay let's just say
nulls will be sorted first for any non
null value so there's a thing in there
in the library called whoops there's it
there's a method in the library called
nulls first so we'll wrap it in that
well we're at the comparator inside of
nulls first and we still get a null
pointer exception why is this so this is
a little bit subtle here because what we
did was we put nulls first around the
outside of this comparator that's
comparing the nicknames and that's
actually the wrong thing what this will
do is if we had a list that had actual
nulls in it then nulls first the way
it's written here we'll sort those nulls
first in the list and then all the
players and we don't want that we want
to deal with a no nickname and so what
we have to do is put nulls first inside
we have to do something a little special
here though which is how we have to we
need to we need to tell need to tell the
sort algorithm how we are comparing that
nickname in order to wrap nulls first
around it to say sort it this way except
treat nulls especially so from the
inside out we're saying we take a
natural order comparator so that's the
in this case the nickname is a string
value so we're using strings natural
order we're saying oh if it's null sort
those first otherwise sort non null
string values in natural order and the
string comes from the nickname okay and
so here that works now so we can see
we're looking at the report the nickname
the null nicknames are all at the top
and then we have a bunch of other
nicknames sorted in alphabetical order
and so that's the result we want from
this one but notice here there's there's
a bunch of cases where people just
didn't provide nicknames so they're all
null and then most of these are you know
typical science fiction style nicknames
but everybody wants to be Spock so a
bunch of different people a bunch of
different people chose Spock so let's
say if we have duplicate nicknames then
we also want to within set of duplicate
nicknames we want to do a further sort
on the players display name so how can
we do that so that's where this new
method called
then comparing comes in all right so
first let me show you the results to
understand it so if you look down this
column here of the nicknames nulls are
still sorted to stop and then Spock's
are all here but notice within this box
these names are sorted alphabetically if
we go back up to the top where all the
nulls are the display names are also
sorted alphabetically so this is a two
level sort so what we're saying is get
the nickname and treating nulls
especially by putting them first sort
nicknames in the natural order and for
nicknames that are equal then compare
the players display name so now there's
a lot going on in there in two lines of
code so what I want to do is switch to
an example of how somebody might write
this incorrectly all right so in the bad
old days before we had the comparator
Combinator of methods you might have to
write this out by hand and I think on
Twitter once I said I get all of my
conference talks from Stack Overflow
somebody posted this questions like why
doesn't this comparator work I'm trying
to sort nulls first and well it's
there's a bug in there comparator and so
this is what the I mean this is kind of
you know they use the different example
but this is basically what they did I
want to sort players by a nickname but
the nickname might be null so first
thing I do is I do not check if the
nickname of a is not null and the
nickname of B is not null then I'll
compare them okay so I compare a
nickname aid a nickname B and if they're
different then I just return that result
but if they're equal then what I want to
do is get the display names and compare
those okay that kind of makes sense
doesn't it well there's this problem
which is what do you do if one of one
one or both of the nicknames is null
well I think the guy didn't know what to
do so he just said no no I guess I'll
return zero there and the the problem is
that that doesn't work right so if you
run this you get comparison method
violates his general contract and I'm
not going to go through the details
there but if you look back at what this
code does if one of the arguments is
null and another is non null it says
they're equal and that's clearly wrong
because we want to sort the nulls first
so here's how you'd write this out
correctly using kind of open logic
without using the comparator
accommodator methods and you know I'm
not going to go through all the cases
but in order to write a method like this
correct that you really do have to go
through all the cases
so if nickname a is null if nickname B
is null then okay then I do my second
level comparison oh but if a is null and
B is non null then a is less than B so
we'll return minus one okay so if a is
not null and yeah right okay so you you
can see when writing code like this it's
really easy to get something wrong like
imagine if you if if if you had another
piece of code that said I want to sort
these in reverse order instead
well you just switch the minus ones and
the zero alright to switch the minus
ones and positive ones right and the
code would look virtually identical
and you wouldn't be able to tell you
wouldn't be able to tell which is which
unless you take through the logic very
carefully or wrote a lot of comments to
make sure that you were explaining it
carefully but the point here is that
this whole how long what is this this is
about 20 lines of code or so this is
exactly equivalent to this two lines of
code right up here at the top which is
what I showed in the original example
comparator well it's similar to what I
wrote in the original example compared
or not comparing get the nickname
sorting nulls first then comparing the
display name so those two lines of code
are kind of kind of like a macro that
expands to this 20 line comparator all
right and oh okay so let's let's say all
right so I ran this I ran this one the
bad comparator and I got the illegal
argument exception so what people often
try to do is they'll say oh it's that
new sorting algorithm that was
introduced in Java 7 why couldn't we
just go back to the old sorting
algorithm and it turns out that you can
there's a property called
java.util.arrays use legacy merge sort
and so that uses the pre Java 7 sorting
algorithm you set that to true and so
now we'll use the same bad comparator
and look at what happens okay remember
we were the the task is to sort
alphabetically by nickname with nulls
sorted first so if you look here well
null kodos Merlin Riker rogue null null
Draco Hagrid these aren't sorted at all
and this is totally wrong
and the if you look carefully they're
sort of sorted because between each null
there's a run of alphabetical names and
then they're a couple nulls and then oh
there's another run of alphabetical
names and then and so forth but
basically this is totally the wrong
result
so I cringe whenever I see somebody
setting this property use legacy merge
sort because it's shutting off the
exception but it also means they're
probably getting the wrong
so I strongly avoid or I strongly
recommend that you avoid using the
legacy mergesort alright so that's the
good comparator I don't think I need to
show you that because it's the same as
the as a previous previous one now
here's a different variation or we're
comparing by nickname with nulls last
instead and otherwise it's the same
thing so here we see that now notice
this is not reversed this is sorting
nulls last so it's treating it's
treating null especially but it's
treating it specially in a different way
so here we have the nicknames in
alphabetical order but the nulls all end
up at the end and so you do that by
writing nulls last and then I have one
more variation here basically so
comparing and then comparing if you just
give them one argument which is key
extractor the extracted result must be
comparable and so my examples are using
strings and so strings are comparable so
so I that's that's all I needed to do
sort by nickname or sort by display name
what you can also do is pass what what's
called a downstream compare what I call
a downstream comparator is once I've
extracted the key instead of calling
compare to on the two extracted values I
can call a different comparator and so
if I wanted to for instance use a case
insensitive sort or something like that
I could pass the case insensitive
comparator or in this case what I'm
saying is the I'll pass a downstream
comparator but instead of using the
default ordering which is the natural
order I'm going to pass reverse order
and so if we run this this will sort the
nicknames nulls last but within
duplicate records it actually will sort
by the display name in reverse order so
anyway so this is just a flavor of all
these different things you can see in
no I don't know how many examples here
you know 15 examples just something like
that it's probably replaces pages of
comparator code so that's the real power
of using these comparator Combinator
methods all right so there's some
wrinkles here there's sort of a strange
duplicate laugh here in the api's so
we've said the compare method returns
less returns a result which is
indicating whether given two objects the
result is less than equal or greater
than so if you the result of a
comparison method is zero what's the
relationship of the result to the equals
method object dot equals and so you
might think well of course those should
be the same thing if two objects here
equal then you're then the compare the
compare function on them should always
return zero and vice versa and so that's
a nice property to have to be to be
clear but it is only a nice property it
is not a requirement and so we say if
equals gives the same result as compared
to equals zero we say that the
comparator is consistent with equals but
it is not a bug if a comparator is
inconsistent with equals or I should say
it's not necessarily a bug all right you
might have written a bug because you
didn't intend for it to be that way
but there are times when it is proper
for a comparator to give results that
are not consistent with equals in
particular a comparator might result in
given two different values might result
in zero saying that they are equal at
least in terms of the comparator but if
you call equals that is object thought
equals on them that might return false
so that's what we say is when a
comparator is inconsistent with equals
and so there's an example of this in the
JDK
um bigdecimal bigdecimal has a scale
which is essentially the number of
digits and so one point zero and one
point zero zero are not equals
according to objects thought equals but
if you compare them they have equivalent
values so compare returns in the zero so
there's another there are some
consequences for this and so if you read
the comparison if you read the
comparator specification it says that if
you have a comparator that is
inconsistent with equals a sorted set
will behave strangely because it
violates to the general contract of set
and so an example of that is with tree
set which determines ordering and
membership comparisons using a
comparator instead of dot equals which
is the general contract upset so let me
bring up some demonstrations here have
demonstration in J shell which will so
you can get through this pretty quick
okay so I'm gonna use this half up
rounding mode a little later on so let's
say alright so the easiest way to
generate the decimals is to use a string
and so this is one point zero zero zero
so I'm going to generate two two values
here so we say a.com compare to here I'm
using the natural ordering one point
zero zero zero has the same value
compares equally to one point zero zero
zero zero so numerically that makes
perfect sense if you say a equals B
result is false
ooh that's kind of weird why is that
well the reason is it's very important
that well it's potentially very
important for big decimal to to obey
numeric consistency properties so you
might think that values that are equal
will give the same result when the same
operations
farmed on them in fact this is not the
case right so if we say let's create a
new new value seven here and so if we
say if we say one point zero zero zero
divided by seven with rounding mode of
1/2 up that gives us Oh point one four
three and if we divide one point zero
zero zero zero by seven we get point one
four to nine and so clearly these values
are not equals to each other but most
importantly these values are now
numerically different in in one case the
first value is actually numerically
larger than another so anyway so that's
that's an important reason why something
like big decimal it's not even though
the comparison the natural order
comparator sorry the natural order
comparison for big decimal is not
consistent with equals this is one of
the reasons that that it isn't because
they really are different because they
have different scale factors that affect
different that provoke that caused
different results to occur given the
same rounding mode all right so then
there was that line about tree set
behaving strangely so let me create some
sets here give a set of big decimal
create a hash set and then create a tree
set here alright so we'll create two
sets and then I'm going to add one of
these numbers to the hash set and
another one to the tree set and so if we
look at these sets oh sorry oh sorry
that's the row I wanted to print out the
hash set so we have hash set contains
that one and the tree set
contains that one all right so let's
compare the sets themselves for equality
so the tree set says that it is equal to
the hash set okay but what happens if we
do the comparison in the opposite
direction oh boy that's weird alright so
what's going on here is that the way
that equals set operation works is this
wants to compare itself to something
else and so when what what this object
does is it is it iterates over the
objects of the other set and then uses
the Equality comparison used by this
object and in tree set it uses the
comparator so it's using the comparator
to determine whether these values are
equal and if they all are then the set
is equal and so as we saw earlier the
comparator says that one point zero zero
zero equals one point is equal to one
point zero zero zero zero but the hash
set does the opposite thing it calls dot
it well the in the opposite order it's
getting values out of the tree set but
it's using dot equals to do the
comparison and what do you know one
point zero zero zero zero is not equal
to one point zero zero zero in terms of
object dot equals so that's why the hash
set says false and the tree set says
true so is this a bug it certainly
counterintuitive behavior but this is
what the spec means when it says your
your what did I lost my place here this
is what it means when it says the sorted
set will behave strangely because you
will get inconsistent results so you
have to be careful about this one all
right so I did that demo basically I
don't feikin so basically in Java 7 a
new sorting algorithm was was introduced
that is more sensitive to correctness of
comparators and let me see if I can run
through this in about one minute all
right I have to skip a bunch of stuff
here but basically the heart of
the Tim sort algorithm is it does
merging of consecutive runs and so here
we have on the left an increasing run
and on the right we have another
increasing run and so what it wants to
emerge it says oh the low end of the
right run is greater than the lowest
elements of the left run so in fact when
the merge is done those left four
elements will stay in the same place so
you don't have to do those merging at
all and same at the high end it says the
highest ones on the high end of the
right element they're about the right
run can be trimmed out of the merge and
so what happens is this establishes an
invariant between the runs which is that
the high end of the left run must be
greater than the high end of the right
run and if in the middle of the sorting
algorithm Tim sort detects under certain
cases that that is not the case that's
the point where it decides to throw an
exception and it can only happen if the
comparator has a bug in it all right so
here's the summary use the library avoid
writing custom comparison logic if
possible if you do write logic you have
to be very careful go through all the
cases make sure you understand the rules
otherwise you might get an incorrect
sorting result or you might get the
exception thank you very much
