invite our first keynote speaker he's
been a longtime friend of mine he's also
our MC of the week so you'll be seeing
him quite a bit
mr. Chet Haase where is he
there is house Wow and he's wearing a
tie so I didn't think he no you don't
normally wear a tie right no no that's
what he does he's a business consultant
and I'm really I mean I'm really
interested in what I learned I mean
chatter welcome to DevOps first of all
thank you thanks very much very happy to
be here it's all yours man all right
let's see what I do with it so I like to
that was awkward but not quite as
awkward as a selfie with 500 people in
the room observing a moment of silence
for a selfie there are a lot of things
in the world right now that we could
have had a moment of silence about but
that one was for the selfie I like to
think that I wasn't chosen randomly to
be an emcee just because I happen to
have a talk that was going to
immediately follow what I'm doing right
now
in fact I've actually been involved
happily involved with devoxx for years I
kind of wanted to find out how many of
you have been how many people have
actually been to DevOps okay so probably
a quarter of the room which is pretty
good it is by far my favorite small like
non company run Developer Conference
because it is run by and for developers
not only is the content really good the
speakers are really good they worked
very hard at the committee level in the
organization level to bring in really
good speakers in content and whatever is
popular and trendy and developers need
to know about at any given time it's
always had a java focus but it's always
invited content from other types of
technologies I have actually been
speaking at TEDx conferences I think
since 2005 in Antwerp
on at while I was at three different
companies on three different platforms
that I worked at and they were always
welcome at the conference because that's
what the conference does these were the
things that people needed to know about
and so it's wonderful this year to see
DevOps
in the US because I think this kind of
conference this kind of content needs to
be here and also I don't have to travel
all the way to Antwerp the side benefit
is that the weather is usually better
here
unfortunately they brought just a little
bit of Antwerp with them today so that's
unfortunate but at least it's not
raining in here one of my favorite
things about the conference is that they
like to play with the forum they like
the developers to enjoy and to learn but
also to actually have fun at the
conference this dates way back to before
I got involved with really innovative
crossing the line videos that they would
use to to announce and advertise the
conference and just things that they did
with the content and the organization of
the conference themselves you'll see
that in a few minutes with the keynote
something really interesting coming up
from Janelle Klein and you'll also see
it in the types of talks that they allow
speakers to do like this presentation
now business technology business
technology business technology business
technology business technology business
technology business technology business
technology technology business
technology technology business
technology technology technology
business I'm Chet Haase welcome to the
business of technology business
technology or as I like to think of it
there's a talk I'm doing and I'm Chet
Haase I think it's useful to give
everybody a little bit of context about
the speaker so that you understands not
only why you are here but why I am here
here's a bit about me I am a
technologist I am also a businesses I am
a speaker Asst which is clear from today
I'm also a speaker about business
technologist I'm also a slide bullet
Asst bullet list bullet lift twist I
also have an education I do have a BS I
have an MBA from Harvard it's in Chico I
have professional affiliations which
matter here's one with a lot of letters
associated with it I'm also an I
quadruple e I have a bunch of a
professional experience I'd like to tell
you about I am a founder of course of
process methodology specialists PMS I
was also the founder of specialists of
process expertise what's spew
unfortunately didn't last very long
my similar company bilateral
implementation of legalese expertise
where Biol
also unfortunately did not last very
long I don't know why and I'm also a
partner in the partnership of partners
pp also similarly short-lived and I make
a great cup of coffee
a little bit about my company I think
it's important to give you as much
context as you can possibly bear process
methodology specialist consults on many
things such as process methodology and
specialist ization and we also make
coffee I have personal interests
actually I don't I focus on process and
methodology and consulting and if you
want to find out what else I do you're
free to hire me I think it's important
for an audience to understand where a
talk is going so it's really good to
have an agenda that you then follow
everybody has a mental model of where
the talk has been and where it's going I
think you'll agree that we've covered
the introduction we've talked about me
and we talked about the agenda now I'm
going to define some terms for you I'm
going to have some content in the middle
which I call the middle section then I'm
going to prove to you the premise of
this talk I think it calls to action are
always important and finally there will
be a conclusion we may have time for Q&amp;amp;A
at the end if not you're free to come up
and ask me about me later but what do we
mean by the business technology of
Technology business or actually is that
important isn't it more important to say
what do I mean by this because you know
what I'm the one that has the microphone
so let's take the word business and
let's think about the roots of that word
we can break it into two roots but
before we do we should just look at the
core work itself a word itself business
obviously comes from the Latin busyness
which means the act of looking busy
because admit it is it more important in
business to do things or to be seen
doing things and the second part of the
word of course is nests which comes from
bottom-feeding monster
the other word of course is technology
we can break this into its four routes
techno log e tech comes from the Latin
for teach to educate others know comes
from the Greek meaning know log of
course is an abbreviation for logarithm
obvious and why why nots
so if we put these terms together we
obviously come up with the following
definition bottom-feeding monster is
looking busy teaching things besides
logarithms and why not so what do we
mean by the business of Technology
business technology when we put more of
these terms together it means the same
thing I just put more words there for
emphasis
all right we've covered some definitions
and now on to the middle section of the
talk I want to hit you with some charts
and some data so here's an interesting
graph we can talk about business
technology trends we have some
interesting numbers on the Left I don't
actually know what they mean on the
x-axis we have time going from before
time to now right so time progresses as
you go to the ask me later and I can
explain the technical details first of
all we can look at the growth of
populations so there were exactly zero
people in the world a long time ago and
that zero continued for quite a long
time until the following occurred people
figured out how to reproduce the act of
reproduction contributed significantly
to the growth of population I go over
that later again if you need more
details now we can make a look at the
growth of business business continued at
zero growth for a very long time even
after reproduction probably because the
people were busy but then at some points
business picked up well what was the
event the invention of money you can't
have business you cannot have trade
without having currency to trade with
then business started to pick up but
there's another inflection point in the
graph where it goes up at a steeper
slope and that was the invention of
computers then business really picked up
computers
I would posit is a term in technology
we'll get back to that later now if we
overlay one other important piece of
data onto this graph we can take a look
at the growth of Technology again that
maintained zero all the way across until
we got to computers and at that point it
picked up but it had a steeper slope
inflection point with the invention of
phones now people not only had computers
but they had computers in their pocket
and they had multiple devices there's a
couple of interesting things I want you
to note about this graph one is that
business and technology grow and go
together
another is that there's way more
technology and business in the world
then there are people because everybody
has multiple devices and who really
cares about the number of people anyway
the other thing I want you to notice
about the graph is that the slope of
people was going down over time so with
the growth of business and technology
people got very excited about something
besides reproduction let's go over some
mountain some more data here this is
important I talked about the growth of
Technology in business together now I
put this into a very complex chart that
illustrates this exactly we have
business on the x-axis technology as
you'll see on the y-axis and again some
units that I don't really care about now
if we take a look at the growth of these
two elements together we can see the
following this leads me to the
conclusion that more business leads to
more technology now there's another way
of looking at this so I'm gonna hit you
with another graph here where we have
technology on the horizontal or what I
would call the x axis and we have
business on the y axis and again the two
grow together do you see something
similar there now this leads me to the
more interesting conclusion that more
technology leads to more business is
everybody following me here I see some
nods in the office in the audience but
I'm not sure it could be sleeping all
right so this leads me to the premise of
what I call business technology
circularity more business leads to more
technology but here's the key and the
other way around too
and this is a quote by me you can quote
me on that just be sure to attribute it
so here's a way to illustrate this with
an interesting chart we have business
and we have technology and the two are
linked in the premise of business
technology circularity and I Ellis trait
this with a very tricky animation that
took me hours all right
everybody getting the point there all
right back to the agenda you can see
that we covered the middle section
effectively and now we're on to the
proof sure you're saying I get all these
slides this is really complicated data
that I'll have to think about later but
how do I know that you're actually
telling the truth well you know what I
can prove it to you first of all let's
take business and then let's take take
technology they share a lot of things in
common but you know what they share in
particular in common is a single letter
now what happens when we think more
deeply about that letter well as a
technology person I know because I
looked it up on the Internet that E is
exactly equal to the following series I
haven't a clue what this means but it
did come from Wikipedia so it must be
right but more importantly this series
equals approximately 2.718 okay people
want to write that down this is a key
fact that you can write down put in an
email to your office back home e
approximately equals 2.718 it turns out
that that is almost three meanwhile pi
equals 3.14 to about which also almost
equals three so we have proven that
2.718 equals 3.14 to and I would put
forward to you that the following is a
bunch of numbers which are also known as
digits and we have just described
digital technology
on the other hand we have also described
the relationship between the variables
it's a technical term asked me later of
e and pi e equals pi and if you put
those two together they spell a word
that is huge business this is what I
call business logic on with the agenda
we've obviously proven a bunch of
important things and now we have the
call to action for all of you what does
all of this mean for you I know what it
means for me I build my customers with
this kind of information but for you
let's take a conference right we're all
here to attend a developer conference so
I went through all the talks in the
conference I used a very complicated
mechanism of reading the titles and
writing down some of the key words and I
wanted to pull out those key words and
think about the kinds of technologies
that we're all going to learn in the
next three days we have Java we have
server we have numbers we have
developers we have system all these
complicated words right you can learn
all this kind of technology in the next
three days and all of it is in fact
technology at the same time there are
also important business terms that I
pulled out of those titles words like
challenges
words like methodology one of my
favorites words like explore all kinds
of business terms and there's also very
interesting filler words that are
important in business there's commas
there's all kinds of prepositions and
you put all of those together and it's
clear that we're also going to learn
about business so we're gonna learn
about technology and we're going to
learn about business and when you put
them together here's what it looks like
so what is the call to action I would
say up to you to go to those talks to
hear those things and to learn that
stuff about technology and business and
you can quote me on that now if we go
back to our agenda you can see that we
covered the call to action we're on with
a conclusion business
technology business technology
technology business so we've covered the
conclusion and it looks like we have
just about four minutes for Q&amp;amp;A if
anybody has any important questions for
me I'd be happy to answer them or Bill
you later yes is there a business
technology business technology business
there is now I will be forming it
immediately after the conference and I
will be billing for you later thank you
great question
yes sir you have a question about the
mic yes can we have people use the mic
so we can have it on the recording can
we can with these please have people
speak into the mic so we can use it in
the recording I appreciate very good
speech yeah I know you thought about the
most popular in a hot technology going
on right now yeah the most popular
something technology yeah most popular
something technology is clearly the
technology about something which is a
huge field in the valley especially in
Silicon Valley there are all kinds of
companies doing all kinds of technology
about something in fact many companies
have now technologies about anything
some companies attempt to have
technology about everything those
companies usually fail what you need is
something in particular and it could be
anything at all next question a second
question okay my question is about
artificial intelligence and machine
learning and e-learning it's very hot
right now so I want to yeah and
e-learning and machine learning machine
learning is a very trendy topic in which
many companies are making a lot of money
in business about the learning of
machines thank you
okay and that wraps up the Q&amp;amp;A no no we
have one more well not really related to
technology but I'm very impressed with
your rhetorical skills have you ever
thought of running for office not until
now I used to think that it took a great
deal of skill and intelligence to do
that but you caused me to reconsider
what's the money like all right thanks
very much it will go back to the agenda
we can see that we've covered the QA and
thanks for coming
appreciate you sitting still and nodding
with appreciation or sleep doesn't
actually matter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
