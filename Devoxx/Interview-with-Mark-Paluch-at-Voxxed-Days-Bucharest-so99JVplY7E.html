or maybe it's just on my side and with
this the big kind of spring five relief
and spring data very much depends on
that yes and so I Catherine I'm
regrettable to be here with you and
you're right there's a little bit of
excitement going on with a spring five
because with spring five we are lifting
the baseline to Java 8 we are moving
forward in terms of compatibility with
Java mine jigsaw is a topic we have a
huge topic around HTTP 2 and perhaps the
most exciting topic for me is going
reactive and that's the talk I'm going
to give I'm talking about a going
directive with spring data so a lot in
the standing of reactive is to maximize
resource use use it and when it boils
down to data this means to take a very
detailed look what's what's actually
going on when you access data see if you
if you stick to today's programming
models they tend to make some
assumptions about resource usage and in
particular this might be something like
web application a request comes in to
the application it goes through all your
service layers and then you request data
at some point and we're doing this by
having exclusive threat users which
means this threat is occupied by your
application and if you take it even look
what happens after the data echoes well
it's going on the network remote side is
processing it and while this is all
going on your thread is dark and cannot
really do useful work and that's exactly
where reactive programming and
comes in because we're active
programming we no longer tend to make
assumptions about the underlying
execution model but rather declare in a
functional way what we want to achieve
and this works out pretty well with data
access because we knew no longer block
threats which are which were previously
occupied by waiting on data but rather
we make a request and then we
immediately go on to the next task where
we can perform useful work and that's a
big bikini new thing for spring data to
that oh and we are going to support
MongoDB Redis Apache Cassandra and
Couchbase with a spring that to that oh
that again we have to wait on string 5
under it's going to be released
perhaps mid and well we the thing is
with today's drivers which also are also
opinionated on the execution model we
have to perform a shift and that we are
no longer able to use the old locking
drivers all made a legacy but in fact
it's still a good solution for most of
the news cases today but but for active
data access we have to use non-blocking
asynchronous drivers that you use a
nonworking socket so we simply arrive
the data out to the channel and are not
obliged to wait for a response that the
driver is taking care of that and to be
honest most of the drivers were using
our based on net evasion is an excellent
event-driven communication framework and
as soon as the database responds we pick
up the response and at the next slot we
are able to process it we push the data
response back to through the application
and processes inside the application
management that people have to do well
you
if you care a lot about AB and if you go
down the reactive room then you have to
take a very detail you look on the
threat tools and the resources you are
going to use that in the case you're
just starting off with that you do not
have to worry about that because every
driver comes with a default
configuration which is pretty ok for 80%
of new scales and if you start tuning it
to your environment you have to take a
very well reactive is a is a huge topic
besides of that we are going to adopt
the compatibility with Java 8 which
means that we are all already able to
use then data types like like the stream
data type on our public API for spring
data repositories we support that for
quite a while because we can rely on
user defined interfaces which are not
backed into our own code base and with
spring data to that o we can use streams
on on the template API we can finally
make things really nice
we can work with optionals take
advantage of the functional approach in
java 8 and we are going also to to clean
up a couple of things and we found to be
useful with this release because that's
that's - that oh release we will break
certainly a couple of things so that's
also some housekeeping tasks for us
thank you
it's a lot of fun and every day we are
progressing with the community towards
improvements getting better getting
feedback on particular things and it's
really fun to see the whole evolution
but I think the most important thing to
not forget is although we are doing
reactive reactive isn't the answer for
all the problems it's an answer for very
specific set of problems and sometimes
it's really better to stick to the
blocking API because that's less complex
for your application
thank you very much thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
