and I would like to welcome you all on
this lovely spring day to today's very
stark I appreciate the opportunity to be
here in front of you and to be able to
talk to you about how robots are
planning to take over the world
well hey sorry about that this guy was
supposed to be here okay no we're not
gonna talk about these good robots even
though everybody thinks about that when
we told them we are in the we're working
in the robotics department we are now
going to talk about robotic process
automation or our being for short of
yours about me I'm gonna be a enthusiast
an RPN developer that believes in the
potential of automation to improve
people's lives and I also think that our
PA is a great tool that will enhance
automation it will bring it to the
corporate environment and will make
people's lives even better I've been
doing process automation for a while now
I've had I've used so many solutions
across these years and it has been a
wild ride technology has been involved
in the sector like crazy I love
technology in general I spent hours and
hours looking at different tech news
hubs reading on the next best thing in
tech and I love Excel I know this must
be strange for you but it's probably the
Stockholm Syndrome speaking I've been
using it for too long but I do love it
you can build some really cool things
with it and I don't like pictures as you
can see from this slide and the horrible
picture on the Fox web site okay let's
get back to our being I'm going to try
to show you a video today let's hope it
works it has it has a pretty big it's a
great starting point up it lists what
RPE is and it helps us avoid what RPE is
not so let's take a look at the video
robotic possess information on our PA
the next productivity revolution don't
get left behind the body process
automation has the potential to
dramatically improve customer experience
by reducing errors extending services
speaking of processing and enabling
employees to fill some customers with
trickier issues to generally require
human intervention
the reality presses the science-fiction
RPA is not a humanoid robot is not
something that can entirely replace
humans is not purely just another cost
play is not something that replicates
human cognitive functions yet our VA is
configurations that automate manual
repeatable tasks our pas of the rhythms
that solve specific problems our game is
software robots that plug into and
accessing scene business software our
pieas workflow enables interaction being
relatively simple to implement our PA
can deliver benefits quickly and deliver
a return on investment of over 300% it's
relatively simple to implement we'll
take a look at that later on
who in the room has heard about RP okay
that's quite a few we're gonna take a
deeper look today so you're probably
gonna find some other useful information
as well
okay perfect so process automation is
not something new
let's have been around for a while but I
believe right now we are in the middle
of the perfect storm that's gonna bring
automation to a whole new level
processes have been growing at the
organizational level as well as the
number of applications and now we have
the tools with which to bring all of
this together the digital work force the
digital work force is the means with
which our PA is going to help us is
going to help empower individuals to
become more creative to focus on the fun
aspects of their job and not do menial
simple repetitive tasks all day our PA
can automate almost all applications in
a corporate environment and beyond if
it's rule-based
its repetitive you can do it on the UI
or not chances are you can automate it
using RBA the market has been growing
rapidly in 2016 it was 250 million
dollars right now it's expected to reach
1.5 billion and it's also expected to
grow very rapidly many believe we're in
the middle of the fourth Industrial
Revolution and like revolutions that
preceded it it's going to help grow
income levels globally and it's going to
improve the quality of life for many
people and I think our PA plays a very
big part in that so these are today's
main talking points we're going to look
at where did our PA come from what is
the digital workforce how does it work
where is it being implemented and what
is its outmost potential
okay so RB is a revolution and an
evolution it all started in 60s with
scripting done in the 80s and 90s
business process modeling high-level
programming languages came along and it
all kind of came together and in 2003
the first players on the market came
through a blue prism and automation
anywhere where the first ones to start
RBA practically invented it and then in
2005 uipath was assembled as you might
know you iPad is arena stardom and
they've done some really cool things in
terms of financing they managed to get
in 2017 around 30 million dollars in
financing and just this month another
153 million and also reaching a market
valuation of more than 1 billion so
that's really cool
war infusion is another tool worth
mentioning in the space they were once
of one of the first to try to integrate
a AI and machine learning into RA as
well as providing a service software as
a service platform for our PA ok jontron
Deutsche Bank CEO also mentions that
automation is a great tool to empower
individuals we shouldn't be moving
papers around we shouldn't be crunching
numbers we should be focusing on the
attractive and fun aspects of our jobs
and right now we have the tools to do
that we just need a bit more
revolutionary spirit ok of course
digitization has other advantages robots
are available 24/7 they cost a lot less
to implement and run than traditional
back-end integrations of course there's
a human error involved
and they can do things faster okay so I
think this is the main question for
everybody today
how does it work I'm going to open up
the prism I'm gonna take it to through
one of our latest automation projects
and you can see it work and we will also
perform a let's say automation life with
you I'm gonna start to replicate one of
the actions that are integrated in that
particular process okay so the simple
prism and structured into processes and
objects processes just provide a
high-level logic that integrates all of
the actions incorporated in the object
so objects onto applications processes
tie everything together ok so we have
this workflow that's supposed to help us
populate some data into a SharePoint
site and also get some data from another
source so I'm gonna run this and at the
end it's gonna send an email to my boss
here so let's hope towards
so that's opening the share of my site
now it's going to open the other source
searching for the person
and then it's importing the data into
the SharePoint
it does that just like the normal human
would on the interface
and once everything is filled in it's
gonna print it as PDF and it's gonna
send it to the person who requested this
form
and knows how to handle errors it's
gonna close that it's gonna see you then
close it perfect that send the email
were from complete now it's getting
ready to move on to the next item and
continue processing awesome so I'm gonna
move on to the next step oops
it really wants to work okay so I'm
gonna open an object so as you can see
this is like a drill down into the
actual process these are the actions
that are mapped for a particular
application you have one object for
application in which to map all of your
let's say interactions with that
particular application and then you can
just call them you can just select the
application select the action you want
to pour and that's it it's basically a
puzzle okay so we're gonna create a new
action
I'm gonna call it get info and the first
step we need to do is start a new
Internet Explorer browser okay
so we need to launch the browser I need
to get the path just a second
oops
so it needs to know where Internet
Explorer is
okay now we need to navigate to the
correct URL
again we need the URL
and of course we need to wait to make
sure that once Internet Explorer has
been launched and finished loading so we
need to check if the document has
loading we have has loaded we have a
timeout in seconds so if nothing happens
in five seconds that it knows to throw
an error hey something is wrong somebody
go and check it and of course once we
navigate to the website we need to do
the same thing okay so once we got to
the website let's see if we can get
there
so it's waiting for the website love now
it's gonna navigate to do it perfect
wait okay so now we need to spy elements
this is how it works
each spy a particular application
element using the application modeler
and then you can integrate it into your
workflow click identify and then it sees
all of the elements on that particular
page control click it and it lists all
of its attributes now this is the tricky
part it's relatively simple to implement
but you need to know some ground rules
you need to know what attributes you
select how to change them how to make
them dynamic so on and so forth so that
you make sure that your workflow is
stable and can handle almost everything
you throw at it it doesn't finish
processing before it should okay so you
need to unclick some of these click
others depending on what you're trying
to establish with that particular
element so I'm gonna name it
okay and then I can just drag it in here
and I can activate it I'll just misspell
that okay so after I just need to write
some information sorry
we can use a writer select the element
again and give it a value of course you
can have it in a data item that lows
from its tone source good
okay so right address good so now we can
continue our workflow stage and let's
see it at work
so we have the vowel there now we need
to click search again we're gonna have
another navigates stage click search
I need spy element
the standards above me
okay
and then just drag it in here we have
some actions that are predefined based
on the type of element okay so now we're
gonna click search
great now we have our first result the
nice thing to do is open that window so
again we need another navigate stage
open result
not the element
okay so we need to unclick all of these
links because they're not going to be
relevant for future searches we just
need the elements position on the
website we made sure that we helped only
one hit by searching using the email
address which is unique so our element
is only is going to be the first one in
this okay I forgot the name it nevermind
it works just as well okay and then we
open the result
result open now we need to read some
information from the screen so using a
raid stage so we're gonna call it read
lips center then we need the mouth that
particular element
awesome
call it
costs are
so reading it get current value and then
we can generate the data item that's
gonna house this information again we
need another reader for the manager not
the element
perfect
click the links
and then just
for that disposal
and we need a new day writer wanna call
the value from elementary okay
let's heat treat these values
and as you can see these data is now
contain the values on the website the
last thing we need to do is to loops is
to navigate to that search page again
and we have ourselves an automation
workflow that was it and I think it's
really cool you can do a lot of things
really quickly and that was will presume
every tool has its advantages I'm not
gonna get into that I know there's a lot
of things are there that's my next
talking point actually I'm gonna show
you how you iPad that's the same thing
great okay so we're gonna watch another
video
yes it's you iPad now you can see that
they basically have a similar approach
the only thing that they add is that you
can record your movements just like you
would record a macro it works and it
doesn't it's a lot better to write your
own codes than to record something and
you obviously need to go back and redo
some of the attributes that were
captured during the recording but it
really does a good job and you're gonna
see it process some invoices in SA P now
now the robot opens the S ap application
and logs in using the username and the
password which is encrypted after
logging into s AP and what searches if
the vendor exists by going to the
vendors tab
so it doesn't checks previously to make
sure that it's typing the vendors name
and checking if there's an entry for
this vendor in SA P in this case the
vendor is already registered in the
system so the robot clicks okay and
fills in the company code then it
selects all information and clicks okay
now the robot goes back twice it then
types FB 60 the code for entering
incoming invoices in SA P no in entering
vendor invoice pane the robot selects
the vendor by its name and starts
inputting the data extracted from the
PDF when watching this you have to
remember that this is done in debug slow
mode the actual robot is much faster
depending on the application loading
speed in the background mode when
working with PDFs or Excel applications
the robot does data extraction and
processing almost instantly
okay so you've seen the code on the Left
we've seen that do some actions on the
right
it's basically RP okay the third tool
that door gonna showcase today is
automation anywhere they went a
different route it looks like regular
code you have some lines of code you can
still drag and drop them from the left
side panel and configure down but they
do like like they do look like lines of
code so let's see this one in actually
okay so now that you guys have seen
these things in action we can take a
look at a bigger picture so what can we
do with RBA basically you can automate
any application that you can find in the
corporate environment then beyond if it
doesn't talk negatively with that
particular application all of these
tools have OCR embedded in them so they
conduce surface automation and they can
find that particular element just by its
picture we don't need its attributes and
of course you can handle multiple
applications at the same time I've seen
projects where we've had twelve or more
applications that were needed in a
single workflow and it's really cool to
see all of those small complications
being opened at the same time and the
robot working in them
and of course it's non-invasive because
hey it's fronting automation you don't
need to talk to back-end so you're not
gonna have a lot of those security
restrictions that you will have when
attempting a back-end integration and of
course it's fast I've seen projects
delivered in less than one week you can
have projects that take one or two
months depending on the process
complexity and how mature is your r-va
deployment like I mentioned before once
you map out all of the actions from a
particular application it's just like a
puzzle you can just plug them in but
first you need to map them so that's why
at first it takes a while before you
automate your first processes but then
things get easier really quickly and of
course there are also challenges you
need to make sure that should digitize
your inputs it cannot look at a piece of
paper and tell you what is there you
first need to go through an OCR software
and digitize it so that the robot can
process it the processes you want to
automate need to be stable it doesn't
make sense to automate something that's
gonna change next week so you need to do
some due diligence before you
select your candidates for automation it
has to be rule-based and it doesn't have
it shouldn't have a lot of impact that
something goes wrong at least at first
before you get accustomed to what our PA
can and cannot do what are its possible
errors and so on and so forth
and this is another fun example from
practice a lot of organizations have a
lot of restrictions on who can get
credentials to a particular application
imagine asking a what to get credentials
so there are little things that you need
to think about before deploying our PA
and you still need support staff and
maintenance personnel the robot will
fail if you have significant UI changes
or if application functionality changes
somehow or simply the application is
just not available so somebody needs to
take a look at that and contact IDE and
get it fixed before restarting your
robots okay
isn't this a nice clean looking slide
I'm going to start reading all of that
information no you're not gonna you
don't have to read the slide the reason
I have this up there is that I want to
show you guys that it's not a new thing
a lot of industries have adopted it
already in a lot of departments and a
lot of processes have already been
automated with our v8 it started out
with the core set of processes that are
common to most industries but then
slowly but surely it branched out into
industry specific processes like meter
reading galatians example
okay what was the impact of our piay in
deutsch Abeka
this happened in less than two years I
think the numbers speak for themselves
we have more than 5,000 transactions
being performed per day in 24 different
applications by 10 different robots and
if you factor the time it took to get
everything set up in that's a lot okay
it all started in 2015 when the project
was initiated it only took a year to get
the first PLC up and running so you do
have some growth pains that need to be
addressed before you can start
implementing our PA and several
automation initiatives later a hundred
thousand transactions have been
processed by robots in just the first
thirteen processes so you can see a lot
of return on investment and right now we
are growing at a very fast pace a lot of
the legacy applications where our PA is
most proficient have already been mapped
so most processes when we start to
automate that we just plug in all of
those actions we previously mapped adapt
them and voila
we have a new process and in the future
things are just gonna grow we have agile
teams that deliver new process
continuously we are working with OCR
software right now to digitize other
inputs so that we can find new
candidates for automation and we plan to
extend internationally okay I love this
picture it really highlights our PAS
potential as you can see it all started
with orchestrated automation which is
basically scripting macros business
process modeling and it was the
on a single application it couldn't do
multiple applications so that's why we
have our Pina
you can do cross application automation
using complex rules you basically mimic
what a human does on the front-end and
we are just at the verge of cognitive
robotics which is really cool
both uipath and blue prism have
integrated API is from Microsoft
cognitive services Google cloud IBM
Watson and we can do some really cool
things now we can do complex OCR natural
language processing really cool stuff
and in the future we're not going to
even program the robots they there are
gonna train themselves or we can train
them we can even give them voice
commands like this choice kind or
protect John Connor things like that
thank you I hope you enjoyed learning
about our DNA and if you have any
questions now Stan</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
