make sure we're here at debit CK and I'm
going to meet you he's going to talk
introduction to cut them by example can
you tell me some of the differences
between cutting and Java that really
strict strike here is important well as
a joke the biggest difference if you
look at the code there are no Sonia :
okay this is like the most important
thing you can get from the language yeah
well it decide from this and maybe
biggest biggest differences there is
type inference local type inference for
example so it's less verbose yeah by
default all the variables are final
classes are final there is a big feature
which is malleable types so if you have
variable certain type by default all
types can be now with encoding
infrastructure so you have to be very
explicit about what is now can be now
not the biggest difference and in
general just lastly both data questions
and so on and so really sucking la
because here your talk is it's no
stretch them to cut them to discourse
tuning to you about that because we're
not really showing any code and we're
talking about Colin you're like I'll
show you but and so maybe instead we
talk about where do you think is missing
from cotton or what you can get kind of
lacks that you'd like to see well the
most of this thing's string literals
satelitte rolls and maps but it's going
to change so that may be added right now
okay let's see okay let's do a cut in
Whistler which state yeah
performance fixes and latest version
it's not as fast as it used to be so get
this month number one on the wishes
well then literals become so that's
pretty much along relatively happy with
the wages so yeah no complaints no
complaint which we think is important
for Java developers to learn about
cognitive they're thinking about using
just like start using it I think on the
way yeah she likes playing musical
instrument if you talk about playing the
guitar it's like maybe I should actually
turn dangerous I go online there is a
website you can like run in your custom
code online you can go to the website
you can even to install anything cool
it's pretty easy ok make it do it makes
sense</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
