talking to Marc Reinhard who again needs
no introduction hello hello and so you
gave the keynote about Java 9 which
thank you by the way for the release of
German Ireland congratulations thank you
it's very happy that it's out there so
one of the things that you mentioned in
one of the big topics at the moment is
the version numbers and the new cable
release cadence every six months so
we're now looking at Java ten in six
months and then we're in about a half a
half so much so I'm thinking back from
him starting the clock from September
and then the next long term support
release of Java is eleven right so at
nine is not a long-term supporters so
why is it important that people adopt
every it's important for people to go
through every version of Java to upgrade
each time a new version is released or
should people do you think people should
follow the release cadence yeah I think
it depends on how you're using Java if
you're if you're using Java in a way
that you you package up at runtime maybe
using j-link the java linker to make a
custom runtime image with your
application then you using the very
latest feature release makes a lot of
sense if you're in a more traditional
enterprise deployment kind of scenario
where you've got you know an app server
and you know a shared java runtime
that's shared across many many
applications then it could make better
sense to stick to only deploy the
long-term support releases but even in
that situation where you're only going
to migrate these confidence big complex
production systems once every three
years I think it's still critical that
you test with every feature release even
if you don't deploy it we we will in
future releases deprecated things need
we will deprecated something for removal
and remove into the next one we're not
going to wait until the next LTS
otherwise we won't have solve some of
our some of the problems we set up to
solve
with this model so as well as testing
with each version should people be
concerned that there is shorter release
shorter support models for the more
minor versions of Java so the thing
about the support models to understand
is what I've proposed is mainly around
what I think makes sense in the open JDK
community where many contributors not
just from Oracle come together to evolve
the JDK it might be that contributors in
the open JDK community to decide to do
something even longer terms and what
I've suggested may be somebody that
somebody decides to come up and
volunteer to do you know five years of
support on every single feature reads is
that likely probably not but it could
happen it kind of it all depends on who
shows up so that's one side of the
support model story as far as there
isn't the real support comes you know if
you really want support then guess what
you need to pay for somebody for it and
maybe you pay Oracle maybe you paid Red
Hat maybe you pay you know some other
companies that provides builds based on
open JDK maybe if they IBM whatever
that's where the real support comes from
and you know Oracle at least if you are
willing to pay enough will support you
for essentially forever you know the
support is is not something trivial it's
not it's not zero effort it actually
takes quite a lot of effort to maintain
an old code line so you know I think it
it makes sense for everybody
contributing an open JDK to agree on
what makes sense in the context of open
JDK as the upstream of practically every
other JDK in the world but then we all
need to understand that there will be
paid support offerings from many
different places and if that's what you
need then you should be compensating
somebody for it
and finally we spoke in the keynote
about it works fine on Java 9 are you
talking about Java 9 deduction
are there any libraries that people will
find that they can't use the Java 9 or
is it is it generally is the consensus
that that people should move to jabber 9
and not be afraid to that their favorite
library will break so there probably are
some libraries that still don't work on
9 I don't know offhand what they are but
what I what I did show in the keynote
was a list i generated by asking on
twitter just a few days after Java 9
shift I asked on Twitter if you maintain
a library framework or tool that works
on JDK 9 today late please please tweet
it and along with version number and I
compile the list and it's a long list I
mean what I showed on that slide is just
part of the list it just the highlights
of the things that are really popular
but it includes it includes all the IDS
include in includes tests ng and J unit
all the build systems and and many many
popular libraries includes the entire
spring framework so we didn't we've been
really pleased that a lot of people have
proactively looked at their code made
made usually the small number of changes
that are necessary to work on Java 9 and
publish that so I think there's there's
already a good you know a good wave of
migration happening and hopefully a lot
thank you very much thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
