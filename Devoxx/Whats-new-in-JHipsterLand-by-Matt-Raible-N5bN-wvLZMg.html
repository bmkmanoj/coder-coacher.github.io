the sticks I grew up in the backwoods of
Montana no electricity no running water
and I had to walk two miles to the bus
stop every day and yes it was uphill
both ways I have expensive obsession
with Volkswagen buses and ban against if
you have a similar problem I'd love to
talk to you afterwards I work for a
company called octa Shh not allowed to
talk about the company but I can talk
about our EP is we have a number of
authentication standards we support such
as a lot to open ID connect in sam'l we
have a blue booth that's out in the
exhibit area we got a ton of t-shirts so
they aren't as cool as this one but
they're pretty cool they got an O on
them and if you stop by we'd be happy to
give you one we basically offer a faster
speed to market because you can
basically use our API and get your
authentication needs out of the way so
now I'd like to know a little more about
you are you a Java developer raise your
hand okay everyone in the room all right
do you like JavaScript we got one two
three about half the room what about
typescript is that any better for some
folks mmm one okay anyone using angular
1 angularjs no one anyone using angular
2 one guy okay has anyone used a hipster
before all right we got one you guys are
in for a treat
so what is J hipster J hipster is a
yeoman generator so it generates a
project for you has a spring boot
back-end and an angular front-end and
you can do it with angular one or you
can do it with angular two our angular 2
support is in beta which means you might
find some bugs the angular 1 support has
been out for several years works really
well is not that many bugs there but I
have used angular 2 on a couple projects
and it works well so J hipster is an
open source project and if you look at
our web statistics from February you'll
notice that 500 thousand page views this
is both from the website itself and the
github repository so it's it's really
popular 39,000 downloads just last month
and as far as github is concerned you
know six
300 stars 309 contributors so the thing
I really like about the project is it
does a really good job of motivating
people to contribute it's not supported
by any particular company there is a
company called upon they're from France
and they have an e pond USA division as
well and they employ a number of
developers that work on the project and
the user there's like a training device
to get people up to speed on a lot of
these technologies but if you want to
buy a support contract you couldn't buy
it from then I will happily sell you one
if you want to buy one from me but no
it's not something that that usually
happens because it's just a really good
open source project it's very active
there's a lot of people working on it so
you really don't need a support contract
I did meet someone at a conference a few
weeks ago that was required to have one
as part of this company they couldn't
use open source unless it was a product
that could be bought so the same thing I
told him he could buy it from me if you
wanted I'd send them an invoice so they
have a number of policies for the
project that I think are really good
policy number one is that policies are
voted on by the development team so
that's good
we try to use the default configuration
for any framework that we use so we have
all kinds of stuff in there
elasticsearch you know spring boot
gradle maven so we try to use the
conventions that that project already
provides and not do any customization if
we don't need to we only add options
when there's sufficient value added from
that option and for the java code we
follow the IntelliJ formatting and
coding guidelines and then the thing
we've really learned is use strict
versioning for any third-party
dependencies so whether it's in your
package JSON file for NPM or for yarn
versus maven you know don't use ranges
because developers break things between
semantic versioning releases right even
though they're not supposed to it still
happens so we've we've just locked
everything down and every release it you
know locks it down between them so
downloads J hipster 4 was released on
February 2nd and you can see we had a
huge spike then we've had eight releases
since then and 450,000 total downloads
and like I said 40,000 in January so how
do you use J hipster you install J
hipster in yeoman using NPM so NPM
install - G yeoman is called yo
I think it's a great name because you're
just like yo create me an app and it
does it and then you create a directory
and CD into it this is one of the most
important parts if you're a Java
developer which sounds like most people
are you're probably used to like using
Grails to create a project or maybe a
maven archetype and when you do that it
creates a directory for you and it puts
everything in it
j'ai hipster doesn't work like that
yeoman doesn't work like that you have
to actually have the directory created
or it puts everything in your current
directory so that's like the worst
nightmare with all the dot files that
you end up with in your home directory
right so make sure and create the
directory and then CD into it and then
you run yeoman with yo j hipster and
that's the power of yeoman you know
pretty cool tool that you know generates
it all for you the one thing I also like
is the whole yeoman generator that
generates all these files is written in
JavaScript so it's a very low barrier to
entry for a lot of people that want to
contribute to the project that's why we
have over 300 contributors and then
here's what it looks like after you type
that it basically prompts you with a
whole bunch of questions you'll notice
we also make sure and put the folder
name in there where it'll be generated
so we hope people see that you know if
it's in their home directory maybe
they'll recognize it there and stop at
that point but we we prompt for which
type of application you can do a
monolithic application you can do a
microservices application you can do a
microsoft says gateway so microservices
gateway uses a spring cloud support and
you know proxies to the backend micro
services and then you specify the base
name what do you want to install other
generators and then package names and a
whole bunch of other stuff without which
I'll get into so the title of this talk
what's new and JE hipster LAN the
abstract of this session reads in this
session and learn about what's new and
JE hipster possible topics include
angular 2 progressive web apps HTTP 2 J
unit 5 and spring 5 so I was I was
pretty ambitious right when I wrote that
abstract I thought all these were
possible within six months and and
unfortunately the angular stuff took way
longer than we expected it was pretty
good idea that we started in like July
and August because angular had
stabilized by then did anyone use any of
the release candidates that came out
like last summer or spring because I use
those in those
like they broke things between the
release candidates like you don't do
that or you're not supposed to with
release candidates right so kind of a
painful transition but we started in
August and it was just there's a lot of
code there there was a lot of JavaScript
vote code for angularjs and so there's a
lot of refactoring work to make that
work and then also we had a lot of
problems with tests right no one wants
to write tests they just want to get
features working so once we had the
features then we had to write all the
tests and that just took a long time and
if if you have ever tried to do
angularjs and angular in the same app it
doesn't work well with protractor so we
had a lot of issues there we didn't know
if everything was working so it's kind
of painful headache if you ask the the
main guys that wrote that angular stuff
they're not as happy about angular as
other people are progressive Web Apps is
not something we've included in angular
but progressive Web Apps is basically a
way of having an app that sits mostly on
your phone and you can install it as an
app it also works in Chrome on your
desktop but it's a way of basically
specifying that that app can work
offline and you do that with service
workers and service workers can
basically cache network requests and so
this is nothing that we've like
prevented you from doing and JE hipster
but if you wanted to do it then you
would basically have to install some
service workers and make that work I've
got a few tutorials out there on the
storm path blog that shows you how to do
that
and http2 I'll show you how I made that
work j-unit five as far as spring
support for it since we use a lot of the
spring annotations to do testing that's
a spring boot thing so in spring boot to
toe comes out it'll support J unit 5 but
there's no reason for us to try to make
J unit 5 work when we're still you know
not on the latest version of spring boot
bootstrap for even though that's an
alpha release we're using it in the
latest version - J hipster seems to work
well they should probably make that
abate in and get it out there and that's
that's the biggest reason that we call
our angular to support beta is because
it is dependent on some libraries that
are alpha or beta releases they're out
on NPM but they're still you know not
like verified as we're ready to go so J
hipster 4 is built on angular
and one framework mobile and desktop and
if anyone's used electron it's pretty
slick I've actually had a couple angular
app set only with like four maybe 40 or
50 lines of code I was able to take that
and turn it into a desktop app that
basically starts up with the chromeless
you know browser and and you could ship
to someone and as an installable app and
it just works really well so electron
has done a good job of making that easy
of course you can also put it on your
phone and make it a progressive web app
J hipster doesn't really prevent you
from doing any of that we just don't
have support for it explicitly right now
and part of the reason for that is we
have a real focus on the backend a lot
of the guys on the team are actually
like Java developers or they're like
docker experts or their continuous
integration experts we do have people
working on the UI but there's there's
more of a focus on the backend so
personally that's one of the things that
I want to add because I really like UI
development so I hope to do that over
the next six months get that progressive
web app stuff in there get the electron
support in there so HTTP - the key
difference between it and HTTP 1 it's
binary instead of text textual it's
fully multiplexed so it allows you to
actually send multiple things down at
the same time you can use more than one
connection or you can use just one
connection for parallelism header
compression is a big thing if you have
fat headers and then allow service to
push and do notifications so in J
hipster we've added this code that
basically allows you in properties to
set it up so undertow is our default
servlet engine you could also use jetty
if you wanted or you could use Tomcat
but you would lose HTTP to support so we
have it configured in here to expect you
to use undertow but you'll notice
there's an instance of so if you use
something else that won't blow up and
then in your properties for our
application dot yeah Mille you'll say J
hipster HTTP version you'll specify
version underscore to underscore zero
and then part of HTTP to is you do have
to have SSL enabled so you do have to
configure SSL on here and then you'll
get into the situation where maybe you
don't have your spring boot application
as your edge server maybe you have a
patchy or something like that or maybe
you're deploying to Heroku cloud
then you have to configure it on those
servers right so you don't really need
it on this server you kind of need it on
your edge server so that is something
that can be a problem and I've done some
research on seeing if Cloud Foundry
supports it to see if Heroku supports
HTTP 2 and whenever I've asked basically
what happens if someone gives me a
private account says we've turned it on
for you so that's not really supporting
it that's like hey we're in beta right
this is kind of working so I do hope to
write a blog post and do a lot more
research on that and really find out if
it is supported I know
AWS supports it cloud front supports it
so once you do that you'll see down here
this is just a feature of you know
Chrome's developer tools where it's got
the protocol there each to and it'll
show you HTTP 1.1 versus h2 so you can
see that it is working so I asked about
g-unit 5 this is about a month ago it
appears that you can't upgrade you know
Java hipster to gta5 and that was
confirmed spring boot 2.0 and so there's
actually a session on that Thursday at
noon ll 21 be on J unit 5 the new
testing framework for Java and Java
platform so if you're learnt if you're
interested in that that's on Thursday at
noon with Mark Philip and then spring 5
the themes there are JDK 9 jigsaw HTTP 2
servlet 4 and Kotlin and functional
style and reactive architecture so
that's that's kind of a big deal for J
hipster because it could be as big of a
change as angular 1 to angular 2 in the
sense of you know rewriting a lot of the
spring stuff to be reactive and to you
know be non-blocking and so there is a
session on that as well that's right
after this one Josh long if you haven't
seen him he's great speaker that's in
Grand Ballroom 220 a so just a couple
hops over
that's unreactive spring so basically
with J hipster if we want spring size 5
support we kind of have to wait for
spring boot 2.0 and I don't know if we
want to use a milestone release and
actually release that right put it out
there and it is quite a lot of work to
be like hey do you want to use spring
1.5 or do you want to use 2.0 so we'll
probably just wait until the end of the
year when they do their GA release
before we're supporting that
hopefully we all have time to learn it
and implement it so spring boot 1.5 is
latest release that's what you have in
there and a bunch of new stuff including
constructor injection I don't know if
anyone's used constructor injection with
spring probably most people but you know
property injection was a big thing and
that's still fine and tests but with
constructor injection now you don't even
have to put any annotations on the
constructor so as long as spring can
resolve those dependencies in its you
know beam context then you don't have to
use auto wired you don't have to use
inject you just put the dependencies in
the constructor and it kind of cleans up
your job a little bit so that came out
in Spring Framework 4.3 and and you can
use that very easily with spring 1.5
there's also Kafka support there's some
cloud found new actuator extension
spring data Engels which is latest
release of spring data and LDAP support
if you're into that and then there's a
logger end point but the loggers end
point is something that J hipster kind
of had because you'll see when I do a
demo that you can actually hit the end
points and tweak the logging and so the
great thing about that is we've had
similar situations like spring boots
Kassandra support where they add it or
make it official in their project and
then we get to delete code from J
hipster right that's a great thing so
hopefully we can do something similar
with the loggers end point and then the
thing I really like a spring security
4.2 support so the reason I like it is
they've added the ability to auto
register dsls so a spring boot there's a
spring dot factories file that like
points to your auto configuration
classes and spring security now is
something similar so for a company like
storm path or octo we can actually have
these custom dsls that register our
security configuration I did a blog post
last week about doing that with sam'l
for spring boot and they basically the
spring security project has a sam'l
extension that they've used to do that
so when you write your spring security
code in Java you're writing like you
know a very elegant DSL that looks
pretty nice
so with bootstrap 4 it's the most
popular HTML CSS and JavaScript
framework in the world for building
responsive mobile first projects on the
web that is their tagline I don't know
if it's really a JavaScript framework
because it's kind of like more of a CSS
framework right and they use Jake
anyway but basically it allows you to
make buttons look good but for me it was
a real boon to my productivity as a web
developer because it allowed me to get
away from you know fighting about how
things should look it was just like hey
if we use bootstrap styles or if we use
bootstrap theme then we can kind of just
use those standards and I like to
compare it to iOS and their human
interface guidelines for the iPhone they
basically said hey just use this and
then it'll look good on the phone and
now people have branched out and made
their own apps a little different but it
kind of leveled the playing field for a
lot of you know HTML developers where it
was very easy to style things because
you had this framework in classes and
it's grid makes it easy to layout
components and columns you can see here
you just use rows and columns classes
and you're not really using any custom
components like you might with angular
you're just adding classes so pretty
easy to understand so there's a number
of build tools we ship with both maven
Gradle wrappers so if you need support
for maven and Gradle and you don't want
to actually have it installed on your
system the wrappers take care of that
you don't have to use them if you don't
want to we do expect Java to be
installed with angularjs we use gulp
with angular we use webpack and then for
the web dependencies to download them
all angularjs uses Bower and then the
angular support you can use NPM or yarn
yarn is from Facebook
it's a competitor or you know a similar
tool to NPM but it actually caches the
results and so it's much faster and
scale like Facebook they needed
something like that
it stands for yet another resource
negotiator there's also a yarn project
that's part of Apache Hadoop so that
stands for the same thing yet another
resource negotiator so they'll probably
another one of those some days and how
do you know if a build tool is any good
it's got a logo so web pack provides a
magic between behind angular sass
typescript in JavaScript and module
splitting so it does all that work for
you to basically optimize your images
compile everything down to JavaScript
and it's a driving force that makes
JavaScript development possible these
days a lot of people are using it in
their Java Script projects what I've
seen is it's cool but it's kind of slow
so more coffee breaks right so you get
to you
compile your code and go away it is
getting faster and it's getting faster
quickly but it does take like a few
seconds to reload stuff and with
angularjs often you do weren't compiling
any JavaScript right so it was just like
instant reload so the cool web pack
features I've seen is there's a bundle
analyzer that will actually tell you how
big your bundles are so you might have a
vendor bundle for all your vendor
classes then you might have different
parts of your app that use different
bundles and then you can lazy load those
so you don't end up with a five megabyte
download in the beginning so that's kind
of a cool tool all you have to do is
install it and configure it and it'll
tell you where your bundles are and this
dashboard shows up in your browser and
tells you you know where your errors are
instead of being like in your actual
browser console so that works pretty
well so since we only have 25 minutes
left I'm gonna give you two options we
can either do a basic j' hipster demo
where i build a blog application and
we'll try to get it deployed to Heroku
that you know will probably move on and
hope that works in the background or I
can do a micro services architecture
demo where I basically generate a main
gateway application and the micro
services one in the backend and I run it
on docker composed locally so micro
services regular blog demo ok micro
services we'll move on from here so not
only is Janet J hipster generated app
really cool but it also has really cool
or clean code you'll see here we have 81
percent coverage of the actual code
that's produced so this is of like ten
thousand different projects on sonarqube
and and we're one of the top two that
has like really good coverage
maintainability security and reliability
what else is new we also have libraries
now so this is something that I've been
kind of against but people aren't really
complaining too much so we're taking
some of the core parts of the JavaScript
that people don't change much and we're
putting into this NGJ hipster project
and we're taking core parts of the java
code that doesn't change much and we're
putting into the j hipster project so
those become jars or they become NPM
dependencies and basically you have less
code to maintain within
project so we're just experimenting in
that with that right now there's not a
whole lot of code in there but we're
just seeing what the community thinks
because when you generate an app a lot
of times what I've seen from my days
with that fuse is people want to control
all the code right they don't want any
libraries and there's the libraries they
want it from like spring or hibernate or
something like that
and so they want to control everything
but you end up with this app that's just
you know got a lot of code in it like
10,000 lines from the get-go and so if
we can take that away and you don't have
to maintain that and that makes things
easier there's also something that's
really bleeding edge that just came out
this week and that's a react module
Deepu is one of the main contributors to
the project he's a co-lead and he's been
working on this for about six months but
it's really starting to shape up and
look good you can see it looks a little
different it's got the menu on the left
but he is making progress and if anyone
like to help with that if you know react
on me certainly looking for assistance
so in November 2016 thought works came
out and had a bit to say about languages
platforms techniques and tools so I
wanted to see how a hipster stacks up
with those so if you look at the
technology radar of languages and
frameworks you'll see spring boot is
right up there at the top as far as
adopt so yes we got that one the
interesting thing is there is no mention
of angular or angularjs except angularjs
is on yeah it's on this list but it's on
hold
so you don't see it on on this
particular one so they're recommending
people don't use angularjs for new
projects but they're not recommending
angular either so if you believe in
thought works radar that is something to
consider
we do have react up there so our new
module might support that the modules
thing is something that we actually have
a marketplace for and what it does is
allows people to contribute plugins
basically to Jay hipster for instance I
wrote one for storm paths I'm writing
one for octa and it makes it very easy
to not have in the core project and you
know a third party developer can
maintain that so as far as platforms are
concerned we have docker up here we have
kubernetes Cloud Foundry so J hipster
has support for docker kubernetes Cloud
Foundry and Casilla
Indre I like that Cassandra where is it
at it's called carefully cassandra
carefully that's not in the name of a
product they just say it's a great tool
and we like it but too often we see
teams running into trouble using it we
recommend using Cassandra carefully
teams often misunderstand the use case
for Cassandra attempting use as a
general-purpose datastore when in fact
is optimized for fast reads on large
data sets based on predefined keys or
indexes so be careful with Cassandra
techniques Jenkins and pipelines is code
Jenkins supports at now and we do
support Jenkins and then API as a
product so we have that at octave but
it's not really you know something with
J hipster you do create an API and you
do talk to it from angular so it is
there and then anemic rest is down here
on hold so that is something that J
hipster kind of does so you need to be
kind of careful about that and that's
basically exposing your database tables
as raw endpoints and not having like
aggregate objects and stuff like that so
it generates crud for you right it
generates create update delete and all
those screens for you but it doesn't
actually you know conglomerating in 2d
TOS that is an option but it just
doesn't do that by default and then
tools console is up here and what's the
other in Kafka let's encrypt obviously
any web framework will and support that
and then web pack is also right down
here in trial we support all those so
not too bad you know J hipsters using a
lot of technologies on the radar if you
want to do a continuous integration with
Travis Jenkins gitlab or circle CI
there's a module for that a sub
generator we call them with with yeoman
that you can type yo J hipster colon CI
- CD and it'll generate those
configurations for you so it's very easy
to set it up on continuous integration
you can also build micro-services
architectures with J hipster so the
architecture works where you have
basically a gateway which you see up
here and this this needs to be updated
for angular but it's still in beta and
then use dual and you can use ribbon for
basically throttling and then access
control you can use a J hipster UA a
server you don't have to but you can and
then you'll have it one too many
services behind there and then this is
to do monitoring with je hipster console
we have the elk stack in there so we can
see performance monitoring and see
what's going on and then as far as a
registry that listens for the
micro-services registering and the
gateway registering we support both je
hipster registry and console by hash
accord and deploying to production you
can use Cloud Foundry you can use Heroku
kubernetes AWS and AWS and Bach views
there's basically generators for all of
those so you just type a command like yo
J hipster : Heroku and it generates the
Heroku configuration uploads it to
Heroku and it all just works and I put
this picture at Josh long up here
because production is his favorite place
to be so before I go into the demo with
docker I wanted to show you how to
deploy it to Google cloud with
kubernetes so you can actually take a
mana list so the recommendation
generally is that you don't start with
micro services right out of the get-go
you want to start with a monolith and
then once you have too many people
working on that monolith then you start
splitting it up so J hipster does
support that you can basically take your
monolith and change just a few
properties in a dot u - RC JSON file and
that is like the metadata for the
project that J hipster uses when it
generates the project so it has all the
choices that you made and then you can
create a micro services app and generate
the entities but your micro services in
the backend and it needs a UI so that UI
sits on your gateway and it talks to
that micro service in the backend and
I'll show you how to do that and then if
you want to run it locally you'll need
the J hipster registry locally and then
to deploy using kubernetes you can
create a subdirectory alongside your two
apps you know your gateway and your
micro service for instance and you run
Joe heaps J hipster kubernetes in there
and then you create a Google Cloud
project you do some stuff with g-cloud
create a cluster authenticate and then
rum cube CTL to deploy it all that so if
you're familiar with kubernetes and
Google Cloud it's much easier than if
you're not so one of the things I did a
couple days ago as I create a screencast
that shows all these steps and it's
about 15 minutes long so
we could do it here but the problem is
to really show you like how long it
takes is painful because you create
these docker images and you upload them
to docker hub and then you do stuff on
google cloud and it takes a while to to
make happen so that's why I wanted to do
the screencast as I can cut out like 20
minute delays and stuff like that so the
screencast time takes all those those
short things out or those long things
out and then you can do port forwarding
from Google cloud locally so you can see
the J hipster registry and make sure all
your apps are registered and then you
can also scale micro-services app so
that's pretty cool feature so micro
service is with docker let's look at
that if I forget to marry my screen let
me know but I think I got it
so we'll make a new directory will call
this devoxx us and then what I'm going
to do is I'm going to grab this existing
project that's a blog demo and basically
allows you to enter you know blogs and
entries and stuff like that since it's a
monolith I want to show you that it's
pretty easy to convert that to a gateway
and then I also need the J hipster
registry there it is
clone that I like to just call it
registry it'll move the J hipster for
demo to be name just blog so now we have
those two and now we'll create a third
one called store this will be our micro
services application I'm Lu yo J hipster
so you'll see it you know tells us using
408 but there's a new version out but
they release new versions like every
three days so the last thing you want to
do during a demo is like upgrade to the
latest version so I'm not going there
but you can see what type of application
would you like to create sorry about
that
monolithic micro service application or
gateway or a user authentication
authorization server we're going to go
ahead and do just a micro service
application the base name will be store
we don't need any other generators from
the J hipster marketplace are you
running in a micro services architecture
so it knows that if you're in a micro
services architecture you're gonna have
some on different ports right so it
prompts you with the next one it guesses
80 81 we'll just use orgs a hipster
store for a package name what type of
authentication would you like to use
we'll go ahead and use jots this is
actually in the spec for JW TS that
you're supposed to call it jot j ot and
then we'll use J hipster registry for
service discovery and configuration and
then we'll go ahead and use MongoDB
right why not and then we'll just use
maven because it's easier and my blog
application has internationalization
support and it's got English and Spanish
so I'm going to do the same in this one
just so the error message is there
anything that comes back from the API
matches and then I don't need anything
else so it's gonna go ahead and generate
that for me and then I'll go to the blog
application convert that to a gateway so
I'm gonna open up in IntelliJ and
someone asked me recently about that
idea pom.xml command if the latest
version of IntelliJ installs an actual
command line tool you can also do idea
space build.gradle and it'll open it up
and you know configure the project for
you so that's kind of handy if you're
not using the latest version you can
also create an alias that points to that
so it's a nice way to open up files from
the command line so I'm going to change
a few things in here I'm gonna change
each cache to hazel cast all right
change service discovery type to eureka
and application type to gateway and then
because that definition is there with
all those choices in there we can
actually just run yo j hipster and it'll
generate it again but also we have
entities that we've created there's a
blog entity there's a an entry entity
and tags entity so if you want to
generate those again so they show up in
the menu and there's a pretty cool tool
out here called jdl studio that allows
you to create a schema or a way of
generating your entity so when you do
crud generation with j hipster you can
do yo j hipster : entity and then an
entity name and it prompts you what's
the name of the field what's the type of
the field is there any relationships and
so it goes through this kind of long and
tedious process but you can also use
this jdl studio and define your entities
here and their relationships to each
other you see here's a many-to-one down
here from blog user login to user and
from the blog name to the blog and so
it's nice because it provides validation
if you mess anything up and tells you
that hey these files aren't here and
then you can download that and actually
generate you know your project or your
entities from that so it's a pretty
slick way to do it and there's also
these jdl samples we've started creating
so you can see here there's the one for
blog there's an online shop and here's a
bug tracker so great
for demos if you need to do one of your
company or local meetup or something
like that so it prompts me to overwrite
the readme as well as the number of
other files so I just said I wanted to
overwrite them all and so there are some
files that have changed in here so
you'll see there there's a whole bunch
but there's some that I know I over
wrote before I change the business logic
so not all blog not all people could see
each other's blogs same thing with
entries so I'm just going to revert
these changes and then also with entries
and the component then we'll do auto
import and I think that's still running
so I can actually yeah that should be
okay to let read but now what we need to
do is create I used I just call it
docker so in here you do yo J hipster
docker compose and it it prompts you
what type of application would you like
to deploy a monolithic or a micro
service so we say micro Service and then
enter the root directory where your
gateways and Mike services are found it
defaults to the parent directory and
then you can choose that blog in that
store and then which applications do you
want to use with clustered databases
since we're using MongoDB it knows if
that's an option I'm going to not select
that and you want to set up monitoring
for all your applications yep you can
use je hipster console we also support
Prometheus so that's a new one I think
it's yeah it's only in the latest
version so use that and then the admin
password I just use the default admin
and then it notices that no docker
images exist so we still need to build
those for the various projects so we
need to copy this command will do it for
store and stores pretty quick because
there's not any UI there or we still
need to generate the entity so
in store we'll go yo J hipster entity
cuz we need a micro service in there and
it's telling me that hey there's no name
it just does it with a long stack trace
does not provide required argument name
so we'll just call it product give a
little more space do you want to add a
field yep and we'll call it name we'll
make it a string well add validation
rules it's required and then we'll add a
price and we'll make it a big decimal
make that required as well and then no
more fields we'll just keep it simple
you can create DT OS if you want but
we're not going to you can also have a
service class between your your resource
or your controller and your repository
we're not going to and we'll have some
simple pagination links so now we have
you know that in our in our store and we
can build that with docker and then
we'll go into our blog and we can do the
same thing yo J hipster entity product
and it prompts us because it's a gateway
now do you want to generate the sanity
from an existing microcircuits got that
in there because i chose it before when
i was practicing this demo so one parent
directory and then to store and you
choose regenerate the entities and so
it's going to prompt you to overwrite
some stuff that's fine we'll copy this
command
and this does take a little while
because of web pack right web packs got
to rebuild a lot of these angular files
that just built so that does take a
little while now we can package that up
the command you can rerun that docker so
DevOps us can rerun yo J hipster docker
compose
so it still needs one for that but
you'll notice this is a command right
docker compose up - D and not
everything's built yet so I gotta wait
for that any questions in the meantime
if I stay silent long enough he'll be
awkward and someone I'll ask one maybe
okay we'll go back to the presentation
yeah
the micro-services support well it's
been around for more than a year now and
so it came out with J hipster 3 which is
released like last March or April and
and it's been used by you know a fair
amount of people that are you know
testing out large scale apps and
everything and one of the biggest J
hipster entities that we've seen it was
Stack Overflow and someone had some
issues with their latest release of
spring boot or something like that and
they had 3700 entities and their project
so some people are generating a whole
lot of code there this is almost done
here and then we'll run it in docker so
the reason this takes so long as it does
do a production build as well so it's
optimizing all the JavaScript it's doing
all the tree shaking the äôt stuff
with angular and it's you know
optimizing the CSS and it's making
everything as small as possible it's
also enabling a production build so it
takes away a lot of the debugging and
logging and you can see a lot of that
was just to get to the I was doing the
you know a typescript stuff not the job
of stuff and now it's running you know
the Java test which you always want to
do when you do a production build
Thomas done
to have docker running you do have to
have it installed and running for this
to work or you'll get through that whole
build process don't try to build the
docker image you know it'll fail there
so it took about three ten we can go to
docker and docker compose up dash D and
basically a number of them like Postgres
it'll pull from the internet so this is
largely dependent on the connection here
so you can see that one that one itself
could take a while
so the shortcut to becoming a J hipster
expert is to just do it
just try it try working with it the
reason I really like it is because it
shows how to integrate a lot of these
technologies together right how to use
elasticsearch with with hibernate and
how to use you know spring boot with
angular and for me I've never actually
used it on a project I wrote a book
about it there's J hipster book out
there but I use it as a reference and
the reason is because before I worked at
storm path and now octa it was very much
I was a consultant and no one would hire
me for a greenfield project right and I
told people I was like you can use J
hipster or you can hire me and it will
take you know twice as long but
basically it's a it's a great learning
tool and I encourage you to you know
create sample apps do some prototyping
with it check out angular 2 or just use
it as a learning tool and so the J
hipster mini book I released the first
version in 2015 at the end of October
the second version was just last
December and it covers angularjs so I
had a small window where it was like up
to date right so if you still want to
use angularjs which is fine
you just ignore the thought works radar
and create your application with
angularjs and everything in this book is
still relevant if you want to use
angular - I haven't written about it yet
I hope to in the next couple months but
it's it's a cool book it's written in
asciidoctor
and I wrote an app called 21 points as
part of that 21 points is something that
I discovered kind of by accident my wife
wanted to do a sugar detox with one of
her Fitness friends and I found out the
day that we started that sugar detox
means you don't get any beer and so I
was like man it's gonna be a rough three
weeks right so 21 days sugar detox the
first week of it you know was hard but I
also ran out of blood pressure
medication and I've had high blood
pressure since I was 22 and when I went
to the doctor then they said you're
probably going to have a heart attack
before you're 35 if you don't do
something about this I didn't even go on
high blood pressure medication until I
was like 36 37 and so you know it was
one of those things that was kind of on
my mind so when I ran out I was like oh
wait till those 21 day detox is over and
then I'll go ahead and you know go get a
new subscription or a prescription and
after eating no sugar for three weeks I
didn't have high blood pressure anymore
and it's the first time in my life
and these doctors tried all kinds of
different pills and stuff and it never
worked so now I have this system where I
allow myself 21 points in a week you can
earn 3 points a day you get a point if
you eat no sugar or whatever your
definition of you know eating well is
you get a point if you drink responsibly
which means you know a couple drinks
maybe a glass of red wine or two and
then you get a third point if you
exercise so what I found for me is if I
get 15 points in a week I actually you
know maintain my weight if I get 18
points in a week I'll lose weight if I
get 10 points in a week I might get sick
the next week so it's great because I've
been doing this for a couple years and I
know when I'm gonna get sick if I have
two weeks in a row of like ten points
like I'm gonna get sick and so I don't
blame Airlines anymore right I don't
blame kids like it's all me it's my
fault and so that's kind of neat so any
questions you can keep in touch you can
contact me online on my blog or on
Twitter I've actually started posting
from SlideShare instead of SlideShare
I'm using speaker deck now but I will
tweet out and show you where I put these
slides and then the code for this is on
github for the G hipster for demo and I
will upload the the microservices demo
as well we'll see if that's done
deploying down here and don't be afraid
to try out try a doctor okay so this is
should be going look we got all those up
and running we got MongoDB running and
so in here there's a kinematic tool you
can use and so things still will take a
while to startup right so everything
might not be like running we can look at
our blog application and you see here oh
that's up and running in our console so
we can look at a few of these if you
don't mind so we can log in to admin
admin and you'll see all the entities so
blog we could create a new blog this
just talks to a Postgres database admins
blog admin admin alright that all works
and then if we were to go to product we
can add a product we'll call it beer and
it's funny the the the actual instances
of MongoDB that docker creates are
persistent you'll notice I've done this
demo a few times and and it's got the
old entries in there I had so there's
bread and ice cream and beer I figured
those would be cleared out but it keeps
them keeps the data in there so you can
delete them if you want but then one of
the cool things is so there's all this
user management there's all these
metrics that J hipster provides for you
to like monitor your application but
there's also this J hipster console
which uses ELQ stack and so this guy has
the ability to look at dashboards that
show like what your apps doing so you
can see an each cache dashboard but
we're using hazel cast now so that's not
in there but you can see you know the
jvm dashboard the total memory that's
being used the heap memory and all that
stuff if you're doing micro services you
need monitoring right because you just
took the complexity out of your monolith
and put it like over the network and so
you're going to need ways to monitor it
so that's pretty cool way to do it your
logs dashboard and what I like to do is
actually use gatling to run a bunch of
performance tests against the
application and then you kind of these
kind of fill in and look a lot better
but that's basically the gist of it any
questions anyone want to talk about
Volkswagens no okay well thanks for
