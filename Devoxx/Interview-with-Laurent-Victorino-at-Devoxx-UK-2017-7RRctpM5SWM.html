devote UK and I'm here as long you gave
a really cool keynote about videogames
but specifically how do you design a
video game where it's not too smart that
you don't enjoy yourself there are a lot
of different techniques to do that
usually when you try to develop a
competitive game like a racing game or
or sport game you we try to develop very
smart artificial intelligence to compete
against the players and once we get
something that is not visible 99 percent
of the time we usually try to make it
just dumb enough to be visible by the
the most the majority of players so how
do you find that special because the
only kind of em thing I've been to do
that is reinforcement learning which is
one of it's a type of machine learning
that looks at it kind of is used in game
playing and I've got as far as finding
out how to program something really
simple to find the optimal path how do
you cut it up in fact how do you choose
that kind of thing with a lot of latest
you you ask you to test your game and to
let players that's your game but if in a
way it's easy to to build a smart
artificial intelligence using machine
learning to to find the best path
possible or things like that but it's
very complicated to to make it be
visible so you have to play this and
play this again recall play this and and
and just change little sliders to make
it miss some some turns or some patrols
will lose some velocity during the the
race and yeah you have to spend hours
latest in your game so I suppose that's
interesting because what you're saying
then is that after you spend a lot
time-coding it there's a huge element of
psychology yeah yeah because every every
game is made to be finished
even very complicated or hard games are
made to be finished to empower the the
players and to make them feel that they
are better than the machine so yes the
the the the the time we spend the most
is in making the game easier for players
and it explains why a lot of games today
are very very easy compared to games we
add 20 years ago because players now
want to to be to feel good and to feel
great and and and so we deliver games
that are usually easier easier to beat
than the games we did before and it
makes me sad because yeah I like being I
like feeling like I'm very good at a
game and most of all I like feeling that
the game is not cheating or trying to
make me believe that I'm stronger than
actually do you think part of that is
that the market for in the gaming
industry market has expanded to include
more people yeah so it used to be a very
nice group of people and although I
always find a few people at a conference
you've also heard of Commander Keen from
my childhood mm-hmm but I wouldn't find
them on the street yeah yeah complicated
but but of course the democracy is very
open today everybody plays I think even
grandmas and grandpas I'm playing thanks
to you too some games or gaming company
and you can play on Facebook you can
play on your smartphone you can play
everywhere so the market is very open
and you as a lot of different gamer
psychology or need that you can fulfill
using different type types of game and
you have some game companies specialized
in very difficult games yeah
and the niche of players who enjoy these
type of games is relatively small but
it's a great opportunity for game
developers to to try to make very hot
game because some players want to play
that and not only you know play tennis
on the Wii with your grandma or
something more easy to do or easy to
play do you find that more interesting
to develop as well the more difficult
game yes probably
because as a player I want to feel that
I'm very good at what I do and again not
because not only because the the Machine
tries to chew to make me believe that
I'm better than I am actually so how do
you find so you've got the fact your
psychologic like a geometric for finding
what's easy in medium and disco
intensive that but when you're actually
training the algorithms that form the
basis of the computer playing the game
how do you actually clip it up is it
that you don't train it as much we from
my expense
I always trying to Train it the the the
more I can to make it real really strong
and just the the settings are changed to
make it easier to get them to make the
difficulty levels so you keep your very
strong artificial intelligence and you
apply different settings the example
with the the racing game is that you
will have very strong artificial
intelligence but it will play using a
different setting a different car
setting so the car won't go as fast as
yours or it won't turn as easily as
yours and I understand so rather than
because I could think of it wrongly I've
been thinking about is that you don't
train it it's not
so you don't give the AI the believer in
this video but you're saying that
actually you you do basically kind of
cheat because you don't you know like
you when you start away from different
positions where the best people start at
the back here when you do when you work
on a game you are always cheating always
um at any level you watching and players
are not supposed to do to know that okay
well we'll finish into that and so we
can to make sure here please person okay
he's make it do it makes sense</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
