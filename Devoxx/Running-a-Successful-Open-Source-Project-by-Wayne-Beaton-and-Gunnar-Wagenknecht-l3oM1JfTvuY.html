in a talk today about is running an open
source successful open source project I
guess before we begin is anybody in the
audience actually currently running an
open source project show of hands no
anybody really want to okay cool all
right my name is Wayne beaten I am the
director of open source project at the
Eclipse Foundation my role there is to
help make open source projects
successful part of that is making
project teams themselves successful and
of course success has a particular
meaning at the Eclipse Foundation I'm
here with my my good friend gooner vagon
connected la mode yeah that's like was
awesome I I look at Salesforce I do have
a very long history and open source
especially also with wayne and the
Eclipse Foundation and my role is as a
developer I try to keep like Wayne busy
with a lot of stuff yeah so oh my flight
okay so go ahead so before we begin its
important to understand what your
definition of success is before we even
start for from any the definition of
success in an open source project is to
have code in a repository that is
publicly accessible for others the
definition is a little bit different and
we'll talk a little bit about some of
the aspects that make things different
but again I guess before you can work
towards a creating a successful open
source project you must know what
successful actually means to you so to
begin that we thought figured we would
lay down a little bit of background
understand what what open source is and
and what when you know how open source
software actually works a typical open
source typical open source software
project really doesn't exist there's no
one single definition
open actually means a lot of things to
different people we tend to think about
about open source projects using a
couple of important words transparency
being one of them transparency is really
the act of working in such a way that
others can pay attention to what you're
doing this takes the form of using a
publicly accessible issue tracker this
takes the form of actually doing
development in the publicly accessible
software repository you know if you are
working on a bunch of code it's behind
your firewall and every time you every
once in a while every month or so you
throw it out to the community and let
the community use it that's not a very
transparent way of operating it's hard
for anybody to really understand what
you're doing if your development is
happening behind closed doors this also
takes the form of for example when you
have a meeting with the project
developers telling people what you
decided in that meeting taking capturing
actual minutes and making them available
in a forum where others can consume them
and again that could be an issue tracker
that could be in a mailing list there's
all sorts of ways forms that that can
take having actual forums where people
can interact answering questions that
people ask those kinds of things are
ways of a project team acting in a
transparent way openness is a little bit
different now I guess it really depends
on the nature of the open-source project
for some people open is the same thing
as transparent open book I guess being
the definition we tend to think of open
as being having a broader definition
open is really more about being open to
others participating in your project we
often talk about there being a level
playing field in an open source project
where by anybody can show up to the
project and as long as they follow the
same set of rules that everybody else
plays along with they get to participate
and a project that's running in a truly
open manner would be receptive to
somebody showing up
new ideas would accept code and
contributions from people who perhaps
work for a different organization a this
leads into meritocracy when people show
up to your project and they actively
participate in your project as they
participate as they demonstrate that
they know what they're doing as they
demonstrate that they're adding value to
the to the project and to the community
you give them more responsibility so
somebody shows up and they contribute
code after demonstrating over some
period of time that they know what
they're doing you make them a committer
so that they can actually write code
directly into the repository themselves
and work alongside the rest of the team
members perhaps after demonstrating
value to the project and understanding
of the project and demonstrating
leadership they may be moved into a
leadership position into the project
again meritocracy is really more about
what people do not necessarily where
they work or other other less important
aspects many most open source
foundations also manage a notion of
vendor neutrality the idea is that no
single vendor no single organization can
dominate the project the idea being that
the foundation will hold the project
maybe hold the project name the
trademark for the project name in trust
for the for the community that forms
around the project so again so no one
develop no one vendor can can attempt to
a coup or take over the project and then
of course we also finally we get to code
and documentation could pry open source
projects are for software projects and
software projects need code and then
rules how do you participate I talked
earlier about a level playing field
level playing fields require that you
define the playing field how do people
participate in your project right and
speaking of people that's actually a
very good topic there there's many
different people in any project
especially an open-source there's also
various roles that you see in a typical
open source project
of course this deal and what we're
listening a few of things let's start
with the owners what does ownership mean
for an open source project now if you
think of an open source project at
github guetta basically it's just an
infrastructure for hosting project the
project really belongs could be belong
to anyone the one that pushes it like a
corporation whatever to believe they
hold to trademark and a source wing so
if they decide the next day they shut it
down or to do to commercialize it it's
gone well they're still the history and
that might be forced but theoretically
that's why that's actually why you have
the foundation right if you if you pick
a foundation for open source project you
would transfer the ownership of those
items to the foundation now ownership
doesn't mean that it all unnecessarily
actually performs the work on the
project by the work on a project it is
performed by committers by developers by
leaders that manage and run the project
could be project management task release
management or or technical architects
that just like make the decisions the
important decisions of the project and
of course any like successful and again
it depends on what what level of success
you define or you want to set for
yourself what contributors is also very
important aspect of open source right
then cuz they create they actually start
building together with other members
they start building the community as a
whole right to have you have people
participating an open source project
collaborating and of course that
requires some rules or some policies
working somewhere to make sure that
everyone follows the same or girls along
the same principle now as when that I'd
like to say it it's more easy to be
transparent to be transparent and to be
open but any any people on those open
source projects can can help make a
difference here and once you have like
once you start building a community and
you realize that
community can be a big a big help or a
big accelerator for open source project
there are people that sometimes there
are people that just love the technology
so they may go out to conference talk
about it and spread the word so actually
it's good for marketing from a marketing
point and also you want to and also the
idea the impact that the community you
have on a cultural perspective is also
big benefit for for your brand for the
open source project itself so open
source foundations provided as we
mentioned before already vendor
neutrality gives a place where you can
go and work without concern for a single
vendor dominating governance models are
valuable governance model may take the
form of a basic structure of how how
projects are organized they may inform
us on how releases are presented to the
community is there a formal notion of a
release what is the structure around
that at the Eclipse Foundation we have a
governance model that's really about
building products in the open source
context and the governance model
provides the background provides the
framework for that governance again
takes that you know defines how we do
reviews it defines who who has
responsibilities and the various roles
and and and that sort of thing open
source foundations may also provide
resources and services I'll talk about
some of the services that the Eclipse
Foundation and apache Foundation and
others provide open source foundations
may also provide marketing support and
other other forms of communicating help
helping projects connect with the
community and and get a message out to
to their to our user community to an
adopter community to a developer
community
and then help people work together and
of course the community doesn't built by
itself I until you have to and that's
also important to realize I mean when
you're running when you when you're
starting an open source project you also
have to invest into your community to
get it off the ground and first well
what not first but like one easy thing
to do is not just like working with your
technology internally but also making
sure that any users out there get the
help that they need this this requires
are in the beginning well actually yeah
in the beginning this requires setting
time aside by developers committers on
the project itself to make sure that
there are if there are any user
questions they be answered to help it
requires some time management but it's
actually very valuable because over time
the users that have questions in the
beginning find answers later and then
those users start helping other users
that's the that's actually in each
situation right so once you enable a few
users building a few especially those
that are very interested in your project
and building like the kind of leaders
and the user community they gain the
knowledge and then they start helping
other users keep them engaged that's
very important and now once you actually
reach and a critical point you have to
make sure that your community is also
great Arlene's I behaving properly but
but kind of like you have some
participation rules that allows everyone
or as long as many people as possible to
participate in your project as Wayne
said already in the beginning this is
also about transparency and openness now
you can be transparent pretty much and
you publish release notes you publish
meeting notes you have internal
developer discussion in and pop in a
public mailing list associated with a
project if people show up with ideas and
you don't like react to them you ignore
them then then
eventually people will go away I guess
like they want to you have to be open to
really even if sometimes it the ideas
might not be the best in the best
interest for for the project or for your
plans for the road meant of the project
last time it chosen it shows interest in
the project and it might help to
incorporate some of those ideas into the
roadmap not necessarily in the way the
user wants them to have but that's it
for example sometimes you can just
implement a smaller thing that enables
other users to build extensions or build
other cool things with your project that
makes them happy and that keeps them
engaged with the project and when people
actually show up and and provide bug
reports don't just ignore them right oh
of course go to conferences I talked
about your project and what happens at
conferences you can connect with your
user basis because very connected the
reception's there's a events where you
can just talk to them it doesn't have to
be confident it can also be a local user
group right wherever you think like you
were you will reach out to user base
just do it okay so we talked a lot about
community another big thing it's
actually is the actual code or called
contributions how to deal with those
that's what we're going for the
remainder of the minute and now when
people start contributing code to you it
can be in various different forms it
might be small bug fixes and it might be
Ashley teachers make sure that when
people do the time in the community and
do the investment to contribute code to
them they are prepared as best as
possible this this breed helps if you as
a project have documented your coding
conventions right so that and people
that submit the buttocks with some know
ahead of time what your wishes are
regarding to code formatting
or or to like naming conventions etc
right also if you run a mailing list
like a contributor mailing list or
developer mailing list that's also a
good way to engage with people that like
to start building on a lot of food
feature right so you can help you can
work with them together on let's say for
example the design and actually
sometimes is yes it is time-consuming as
it as a developer from a developer
perspective but it really helps building
or building the next laboratory open
source project why because you're
showing interest in not just being
transparent but also being open so part
of part of your code is how you choose
to allow others to make use of your code
selecting a license for your project is
an important consideration and it's
something that software developers
that's really not our best thing it's
not our favorite thing to think about
the legal implications but how do you
want people to to to use your code do
you want your code to be used in such a
way that if anybody uses your code that
they must make their code available
publicly as well you know is your
project is your code meant to be used in
commercial products proprietary products
is your code meant to be used only by
other open-source projects so there's
lots of different considerations for a
license selection there's a the OSI
provides a very large list of a long
list of open source project licenses
there is also choose a licensed com
which will step you through how you
might go about choosing a license
there's a fatal flaw in choose a license
calm and that they make it a relatively
hard to find the Eclipse public license
but anyway that's yeah they still
there's still a good resource for
selecting a license but this is the kind
of thing that you need to be careful
about and and getting right relatively
early in the prod
makes things a lot easier especially if
you subscribe to some of our definition
of subject success and you wind up with
lots of people contributing this sort of
leads into another topic a bit later to
is how do you accept code contributions
who are the owners of the code if ever
you have to change a license to do it
properly all of the owners have to agree
to that license change again depending
on the license some licenses actually
have a stipulation for changing licenses
so anyways this is not something to take
lightly something to spend a little bit
of time on at Iran in the project can I
make one remark no go so I whatever you
do make sure you pick an OSI approved
license like don't try to imagine that's
really it's really difficult because
like if you want your code to be adopted
by larger corporations having an oath I
approved license really helped here
right because then otherwise they need
to like get their lawyers and wolves
review the terms conditions that might
be issues then and usually these days
the large corporations they have various
systems in place and if like there's a
unknown license popping up in a project
it's usually a red flag already so there
is a there is a license either the OSI
reviews and will reject licenses
occasionally there's a license that we
run into every once in a while the JSON
license it has a clause in it that the
code is intended to be used for good and
not for evil which sounds really fun and
everything like that and who could argue
with that what turns out lawyers
apparently evil is legally ambiguous so
anyway those are you know again the
Gooner was saying a vanity license
making your own licenses is potentially
problematic anything that's OSI approved
makes it relatively easy for most
organizations to adopt it assuming that
the terms are also acceptable but again
OSI licenses are something that people
understand manage copyright in your
project now copyright is basically who
owns stuff and it's not always obvious
who own stuff some open source product
require that you assign ownership of
your contributions to the project some
do not the Eclipse Foundation for
example does not take ownership of of
anybody's contributions if you make a
contribution to an eclipse project you
still own it so which that makes
relicensing a bit of a challenge but
still you own your contributions and you
are legally entitled to them now again
it's a little bit more potentially
complicated than that as the author
chances are you have an employment
contract which grants all works of the
mind that you create to your employer so
it's more likely that your employer owns
the copyright with the Eclipse project
most of the project do this differently
with the Eclipse project we require that
a copyright statement be put right
directly into the code header that goes
with every bit of source file every
source file I'm showing here an example
copyright 2017 the Eclipse Foundation
now I probably should change it because
the business leading I actually work for
the Eclipse Foundation so if I put a
file header into some things that's the
file header I will do however if you
were doing it you would put your own
company company name then again if
you're contributing to an eclipse
project something that we've been really
investigating and I think well I've
certainly bought in to them and we're
working on that disseminating this to
our broader community is SP DX s P DX is
a way of specifying a license in a
machine understandable way as it is we
do have tools that are capable like
Faust ology for example that is capable
of scanning a code base and determining
licenses based on the text of licenses
and it does a pretty good job but it's
relatively easy to fool when you get
into things like dual licensing
scenarios with SPD X there's actually a
syntax oh so the the the second
highlighted line there s pdx license
identifier this is a standardized way
that an S pdx scanner can figure out
what licenses you are expressing in a
file and there is a syntax for joining
license
so you can say that this is EPL 1.0 and
it is apache license 2.0 you could also
say is there's an or condition if you
pay you can pick one there's I think
there's a condition for parts of you
know certain parts or licensed in
certain ways right so there's a the SPD
X allows us to be fairly expressive SPD
X also has an enhanced file format that
lets you specify a great deal more
information in a separate file so you
can specify who are the actual copyright
owners nature of the code you know
basically could much more information
about the provenance of the code which
is something that again people who are
commercial adopters tend to care about
one of the things and this we run into
this all the time with the Eclipse
projects and other projects generally a
project an open source project is not
itself a legal entity when you express a
copyright the copyright needs to be held
by a legal entity so the project so it's
never going to be copyright the Eclipse
project for example or something else
lines depending on the rules we actually
this is more this is optional for
Eclipse project you can actually make it
an absolute list of contributors
directly in a file header if you choose
we're actually investigating some other
ways of doing an Apache does this and a
separate file you have a notices file
where you can list copyright holders
establish guides in convention so we're
going to mention this a little bit
earlier things like make sure make sure
your project is actually buildable but
more importantly are well as important
as having it buildable is pretty
important but if you haven't if it's
something that can be built by somebody
make sure you have documentation that
describes how to actually build the code
put a contribution guy directly into
your repository this is something I
think github pioneered and we latched
onto this pretty early is right in the
root of your git repository put a readme
file or a contributing file that
describes where do you go to
put issues where do you go to do
discussions how do you actually do your
build all of that kind of information
that anybody who wants to contribute to
your project can actually find and make
use of now there's little things in here
that might be a little bit subtle I
think it's not hard to think about
requiring for a contribution you want to
have unit tests but indicating what kind
of patch sizes are reasonable as a
committer on a project if somebody shows
up with a 10,000 line pack that's going
to take a week for me to review that's
going to take a lot of time for me to
review and make sure that it's something
that's fits with the project it's a good
idea to set expectations say hey you
know if you're coming here if this is
your first time contributing if you
could probably if you could please limit
your patch sizes to a couple hundred
lines something that I can review in a
few minutes 15 20 minutes something that
I can actually you know get a sense
around because if you if you make the
commit too large it's just going to take
too much time and I'm I have I'm
depending on you know who's paying for
my time I may not have time to even look
at that patch let alone try to accept it
right so indicating that kind of
information to your community is pretty
valuable coding conventions coding
styles if you if you have a favorite IDE
having the metadata for that I de that
describes how to do code formatting
included directly in with the project
having the mighty e metadata directly in
the project is great there's some new
functionality with che the Eclipse che
project which is a browser-based IDEs
where you can clone and git repository
and then say chego right and if you
provide the right metadata in your
repository root che knows oh okay I need
to go get this this this and this and in
the amount of time it takes to download
all the pieces you have a fully
functional development environment right
make it super easy for your communities
to to do it we actually have this new
feature in relatively new feature in the
Eclipse IDE called oomph where you can
specify
I a complete configuration and it will
go and pull extra plugins down and
configure preferences and set your
workspace up for success basically two
to get to kiya developing this is
roughly more of a be a good citizen but
I find it's a good thing to include in
your in a contribution guide tell people
to separate their keep their commits
focused the number of times I've gotten
a commit where somebody has reformatted
the whole file and then change two lines
I can't work with that I don't you know
I got to eyeball every line because the
the diff reports that everything is
different if you're going to reformat a
file cleanup tasks are awesome a lot of
project love them but if you're going to
do a cleanup past keep the cleanup tasks
separate from the other the other
contribution if you have to this is the
advice to give and I'm throat and I'm
giving advice to you if you're
contributing to open source projects as
well but keep your patches focused is
the message that you need to send to
your contributors focus on a particular
thing and that sort of thing of course
communication and expectations it sort
of generally what do you expect what
you'll define the playing field so that
people know that you know how to
participate in this level playing field
this one's a hard one for us again as
software developers tracking the whole
notion of tracking intellectual property
is horrifyingly difficult when somebody
shows up with code especially if it's a
very large patch there is some risk
associated with it you need to look at
it with an eye to does this code fit
with my project scope is the code of
sufficient quality but you also need to
say to take a look at that code and
think did they steal this from somewhere
else software developers copy things
that's kind of what we do is part of the
job description if somebody copies a
whole chunk a GPL code and drops it into
your Apache project patchy licensed
project that's a license violation and
somebody could eventually come after
or even worse your customers well maybe
maybe that's not worse I guess it
depends on how deep your pockets are
anyway as you as you accept
contributions you need to have some
sense for for knowing who actually wrote
the code through the people who wrote
say they wrote the code did they
actually write it do they have
permission to actually contribute the
code these are things that are that that
are not generally easy to sort out we
actually have a team at the Eclipse
Foundation and does this on behalf of
our projects and they are superhuman
I've had our IP team come to me with a
printout of some code because they still
print things a printout of some code
that they found in an eclipse project
and a text book and I have no idea how
they made the match between some code
that somebody told ask them to look at
and a textbook but they look they say
what they showed me the code and it said
this is similar it's just just wrote is
this just how you do it right and they
asked me to make a technical assessment
for them and it turns out in that case
it was just sort of like textbook this
is just this is the only way that it
would be done it's just a coincidence
that they did it exactly the same way
but you know we have an IP team that's
fantastic at finding finding these these
problems are you actually allowed to
license the code in the way that the
project team wants it licensed just you
know if your employer says no we only do
things under certain licenses that may
prevent you from prevent someone from
being able to contribute to your project
sorry I keep switching back between how
you contribute to an open source project
and how you tell others to contribute to
yours use a contributor license a
contributor agreement I put the word
license in there and the CLA is kind of
a passing fad now people are moving on
to just a contributor agreement and the
distributor of the DCO developers
developers certificate of origin so
basically have your your contributors
sign an agreement stipulating to the
fact that they own what they're
contributing that their contribute
the appropriate license and that sort of
stuff define an intellectual property
management process you know this is this
is hard and it's something that
definitely needs to be thought of the
Apache Prada patchy foundation has a
well-defined intellectual property
process and they have some resources for
helping helping you sort that kind of
stuff out and then of course nobody does
anything completely from scratch your
dependent on third-party content is any
third-party content libraries that
you're using are they compatible with
your project license that actually might
be an important consideration when
choosing your license initially are the
third party libraries that I'm going to
depend upon are they going to be
compatible with this life and also some
background checks I do the libraries you
depend on do they how do they actually
have kind of a process for all so many
mentioning those so there are third
party dependencies or their
contributions chances are if the project
you're depending on except contribution
by email and copies them there's no way
that they ever gonna be like can track
the route where where the code was
coming from and if the the submitter
actually had the right to submit it this
is all about reducing your risk right so
if you have a process don't do it by
email it it's fine some projects
actually decide not to go foundation but
they still use their issue tracking
system or whatever they have or pull
requests to sort of like establish some
some small process around this so
intellectual property management is is
hard it's easy we were at the linux
foundation's open-source leadership
summit a little while ago and a lot of
the thought leaders in an open-source
are really starting to realize how
important this is and how hard it is to
actually do some things that our
intellectual property team looks at and
things that are important again and i've
mentioned some of these already is a
license compatible is the provenance of
the third party code that you're using
are distributing is the provenance clear
the people who say they offered that
code or the actual authors are they the
actual owners
they have the rights to distribute it
the way that they say that they do and
then integrity is the the actual license
statements in the code are they are they
actually correct is has a license change
i mentioned earlier changing licenses
are hard if you take a whole bunch of
contributions and then the people who
make those contributions are the owners
and you decide out of hand to just
change the license that license change
may not actually be valid so to sort of
keep that sort of thing in mind you
can't just willy-nilly change a license
you need to be able to keep a keep track
of of the stakeholders to be able to do
that and you know as I was mentioning
earlier both third-party content if you
are taking other people's code and
including it with your own you need to
make sure that you're conforming to the
terms of the license but you also may be
accepting a certain amount of liability
for distributing that third-party
content and if it's Providence is not
clean you know you are on the the legal
path a legal responsibility path it may
not be you that gets sued but maybe your
consumer may get sued for something that
you are your self consuming that's hard
to think about but that those are things
that we need to to keep in mind so
requiring a contributor agreement or a
certificate of origin is just a great
way of providing you a little bit of
legal cover do you accept somebody's
contribution you're still if you know
that somebody is something is
contributing something they shouldn't be
you'd still have a certain amount of
liability there but if you have a
contributor agreement in place what
you're doing is first off you're sending
a message to your contributors saying
that intellectual property management is
important please get this right and then
of course if they get it wrong then the
you know at least you have an agreement
from them that says that they thought
they knew what they were doing a public
record of the contrary actually this is
something the developer certificate of
origin that we use at the Eclipse
Foundation is the one that the Linux
Foundation provides we decided that
doing that made it easier than having
our own it's one of those you know the
same same kind of ideas using an OSI
license use a developer
of origin that already exists because
most legal departments will have already
seen it and if you're trying to attract
contributors they're going to have to
agree to that distribute a developer's
certificate of origin and if they're if
they're lawyers have already seen it
that's going to be a lot easier than if
their lawyers have to review it one of
the things that's in there is a
stipulation that the public public
record of the contribution will be
maintained indefinitely this may be at
odds with the right to be forgotten so
that's something as I said I haven't
seen that tested yet but will that will
be interesting to see what it does
protect your trademark who owns the
product and project name yes if you work
with a foundation the foundation is very
often the owner of that trademark should
you register a trademark is an
interesting question we have a legal
team that can help you decide that that
it really depends on different things
sometimes just asserting a trademark is
enough registering a trademark gives you
a little bit of a stronger stronger hold
on it registering is something that's
done based on you know from country to
country we tend to register trademarks
in the United States and in Europe again
that's again something if you're doing
you're open source project you may
decide whether or not to do as we've
mentioned before foundations will hold
the name on behalf of the community we
as a foundation the apache foundation
does this all organizations do this as
they provide usage guidelines how may
you use our trademark we actually will
contact people to make sure that our
trademark is being used appropriately
there's a lot of Eclipse plugins that
are called Eclipse something or other
which actually are our violation and
when we find them we ask them nicely and
most of the time they just change the
name the the thing about trademarks as
well and the cats keep in mind as you do
need to actually enforce them in order
to hold it to keep a hold on them so bad
that's sort of an important thing so
with you know the Eclipse Foundation the
Apache foundation sort of the same idea
if you go to any given a patchy page
pachi project page you'll go to Hadoop
Apache Hadoop every time but only had do
project and call them that self that if
you have an extension it would be my
extension for Apache Hadoop right the
idea there is that creates some clarity
to the reader someone reads that it's
obvious that that is not an Apache
property they are instead using an
Apache Tribe trademark and then of
course the trademark is something you
know the project names the foundation
names weird this is something that we
try to do the Eclipse Foundation the
Apache foundation provides some value to
the various open source projects that
they hold and so you know Apache Hadoop
is a great example Hadoop has got a
great name Apaches got a great name each
of those names builds up the other a
little bit so and now with there was a
lot of stuff on code high beam but
there's a lot more to talk about and so
how do you perform testing how do you
like how to write support for your
project sometimes that you you want to
do some some companies actually have
kind of a business model where they have
like an open-source addition when they
actually provide consulting services on
support to sometimes you want to allow
others to participate in that not right
not just to be transparent but again
it's the level successfully defined for
openness and and also there are all
sorts of business drivers why you want
to do open source right all why do you
want to do your project as open source
or white whatever right and in the end a
very very important topic also in any
successful project open source project
that we've seen is actually diversity
right projects that are divers are are
actually more successful than a project
that are mostly a single vendor
dominated one thing that isn't on there
but it's like if you are a corporation
and trying to like get more involved
into open sores this group of companies
called the to do group and they actually
help each other and to understand and or
actually they also help up regular
meetings when they just talk about like
how they do all the source and how how
do things all right I think no times
whatever so of course diversity takes
many forms diversity we know I think
when we start off we talk about
diversity of different organizations
participating so this one organization
loses interest at least someone is there
to maintain the project again this
speaks to our definition of success if
your definition of success for your
project is that organizations are
incorporating it into their products and
and that you've got an active and
vibrant community of six million users
or you know whatever your definition of
success is commands or the help suit
will help you to decide what of the
things that we've talked about today are
interesting and useful to you I don't
we've I've been involved with literally
hundreds of different open source
projects and in one capacity or another
and the the single vendor open source
projects tend to go away they tend to
live the shortest because as soon as
that vendor is it loses their funding or
moves on the project nobody supports the
project the project dies and goes away
so that diversity of you know the people
involved is is really valuable that in
the diversity of ideas some of our most
successful projects at the Eclipse
Foundation have many many different
organizations involved the team support
the good integration support in the
Eclipse IDE I think has eight or ten
different organizations represented
regularly committing contributions to
the code the original contributors I
believe have actually gone away but that
the project that produces that it that
support has managed to build some some
top quality tools to do get get
integration anyway and of course our
platform team our main team has they had
a real diversity problem in the
beginning but they've really grown and
become very diverse and and their their
continued success is a testament to that
anyway so why should you care about
anything we've talked about again it
really kind of goes back to that first
message what how do you define success
and with that I guess we have a few
minutes for questions does anybody have
a question yes so yeah repeat the
question so I had said that a
contributor agreement was important but
if you have a license that states that
there is no warranties why is that
contributor agreement important why is
there so I say that there is no
warranties why is the contributor
agreement important because you still
need to have you still need to have the
content number yeah you take that what
I'm having a hard time performing it if
you've got it go so first thing we're
not lawyers I told what they say they
actually will tell you why but there's a
difference between warranty and
intellectual property violation even
though if you like you don't provide any
warranties for damage your project might
do or whatever Chinese is high like if
someone brings code and that was never
supposed to be open and all of this
happens in your project and there's some
very large corporation or whoever
actually owns the code then they will
ask you no matter what your license is
right so it's really like you like you
want to make sure that the code your
license actually fits with the culture
like with that license and your you
can't not either you ready every code by
self or you basically sort of with that
computer agreement you sort of dedicate
the risk of a right because you have to
process it's about reducing risk you
cannot verify Angus aniline risk point
for you like for for the entity that
owns the project most of the time
actually they don't go after after the
project like after the project entity
itself they go after the user thought
the project right just like I don't know
if you remember the the SEO unix thing
right that they went after the customers
and then last they went off for SEO
um yeah so that's gone nevermind well
there is no such thing so that the
contributor agreement does not remove
the risk there is no such thing as no
risk everything that we do in
intellectual property management is
about risk mitigation right you know and
actually I did mention one of the things
I did mention i remember i was going to
say the contributor agreement by making
someone sign the contributor agreement
you're also making them damn thing right
so maybe they don't fully understand but
by making them sign the agreement you're
getting them to it you know at least try
and understand what they're doing and
maybe you know maybe if they're going to
copy this code that they got from
somewhere hopefully make them think
twice about about doing something that
maybe they don't know is wrong are there
other questions yes
so the question is if even if we have
this agreement would somebody come after
the project if there were a violation I
think we've probably leaned a little too
heavily on the fear aspect in our
presentation so you know as governor was
saying actually generally when there is
a license violation it's actually this
more it's usually downstream where
people go right so they usually go for
the users so again this is this is a
lawyer talk right and but it like if you
can demonstrate for for let's say let's
say it comes to the point where they
actually go up to you right but if
there's a case that you can semin
straight you have to process in place
and which is actually the computer
agreements and it could end the
developer certificate of origin then
chances are pretty high that you know
there's there's not a lot you have to
worry about right because like that
that's usually taking into account is
like did you violate this on purpose
right or did you do the best that you
could and add the debt back then at that
time to prevent such violations and a
computer contributor agreement developer
certificate of origin is such a thing
right it right now it's like the best
thing like you can do to prevent such
violations so there's also better JJ and
mitigate but again they do it and and
that's very well-known practice in the
open source communities like I said
there's no such thing as no risk but yes
so for the committee agreement is there
an automated process or practices that
we can recommend you look like you have
an answer I do go we are oh yes so did
to do group they are zode the thing is
every company develops in cells like it
is their own system and so within the to
do group there was recently a discussion
of some like moving all like the
internal systems that the companies have
in to absorb and on github you actually
find those systems from I think Facebook
and Google they call they also collect
us all sorts of tools like open source
dashboards when they actually monitor
yeah actually I at the islands
foundations awesome it Microsoft gave a
very good talk Microsoft actually they
also have like a tool where they track
any single contribution that's going
into their project right and also any
single contributions that that
developers are doing into other
contracts so they all analyze this and
so there's a plenty of there are tools
available I think we are also in the
process of open sourcing one item well
I'm not sure so it was the Eclipse
Foundation we do have a process very
often it's which I'm not sure exactly
how the Apache Foundation does it but we
have we have an online forum and we have
some infrastructure where the
information is stored in our database
and we're able to query that different
organizations do it in different ways
some legal jurisdictions will require
paper tracking but but none these days
not not so much these days yeah I
remember signing paper and texting it to
Google a long time ago but these days
like all those contributor agreements
most most mostly signed electronically
so I think in terms of is there a
critical general service that you can
use I think I don't think so right
that's another place where there's the
value of participating with the
foundation
is there so we have one more question oh
so Apache and oracle still required to
sign a paper and introspection two men
that's for contributors or for
committers I'm interested okay good hey
we're easier than Apache alright cool
okay with that thank you so much for
your attention I'm grateful that none of
you left anyway I hope you do enjoy the
rest of the conference and thank you so
much for your attention</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
