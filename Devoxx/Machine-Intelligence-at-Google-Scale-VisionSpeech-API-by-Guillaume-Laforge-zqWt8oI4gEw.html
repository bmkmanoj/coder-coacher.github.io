this is a pretty full room that's cool
so there's lots of interest in machine
learning machine intelligence so in this
presentation we'll do another view of
what's available within the Google cloud
platform so we'll be speaking about API
is available about even open source and
solutions to scale your machine on which
needs so I am giel afar's I'm a
developer advocate for Google cloud
platform and and I'm Martin Martin
corner and some of you have seen me
already already on Monday and Tuesday in
the tensorflow sessions I will be
showing a little bit of tensorflow here
as well so if for those who were in the
keynote I'm gonna show you again this
little slide in the in the 80s there was
what we call the AI winter so there had
been lots of research with neural
networks etc in the 80s I mean the
algorithms were there but what really
changed the real breakthrough and why a
machine learning is so you know in the
front of the news everywhere or every
companies adding some sorts of machine
learning everywhere that's really
because there's a huge quantity of data
available that we have to do something
with what can we do with that what can
we learn from those data sets also
what's interesting is that we have lots
of labeled data sets so that neural
networks can learn from these and say ok
this data means this is something this
data that's something else so there are
labels like this is good this is bad
spam not spam etc this is a car this is
a an animal etc but in addition to that
so obviously you need also to store that
data it's not necessarily data you can
fit inside
one single computer and it's hard right
you might have tons of terabytes of data
and perhaps your hard drives are not big
enough so that's why the cloud is
helpful even just for that aspect of
data set size but also the big change is
all this cloud computing stuff because
we are now able to have tons of compute
power available to train massive neural
networks and also to Train bigger models
and that's this little circle this chain
with obviously ongoing research in order
to refine the algorithms optimizations
etc and I'd like to add that those big
models was the key that's why we are
talking about deep learning because we
realized but that by stacking layers in
a neural network suddenly that neural
network could do a lot lot more things
previously the idea existed but we
didn't have the CPU to compute those
yeah definitely so that's why AI and
machine learning is there everywhere so
an example so you've got your pictures
of vacations and I mean before pictures
so it's if you used whichever photo
service available you had to manually
kind of label your data if you wanted to
find later on okay which vacation that
was or let's say pictures of your
friends or your family or something but
what's nice is that now computers are
really able to figure out what's inside
those pixels for real and it's able to
figure out that okay there's a woman
there there's a pool that's the close to
beach water etc and instead of you know
I remember myself I mean going through
my own pictures and having to flick
through tons of pictures till I really
managed to find something okay no not
that oh that should be around that date
and then going through a hundred of
pictures before finding what I'm looking
for now I'm really able to do a search
and search and find out the right
pictures that's actually what I did for
I'll be showing later on where I'll show
you the the vision API actually search
for past pictures I knew I had taken and
thanks to the search it managed to find
the right picture and I'll come back
then you're doing this with Google
photos yeah with good is it available
but Jose in Google feels for everyone
who uses Google photos you can search by
content and the fact that I mean we're
all the users of Google photos uploading
Didion's I don't know how many pictures
were we have lots of over 200 million
users yeah that must be quite a number
of pictures and especially our devices
are sending those pictures automatically
in Google Photos that's a lot of
pictures and yeah machine learning is
everywhere so
translate is using machine learning and
neural networks for that
inbox the the mobile version of inbox
when you're using the smart replies and
I'm taking that example on purpose
because there's an interesting example
and demo that Martin is going to show
you later on well it figures out what
the lightly what is the likely response
you're gonna give and it's it auto
completes the the beginning of the off
we also write the beginning of your
email because it knows more that's what
you're going to talk about so yeah
machine learning is everywhere not just
at Google anyway so that's interesting
so I'll I'll read you and spend tiny bit
more time on my demo from the the
keynote yesterday where I implemented my
poor man assistant and this time I have
a bit more time to show you a bit more
the details of the of the calls that I
made so where is my theme it here so
basically it's really just like 1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8 9 10 in 10 lines of code I was
able to record some so I perhaps I
should launch it first so that you see
will you to refresh your memory so what
am I going to ask
is there a conference about machine
learning so I'm recording the audio I'm
going to store that in Google Cloud
storage then I'm going to call the club
speech API to do the the recognition of
the speech and then I'm using so let's
see
concretely step by step so where is it
huh there so I used a little command
line tool I'm gonna zoom here called the
socks that I installed on my machine to
record the audio so I recorded that with
a black file then I'm uploading here the
content to Google Cloud storage
then I prepare a request that I'm going
to send to what shouldn't highlight
because it's even less readable so this
is the request I'm going to send to the
speech API pointing at the the place
where I stored my audio file then the
result of the call is here is there a
conference about machine learning so it
properly recognized despite the echo and
everything recognized the text very
accurately so this is the text
recognized then once I'm there I'm gonna
use the natural language API to actually
analyze the content of that sentence and
so this is the result of that call so
how many sentences well that's just one
and what's interesting here is that it
analyzed the structure of the text the
the big break through here but I'll come
back to that is how you can really
understand the structure of text so it's
not just Mayer characters and words but
it's really okay this is a noon this is
the subject of the sentence this is an
adjective
this is a preposition etc so it's really
figuring out the different parts of the
speech and then there's also I'm not
really using it for that demo but
there's also a sentiment analysis that
you see and with Microsoft Word that you
see here so is it a positive sentence or
not then
I have extracted the words and I'm
interested in the odd position part
which is about what and the keywords I
mean interesting in here are machine
learning and then I used Google search
actually to find inside the devoxx CFP
the talks which are related to machine
learning with a simple player so this
and I'll come back to showing you more
more concretely some of these things
with someone nineteen was after
afterwards
okay so I'm coming back here so yeah so
we've got it's like a spectrum of
machine learning solutions so if you're
a developer you want to use on the
shelves API is REST API or using the
Java SDKs that we have you are able to
call ready-made API so you don't have to
be a data scientist so it's concrete use
case but somewhat limited I mean in the
sense that it focuses just on speech
vision it said it's a trouble you can do
already interesting things with that on
the other end of the spectrum you've got
tensor flow which is a an open source
framework which allows you to really
define exactly how you want to create
your neural networks and then in the
middle you can also leverage the
infrastructure of the Google cloud
platform to train at scale on huge data
sets the the neural networks to do
pretty extreme specifications etc so
we'll focus first on tens of them on the
right bit the experts speak let me show
you just a little bit of tensor flow
there is a longer session or right after
this if you're interested so you will be
a slightly disappointed you might not
understand all the codes on the slide
it's not the point of those five ten
minutes here it's just to give you an
overview see a bit of code and try to do
something fun with a neural network a
neural networks usually look like this
they come in layers and the neurons
they always do the same thing they do a
weighted sum of all the inputs and
produce some output and all the trick of
training neural networks is figuring out
those weights in the weighted sum and
you do that through training here I want
to play with a specific neural network
which is called a recurrent neural
network the specificity is that it has a
vector as an input which might be
anything but the state I mean the
outputs of that intermediate layer will
pump it back into the input at each time
step so this can actually be represented
as a simple cell it has a vector as an
input produces a vector as an output and
also produces a state which you pump
back in at each time step this is a
recurrent neural network um and that's
what we are going to do with it we are
going to build a language model we are
going to put on the inputs characters
from the piece of text how do we encode
those characters well the traditional
encoding is called one heart basically
you have a an alphabet size of let's say
100 possible characters so a vector
representing a character is a vector of
100 elements all zeros just to 1
somewhere in the middle saying this is
the index of the character and to train
a recurrent network you unroll it a
certain number of times so you replicate
one cell multiple times then you put in
characters it will produce characters on
the outputs and you will say no that's
not the characters I want I'm going to
train you and I'm telling you these are
the characters I want it's the same
sequence shifted by one character so
actually what I'm training the neural
network here to do is to predict the
next character based on an input
sequence so let's try to write this in
tensorflow
and first of all you have a high level
called intensive flow to create one of
those cells it's called a GRU cell here
because there are several types of those
cells I've shown you one the gruesel is
slightly more complicated but still
input output and a state that is passed
around you heard about deep learning so
yes we need many layers that's simple a
second call to stack this cell hi again
doesn't change the structure still one
one input one output and one state that
is now slightly bigger that is passed
around in a third call in tensor flow to
unroll this sequence a certain number of
times how many times well that's in the
X which is the input it simply depends
on the size of the vector all right we
are ready to train this so to train as I
said we put characters on the input it
produces outputs we say the output we
want is the same sequence shifting by
one this in turn produces a difference
between what we want and what it says
and we use this difference as an error
function to minimize through training
this is the full code of this neural
network ok so again I'm not asking you
to understand anything everything is
just a little snippet but I want you to
take away that the full code for
training this neural network is on one
slide and you recognize there in the
middle of the left side my model the
cell stacked high and unrolled the rest
is basically pumping in inputs and
outputs and you have one very important
thing look at the top of the screen
Adam optimizer so this is what
tensorflow gives you as really added
value you take an optimizer you compute
this loss this error between what the
network says and what you want it to say
and you ask the optimizer to optimize
this it will optimize this across many
iterations pumping in new data nudies
the outputs and so on and this is
mathematically quite a complex of
operation usually it's called back
propagation and so on in tensorflow it's
one line and that is really to the
GameChanger
the rest that's the training loop you
pump in characters give used gives use
and run the actual training step that
the optimizer gave you all right so I've
done this on the entire works of William
Shakespeare let's see what what this
gives us so what I'm going to do now
that this network has been trained is
take just one of those cells put in
garbage it gives you a it gives me a
character of probability in the output I
roll the dice take one character from
this probability put it back in inside
and suddenly I'm generating text so
let's see what our neural network he can
tell us how can i generate text so first
of all in chin in tensor flow you have a
safe command during training you can
save all the weights and biases of the
system so let's see what this does with
a network that has been trained on a few
passes on a few plays alright and now I
need run let's see I think you did the
wrong place
oh yes I do ok so now I need to run I
run something else which obviously is
not what I wanted run
oh so it's already starting to look like
a play well it's not really English you
know but still you see something that
looks like a character name and then
then characters with spaces all right
it hasn't learned much yet let's try a
little bit more advanced like this but
is it harder to understand that the real
Shakespeare plays alright well it's
still not completely English okay I
think there is progress to be made there
all right how about this one oh look
this is starting to be English and look
at this you have readers you have
characters yeah the short words are okay
there is feet there is me there is to
the character names
look there are recognizable thin tens
port amen
not quite yet perfect but this is
starting to look like a play but is that
Old English Old English anyway it's old
English so you can't understand it of
course that's why but now let's try to
push this to the very end
now I train this on the entire
Shakespeare corpus I think ten times
let's hit run whoa look at this I have
acted three sin one a pledge sound I
have stenick indication enter Gloucester
I have a full monologue I have actually
credible credible character names where
are they oh sorry
I have Warwick can I have a gentlewoman
look it picked up the fact that when
it's a name it's it's full caps and when
it's a character like a gentlewoman a
soul urines and so on the capitalization
is different it learned this is this is
actually generated character by
character it has learned how to spell
English not yet correctly because I
actually I forgot and that was at that
moment that we asked the audience to
actually play the play that is generated
who wants to hold a sage who wants to
play how
loosen ated Shakespeare come on we need
a volunteer
too much Belgian beer no no we need to
volunteer this is a good idea
okay who wants to play yes please come
on come on you can you can play Denarius
or Juliet would you want to play Juliet
the well sir what news unless this is
real English the soul of all those
friends indeed the benefit that worked
themselves to save the reason of a
father as if it would be so about to be
a sound it's almost like a real
shakespeareans
all right and actually what I find nice
is that you you you actually get those
cynic indications like enter messenger
re and exit re-enter strides all that is
generated character by character it had
it had to first pick up the syntax of
English how to spell words than the
syntax of a play and so on all right so
that's the little funny Network I wanted
to build with you all right let me stop
this and now if you have a network like
this well you won't actually I also
tried it on the full Python code of
tensorflow itself so at the beginning it
didn't understand much but then you know
look it has the the keywords right
already it's starting to open some some
function names a little bit further
well the keywords alright it's it's
actually hallucinating function names in
D themselves be sure because that's how
the cutoff tens of hours retired of
course of course
the parentheses nesting is not quite
there yet but look 12
a park so 12 times the entire code base
the parentheses nesting is correct at
triple deaths it can recite the apache
license entirely and it figured out how
to do comments it's giving me tensorflow
tips look create the string operation to
apply gradient terms that also batch
that's very important and the original
of any operation as a code when we
should always infer to this session case
I always introduce a session please
remember that and that's also how the
documentation of the website yes alright
and in the gentleman who who actually
built this neural network for the first
time is called Android car patty he's
got a nice blog about this he tried it
on an algebra book written in in in
latex and actually the network produces
almost syntactically correct latex he
had to fix it a little bit but this is
what he gets he gets on an algebra book
hallucinate it and I love the proofs
look at the first proof proof orbital
method that's clever that's clever all
right so now if if you have these
networks it takes a lot of CPU to train
them so we built the service called
Cloud ml which is a hosted service where
you can throw your tensorflow
and build it on a distributed
infrastructure in the cloud so how does
it work let me show you first of all
what is the algorithm for training in a
distributed neural network well it's
like this you put your model on multiple
servers you pump in training data
now during training this training data
generates that's the training algorithm
little Delta's little modifications to
your internal weights and biases and you
hope that those modifications will
change the weights and biases so that
your network becomes better and better
so when you do it in a distributed way
all of those servers are sending the
updates to the weights and biases then
getting the new weights and biases and
restarting now if you ask me why this
works mathematically I mean this server
is sending biases adding them to the
sorry deltas adding them to the existing
by
but maybe those biases have been updated
already by another server how can this
work mathematically it doesn't work it's
not correct it's actually not correct
but this being not correct is actually
just a little bit of additional noise
and it happens that these things to
converge
they kind of like noise so even if it's
mathematically totally incorrect and my
math teacher would slap me if I did this
well in the real world this approach
works quite well but I have sure the
math proof that you generated to your
math teacher it might be happy emitted
alright there's a few pieces of code to
show you how to how to package this for
cloud ml so this time I'm showing you a
high higher level API in tensorflow that
has layers so in my model function you
know I have layers each layer is a
different kind of layer in my neural
network this is a complicated one a
convolutional one whatever my model
function I use it to build an estimator
by passing it in the in the estimator
and the estimator in this higher-level
tensorflow API that is the object that
has the fit function that was the
training and the predict function that
does the prediction give it something
that it tells you what it is now I can
call the fit function to the to the
training myself on my computer but I can
also use it to build an experiment and
an experiment is basically an estimator
plus data feed functions so of course if
your data is small like here you just
load the data in memory and it's a
constant so no need to to anything fancy
but usually the data is huge and there
is a possibility in tensorflow
to insert in your computation graph
nodes that during training actually pull
data so that's what you define in those
trained input function eval input
function and whatever basically the
model is your layers neural network
layers you put
this into an estimator which gives you
the ability to call fit which means
trained and predict and so on and if you
add data feeding functions you know to
the mix you get an experiment and an
experiment you can run it on Google
cloud platform cloud mo learn at run
around our daughter run let's run it so
to run it I have it's here
you know yep here we go command line
it's a simple command line you have to
package your code in a folder okay not
too complicated my code isn't as close
pi and there is this config file which
basically tells the system how many
replicas I want for training I'm using
standard one which is basically a fixed
set which has three model replicas and
one parameter server so instead of doing
that on over days hours or days or weeks
on your local machine you can spread
that that tons of machines exactly you
can you can speed it up by simply
paralyzing this and it's a very good
approach also to run this on your local
GPU that gives you a good you know boost
like 10x but after that computer with
two three four eight GPUs that's not so
handy so that's where you switch to
cloud ml where you can put this on
multiple replicas even if they don't
have GPUs right now you can Yuki you can
have as many as you want and which eight
GPUs you might be playing some nice
games on your machine oh yeah all right
so I launched this it's cute
let me just see so I have to find what
it is a browser anointing the other
right on the right okay I have a browser
somewhere stop the presentation matter
and it's zero thank you so so this one
yes alone right so here in cloud
platform
I've got machine learning somewhere
right here and in my machine learning I
have now created a job which is judge on
number 27 if I go into it I can view the
logs and if I view the logs it tells me
that there is something running here
running running running running it's
actually not launching my notes doing
the training and so on and the result
from this training I will see in cloud
storage because it's actually storing in
cloud storage as soon as I found it yes
cloud storage here in jobs train 27 it's
storing data to visualize the progress
that's using tensor board that's a tool
for visualizing progress and very soon I
will have here checkpoints that it's
saved to those are checkpoints with all
the weights and the biases of the train
system at one given time so from those
checkpoints I can create a model that
then I use for serving cloud and I'll
can also do that cloud ml can do the
training part and candidate cloud ml can
be used for serving if you need to put
your trained model in use in an
application all right so now let's see
what people did with this because I do
agree that you know just launching it
singing train this may be not such an
impressive demo but what I find is
pretty safe is that what people were
able to do with this we have a company
in Japan they are a used car Sailor
reseller and their problem was that they
get used cars they take pictures of them
and they want you know to make sense of
those pictures it would be nice if this
could be done automatically so they need
image recognition for car models car
parts like a tire steering wheel and so
on well this is usually a hard problem
because you need millions of images
to recognize such kinds of you know high
level features but there is a simple
approach we at Google we have built this
model called inception for recognizing
images
it was trained on millions of images for
recognition tasks of whatever but
actually you can chop off just the last
layers and use the full beginning as a
fixed encoding function for your images
and train a small neural network just to
recognize on those included features if
this is a Toyota 94 or if this is a
steering wheel and so on to do that
first of all you use significantly less
neurons than here so you need
significantly less compute time and
significantly less images it's actually
doable for a used car retailer let's see
demo of what they did so escape again
and I'm here let me throw some images at
this demo yep
so it's uploading these these images and
very soon it will start recognizing this
is not an API this is a neural network
they built themselves by repurposing the
open-source inception Network already
fully trained they took all the weights
from gira just chopped off the last
layers we trained those and look we have
a god the rear side of the car we have a
steering wheel the front side of the car
the right side front side blah blah blah
very soon it's going to tell me which we
have a dashboard and it's telling me
that it's a maybe a 212 to occlude
cruiser maybe a to 994 or a 205 total
enclosure the first guy
is I think the most accurate very
practical application done by a real
company not specialized in machine
learning and of course they needed cloud
ml to do this because they don't have I
mean it's not a ml research lab they
don't have those computers with a 20 DP
GPUs that they could have used for this
to play card games to play card games
yes exactly oh that's interesting
because it's really so you see the from
the rear right side it really recognized
the angle and the detail and everything
that's great and actually on the slides
we have a link to both the open-source
version of the insect inception Network
and there is a short code lab that
teaches you how to retrain it on another
data set very nice yeah so let's not
forget full tensorflow sessions so with
all the details all the gory details
this time right after this if you're
staying with this room if you're asleep
doesn't matter because it means you will
stay here that's the goal so we saw the
tensor flow parts with so cloud machine
learning now let's come back to the
higher stack with ready-made models
which you can use as an API directly
with a Java SDK with the rest goal so
the merchant Learning API is that we
have let's have a look at the natural
language API this API has got several
features synth let's start with let's
say sentiment analysis so you can say
okay this sentence or this body of text
is very positive or note negative and
with which magnitude is it very negative
or a bit negative we also have entity
recognition so it's able to figure out
okay this this word there in the text is
the name of the new President of the
United States so it might be a negative
sentiment I don't know then the syntax
analysis that's what I explained earlier
you really have the understanding of the
various word
of the text so if I just come back also
what's nice and I'm going to show you
that in a second with my cursor it's
there so for example if you go can
increase a little bit it might be better
so if you go to can even start from
scratch if you go on the Google cloud
platform website cloud Google comm
products and then you see all the tons
of available products where's the yetze
there so the machine learning ones if
you go to each of them
you'll see I'm clicking again on this
one and so quite natural language it guy
on each of these api's you also have the
box where you can actually play with
those api is directly so yeah I can try
this one so complex phrase so it
recognize some entities like Google
Mountain View etc so Google it's an
organization so it's even qualified
information so you really know what kind
of things it is like a personal location
an event etc and there are also links to
Wikipedia pages and for things like yeah
so persons etc and so is it something
positive or negative yes sounds like
that sentence is pretty positive
magnitude you know not average so I'm
gonna use another sentence like the one
like is there oops
is there conference about machine
learning and I'm gonna show you the
exact structure of this sentence that I
used in my demo earlier so conference is
an even machine learning not sure what
it is it's other something else
yes sentiment it's positive and this one
so if you look at the the structure you
can see like the subject of this
sentence is conference and there's a nap
position with the preposition about that
points at the the actual topic I was
interested in so I'm able to figure out
okay
if I want to create an API an app an
assistant for conferences I could say
okay is there universities there is
there a tokus there quickly etc so it
can figure out what I'm really searching
for and then it can tell the search
engine or whatever is next to figure out
okay this is inside this odd position
Mershon learning is the the actual
content I'm really interested in so
that's what you can do by really
understand or the understanding sorry
understanding the structure of your
sentences so it's not just a list of
words it's really a tree representing
the structure of your text so this is
pretty nice not just characters in words
so this was the demo let me come back in
presentation mode how the cloud
translation API well this one you
certainly know it it's actually a node
node API at Google it's been there
forfor a while but we keep on improving
it versions after versions with even
more text etc so you can pick between I
think 80 plus languages and to translate
from one language into another language
so a quick demo but this one is not very
impressive because you suddenly know it
very well
oh yeah just you're saying in French but
I'm gonna use something Shakespeare no
more puff officered oh it's too matte a
new my English and let's see what's
gonna be the my math teacher is zero
zero nice I mean you know I could have
said is bad or something at zero and
math that makes sense right so this is a
the translation API so yeah I think
there are over 18 languages which are
supported by this API hope
back to the slides here the Google
speech API and that's what I showed in
the demo so you can it support several
different audio formats it allows you to
get the transcript of the the text that
being said what's interesting as well is
that so no actually I said 18 on wages
but what's that thought yeah that was
for the speech API for the translate API
perhaps it's even more than that I don't
remember the figure I had this 80 in
mind but that was for the speech API but
the translation API really recognizes
tons and tons of languages
also what's interesting with this API so
although I used it you know it's a
synchronous mode I in a non streaming
mode it also supports a streaming mode
so you don't have to let's say okay I'm
gonna speak for an hour like today and
at the end I do the speech recognition
okay well you could do that but what's
more interesting is if you can do that
speech recognition while the person is
speaking and so the the demo online
though works non streaming but it's also
possible to use as the streaming
approach to have the the the recognition
happening as the the speaker actually
speaks and that's what you see when you
talk to your Android phone yeah yeah
exactly it's the exact same technology
behind the scenes so when you type not
type but you speech use speech to speak
to your phone you know for text message
or something like that you actually see
it doing that
live in a streaming fashion yeah so
you're over 18 on which supported the
streaming oh yeah it's also able to
filter inappropriate content so in the
text that is returned it's gonna replace
the curse words and things like that
with I don't remember what it uses but
you can get rid of those of those curse
words and also it's been trained not on
just you know now nice sounding voices
without any noise around etc but it's
been
trained on real samples of data in
people who are in the street who are in
noisy places etc so it's pretty good at
recognizing voices even in noisy
environments oh yeah no I'm not going to
show that one okay
the this demo because I showed it
earlier so the cloud vision API so just
like in the example with the the Pickers
recognizing the pictures of my vacations
what it supports in terms of features
so there's face recognition with things
like giving the the sentiment or the if
the person's happy or sad etc label
detection to recognize what's inside
pictures OCR so if there's some text in
the pictures it's going to extract the
text from those pictures it can
recognize logos if you have naked
pictures and things like that it's also
able to figure out if it's something
that you should be able to display like
imaging on a website people upload
pictures and you don't want and pictures
are viewable by anybody and you don't
want guys or guys or ladies why not it's
usually guys who do that upload their
naked pictures or something nasty like
this so there's this ability there and
landmarks detection so if you take a
picture of something pretty well-known
like a monument or something it's able
to recognize that I'm gonna show this
again in the action vision thinker
starts there so here I'm on the cloud
vision API page and I can upload some
pictures so I'm not going to take the
car at this time that I'm gonna use
email pictures I think that's this one
so so this year I didn't take that
picture that I had I didn't have to go
through
all my pictures thanks to google photo I
knew that I mean I come to Antwerp every
year for the box and last year I had
taken a nice picture of the cathedral
and it actually recognized the cathedral
so Cathedral of Our Lady and if you look
at let's say the the map you're gonna
see it looks like it's its own twerk and
some label also this is buildings this
is a cathedral at night the place of
worship okay
somehow this one is a little bit weird
that if you look here some sculpture
there somehow looked like three and
three well that was a bit surprising to
me but sometimes can figure out some
texts some in some place oh it also
gives some useful information like
common colors that you see in the
picture SafeSearch okay is it something
safe to see yes and this is the the
structure but I'm gonna show the
structure and another example another
example so this one that's the the train
station and again it manages to
recognize it pretty easily more
interesting not that the train station
is not interesting but let's say okay
you have faces so this is a picture I
took with a gem Strachan we call
invented the the groovy programming
language but look and what was funny is
that I wanted two faces but then it even
recognized the faces in the in the
Twitter wall okay well so face one
that's me face - that's gems and yeah
okay joy very lightly yeah we're all
smiling head were both we were wearing
glasses and this is a the other face as
well and there's also some text here and
there although it was written very small
but there's okay rates and managing
cloud native applications etc and so
let's say one I think I have one more
yes proofing this one oh no or this one
person okay and get on the OCR part so
someone gave
account with the local taxi driver
because there were some issues with the
tram the other day and okay writing and
and then yeah it probably recognized the
text and it gives you the the bounding
boxes showing where the text actually is
and the very last one I wanted to show
you there's also so I showed I I said
that it can figure out if if there's if
there's you know nicked or unsafe can of
content but things like spoofing you
know when people add their own comments
to pictures it able to figure out that
okay someone somehow altered the picture
with adding some some particular
come-come you know text so this is very
like hmm it's stronger in terms of adult
did you see there Oh
fries are not good for children okay my
bit but do you mean there is a meme
detector in there yes that's very good
you know neurons really learn lots of
interesting things
oh yeah weeks media you want to do and
yeah that one we also wanted to show you
what company weeks you know them they
they they have this this fantastic
website builder and again not and no
developers specialized in machine
learning this is a pure web company but
they took the vision API and did
something really useful with it they
they have a problem they have gazillions
of images when people build websites
they both upload images they need stock
images and so on so they have these
gazillions of images and for the users
it's a bit daunting to find the right
image in the stock images into bed
images it's part of their business model
they also sell images so what they did
is that they indexed all of them and
that's the cloud vision API very simply
they passed all of their millions of
images into the cloud vision API
to index the landmarks to index the
people in it and so on and they have a
searchable database of images for their
customers you're building a website
about San Francisco user San Francisco
Bay Bridge whatever boom you've got a
picture of that you can use it
you've got the rights alongside you know
if it's free if it's a page picture they
also run actually they also run and
these two face detection and its face
detection it's not face recognition it
tells you there is a face here it
doesn't tell you this is guillaume apple
or it doesn't even tell you this is a
gentleman number 27 it's just a box
telling you there is a face here but one
very useful feature you can you can do
with that it gives you the box so you
can provide to your users an auto
cropping function function around the
face if you want to put faces on your
website you only have a big picture send
the big picture auto crop on the faces
pick one job done a very useful feature
that again they implemented very simply
using just the vision API and well
that's all I wanted to tell you about
them it's it's a problem that was
regarded as intractable actually if you
want the full story so sometime in the
60s I think when computers were invented
when the first image processing was was
done a computer science professors
thought well we can do image processing
now we can do image recognition that's
an easy problem
he called his colleagues and said well
let's take our you know each come each
of you come with your two best PhDs will
do summary three two month will solve
this they didn't we are 50 years later
but now it's been solved recognizing the
Bay Bridge in an image recognizing the
cat and image recognizing a person in an
image in a completely automated way on
large sizes or category sizes like all
the monuments on
at earth you know all the landmarks that
is a solved problem it's easy today you
there is an API for it and there are
algorithms for it if that is something
you want to do at home so I find this
progress really remarkable and even more
remarkable how useful it is in real life
and compare that so I mean myself I use
you know stop for the websites or for my
presentations yeah
and often you've got labels for pictures
manually entered and so on but with that
you can really say okay one this on that
and that in the picture and it's gonna
return the right picture of those labels
now people had to enter them manually so
the idea of the quality is the quality
of the manual work that was done very
expensive that's brilliant
alright so we in terms of ready-made
api's we spoke about the natural
language analysis that translate API the
vision API the the speech recognition
API and as you can see what's
interesting as well as also when you
combine them like in my little assistant
program assistant demo it's fairly easy
to just combine a few of them and
provide some interesting products and
sometimes with the existing models like
with tensor flow you can then reuse a
model and do something else to tailor a
tailored to your needs so this is the
whole spec spectrum tensor flow train
that in the cloud and ready-made API is
depending on whether you're a researcher
or not not this earlier not necessarily
with a PhD I know or if your your Napier
developer want to benefit from
ready-made api's here are interesting
links also before you all go away we
also have t-shirts by the way if you
want some Google Clan t-shirts which are
here to give away and so here are the
links to the various accounts that we
have the tensile photons was project and
also this interesting
one on the tenth floor for poets there
is the inception retraining the codelab
mind right so join the discussion on
twitter slack Gaeta you're welcome and
thanks a lot for your attention</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
