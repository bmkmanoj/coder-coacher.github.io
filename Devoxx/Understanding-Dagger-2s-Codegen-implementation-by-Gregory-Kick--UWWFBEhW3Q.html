Greg chick I work on dagger to sort of
did the original fork from dagger one
from square uh and I wanted to you know
kind of just take a quick moment and
present you know what dagger two is the
mechanics of it particularly from a code
generation perspective things stopped
working why did the thing start there we
go I guess we're going to have to click
now code generation we're going into
mono spaced font to mode because a the
thing that differentiates dagger from
you know pretty much every other bit of
dependency injection is the fact that
generated code and that simplifies
things a lot in ways that are hopefully
helpful for the user so we will you know
sort of walk through why it is what it
is or you know how it does what it does
um
di from a very high level since we're
talking about generated code we're not
going to give you high-minded
conversations about Hollywood principles
and things like that
that I find a lot of time do more harm
than good
di basically just make a zero argument
factory method for any type that you
want that sounds perhaps a little
abstract so let's talk about what that
means these are the zero argument
factory methods we have an interface
called provider we just want to make
sure that you can for any type that you
can imagine say I want to string get me
a string I want to object get me an
object I want to fool a bar Baz give me
one of those by implementing provider
our factories look like that so what
does that mean
if you have a class called foo in this
very simple example that doesn't do
anything you throw at inject on it in
the normal way and now here's where
dagger goes to work generating zero art
factories it implements provider and it
generates my code for you that's really
unremarkable because turning a zero
argument constructor into a zero
argument Factory is not super
interesting but we can get slightly more
complicated what happens if you have
dependencies this is where the
dependency injection bit comes in how do
we turn that into a zero argument
Factory
well it's a lot of ways still the same
this is perhaps a little small but
hopefully you can see it uh that you
just say okay well in order to have a
zero argument factory for you know our I
depend on the zero argument factory for
foo and we know that we're capable of
making one of those um and then we can
implement that get method that just says
you know return new Harr
excuse me return new bar and then give
me back the food that I got from that
zero argument factory we don't care
about how you know who showed up all we
know is that we care about
barbar requires foo and we just delegate
two factories all the way down and you
can do the same trick four methods if
you don't have two constructor but
instead you have like a factory or like
a static factory method on you know say
bass and bass takes a bar you can do a
little bit of work that requires a
little bit of dependency injection
specific API but it's basically the same
principle instead of that inject you say
provides and then you call bar dot
create um just right in that provides
methods simple delegation a little more
boilerplate from the calling side but
that's how you sort of express the same
principle and you get basically the same
factory you get you know that a factory
that gives you basses it takes bar
because that's the argument to that
method does the exact same invocation
but instead of saying down at the bottom
return you know new bad it says okay
call that provides method that I made
over there pretty straightforward and
you can do that for any type you can do
that same mechanical step in generated
code as many times as you know need be
ah but what good does that do us that's
not a particularly useful tool to make
factories in factories and factories how
do we make this work for us well you you
just say it's very top level alright
here's an interface this interface
enumerate to the types I actually want
in this case we're going to say we want
Baz we know from the code that we just
showed that Baz requires a bar bar
requires a foo all the way down but all
we really care about from the
perspective of our application is give
me a Baz and we know that in order to do
that we had to
to include this module so we have just a
little bit of declaration and then we
say dagger generate the implementation
of that interface and it does um you
know it kind of does sort of the thing
that you would expect is string together
all of these little factories and a
lovely tree or actually a lovely dag
that's why it's called dagger fun fact
um which in and of itself is
questionably interesting but that bit
that's the hard part a little part in
bold where it does all of those
factories in exactly the right order we
have a nice linear structure of one
thing depends on the other thing depends
another thing but now imagine that
you've had a complicated structure in
which you know any number of things can
depend on any number of other things the
entire magic of daggers that it figures
out the order that you need to
initialize these factories in order to
create your application and all of that
shuffling requires no thought to on your
part you just say here's the things that
I require any giving type and then
dagger figures out how to wire them all
together for you
alright neat trick
I can you know a little bit of
background on sort of how we've seen
this in practice it actually scales this
strategy that we've shown scale to huge
dependency graphs in Google in addition
to running a whole bunch of Android apps
out there in the world it also runs
search all of you know the front end for
web search the the you know ten blue
links and all of the things that you
know come and is actually a massive
application as you perhaps might imagine
we've actually run into issues here and
there with the sheer amount of bytecode
in you know all of those initializations
the factories and etc exceeds how much
you can put into a single method this
really does like sort of scale out to
the very very large and it works pretty
well the complicated structures of you
know figuring out how to wire everything
together is managed automatically so
that means that if you change your
dependency structure there's no
refactoring on your part or you know at
least not from the perspective of wiring
together all those factories error-prone
patterns that we used to have at least
in search are now detected at compile
time like we do a little bit of Milnes
checking depending on the presence or
absence of
knowable annotations we make sure that
there are no cycles in your dependencies
things that otherwise would have been
you know no pointer exceptions and you
know stack overflow errors at runtime
are now detected at compile time and in
your very large applications another
thing that ends up sort of you know
coming out in the wash is that dead code
disappears from the app completely you
don't have a giant runtime bucket where
you're putting everything into a hashmap
Kiton class literal or whatever it is if
you don't use a type in your dependency
graph it's just not part of the
generated dependency graph so huge
swathes of like features that aren't
enabled are going to drop out of the
application but there's always catch
right you know what's the catch we have
tons and tons and tons of generated code
well that is the problem we have a lot
of bulk where we might conceptually not
need it the very first example of just
invoking a constructor for foo all of a
sudden got an extra wrapper class that
thing got a bunch of extra method at
runtime whenever you create the
component implementation there's objects
that are generated we don't like bulk
not so much a problem on the server side
big problem on the Android side in
android is obviously one of our primary
targets for dagger so we start talking
about optimization how can we make this
thing better and the very first thing we
did is we said well you know we're the
implementers if you think about
annotation processors at a very sort of
abstract level it's kind of a compiler
for a kind of a language and compiler
optimizations are things that we know
and love from you know years and years
and years of computer science so let's
go to work and you know a good example
of this is just in lining the calls
dagger does this right now ahead if you
download the latest version for places
where it can detect that you can you
know sort of just you asked for a foo so
yeah we'll just give you a foo instead
of calling a factory for a foo as long
as everything's accessible and etc etc
and so if you take the sample code and
actually compile it against what's
happening in dagger today ah you will
get something closer to that um or it
says okay no just you know call the
provides method call the constructors
do that work I actually ran an
experiment in which we have a graph with
thousands and thousands of calls and we
inlined 100% of the there was not a
single generated factory present in the
compiled application and magically in
android
if you run ProGuard over it with a
sufficient number of rounds dagger
disappeared from the application
entirely because of this optimization
you know even the component interface
was gone the dagger component
implementation there was just one call
sight and it all got inlined right
exactly the way that we hope it would um
we have ongoing work it's not perfect
yet we don't optimize everything away
you know perfectly but we continue to
make progress on that but that's the
type of thing where we just look at the
compiler and we try to do a little bit
better there's all the things you can do
sort of on the on the caller side and we
try to you know we try to do things for
you as best as we can most of the time
but sometimes it's just you know we have
to make the suggestion that on the you
know on the user side there are things
that you can do to make your life a
little bit easier for example remember
this module from early in the talk well
no you don't you actually remember this
module the difference being static
static makes a big difference the funny
thing about instance methods you need an
instance to invoke it on let's go figure
right so you imagine that generated
component you would actually have to
have an instance of my module in order
to be able to invoke that method which
means that you have to create an
instance or have it passed you have to
hold a reference to it then you have to
pass that around to invoke the provides
method etc etc etc if you make not
static all the sudden you know fields
disappear invoke virtual calls get
replaced with invoke static calls which
at least for Android the developer
documentation claims can be 15 to 20
percent faster on mobile devices um and
you know there's nothing really we can
do as an annotation processor to make
this work better or not for you but
except for inform you of the fact that
if you think about the way the generated
code has to work that you can you know
invoke static methods with a lot more
freedom than you can invoke instance
methods because you don't use the
instance well that's that's a good place
to start and actually sort of if you're
using dagger and you start poking
through so you're generated code and
looking for cases like this you can
shave off a lot of bytecode a lot of
runtime overhead a lot of allocated
objects doing exactly this type of work
and the dagger documentation at like the
user guide sort of points out a handful
of patterns like this finally this is
our optimization of last resort every
once in a while we just have to give you
a better way to express the thing that
you want to do the dagger understands
what does that mean well imagine you
just want simple delegation oh I
apologize that became very tiny um the
the example up here is basically imagine
you have a login activity presenter that
logging activity presenter as a logging
activity presenter imple this is very
common you know thing to have your
interface implementation separation well
somewhere you need to tell dagger okay
well in order to you know whenever I ask
for a presenter give me the presenter
imple and traditionally what you do all
the way back to you know dagger one this
was the only mechanism as you'd have a
provides method that provides method
would ask for the in pull and then
return it
you've just strung together a pattern of
delegation what's the problem why do we
care ah that is a method that has to be
invoked we don't know as an annotation
processor in you know dagger code
generating land what the implementation
of a method looks like we can't know
that you're only doing simple delegation
so there's you know a limit to what
types of optimizations we can do so we
gave you an alternative API rather than
saying okay because it provides medicine
here's the implementation that just does
the delegation we have a Bynes method
and Bynes method it's basically
shorthand for simple delegation we have
an abstract method because again Method
bodies don't matter to annotation
processor so we don't even need to
bother with it and now that abstract
method has the exact same method
signature but by saying binds it says
simple delegation what that means is in
the generated code we
all right implementation you're going to
have a provider just like you always did
but anytime you want the login activity
provider we do a you know relatively
safe cast it says okay just use the
provider for the implementation we know
that safe we've verified that we've used
the language to you know the language
that we've constructed out of
annotations to declare a construct that
now dagger nose is optimizable in this
way you get fewer objects you get fewer
method invocations you get simpler
delegation you get a whole lot of
benefit that you couldn't otherwise have
because the thing that you were trying
to do is not expressible in a way that
you know the previous api allowed so
this is thus far pretty much the only
time where we've resorted to having to
give you no dagger users a new API we
try to do as much as we can for you
without having to have you change your
code but on the flip side the nice thing
is there is a tool called error-prone
out in the world I don't know if you've
ever seen it or not error prone is a
static analysis and refactoring tool
that will find patterns one of which is
out of the box go download error prone
and it will search for you know dagger
optimizations that it can do and it will
suggest that you replace provides
methods with bines methods automatically
and it basically spits out a patch that
you can apply to your codebase so you
know we've tried to make it we tried to
keep it as automatic as we could but you
know not not as perfectly as we'd like
with a new API so that's the that's the
quick overview that's the you know sort
of a high-level version of what dagger
is and does and how we you know try to
keep the generated code nice and happy
and healthy
