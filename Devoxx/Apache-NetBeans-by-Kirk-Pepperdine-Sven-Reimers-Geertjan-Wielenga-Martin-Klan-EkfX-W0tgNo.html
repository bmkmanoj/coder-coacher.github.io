about half an hour or so not that much
time what we want to do is give a very
brief overview of the Apache NetBeans
process where you are where the process
began and also there's a whole number of
people here from the community who are
here to say a few things from their
perspective
also after Dalma he was one of the
mentors on the Apache net this project
is here as well so hopefully we can
actually have some discussion there's
literally one slide just to give some
context and we hope to engage you in
discussion and get your feedback and at
the end that there are even more people
involved in this project all right one
slide but I can't even get to it here
okay this is the one slide a summary of
everything in a few bullet points and so
in October 2016 Oracle announced the
donation of NetBeans to Apache and as a
result a proposal document was drawn up
with the motivations and the reasons and
so on and it was very clear that the
reasoning behind this move was to get
more community involvement in the
NetBeans project of course NetBeans
started in about 1998 1999 the first
Java IDE created by a group of students
in Prague and then son used it to
promote java primarily there was the
Oracle takeover and NetBeans became more
than a Java IDE over the past years
including JavaScript especially because
Oracle is increasingly focused on
javascript on the front end and then
this announcement about NetBeans being
moved to Apache Oracle remaining and
heavily committed to it in the process
so that happens in about
that announcement came out in October
2016 a long process began of auditing
the files to be donated at that point
the first few months figuring out what
the process should be and then actually
going through the code checking whether
files in the in the netbeans donation
could be donated to attach it whether
that really belonged to Oracle what the
provenance of each and every individual
file was which explains the length of
the process in the end we decided to
split up they don't net means into
different parts for the purposes of the
nation the first part focusing on the
the core of NetBeans the platform plus
the Java SE parts which have been
donated and which are in the Apache and
gate repositories so there's get up but
comes flash Apache slash incubator -
NetBeans or you'll find a very long list
and this list these are these are
modules and this is not everything yet
bear in mind this is the Java SE parts
of NetBeans + the underlying platform
and run at the end you see the
instructions for how to build it and you
need to do a git clone and then run ant
and make sure that you're using Java 8
because right now
NetBeans builds by means of Java 8 but
you can run it on Java 9 and there are
tools in it for the new Java 9 features
so support 4j show support for jigsaw
support for j-link and so on are all
built in there all kinds of features for
that
so there's 45 thousand files all donated
which constitutes formula lines of code
then the process began of relicensing
all that all those files to Apache about
30,000 we managed to do automatically we
built a tool to inspect all the files
for the Oracle or son licenses and
converted those then about 15,000 were
left over and we built as a community
and this ended up being a very useful
thing aside from its purpose also the
way that we worked as a community we
built a
list of all these modules in a table and
so I'm trying to get to Apache wiki and
there's a row in a table for each of the
modules and so you can see a long table
and people assigned different rows to
themselves and then inspected each of
those modules that they assigned to
themselves for whether or not you know
for the reason why a file hadn't been
realized automatically what was the
reason so in many cases there wasn't a
license and I needed to be a license of
people had to manually relicense those
files in other cases there were specific
reason so we there was a lot of
investigation I'm going on in that
process and we have just actually
finished that for the platform part of
NetBeans so the underlying
infrastructure which is not only the
basis of NetBeans IDE but also of
application that Boeing and Airbus and
Nate's are not Nestle many large
enterprises that part we have completed
relicensing and today is actually a
happy day because we sent out the vote
thread for the first incubator release
of NetBeans specifically we coded
NetBeans Niner alpha and that is the
NetBeans platform parts of NetBeans so
not all the Java EE tooling but the core
the parts where you can build
applications unlike Sun and Orick was
done with NetBeans IDE or like Boeing or
like breast and so on so you can gather
even without being a committer of course
you can go in that thread and you can
say plus one after you've done if you've
checked that there's artifacts but if
you're a committer on a patch in that
means then your vote counts more but you
can definitely check the artifacts and
and give your opinion on them so that's
where we are what we found especially
interesting about the process is and you
kind of expect that but it's great to
see a bunch of people are involved who
had never heard of before and this whole
process coincided with the October
hackathon an eclair hackathon that was
taking place somewhere and one of the
people from the Apache NetBeans
community was involved with that and God
other people involved you would never
heard of so you can see here on the
committee's page very nicely who has
been most involved over the past period
and this is all being about IP clearance
so these are the key people involved and
Phillip at the top six committers and
two of them are from Oracle myself and
my colleague younger Hoda and four of
the other top six are North America
which is great
so clearly this shows on the one hand
that Oracle remains involved and at the
same time that other organizations are
other people from other organizations
are also actively involved in this
process
you can see a long list of people who
are involved in different ways in that
in that list so you can join the mailing
list
put your plus 1 or minus 1 or 0 whatever
based on checking the artifacts then we
will have Nathan's 9'o beta which will
be everything in the github repository
so not just a platform but also the Java
SE tooling and at the same time with an
Oracle we're continuing to work on all
the thing the files to be donated so
we've focused in the first place on the
Java SE part so I'm going to we're now
working on for example the Java EE
tooling the JavaScript tooling the
groovy tuning the C++ tooling all these
other features of NetBeans has that's
being processed and that's really we
were I think the process has been a slow
and thorough one no one can complain
afterwards that we went too fast that's
definitely one complaint that we're not
going to get after all of this it's been
a it's it's a thorough process and it's
it's a great process and we will for the
first time not only be open source but
open governance that's the added
advantage that an Apache is giving us
and we're already seeing that in the
decision-making process no one no one
company no an individual and dominates
everyone discusses this on the mailing
lists and which of course means lots of
emails lots of potential confusions and
misinterpretations but that's email at
the end of this we're going to have a
really well
licensed healthily structured
development environment and
tooling platform for anyone else to
build their software on top of or to use
in schooling educational facilities as
it's already the case but even more so
and maybe contribute code into the
project and be involved in it and within
the community so that's a very basic
overview of where we are
maybe I'm Sven can say a couple of
things of of features that you're
working on and plans that you have that
are going to enrich NetBeans on the
community so Oracle is say or was not
interested in things like groovy support
for example but I'm with Gradle taking
up and the built to linspace a guy from
the community started writing you know a
plugin great plugin for NetBeans and but
the support was like like limited if you
wanted to write some groovy stuff that
was like only basic highlighting and
basic code completion things when we
started adopting groovy and writing own
Groovy's things for Gradle we just
discovered it well there are a lot of
thing points so um I started to to fix
things and I'm sitting like on a top of
a stack of a lot of changes in them
helping to get them manelli Apache once
the donation process is finished so
there's no no big point in trying to get
it back into the main line at this point
in time but I'm waiting for the second
code drop and to make all this work that
should be fine and yeah they're there
they're different things so having the
the platform with apache license will be
great for all those platform based tools
out there so we'll make giving back from
from a company perspective even easier
so um yeah so we're working on that and
hope to get more this so on so Kirk
what's your take on visual um being
available on a platform that's the
Apache License
in general whatever I'm up with yeah so
I mean I'm we really haven't done
anything in terms of or I haven't been
involved in anything in terms of getting
visual BM ported over but I would
imagine that's gonna be happening soon
so I have a number of different plugins
that I want to make sure it get ported
over to the same platform also on top of
all of the wonderful plugins that we
have I don't is anyone using visual VM
at all okay has anyone writing their own
plug-ins for visual VM we have one okay
yeah as so the process is incredibly
easy to to do so I think we should do
some more work in and in that area so
the Apache process has been absolutely
amazing to watch it right from the
beginning I know there was a very
tumultuous start to the whole thing but
really I think this is a model that I
think is absolutely wonderful the open
governance is something that I hope
would extend to other projects under the
umbrella maybe oh right here you can
listen to someone intelligent here no it
happens to be B so I think I'm thrilled
that that is now been developed in
Apache and that comes with great
expectations with us with big
responsibilities so of all the people
that complained in the past
Oracle should do this in that means or
guru - dead dead in that means well it's
now up to us ourselves we can we can if
we think NetBeans is not what we want it
to be then we can change it the apache
forces is much much easier for
developers to to participate and to and
when and and to shape that means the way
that we would like it to be shaped for
example if people say well it would be
nice if that means was rewritten part
using a Java vex that's fine then you
can go ahead and do it and I will be
happy to do participate so in general
it's a it's an opportunity but we have
to be aware that nothing come by itself
so it's also responsibility but I'm glad
to take that part of that responsibility
and I think one of the really nice
things about the Apache process is that
everything that we are doing other
organizations have done before other
projects have done before we're just
following well-trodden path that others
have taken and what makes that all
possible is that each project has
mentors assigned to it or mentors
volunteered to be involved in a in
different project to guide it along and
to give advice and to stay away as much
as possible to let the project develop
on its own as much as possible but to
inject advice and when asked or when
things are going a bit off the rails so
it just so happens that one of the
mentors on the Apache NetBeans project
is right here and so maybe Arthur can
say a couple of things from the Pachi
perspective and on on the path that
we've taken sure I think that NetBeans
like her already mentioned had kind of a
well troublesome start or at least
confusing start but that's normal
I would say especially for project didge
huge with so many people involved on so
many different levels so how the process
works within Apache that takes some time
to to get familiar if and it's so it's
not nobody is surprised that it takes
some time and that sometimes things go
off the rail or at least there's some
discussion about it I think it's really
good but what I am seeing in the net
beats community it's really discussing
things and among each other some people
complained about the process but then
what you often see is that mentors that
need to step in and explain things but
we try to stay away as much as possible
because the whole point is NetBeans in
the incubator of Apache is there to
incubate out of it into its own instead
on its own so the members of that
project needs to run the project
themselves it's not the mentors and
mentors will step out after a few months
or a year or something like that so it's
really about letting the community learn
the roles by themselves so it's not like
we are like babysitting the project it's
more like the projects like in a puberty
and it will probably do some nasty
things from wrong things that's fine and
and we'll probably tell you where you
went wrong but first you need to fall on
your face to figure that out and so in
in actually I think the community is
picking up pace pretty rapidly now so
that was slow in until June July or
something like that but like now all
kind of external new people coming in
shiny in helping out 50 license checks
and stuff like that that's that's and
except it's that community's starting to
learn how it works and it's growing in
that sense so from mental perspective I
think the project is really doing fine
first folk of actually a second but for
the platform point of view the first
fall going up that's really great and I
think it's just the first start of well
let the project bloom of a period and I
think it's it's on the right track thank
you thank you very much so I think
there's a bunch of things that you kind
of learn as you're going along and with
this with us how process and Apache
it's impossible to plan too much ahead
you kind of figure things out as you're
making the mistake and you realize okay
we shouldn't do it like this we should
do it like that and and that's that's
one one I mean I think at some point
we're going to be able to really do a
good presentation on lessons learned for
other Apache projects but that there's
one thing that you kind of learn things
as you go along and you can't plan too
much
and too far ahead and the other aspect
that I found really interesting about
Apache is that it's clearly not about
the code it's about the community which
is a very different approach very it's
more important that the community is
healthy and the communities working
together then that the code is healthy
at many especially in the in the
incubator stages of the project and in
the case of NetBeans what I think is
special aside from the scale I mean it's
such a large project that it's existed
for so many years and is that you know
we're coming to Apache not to create a
community we already have a community we
are recreating the community in the
apache way of doing things but we are
coming with the community and and what
we're trying to do is we're trying to
create a project around that around that
community whereas I think most groups
starting an Apache project and that they
they have code and they're going to
Apache because I want to build a
community with an Apache and we actually
have that community now but it's turning
out that our community is different to
what we thought it was which is very
interesting you know our community is
quite different the people are leading
it who are very different
- who were leading it in the beginning
and one other thing before we open up
for some discussion is that is really
interesting is that I forgot that point
that I wanted to make there's a very
interesting point penomet later I guess
are there any questions or comments from
anybody and here
insights must be a reason why you're
here you're not just here because you're
nowhere else to go to any any comments
from anybody yes
sure so the question the question is
where do we see that means going and
what is the support for Java 9 and it
would have been nice if they'd been Java
9 support earlier and compared to
intelligent Eclipse this is a key
question for many people I think and the
first point to make is you can use
NetBeans with Java 9 today you can do
get clone from the Apache git repository
and build it and then you'll be able to
use okay it's not a binary but if you're
a developer you can use git you can use
end and that's and there is a convenient
binary as well so if you're on the
Jenkins build page of attaching NetBeans
there's a convenience binary you can
download that you can start it up right
now sure it's not a finished complete
marketed wrapped up project but you can
just make things with Java 9 today you
can run that means on Java 9 and you can
use to have a nine tooling and the other
points about IntelliJ in Eclipse and so
on one interesting thing what I like
about Apache as well is that it's not
about competition we're not competing
we're not competing with any products
from the computing with commercial
products it's the only question is do
you have a community clearly we have a
community we're going to be building a
development environment and the tooling
platform for a community of people who
are using it if you want to use it
you're free to use it if I mean IntelliJ
has a fantastic role to play
Eclipse has a fantastic role to play
part of the reason why Jarvis says
successful is because there are these
choices most other languages and
technologies have one or two at most
development environments for them in the
case of Java we have three and it's
fantastic one of the actually the most
popular plug-in right now for NetBeans
is IntelliJ is dark long look and feel
so you can have Nettie's look like
intelligent violet plugin correct by
JetBrains
which they open sourced and somebody's a
random person and turn
to plug-in for NetBeans so you know if
you want to get NetBeans fine you know
where do we see it going we will be here
forever there is such a strong community
around it you've been working on this
for 20 years a lot of it in their own
free time not paid by anybody and that
kind of enthusiasm is going to keep this
project going for a long time
we will not be tied to a company I think
that is one big difference between
NetBeans and IntelliJ IDEA that they are
tired to JetBrains if Jeff brands were
to decide tomorrow well we're not going
to do this anymore
it doesn't seem very likely but if they
were to decide that they could in the
case of NetBeans we will be around as
long as people continue contributing to
it and even even then and we will be in
Apache you can download it forever
you're going to be there forever which
is really the nice thing and that the
Apache foundation gives us does that
answer the question the place if I think
if you compare this to how long it took
son to open source java and there's
still components in java that are not
open source right so i think the pace
has been spectacularly fast it's been
very quick or relatively speaking and
while they're trying to migrate over of
course those resources are migrating
over they're not developing new features
now the timing which oven Ines have been
unfortunate but that's that was an
outside influence there's not really
much you can do about that so I think
it's the pace has been good as far as I
think the pace is going to pick up a lot
once we actually have all the code in
Apache you're going to see the pace
picking up massively you know we all
decide as a community when we do the
next release we will just have mania so
we say okay so what are the features
that we'll work on for the next release
and discuss them together so in terms of
pace the one of the people from the
compiler team yonder Jolla he is
providing
already patches and branches for the new
features for upcoming Java releases so
there's support for local variable type
interference and I think there is say
from Project ember for the pattern
matching there's already prototype and
it's trying to do it all on the native
compiler no additional things needed
just the JDK so there will be like
awesome you know I think this is one of
the benefits we've seen from moving to
Apache is that now you're getting
contributions from a lot of places where
they just weren't able to contribute
before and so when people do
experimental language features they can
actually take the IDE modify it to
support those experimental language
features and you can check it out on a
branch so one thing that people don't
realize maybe is that there are
literally hundreds that we know of at
least of organizations who have created
applications on the NetBeans platform so
on the framework which means that they
know the api's so this like you know
spin and Martin and there's people from
NASA and NATO and Boeing and these large
organizations really smart developers
who've created large enterprise systems
on top of NetBeans you in other words
know the api's and in many cases they'll
be contributing large pieces of code
back to NetBeans but haven't been able
to do before on the on a platform level
but also I have this knowledge that
they've built up over the years in order
to build those applications which
enables them which which means that they
are ready to contribute code and
internet beans because they have all the
skills or the knowledge of the AP is we
don't have to spend a lot of time
introducing people to how NetBeans works
because people already know how NetBeans
works um through all the years that
we've been running this project we have
very few minutes left
is there someone with a question or a
comment or a statement or a complaint
yes
yeah yes there's more than code involved
this the website there's the issue
tracker this is a wiki there's
everything everything the the very nice
thing is that since Oracle remains
committed to NetBeans there is no cutoff
date from the Oracle side no one is
saying well if you're not out of here
before this in this date we're going to
just delete everything or something so
so right now the focus is clearly on the
code at the same time there are
different people in the community
focused on leaving the website and and
in all the other pre-processing and
post-processing stuff that needs to
happen there we're going to use the
Apache era tracker discussion is open
about whether we want to move everything
from our existing bugzilla into that
gyro tracker or maybe are in the open
items or maybe only items from the past
year or or stuff from 0 and and
different approaches and there's no
decision on that score yet we have a
wiki on Apache we have a blog on Apache
we have all kinds of infrastructure on
Apache we have a VN on Apache so it's
amazing how many resources we've you
know Apache is very generous as
everything set up and once you know
there's there's a chat that you can join
an infrastructure chat when there are
things that are kind of blocked and and
issues are not being resolved you can
just go on online and chat with the
infrastructure team in Apache and
there's like 20 people always like it
looks like 24 hours a day there's 20
people on there ready to help so as so
on the infrastructure level and all
those other parts of NetBeans things are
in different stages of the process and
we're not we're not planning too much
but we have an outline with a long list
of ok we need to think about this and
that and that and that and and it's a
it's a table of about 60 different items
and there's some of them as well there
was another question up there
the question is are there companies
other an Oracle interested in
contributing to a Petri net thing is the
first point to make is which is what I
like as so much about Apache is it's not
about companies it's about individuals
so that but the second point is there is
on the new proposal and the initial
proposal to prove the level of interest
in the Apache NetBeans project along
this of names and just out of
convenience not because it's neither or
whatever we also listed where they come
from to share the diversity and there's
a long list of them some error code this
also lists from from different
organizations in each case it's about
three or four people you know three or
four people from Airbus three or four
people from Red Hat three or four people
from this place in that place and none
of them full-time in the same way as I
mean no one in in Oracle as far as I
know has worked full-time on NetBeans
for years it's it's together with
something else and that means in Oracle
supports a range of different projects
and the context of those projects people
work on on NetBeans and so it's gonna be
on a needs basis so when an organization
needs a particular feature or you know
when those developers say ok this would
be interesting to have and that means
that's when they work on it so yes
there's a long list kind of NATO NASA
Space Agency type organizations but all
kinds of different things love
individuals and gluon of course many
different groups you find in this in
this list payara is another one and I
think more and more will come out but in
in many ways we don't care about
organizations we care about individuals
and a lot of the work will be done in
free time but eventually it would be
nice if there was something like area
and we have a free Friday this is
something that some organizations in
Oracle doing every Friday dedicated to
NetBeans and if some if owners actions
would come out with a statement along
those lines and that would be nice but
that's kind of with what the direction
is there that times up thank you very
much for coming we hope that you'll be
involved in this project and if you have
any questions or whatever there's of
course the Apache mailing list that you
can join and
you can discuss and we're looking for
more votes of course on the on the first
incubator release vote I'm very
confident that we're going to be here
for a very long time quite a few people
I've worked with on this project I mean
I joined that means in about 2004 there
were people working on on that on that
means for years before that and quite a
few of them a kind of white-haired great
bearded people and not the kind of
people who are just going to drop a
project one of which of course is James
Gosling the founder of Java hard core
NetBeans user and he really supports
this project and wants it to succeed and
we need everyone to be involved I hope
you be involved have to see on the
mailing lists we're going to have a
session like this at conferences all
over the world we're going to continue
to promote this product because we think
it's great thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
