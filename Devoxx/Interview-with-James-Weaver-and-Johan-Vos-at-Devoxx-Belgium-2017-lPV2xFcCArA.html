Johann Roth's and
James Weaver and you never talked
yesterday about quantum computing now I
have to admit a given I've given a few
interviews before by given I'm you know
I've interviewed people before about
quantum computing and I always feel a
bit fuzzy on the details which I suppose
is part of the quantum nature of things
nice thanks it's a bad joke what what is
he a qubit I could take that okay I'll
take the easy ones you take the hard
ones okay what if you think a qubit is
easy then well okay so a qubit is kind
of like this is probably a developer
audience right so if you think of a a
classical bit it can be on and off on or
off a Cuba is like that it could be on
or off
or it could be in some combination of
states some they call it a superposition
that's neither on nor off it's it's this
it's this state that really isn't even
decided until it's measured and then it
collapses into either on or off
kind of like Schrodinger's cat the
famous cat that that when you open the
box is either alive or not live yeah and
it can be used as the basis for some
really nice computations things that we
can't do classically like factor like
large prime numbers so what about a
qubit allow us to and I realized this is
very large question what is it about a
qubit that allows us to do that type of
computation that would take an infinite
amount of time maybe in classical
computer well but because the qubit can
be in different states at the same
moment as a Jim explained it is on and
off at the same moment so two qubits if
you have two bits for example
they can have four different
combinations but not at the same time so
if you want to evaluate those two bits
you need for function calls to evaluate
all the different possibilities but with
two qubits you have those four
possibilities at the same moment because
if you bring them into a superposition
they are 0 and 1 at the same moment with
different probabilities if you measure
them but because they can they can
contain the states they can contain
information of all the bits combined at
the same moment you can do much more
calculations simultaneously in the end
of course when you measure them they
will fall back to one state but because
all the computations can be done
simultaneously it's exponentially faster
than if you would have to do them one by
one question
how do you do the calculations without
measuring them so the trick with most
quantum algorithms is leveraging the the
wave nature of quantum mechanics and so
there's a there's a very famous
experiment that probably everybody's
heard of it's called the double slit
experiment where they shoot photons
through two slits and and they interact
with each other in a wave pattern and
and so you see a wave pattern that on
the back wall where where there has been
constructive and destructive
interference and so leveraging the quant
the wave nature of quantum mechanics
quantum computing then can do as johann
said you know you can create
combinations of qubits that are in
different states different phases at to
the one you so that you can choreograph
the solution then you can you can
choreograph the state to where to where
the correct answers will constructively
interfere and the the incorrect answers
will destructively interfere so then you
end up with you know very if we're
talking about the photon analogy we're
talking
you end up then with a wave pattern that
focuses light on one part of the screen
which is analogous to constructively
interfering to get the correct answer
and adding to that in the end of course
you still need to measure what you want
to measure but the answer to a difficult
question can be very simple and the
combination that the calculations
required to get a simple answer can be
very very complicated so that is what
you can do with quantum computing the
calculations can be extremely
complicated but then the answer might be
very simple the answer can be one number
for example the number 42 for example
yes that's the answer to a very
difficult question yes right exactly and
so as Johann mentioned it's you don't
know the answer to you measure and when
you do measure it's going to be some
probability that that's the correct
answer
now with some algorithms that
probability can be a hundred percent
like the Deutsch algorithm that we've
walked through yesterday but with some
algorithms like shores or which factors
large large prime numbers when you take
that measurement there's a chance you
know there's only you know a certain
chance that that's that's the correct
answer and so it may not be and then you
check it and maybe classically you know
using classical computation you check
that answer is it right or not and then
you might have to measure again and you
know like like run the run the problem
again maybe a few times to verify that
that was the right answer
so you mentioned in you talked about and
just now about quantum computing being
leveraged to solve these very difficult
computations and functionally
specifically trapdoor functions like
factoring large Prime's so what are the
implications on things like cryptography
yeah well cryptography is partially
based on the fact that it's extremely
hard to factor a large number into
primes so the moment that that becomes
very easy one of the core fundamentals
of the current encryption for example
errors a encryption vanishes so that
means that it will become very easy to
intercept encrypted communication and to
break encryption so to decrypt messages
without having the right credentials to
do so and that's a it's going to be a
radical change if if someone can easily
decrypt your message then you can't rely
on encryption anymore
so that will completely break encryption
but fortunately that does not mean that
well it will break the current
encryption but fortunately quantum
mechanics and quantum computing also
allow for a new type of encryption
that's based on quantum entanglement and
so on and that encryption cannot be
broken by classical computing or quantum
computing so we should be safe for for a
while after we switch to quantum
encryption but once quantum computers
are strong enough to break the current
encryption then you had the current
encryption will be completely unreliable
and you mentioned a really interesting
piece of research done by a Chinese team
XI with quantum encryption as you
mentioned quantum encryption so could
you tell me something about yeah they've
done a couple of experiments that were
documented in the arc sieve papers one
was where they shot a photon first of
all before they shot the photon they did
something called entangled tangling at
so they can untangle two photons and
that's a that's a just a quantum
property where you can tangle entangle
to you know subatomic particles and and
so when you you could you could separate
them by a great distance if you want to
farther than you know light-years or
something you know just other edge of
the universe doesn't matter what they
did is they shot one up to a satellite
and then they kept the other one on the
ground and so then they did the
experiment where you measure one and
then measure the other one and they're
both the same because when you measure
one in an entangled pair like that then
the other one collapses to the same
state and so they did they did one
experiment from ground to the satellite
and then they did another one where they
shot the photon from the satellite to
the ground and verified
you know quantum entanglement and the in
that context that can also be used then
and maybe johan would like to explain
this for something called quantum
teleportation to where you could
teleport
encryption keys yes well quantum
teleportation is a it may sound a bit
science fiction and I have to disappoint
the people who expect Scotty beam me up
happening soon because it's not really
like that already quantum teleportation
allows allows you to send information
from point A to point B without really
sending the bits from point A to point B
so by sending it can be shown for
example that you can send the
information of two bits by just sending
one bit and an entangled qubits so by
leveraging entanglement and by doing
operation against applying gates to
qubits you can send the information from
point A to point B without really
sending the carrier of the information
from point A to point B so that sounds
like teleportation and it actually is
teleportation but it's not that it's not
really that you can first of all this
works on a very small scale at high
energies so it's not that you can
teleport a human from point A to point B
which does not mean that that is
serially impossible but not with this
theory this is about transferring
information from point A to point B and
then when you do that then the the
information at Point a is collapses so
the information at point B is the only
copy of it that at that point because
there's something called no cloning
there's a no cloning theorem where you
can't you can't clone a quantum state ok
so that's because you have a unique
really please shared yeah secret yes so
that is that is indeed one of the of the
core principles of of quantum computing
apply to encryption if if you have a
private key and that has been tampered
with or if someone tried to read
something private then it can be
detected that the message has already
been read because by observing something
it will fall back to the default state
and that is something that with some
other quantum algorithm that you can
detect so if you get a message and that
message is supposed to be encrypted and
only readable by you
you can relatively easy detect if
someone else tried to read it successful
or not successful and that means that
someone tried to want to snoop your
message and that will allow much better
than today - to be sure that the message
that you received is really not
intercepted so the moment that a hacker
between two parties try to do an
intercept your key and to want to break
it if you try to do that with quantum
mechanics you break the whole system and
it will be notified so it's it's adding
it's adding an additional security layer
so we might lose standard encryption but
we have something much safer
