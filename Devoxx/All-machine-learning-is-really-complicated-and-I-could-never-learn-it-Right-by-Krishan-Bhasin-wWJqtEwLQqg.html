sure hi thanks for coming to my talk
titled all machine learning is really
complicated and I could never learn it I
actually hope over the course of next 15
minutes I can convince you otherwise to
set a bit of context the talk first my
name is Christian I'm a self-taught
software engineer I've got actually got
background in mechanical and
environmental engineering spent a lot of
time looking at energy policy I
currently work as a data engineer at a
large plant or services company building
out our data ingestion systems in the
cloud I previously worked as data
scientists in the same company as a more
like general software engineer and in
the cloud architecture team I've been
very very lucky to be on a grad program
letting rotate round three diverse areas
and my journey in the industry has been
from a place where I didn't really know
what or who Jenkins was or what Tomcat
was or or 180 I really meant I've been
to a really steep learning curves and I
found the dispersed loading curve was in
a data science team the machine learning
and because I found the very the start
was very very dense and very
inaccessible so this talk is all aimed
at addressing that I'm hoping to achieve
three things really to give an overview
of some of the major kinds of problems
that machine learning can help solve to
show where you might see an in real life
where you may have encountered it and
lastly to make the first steps less
dense to try and encourage more people
to to have a stab so it's useful to
start by trying to broadly define what
machine learning is it's the thing that
lets you move from a world where you say
if the heat exceeds 80 degrees Celsius
then we've got a problem
likely to fail to a world where you say
I've got all this data showing the
component conditions over time some of
them failed let's use that to define
what the pre-fader state is and we'll
act on that it's the idea of getting
machines to provide insights or drive
actions based on what the data says
rather than what the code says even more
simply it's the idea of writing
generalized code that can do specific
things people often ask how does the
machine learning rate to relate to AI
for our purposes it's just a specific
subset where AI is generally making
computers behave smart dictionaries
academics will give you proper
differences proper definition
it's kind of semantics so with in
machine learning there are three main
types you have supervised learning which
is when you you are looking for
something specific from your data if
when you have a kind of known outcome or
a known thing that your data to predict
sort of point out to you you have
unsupervised learning which is when you
don't have that specific target and
you're looking more to understand your
data there are many many different kinds
a really cool example is clustering
algorithms like the use of Spotify where
they look at your playlist play history
put them into discrete groups basically
how similar they are and then add new
songs free to try and the last kind is
reinforcement learning which is a
situation where you have an agent and
then that agent can carry out actions
and then you reward or punish that agent
based on whether the actions led to a
success or failure you might have seen a
video on YouTube of a machine study
going to play Super Mario Brothers on
its own that's reinforcement learning
and we won't actually be looking at
unsupervised or reinforcement learning
here because they aren't the nicest
place to start I've actually not touch
them too much myself and I haven't got
time 15 minutes
so talking about supervised learning
there are broadly two main kinds and you
have classification and regression
classification is where you want to
split things or predict things into
discrete categories kind of like what
what fruit is this or a much simpler
example binary example given the full
passenger list of a Titanic can you
predict who would have survived and who
died there are many different algorithms
you can use to approach these problems
the one I'll start with is a very
visually intuitive one it's a tree model
and the way it works is you start with a
simple baseline prediction where you say
I have knowledge of that unfortunately
60% of people on board the boat didn't
make it off alive and so for every
single passenger if I predict they
didn't survive the fact that they died I
have instantly a 60% accuracy but then
if I realized that I know that there's a
split on gender maybe 80% of the male's
didn't basically males died but only 25%
of the WIPP over the females that died I
can then do a single split where I say
if it's a man predict dead it's a woman
predict survives
I've suddenly jumped to a 75 percent
accuracy now if you keep going with that
you end up with something like this
which is a 3/3 branch tree based on
gender age and number of siblings or
spouses that person had on board now
this is really clearly something you
could write yourself using some if or
switch statements or whatever but a
really cool part is that when you use
the machine learning algorithm to do
this at each layer it looks the optimal
split and it does it for you you have to
yourself pick out the fact that being
older than 10 years old is a good thing
trees are obviously aren't the only
model on your only algorithm you can use
here and there are many others things
like support vector machines and you've
probably heard of neural networks
unfortunately haven't got time to go
into them against the 50 minute talk but
they are more used than these and the
destiny worth reading into more if this
sort of catches your interest so the
other kind of machine a supervised
learning problem that I mentioned was a
regression problem and that's when
you're interested in a continuous
outcome run a discrete outcome at a high
level most regression algorithms are
just simply doing a line of best fit
search so this is an example of a
univariate linear regression where
you're looking at a single input some
with high school GPA and trying to
predict their University pay offset more
commonly you'll find people don't use
univariate they use a multivariate which
is the same idea just with many many
more inputs and very hard to visualize
so I've gone for univariate one here the
other thing that might be really
obviously is that this strongly relies
on a strict linear relationship between
your input and your output but again
that can be handled by allowing your
variables multiplied by each other or
square root of them or square them or
something
but you fundamentally come back to the
same idea of I just want to find a line
of best fit in many dimensions and
that's what the equation looks like
where you have an output a sense
literally a mass equation so when might
you have encountered some of these
machine learning problems in the real
world so Facebook and Apple iPhoto in
Google photos they famously
automatically detects faces and in
photos the way they do that is when you
upload a photo
they put a scanning box on it and then
move that box across and at each point
they do have a classification problem
which is inside this box is there a face
if they do find a face there we've got
can problem given I have a face can I
predict whose face it is this is quite a
cool new problem but something that I
think is cooler which is debatable
it's a idea of email spam filters
because there are there's not a new it's
not not a new problem and this is a
situation we've gone from the old world
of humanely trying to predict these
things by saying does the email have the
words buy cheap or discount or viagra or
something so a world now where you have
stacks of known spam emails stacks of
known good non-spam emails and you throw
into a model and the model itself
without human intervention will pick out
the pictures of spam so you no longer
need to yourself be chasing the habits
of spammers regression is used very
widely as well an example I mention here
is in sales forecasting especially in
real estate management so hotels and
other places can and do build models
that will take into account things like
what the weather is or expected weather
is and what time of year it is what the
macroeconomic effects are if you're in
the recession or in growth you might
have different numbers of customers
willing to come to you and slight prices
into the country concerned and things
like is the website being heavily hit
right now and how full am I to predict
what the optimal room rate is that they
should charge to maximize their profit
so as I mentioned to start my ideal hope
from this resource 15-minute talk is
that people go in and have a kind of
stab at doing something so I thought I'd
also quickly have a look at what things
you should think about when approaching
a problem especially think about is this
idea of future engineering because data
doesn't always naturally usually doesn't
come in a very easy to consume format so
feature engineering is the process of
creating features or variables within
your data that you can reasonably expect
to help you in your in your attempts to
predict something so if I go back to
Titanic example you're given like full
names ages ticket prices and more on the
data set I'm doing a truncated version
here and you might have a theory though
that someone's class one social class
might influence their chance of getting
off for life maybe if you're a baron or
a madam or
game or something you could do elbow
your way to the front of the lifeboat
assault or something but you can't
really extract that from this data as it
stands but you might recognize that
someone's title strongly influences or
strongly indicates sorry their class so
you could use some feature engineering
where you extract everything from the
first column to the first full stop and
put it into its own variable suddenly
you've made someone's class available to
your model to consume and you actually
find it's quite predictive a slightly
more complicated real-world example is
if you if you mention remember I
mentioned them Spotify dear clustering
on your on your listening habits they
actually do that based off features they
engineer themselves on things like dance
ability of a song and a clue thickness
of a song and they build those before
putting it through the clustering
algorithm by looking at some of the
underlying metrics of the song it's
nothing to think about is that in nearly
every case and the data you have
available in front of you to build a
model it's only a small subset of data
that really exists in the real world and
again most the time you don't really
care about your accuracy on this small
subset you really care about your
accuracy across all data out there in
the real world does it generalize and if
it doesn't generalize you over fitted a
really extreme example is again if I go
back to Titanic example this is a quite
a shallow tree with only 3 splits but
you could imagine it kept going until
every single leaf everything will no
have a single person in it so someone's
male age 22 had three siblings on board
the th lost 130 pounds had no children
blah blah cool Joseph you couldn't
reasonably expect that to scale to the
general real world just definitely an
over fitted model the way you avoid this
is by splitting the data you have
available in front of you into a train
and a test set and what you do is you
trait you build your model on that train
set and then you move it across pointier
or test set and just see if you can
predict it accurately and if your asset
doesn't drop by too much you're taking a
big step to being comfortable they are
model generalizes and doesn't over fit
the last point that I want to impress is
is the idea of how you measure the
quality of your model and because before
you do any evaluation of your model
you've built you want to make sure you
consider what the baseline success or
failure rate of a really really simple
or a really random model would do so for
example if I flip a coin and have
I have around 50% chance of guessing
correct I guess heads every time now
let's say when I weigh and built a model
that looked at things like the strength
of my thumb the diameter of the coin
humidity wind speeds all those kind of
things and I got 45 percent success rate
that could sound really exciting and
really cool until you remember that
guessing heads every time is literally
better and that's something I like
people often tend to forget that you
want to compare against this really
simple or really random model so the
steps to take after this I hope is more
like to get get hands dirty and to dive
in and have a poke around because that's
the fastest way to learn that's how I
managed to how I did it and there are
data sets and challenges all over the
internet specifically for this and even
competitive one this LSATs your games
you want to earn some money from it a
really amazing community for that is
Kaggle and that's where I really
recommend starting out with I got
started there with the two models they
have specifically for people news the
field the Titanic they've set which I
referenced a few times already and the
Iowa housing data set which is their
regression example we are trying to
predict the selling price of some houses
in Iowa based off things like the floor
space
number of bathrooms how they got a
swimming pool etc the way it sort of
works is you go to the website you
download some data sets they split it
into a training test for you you build a
model on the training set you point out
a test set and get some predictions and
upload it back to kaggle and then
they'll school you and put your
leaderboard there are some really useful
tutorials against art as well I use this
guy Travis Stevens to help give you
pointers of where to look and actually
recommend looking at their machine
learning expose the workshops happening
later on this afternoon so to actually
get started it's worth pointing out that
you don't actually have to understand
the nitty gritty to the inside out or
even much the basics of how these models
work in the same way that you don't
really have to know how to CP works
properly or a tool to build a restful
api and there are implementations of the
algorithms across almost every language
skipping out all the imports and stuff
are which is one of the most widely used
data science languages has it built in
its native you just call that our part
function which build you a tree
basically data
Tyson has a really cool scikit-learn
library which is the go-to library for
all data science and machine learning
and again you just just initialize that
classifying and pass your data in I
personally haven't done any machine
learning work in Java but I know that
whacker and ML Lib why at least well
seen in this space and again it's a case
of running the imports initializing your
your model and passing and passing the
variables you care about I would really
recommend the getting started with RM
Python despite this being a Java
conference specifically because best of
most widely used languages in industry
and there'll be loads and loads of
resources out there to help with getting
started and then once you get
comfortable you can move over to these
Java libraries now after doing this if
it takes you if it takes your fancy you
find very interesting then it's worth
having a dive under the hood and looking
at how the algorithms work and to that I
took the machine learning course by
Andrew Young it's on Coursera via
Stanford University and what it does is
it uses MATLAB to show you the math
behind the magic of the algorithms and
it's quite eye-opening because it shows
you some of the subtleties of how it
works
I wouldn't let Matt now put you off and
the fact that use MATLAB lets you really
understood understand specifically how
the algorithm works so that was 15
minutes a quick whirlwind tool I hope
that I've helped given a top level
overview of some of machine learning and
how you might approach it I really hoped
I've made the first steps less dense and
less inaccessible and I've you have to
take any questions this is well I've got
