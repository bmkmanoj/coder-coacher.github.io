really pleased to be joined by my old
partner and crime Stefan the antrum
founder of DevOps co-founder of Lost's
welcome thanks for joining me on the
sofa to welcome
so you apart from being here as in your
Fox News capacity I know that you've
been talking
you gave a session about something
really exciting and close to my heart
which is there the next phase of
voxcom Fox days calm and DevOps calm
yeah absolutely
yeah tell us a bit about the projects so
I've been hacking for the last four
months since Devil's Belgium was
finished I I had an idea where I wanted
to actually import all of the cfb
contents which we normally reset after
every devoxx and basically have like an
aggregator where we import the talks but
also the ratings and so that way we have
like one dashboard we can see all the
presentations and all the ratings cross
their folks events so that was like a
first objective this is all fragmented
at the moment it's all fragmented every
deaf fox has their own cfb they don't
share that information because it's just
they're all on their own islands so that
at least already solved that that that
issue and I had that working very
rapidly I was using je hipsters for that
and almost in a matter of a day maxximum
two days because I was changing the the
domain model a beta and so on
I had a working prototype so I showed a
working prototype to you and a few
others and of course you know you very
creative if you came immediately uh we
should do this and that and after that
one our hangout I already had like to-do
list for another month or so and I think
yeah that's fine I mean that's what
we're I'm looking for these synergies
and the cross-pollination and one of the
ideas I think it came from you was like
so you're creating events you're
importing the events we might as well
publish the events to fox days because
now we're manually adding that so so
that was one thing is like hey Fox stays
calm let's have a manual nice list of
all the events but also like with
Foxconn since we need to basically
automate what Katrine did in the file
and instead of adding the stalks from
the different sessions if we import the
stalks and I can actually look up viewed
on YouTube where that talk is located I
can add that link from YouTube to that
talk and then we can basically create a
vox.com automatically based on their Fox
and Fox taste content which gets
published on YouTube and basically
maintained in the CFP so so that was the
the next phase is that that was very
rapid well not rapidly I had to also
make it a nice design and so on so that
it looks good because it was front
facing solution but basically that that
was version 2 I think that was around
end of December I had that and then I
think the the other biggest pain point
that we have is that the CFP CFP is
written in Scala uses Redis and so on
and every devoxx has their own instance
and the problems that we have like
twelve or thirteen fox days they don't
want to use a very heavy scale
application because it's a bit hard to
install you need to configure the event
in Scala as well and this is where we
were talking to the dead Fox Morocco
guys is that they said well maybe they
can actually create a white label
version and in the administration of the
events you don't only define your event
but you also define your schedule and
I'm using like these nice prime and J
components which wraps around full
calendar JavaScript components and
basically you're doing your visit with
setup of your event like when the
keynote is taking place in which rooms
what types etc you do that once and then
you say okay now create a CFP and so I'm
taking that JSON information passing it
to a docker image starting the docker
image and in less than 15 seconds you
have a CFP running on the in the cloud
basically that's amazing because
beforehand I mean I know Nicola did a
fantastic job of writing the CFP
application and scholar in the first
place but as you say it's difficult for
some people to do so now from a
wizard-based
system we were able to spin up a new CFP
instance like that yes and that is gonna
allow people to use a really amazing CFP
which as so many features for program
committee reviewers yeah not to mention
also the fact that you can start doing
what we what we call their golden ticket
initiative whether you also allow people
from the community to also put their
votes and ratings and reviews for each
toolkit as well so that's great and then
that's also got an angular scared
schedule application no I'm dialed into
it so once you've worked out when people
are going to talk and I know there's
some stuff that we're talking about on
there in terms of automating some of
that activity as well yeah we're working
together with red hats on up top planner
where it will actually create a schedule
for you based on certain parameters you
give so you don't have because that's
always a big puzzle right you need to
put all the right puzzle pieces on the
board and optic planner will probably do
this ultimate it for us so and that's
the beauty of this country so I've been
because like the development was very
fast thanks to Jay hipster but the
deployment I'm not a DevOps guy so
deploying it I was like sure it's
already Dockers it these are already
docker containers but then we want to
have you know high availability I want
to be able to do rolling updates and it
became very obvious for me that I have
to use kubernetes so I've been like in
Foxy's Bucharest here I've been
following all the different kubernetes
sessions I have a workshop that I will
follow later this afternoon on Cuban so
hopefully that's going to give me enough
information to then finally deploy
version one in production and then yeah
we've got a long list of to do's and
nice enhancements and other
opportunities that we can introduce in
this environment yeah absolutely and
that by having that the the CFP tool
easy to spin up that creates so much
more as well so ultimately yeah the
schedule is pushed out in HTML on the
website and then you've got for instance
mobile app on which we've worked with
the gluon folks yes on and so we'll have
a white label version of that that we
can instantly throw out and that allows
things like sponsor scanning and also
attend the appear to peers
so new barcodes with a bit of
information here two people can stay in
touch or Nyanko love their media
conferences and then ultimately any
session that's recorded err than their
vendor it's gonna get pushed immediately
to Fox comm yeah I mean the beauty will
be is that because it's a franchise
model if there's a user group who wants
to join the family we can actually boost
up them in less than an hour they can
have the full ecosystem of tools that
we've now been working on have them
readily available and join the family so
it really starts to become a nice
ecosystem and the beauty is that we have
all these different organizers they come
with new ideas and we can actually start
developing that and create white-label
versions so that way if one idea is
implemented all the Deaf foxes all the
vogue days will immediately benefit from
that yeah so I'm really excited I mean
I'm really keen on like you know the
next couple of months I'll I'll have
lots of fun with other ideas and I think
well next couple of years basically and
if you're an event organizer and
eventually your most cumbersome task is
actually just building a website for
people to understand what what's going
to be happening at your your event which
is pretty much what's going to happen
now with this new tool everything else
in there behind the scenes is gonna work
yeah then that can only be is great yeah
yeah it's gonna be fun I'm looking
forward to version 3 and 4 and 5 because
we'll love the ideas that we've talked
about and also all the ideas were
getting from being out conferences like
this absolutely people are saying hey
how about you integrate this and do that
they're so crazy oh yeah just really
some really cool ideas that we'll be
able to add in it and then gradually and
then I'm really having lots of fun it's
good stuff maybe in the next version of
this interview we'll start talking about
image recognition and stuff like that
tell too much of some secrets for the
next talk I'll give Oh on this so if
people want to know more about this I
know they can watch your YouTube video
from this week and also then in about
six weeks from now you're gonna be
speaking at DevOps UK yeah with the next
iteration yeah absolutely this is going
to constantly evolve so
and I can't wait to see the next version
at that event and thanks for joining me
on the sofa yeah
thank you Mark see ya</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
