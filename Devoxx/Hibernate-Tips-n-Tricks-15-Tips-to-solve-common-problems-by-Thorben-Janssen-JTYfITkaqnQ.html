hibernate tips let's start it off with a
quick question who have you knows this
situation that you have to implement
something that sounds pretty simple and
then you recognize well it's not that
simple to implement and you can't by any
means be the first one who has to
implement that yeah I think all of us
know that and the good thing is there is
in the most situations a good way to
solve that without implementing a lot of
stuff because hibernate provides lots of
features that help us to implement the
most common business requirements before
we dive in a few words about me Who am I
I'm Tom yawns and I'm an independent
trainer and consultant and author of the
book hibernate tips and today I want to
show you 15 of these tips and how they
can help you to implement the most
common requirements so enough slides
let's just jump in the IDE and take a
look at a little bit of code so a common
question that I get is how can I find
out which queries hibernate really
executes from a use case and how long do
they take where I was having it
statistics you can get a lot of internet
information about what hibernate is
doing because hibernate obviously knows
pretty well what it's doing internally
so what do you do need to do for that
you need to set the generate statistics
configuration parameter to true you can
do that in the persistence example like
I do here or what I prefer for real
applications is to provide this as a
command line parameter so that I don't
need to change any configuration files
another thing you should then do is set
the lock level for or hibernate start to
debug and that's all so let's run this
simply test case here which just selects
an author by ID and let's take a look
what hibernate can show us for this
simple test case the first thing you
probably notice is this part we are
having it gives us a good overview about
what happened during this session so we
can see how long hibernate spend on the
on all JDBC statements and how many JDBC
statements hibernate executed and you
can see that here there are a lot of
other information if you want to dive
deeper into this then definitely take a
look at the hibernate statistics either
in the documentation or I wrote a blog
post about that which explains that in
great detail another thing that you get
is this line here and this is pretty
handy if you recognize where my use case
takes longer than it should because here
you can see okay I executed this query
it took this long and it just returns
one row if you have performance problems
we quite often then see okay this query
either takes long then it's most likely
something that you need to analyze in
your database or your may be returning
not one row but a few thousand and there
is almost never any reason to really
read several thousand records from the
database and to look at memory the
question that I then often get and that
our surprises me little bit is well why
can't I use patron nation with jpq air
because the issue is you probably know
limit and offset and other ways to limit
the number of reside set records in an
SQL query JPK doesn't support that but
we don't need that in an Estonian apq
egg theory because the query interface
provides us with the said max reside and
set first reside methods which do
exactly the same and that allows us to
use the same approach for jpq l and
Tyr key with which is quite nice and
when we execute this test case you can
see here that having it used this
information to put a limit clause to the
SQL statement that it generated okay
another thing that is quite useful with
hibernate as this one so if you're
working with JPA and hibernate you
probably know that you can model
associations in your entity mapping
which is nice and comfortable to use you
just call it get our method and then you
retrieve the Association and you can use
these associations in your queries but
sometimes we don't want to model all
these associations in our mapping for
example here I have a book entity and a
review entity and if you have a huge
online bookstore then you might have a
book with several thousands of reviews
and you would if you would not want to
load these several thousand reviews into
memory so you might not want to model
this association unfortunately with
plain JPA you can't use or you need this
Association to join the book with the
review entity in your query but not with
hibernate anymore there we can finally
since hibernate five join the book
entity with the review entity in this
example with a join clause that looks
basically the same as we know it from
SQL so we finally have that with
hibernate I hope that we will get that
in the near future with JPA as well
because let's be honest there's no
reason to not use such an a joint
statement in a query and the result is
well what your basic cell probably
expected it's basically the same as you
would write if you create your SQL State
when you're safe it's just an inner join
with
on condition that he finds that we want
to join it by the book forum pokey
foreign key to the book table and the
book ID just just the typical on claws
well if you're talking about SQL
statements and SQL snippets that we want
to use then you might be familiar with
the formula notation as well as someone
used the formula annotation at the past
okay this is an annotation that is a
little bit special you shouldn't use it
in huge applications that have to handle
lots of parallel users or you where you
need the best performance it's more
something that you might want to use for
an exam of one application that is used
within a company where it's more
important to get the job done quickly
than getting the best performance in the
end the furmity annotation allows you to
define an SQL net which hibernate will
add to all queries that load this entity
and the result of the sks Nippert will
be mapped to an entity attribute so here
i use it to calculate the age of my
author so obviously don't want to store
the age in the database let's say if I
would need to update it basically every
day and shake well is it his birthday or
her birthday do I need to update the the
age or not I can use this PostgreSQL
function and just calculate the age
similar to what I would do in my
business logic I'm going to now run the
test case you can see that hibernate
adds this snippet to the SQL query as I
said please be careful with here is with
these formula snippets they are added to
all queries and whatever you do in this
SQL nebat it creates an overhead if you
don't use the age attribute in this case
so either make sure that the attribute
that you annotate with deformed
annotation is used in all important use
cases or be pretty sure that the that
performance is not one of your most
important requirements database views
who will uses database views and who
mapped them to entities yeah quite a few
well as long as you just perform a
select statement then the table is
pretty similar to view the SQL statement
basically looks the same and you can map
them to an entity you can see that here
the book viewer annotated it with entity
and then there are a bunch of attributes
one thing that's special is the
immutable annotation quite often you can
use views for read operations but you
can't use them for write operations so
it's a good thing to tell hibernate
about that you can do that with the
immutable annotation and then hibernate
will exclude this entity from all dirty
tricks that means you could change any
attributes of this entity if you provide
setter methods but hibernate wouldn't
replicate this change to the database
and it wouldn't also wouldn't throw any
error message you've just not recognized
that your change attribute wasn't
persisted so I highly recommend if you
have immutable entities that you only
use getter methods and don't provide any
setter methods so that no one can change
any attribute value
another handy mapping operation
annotation is this one here
it's another annotation that is quite
useful if you have an application that
you want to finish quickly and that
doesn't need to handle too much load
here I decided to load the author
entities that are associated to book so
basically all authors who wrote a book
in the alphabetical order of their last
and first names I could do that with a
new query but if I say okay I will
mostly access the author list by a
Decatur and I really need them always in
this specific order then I can also
define the order clause via this order
by a notation if I now run this test
case then we can find the order by
clause that I defined in the annotation
here at the end of my at the end of my
query so hibernate takes the SKA snippet
from the order by annotation and adds it
at the end of each and every query that
initializes my author association for
the book entity again if you use that
please make sure that you always need
the author in this specific order
because ordering takes a little bit of
time at least a little bit and there's
no need to spend that if you don't need
the other than that order and if you
need them ordered in some use cases and
not ordered in others then it's most of
them the better approach to just use a
JPEG vivid you load the author entities
and order it within the query
database functions who uses database
functions who would like to use database
functions it would be easier well a few
more still not that many okay
as with all features that are supported
by your database as soon as you use jbk
your capabilities are quite limited
JPK can do a lot less than SQL and
that's also the case with functions
JPK supports a small subset of the
functions that are part of the SQL
standard and unless they are added via
the database specific hibernate dialect
it doesn't support any database specific
functions but what you can do is you can
use the JPA jpq a function function to
call any function that you want to call
so in this case I call the function
calculate with these two parameters so
basically the price attribute of the
book and a bind parameter value that are
set down here so right now with
hibernate 5 we have a few limitations
here we can easily use the function in
the where clause unfortunately we cannot
do the same in the Select Clause because
they are hibernate needs to know which
data type or function returns it can
guess that here in the where clause but
I can't do that in the Select Clause so
if you want to use it in the Select
clause you need to define the function
in your hibernate dialect and then this
whole function approach here isn't of
any use any more because then you could
use the function directly within your
jpq statement but for the where clause
it's quite nice and you can see here
that I now have the calculate function
which I referenced here
now have here my statement
another handy feature of JPA is the
metamodel do use the metamodel well
maybe a few
okay the meter model provides us with a
way to define queries with the material
API in a type safe way and there are
these classes here so if I add the
following dependency to my maven build
this JPA model again then hibernate will
generate the metamodel classes for the
metamodel class for each entity in my
project what is the metamodel class
emitter model class is this it is the
metamodel class for this book entity
which has an ID version title publishing
dated publisher and authors attribute
and as you can see here you have the
same attributes within the static meter
model class and that enables us to
reference these attributes here in a
type safe way when we build the criteria
query the huge advantage where there are
basically two huge advantages compared
to plain strings first of all I don't
need to remember incorrectly type the
name of each attribute that makes it a
lot comfortable more comfortable to
implement the criteria clearly in the
first place but what is even better is
as soon as I reflect on my entity and
rename one of the attributes or the
entity itself then the next build will
generate the new metamodel classes and
the old version of the attribute will
not be no longer be available so my
build will fail with a compiler error
and I will see all the places where I
need to affect on my code in the IDE
because the name of the attribute
changed well that might not be the the
best tooling that we could wish for I
mean it would be even better if all
these places would be adapted
automatically but it is by far better
than using the search functionality of
your IDE and searching for a string with
a specific name especially if the string
is called ID or note or something else
that is basically used on on each and
every entity so how do you you model
your primary keys do you use uu IDs okay
who uses u uu IDs there are basically
two options to create these uu IDs I
can't do that in my own code which is
definitely a good idea but I can also
use an easier approach if it's fine for
me that hibernate will do it when I
possess the entity so you probably know
that hibernate can generate normal
surrogate Keys via a sequence or an auto
incremented database column and it can
do the same with uu IDs the only thing
you need to do is use the datatype UUID
which is class in the java.util package
and annotate it with generated value
like what you would do with a primary
key of type long so in this case
hibernate will use a random number based
algorithm to generate a unique UUID
let's take a quick look at the test case
so you can see here
that I'm persisting a new author and
then which we need later on and as you
can see in the code hibernate here
generated this very cryptically looking
uu ID as the primary key value and can
it can then use it to which with the
UUID layer the entity later that's not
the only approach that our algorithm
that you can use to generate uu ids you
can also use this approach which uses
not a random number but the IP of the
server to generate a unique UUID value
and as you can see here that requires a
little bit more work just because it's
not the default algorithm so now I have
to explain to hibernate right I don't
use the default generator please use the
this UUID generator with the custom
version one strategy but still just one
annotation that I need to add here and
run an hour on the test case
then you can see here that the UUID now
looks a little bit different
so Java 8 plot quite a while ago some
interesting changes one of them was
optional which enables us to show in our
API that there is an attribute that
might be not right with associations we
have exactly this situation to one
Association could be null for example
here a book and the publisher nowadays
you can do safe publishing pretty easily
you don't need a publisher anymore and
you need to model that in your domain
model unfortunately you can't use
optional as an attribute type there are
several reasons for that it's not
serializable it's not supported by by
JPA or hibernate and that will most
likely also not change in the near
future so you need to apply a little
trick if you want to use optional first
of all you need to annotate your ID
attribute with the idea notation so that
hibernate uses reflection and called
field access to set the values of your
entity attributes because when you do
that then hibernate doesn't care what
you do and how you implement your getter
and setter methods you can do whatever
you want so for the publisher I can go
here and change the return type of my
get publisher method from publisher to
optional publisher and I can create the
optional of nullable of my publisher
and if you take a look at the test case
you can see here that I loved the book
with ID 1 check that the publishers
present and do the same with book 2 and
check that it's not present and you can
see here that the book Java persistence
was hibernate which was pretty good book
was published by many publications and
that my hibernate tips book has no
publisher because I saved published it
so this little trick just annotate the
primary key attribute with ID and then
implement the getter method so that it
wraps the attribute value does the job
to provide or to use the optional in
your entity definition and to show
everyone who uses the entity that it
might be null
another good change in Java 8 was the
new date and time API is there anyone
who misses the old Java util date well
me neither
the new date and time API is much better
than the old one unfortunately jp8 2.1
was released before Java 8 so JPA to
have one didn't offer support for that
it was introduced with hibernate 5 has a
proprietary feature and is now part of
JP a 2.2 as well and we can now use
local date for example without any
additional annotation we don't even need
to annotate it with tempura why because
we finally have classes that represent a
specific type a date there's no
discussion about any time button if you
use a local date so hibernate has all
the information it needs by seeing ok
it's the local date and it knows exactly
how to map it to the database
and you can see here that hibernate now
because this the local data attribute
that I use in the code to an SQL
database
proprietary features in hibernate five
and your stays back on JPA 2.1 well you
don't have any support for the date and
time api but what you have attribute
converter an attribute converter
provides a quick and easy way to
transform an attribute type that you use
on your in your entity model to a type
that hibernate knows how to persist in
the database so in this this case I map
the local date class to a Java SQL date
why well you see that down here the main
reason why I use an SQL and not a you
today is that the SQL date has this nice
value of method that converts my local
date to its database representation and
also provides the inverse operation and
that the only thing that I need to do in
attribute convertor I just need to
implement these two methods and in the
best case it is as easy as it is as it
is here and I already have all the
things that I need what you also need to
do is you need to annotate the class
with converter and in this case you
should also set Auto apply to true that
hits hibernate to use this attribute
converter for all NT to edge root entity
attributes which are of type local date
which is most likely the thing that you
want to do here because local date is
not supported with oder hair hibernate
versions so
we do basically the same as we did
before just possess an author entity and
load it again afterwards then you can
see here that hibernate called the
method that converts the local data java
SQL date when it executes the insert
statement and after it got the record
from the database it caused the other
method to perform the inverse operation
and transform the SQL date that it just
got from the database to java time local
date okay for this one I need a few
slides
who have you used multi-tenancy yeah
coming more and more people who are
using multi-tenancy it's the the general
ideas that I implement an application
that can serve multiple completely
independent clients
it's a typical scenario that and I have
in in read applications where I want to
serve multiple of my customers and these
customers want to separate the data from
each other completely if you offer for
example a CRM system as a software as a
service they're your customers where
might be interested in the customer
information of their competitors but I'm
pretty sure that they don't want to
share their own data so there you need
to separate the information so that each
of your customers in this case called
tenants can work on their own data
without any without sharing any
information with other tenants there are
a few is three different concepts that
you can use to implement that hibernate
implements two of them at least right
now the first one is this year that's
probably the easiest and most obvious
approach each tenant gets its own
database so you have multiple tenants
that are using your application and your
application decides okay this is tenant
one so I go to tenant one database and
for ten and two I go to the other
database another approach that I can use
is the separate schema approach there I
used the same database but I have
separate schemas for each tenant and
within that schema have a bunch of
tables and the data is again completely
independent what hibernate doesn't
support right now is to share the same
database in the same schema with all
tenants and just add an discriminator
column to each table to identify to
which tenant each record belongs
that's right now not possible with
hibernate if you want to do that you
need to use eclipse link
the reason why hibernate doesn't support
that is because hibernate uses different
connections for our hand it's the mighty
tendency set up on the connection level
we need to do a few things for that
don't worry it's not too much that you
need to do you first of all need to
activate multi-tenancy and define which
approach you want to use in this case I
want to use the schema approach and then
you need to implement two interfaces you
need a tenant identifier his OVA that
one is responsible to identify which
tenant belongs to the current user and
should be used right now and then you
need a mighty tenant connection provider
which selects the connection that has to
be used with that specific tenant so
implemented these two interfaces here
let's take a look at this very
simplified example why did I simplify it
like that well identifying which tenant
is responsible or active right now is
something that is far outside of the
responsibility of your persistent
solution that's something that you do
most likely to me login so you might
extend your authentication and
authorization component to identify
which tenant is active right now and
store the tenant ID in a thread local
for example so here I just provide a
setter method so you can see it's not
part of the current tenant identifier
resolver interface that interface just
requires us to implement these two
methods and then we have the multi
tenant connection provider which
provides the collection this again is a
simplified example because in general if
you implement a multi tenant connection
then you have a huge stack that you're
used for application because you're
using a
complex are you building a complex
business application so you have
connector pools which provide you with
the connections to your database and you
would most likely use them here in the
multi tenant connection provider a
typical approach would be you configure
a pool for each tenant that you want to
serve with your application and then you
would select the specific connection
pool that you want to use for your
tenant here I kept it a little bit
simpler just to make sure that we just
need to use hibernate the approach is
always the same so here I have my
connection provider map which is a
simple map with the string and the
connection provider this string is the
ID of the current tenant and then I
create the connection I use hibernates
driver manager connection provider input
for this this one is good enough for
presentations or to learn about the
general concept of multi-tenancy here
but please don't use it in production
and the two important methods are these
down here hibernate requires you to
implement the get any connection
provider method which just need to
return any of the connection providers
that you have available
that's for administrative use and then
we have the select connection provider
that gets the tenant identifier as a
parameter so here we need to select the
specific connection that is valid for
that tenant that's currently working
with our system let's take a look at a
simple test case where we use that okay
you can't ignore this line that's just
because I fake the authentication and
tenant identification here and set it
hard on the current tenant identifier
resolver
what you would see in a real application
is basically this part so we open the
hibernate sessions started transaction
resistor book this one is for ten and
one so I called it book of ten and one
and we do the same for ten and two the
only difference here is this part the
persistence code isn't affected by this
change so you could easily add the
multi-tenancy feature to an application
that you developed without thinking
about mild eternity now if we now run
the test case we see not that much we
see how when it gets a value from the
sequence in that's a book and that's the
same yet again but if we take a look at
our database table then we see that in
here that in the book table in the
database schema 10 at 1 we have only
books of 10 and 1 and if we take a look
at the schema of 10 or 2 then the book
table then we see that we have just
books of 10 and 2
so without adapting our business code
just by adding these two interface
implementations and making sure that the
correct tenant identifier set on the
current session hibernate takes care of
multi-tenancy and decides ok this is 10
at 1 all operations go to this schema
and that one is 10 and 2 all operations
go to the other schema the tenants are
at least from a data point of view
completely separated from each other by
implementing two simple interfaces
it's their question okay another typical
business requirements nowadays is
auditing the goal here is to document
all changes that were performed on the
data so we can of course use database
triggers to document all of that or we
could use hibernate inverse which is a
hibernate project that integrates into
hibernate ORM with lifecycle listeners
and write additional information to the
audit tables there are few things that
we need to do for that first of all we
need to add this hibernate inverse
dependency to our project and then we
need to annotate all entities that we
want to audit with audited you can see
here there's nothing else that I did on
the entity but if we look at the test
case right first of all we can see here
that I again don't change anything I
just possessed a new book and then I
read the book and change the title
you can see here now that hibernate
performs quite a lot of operations so
let's start with the insert statement
yeah so I first created a book alright
it's no surprise hibernate gets the
primary key in that the record into the
book table but the following in that
statements are part of hibernate inverse
hibernate gets another sequence value
and creates an entry in the Eurovision
table this revision will be associated
with all changes that we performed
within this one transaction and then
hibernate writes a record into the book
audit table that's the default for all
audit tables so when we annotate an
entity with audited hibernate Maps
the entity to a database table with the
same name by default and at underscore
AUD - it - to the table name - and uses
that as the audit table in the database
so instead of performing one in that
statement we are now performing one into
the book table one into the univision
table and one into the audit table and
after that I started a second
transaction and updated this book entity
and you can see here that are now with
the book entity perform the update on
the book and then hibernate documents
the next operation in the audit table so
it writes automatically a revision entry
and a book record into the book audit
table and can take a look at that here
so we have the info table you see now
year that hibernate wrote two entries to
this table which were the first trance
of the first revision which created the
book entity and then the second revision
which updated it and we have here the
book audit table and here you can see
the entries for the different changes on
that table the ID of the record in the
book table and the ID of the elevation
in which it was in that it created or
inserted updated or deleted the combined
primary key and then the ref type type
identifies the kind of operation 0 for
insert 1 for update 2 for delete and
then you can see here the values that
the book record had in that specific
revision and you can then go to or if
you want to use that in your project you
can take a look at the hibernate invest
documentation you can easily adapt the
revision entity and add user information
for example that's a pretty common
requirement that we not only need to
document when did what happened but also
who did it which is not part of
hibernate standards division because
that's again related to user information
and that's outside of the persistence
logic but you can easily add your own
revision entity which adds these
information you are to get an API to
query data from your audit log either
vertically where you take a look at all
changes that were performed on a
specific record or horizontally where
you basically go back in time to a
specific timestamp and take a look at
your data what was valid then ok
and then we reached the end and I'm
happy to answer further questions who
has a question no that's that's totally
fine at least from a hibernate point of
view the mighty tendency approaches
apply different kinds of isolation I
mean if I have a separate database
server for each tenant then I can be
pretty sure that everything that I do
for 10:00 and 1:00 has no effect on
tenant - that's not necessarily the case
if I have two schemas that are hosted on
the same database server that can happen
that the resources that are used for
10:00 and 1:00 are not available for
10:00 and 2:00 and and impact the
performance there but that's a general
thing that happens if I host multiple
things on the same database server and
that's not directly connected connected
to this multi-tenancy approach another
question
the question is if the audit trail would
affect the performance and yes it
definitely affects the performance so if
you take a look here at the at the lock
then you see that you perform a lot more
data based operations than you would
normally do about twice as many it is
for all right operations another thing
you need to be aware of is that you
write the audit lock by monitoring the
lifecycle state changes of your entities
within hibernate which is easy and
comfortable but you miss everything
that's performed outside of of your
hibernate persistence layer and there
are the two main disadvantages of
hibernate in method is the the amount of
database operations and therefore slows
down your application but that would be
the same in at least most situations for
database triggers and you might miss a
few updates if you use other tools that
also work on the same database any other
question ok then thank you and have a
nice evening</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
