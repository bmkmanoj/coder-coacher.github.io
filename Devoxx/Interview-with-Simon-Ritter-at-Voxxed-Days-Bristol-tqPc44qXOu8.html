gave the keynote this morning about
agile as a perfect for java yes as a
process for the standardization of Java
and therefore the development of job
yeah so the keynote was about a
situation process so we get more access
to features quicker us than big releases
is that in any way motivated by the Java
9 general availability real estate I'm
not really no I mean this has been an
ongoing process if you look at the way
things are changing this and really
started in jdk 8 because that was the
introduction of what are called the jdk
and haunts and proposals and the process
around back so the idea of that is to
allow people to define smaller complete
pieces of work which is a set of
functionality and then that can either
be included as it is at the moment in a
major release or theoretically in the
future if the JCP and oracle and java
engineering organization wanted to
switch to a more agile way of developing
the Java platform then they could
actually say I get at stake jets and
when the check is completed we'll make
that available as like a point release
between major releases what do you think
is preventing that from happening at the
moment um I guess there's a few things
certainly one is the relationship
between jets which are for the OpenJDK
project and the JCP because clearly for
the standardization of the Java platform
if we talk about java SE that is
standardized through the JCP so there is
a JSR for each major release of java SE
there's 379 which is java SE 9 partner
in the number 23 37 maybe for JDK 8 and
that defines all of the parts which make
up the core platform that's the core
libraries
the language specification and the
virtual machine specification and there
is a subset if you like of the JDK
because JD Kane is a number of other
things around that you've obviously got
the compiler people other tools but also
when we deal with the JDK what we're
dealing with is Newton fermentation of
the standard if you look at something
like the JVM standard it says there must
be a garbage collector so yes we know
there's a garbage collector in there but
it doesn't say how that garbage
collector must work if you look at
OpenJDK you've got several different
garbage collectors included in the
virtual machine so there's the
concurrent mark sweep there's the
parallel collector and the more recent
g1 collector one of the Jets is in jdk
nine is to make g1 default collector so
that's something which is part of the
JDK but not part of the Java
specification so when it comes to moving
from using or moving to using jets as a
way of defining everything there needs
to be a relationship with the jsr s and
the JCP works out so that everything
fits together because also there's the
issue around testing Jex is great they
define pieces of work but then we need
to be able to verify that somebody who
implements one of those if it's not
through the OpenJDK is conforming to
whatever that specification is so like I
say there needs to be a closer
relationship between Jets and the JCP
and having formal standardization and
test suites available to do that do you
think we're moving towards that I think
we are I think it's probably going to
take a while because being on the JCP
execs committee I know this is something
that has been discussed a number of
times at different meetings and
certainly if you talk to some of the
Oracle engineering people they are keen
to move to a more let me say a job at
faster release cycle which may not fit
in directly with the way that the JCP
works at the moment but I think that
they're there needs to be this synergy
worked out so that everything does fit
together people then still have the
the confidence that when they're using
Java and it's something that's coming
from somebody other than OpenJDK but it
does conform to whatever standard is is
defined and so now going back to the
Java standard I'm Java sense into
mutations you also give a talk about 65
new features of Java 9 apart from the
module system what are you looking
forward to ah right so that there is one
particular feature in jdk 9 which i am
so so happy about it is not a sickly big
feature doesn't affect the language
doesn't affect the libraries directly
doesn't affect the virtual machine but
it is a feature that I find so so useful
finally after 22 years we have
searchable javadocs oh yeah I think yeah
okay that's funny actually because I was
looking at that jet myself a while back
i think this so of you yes yes yes
search has been around for a while now
nothing terribly knew about it so you
think yourself what is it taking 22
years to figure out that we could put a
search box on the javadocs but there you
go guess I finest art be more fun to
develop sphere the other features yeah
yeah but like I said I find it's so
useful because you know that there's
4,000 plus classes in the standard JDK
classes and trying to find something
even if it's just like you know that you
want to look at string and there's a
particular method you want to look up
the signature or whatever and you've got
to scroll all the way down to the s's
define the string or you've got to think
okay I need to click on the java.lang
package at the top but it's still not an
easy thing to do whereas if you just
talking string and then it goes there it
is rather than happy to know everything
is yes I've definitely been stunned by
that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
