make sure all right welcome you guys to
a I for all des hopefully I will prove
that to be the case what we're going to
talk about today our agenda is kind of
packed so I'm going to try not to go
fast if I start to speed up just tell me
to slow it down
I would rather miss not doing something
then to make sure you don't understand
all right so our agenda is as follows
I'm going to introduce myself and then
we're going to talk about the
differences of AI machine learning and
deep learning and this is going to be
really important as we get into AI for
all Devas I find it when I talk to a lot
of people about AI these three times
have gotten mushed together and they're
really not clear so I want to make sure
they're clear before we go forward then
I'm going to introduce Amazon AI so it's
more than just the services I'm going to
cover here and then we're going to dive
into some of the technologies that you
guys can get started with today and put
in your applications and then at the end
we'll talk will chat or you'll throw
tomatoes at me one of the two and then
we will hopefully it'll be a good
session
all right so Who am I really quickly I
am Tara Walker I am a software engineer
that talks to people that's where the
Evangelist comes from so I always tell
people especially when I'm in the United
States I can't save your soul if you
thought that's what his Benj was meant
it's about technology but I had worked
for Amazon Web Services I've been at
Amazon about three years and prior to
that I was at Microsoft for 12 years and
then I did the gamut of the Bell the ma
bells and the time warner's so that's me
let's get into it so when we talk about
AI what are the differences of that
let's explain AI versus machine learning
force deep learning
first of all AI is what you probably
think it is human-like decision makings
or intelligence displayed by machines
now typically when you hear people talk
about AI today they're talking about
machine based learning but really there
are two types of AI one is denote it is
like a general AI and the other is
denoted
of a narrow AI so the narrow AI is what
you think about when you think about CP
Threepio and Star Wars or the Terminator
everyone's like oh no Skynet is coming
to get us
that's really narrow AI and we haven't
gotten there yet
in fact AI is really not a new concept
the Turing test actually said that a
machine can really if they can fool
someone to think that it's a person then
we've actually accomplished narrow AI
now it took us 60 years to do that but
we've only had one computer that
actually fooled a bunch of judges that
happened in June of 2014 and based upon
the Turing test for a narrow AI the over
30% of the judges would have to believe
that they were talking to a real human
being and so this was a chatbot that
actually did that and that was call
Eugene it fooled 33% of the judges that
it actually was talking to a 13 year old
kid but again we're not there yet
so typically when you think about AI
think about general AI this is what
we're going to talk about a day and
these are machines that have human
characteristics or shows some type of
predictive analysis or intelligence as
if we would make those decisions we
haven't quite done to the narrow AI so
two types so then what is machine
learning machine learning is a way to
achieve artificial intelligence so it's
really just a practice it's a theory use
algorithms you parse large amounts of
data you learn from that data and then
you can make predictive apps or
solutions with it that's machine
learning and there are three types of
machine learning one is supervised the
one is unsupervised and one is swimming
supervised now if I was running a narrow
AI then I would be doing an unsupervised
AI that means the machine is actually
working it's thinking for itself again
that supervised unsupervised a AI but
machine learning and these concepts of
machine learning is what enables
artificial intelligence so I don't
believe we're reading the slides you
guys can see that but again there are
three types and right now what you'll
find is a mixture of what we call
semi-supervised so you guys were you
taking advantage of all these different
data models and other things that are
out there and then we're actually either
running a program to simulate some type
of predictive intelligence or we're
right we built a program that has some
level of I can make these decisions so
here's the third one deep learning like
I said they're all mushed so if a eye is
machined exhibiting human-like
intelligence and there's two types and
then machine learning has three types of
machine learning and it's predictive
algorithm and analysis what is deep
learning deep learning is a method for a
implementation of machine learning see
how this kind of goes down so it's
really algorithmic technique and what
it's based upon is actually the way our
brains work so our brains work on what
you call them neural networks that's
actually where that term comes from and
the reason why this technique has become
really really like hot right now is
because out of all the machine learning
techniques and algorithms this one
produces the results the quickest and
obviously think about if we're trying to
get to that narrow AI some people don't
want to get there but if we're trying to
get to narrow AI you need to have these
results happen quickly so a neural
network again the way the brain works is
any snap fires to the closest one it
sends signals in those many synapses
that are firing at one time just like in
a neural network of artificial one there
are many layers so one layer takes the
impolitic processes into the other layer
and so on and so forth and then again
then you get a final result so neural
networks would exhibit any more want to
guess what type of AI to really be a
neural network we talked about three
machine learning types what type of
machine learning would a neural network
exhibit you want to against unsupervised
right in fact it would not really be a
neural network if it was supervised the
whole point of neural networks and using
machine learning and producing more
quickly is that the iterations actually
learn from each other again unsupervised
so that was great we went through all of
that that's wonderful
internally as we keep going through all
these turns
AWS okay can we actually help people who
are not data scientists put intelligence
at every application every solution they
want to do and this is where kind of the
concept of Amazon a I came up so what
does that look like that's a chart right
so if you think about it take all this
stuff that you see on the strings you
probably can barely read it but there
are three main parts of AI and this is
existed we're talking about Amazon today
but this is pretty common across most of
the cloud providers you're going to have
a manage AI service which means any
developer without any knowledge of a I
can immediately jump right in and then
start to develop and use intelligence
using AI services then you have AI
platforms these are for people that hey
I'm a little bit more savvy in this
machine learning space I want to train
my own models to enable AI with machine
learning so you had that machine
learning platforms and then you have the
frameworks this is where you are really
phenomenal when it comes to AI you know
how to pull your data you know how to
build a neural network well again still
these frameworks still make it easier
for you to do that so again three levels
of course there's an infrastructure that
runs the AI and you see that there at
the bottom but if you think about what's
common across most cloud providers and
most AI providers there are the services
there's the platforms and the frameworks
so what how does this fit in what you
need pretty much it's your needs your
choice if you want to use AI enabled
manage API services then you would take
the top layer so that poly recognition
and let's some of the things we're going
to talk about the day and immediately
put natural user interfaces into your
application if you really want to build
your own type of deep learning model
that maybe either doesn't exist today or
possibly it does the one thing that
enables deep learning today is the fact
that we've been collecting all this
massive amounts of data and now we
finally
opportunity to do something with it to
train models well maybe you have access
to these huge amounts of data sets you
might want to take a deep learning
framework and do that yourself so from
Amazon perspective we support all of the
frameworks and that's net since their
flow all the ones you've probably have
heard of and played it with or you can
again take advantage of the work we've
done the neural networks and then use
the manage services so before I get into
those manage services because that's
where we hear a guy for all des let's
talk about what you have if you're one
of those people that are raring to go
and want to run a framework we have what
we call a deep learning AMI that's just
simply a container is a BM you go you
pick it you run it on ec2 it has every
neural network or every machine learning
framework that exists today pretty much
I literally listed them out here it's
already pre-installed with them we have
it's a really pretty robust machine all
of the drivers that you need to already
installed we actually support this ami
so you literally can get up and running
with one click to start your own deep
learning framework in addition to that
ami we have a template that will set up
all the resources instances workers your
own BPC auto-scaling groups master
instance and then two slaves two workers
sorry instances there so again if you
really want to get into a deep learning
framework and you like oh yeah I want to
do the hard stuff
which is great we actually try to make
it easier for you get there so again as
a part of it which we won't dive into
the day but I would be remiss if I
didn't talk about it now I told you that
we have all of these different
frameworks there is one that we've kind
of narrowed in on and all of the other
services that I'm going to talk about
the day and show you code with today are
actually built upon the premise of this
framework that's the Apache MS net
framework so why did we decide to settle
on this one well first of all it's the
most open so we're really if you weren't
aware really the
about using things that are open that
other people can not only help us to
build different things on but it can be
expanded with the wealth and number of
developers out there so that was the
first reason the second reason is it's
really portable so you can make models
whether it be for mobile or IOT and all
of the managed services that you see
that I'm going to talk about are based
upon us leveraging imagenet ourselves
now if you want to get started with ms
net we literally have labs workbooks
already out there Jupiter notebooks
already configure for you to get you up
and running really quickly so in
combination with that and am - in the
cloud formation simply you're really
into investment you have opportunity to
get in there so that's kind of wanted to
make sure I did the background and
everything else but again ms net is
available for you as well
that is a deep learning framework and I
just want to see if you guys actually
paid attention to me so if that is a
deep learning framework ms net it is
using what anyone anyone no one's saying
it to me it's using a neural network
which means it is leveraging the larger
one so it's an unsupervised machine
learning using neural network so that's
a deep learning engine in this net so
the services that we're talking about
that provide services for all Deb's AI
for all dead the ones I'm going to focus
on today we talked about MS net there's
no way I can set up an investment
instance in the 39 minutes I have left
I'm going to try to get to the other
ones in that time but the ones we're
going to focus on today are Polly's
recognition or Lex has anyone heard of
any of these before I go on three people
Wow I'm not we're not doing a great job
of talking about every time all right so
well more people will learn about them
today so really quickly Polly is
lifelike text to speech recognition is
image analysis and Lexus conversational
in in did you have questions yes
second yes so Polly does both we're
going to go through that I'll show you
and Lex says as well
all right so got it great we talked
about AI we did all the background let's
dig into the services in the code the
first service I'm going to talk about is
recognition so recognition is for image
recognition service it is managed so you
all you have to do is access an API and
you're off to the races and actually
using the neural network that we create
it and the models we create it to detect
different images this does not just
relate to faces so this is object and
scene detection this is a spatial
analysis comparison facial recognition
again these are things that Amazon
recognition will do for you and it runs
in the cloud of semantic service as I
noted so what you have to do is simply
leverage an API or SDK and upload an
image and you're off to the races
so again four things that amazon
recognition does so if I wanted to for
instance detect an object I literally
say hey I want to detect the labels of
the different objects in here so you see
this is a picture of a city and if I ran
this code it gets this image what it
would give me back is labels and the
confidence of what that actually
happened so you'll see that I said I
want a minimum confidence of 50 and so
and I just printed it out and Jason
we're going to actually see this in the
demo but with 91% confidence in that
image it knows that it could label a
city and then with another 91% instance
they could say okay this like it was a
much much progress and then it's the
building it's the high-rise has adopt
blah blah blah and these are the actual
confidence that it feels as though based
upon the model these actually are in
there so let's actually get into a demo
I've been talking for a while so let's
look at some code so what we're going to
do today I didn't want to do a demo that
everyone keeps doing here but takes a
picture and they
you crop something over it so I want to
do with something a little bit more
risque hopefully my screen is going to
come back in a second I wanted to do
something a little bit more risque so
I'm going to run this first and then
I'll go through the code with you so
what this solution is going to do
actually fix the motion detection out of
it because it's a little interesting
having motion detection and it's just me
standing up here is better when other
people around but what I have here
because I took the motion detection out
is it's going to use my webcam I'm going
to flip a button it's going to take a
picture of me and it's going to
determine whether or not I'm happy or
sad how old I am
blah blah blah things of that nature now
typically when I wrote this initially it
was promotion so the minute someone
walked past it would immediately capture
you and determine whether you were male
or female you were happy or sad etc etc
kind of hard to do spending up here
alone so I have created a huge ugly
button that you'll see in a minute so
we'll run this first and then we will
I'll show you the code so I don't know
what I did change that while I still in
that but we'll see all right so this is
me I'm going to here's my big ugly
button it capture a picture that's a
weird interesting button picture so it
says I'm happy I don't know that's it
but it's only 20 varmints and I'm happy
so that's pretty accurate
he thinks on the mail I have on a hat so
okay I don't know how that's going I'm
not smiling I'm between 26 and 43 years
old I don't have a moustache that's
pretty good I guess I don't have a beard
and I'm wearing glasses let's play one
more in peace I could look a little bit
more like a female with my hat at least
have a better confidence that I'm happy
so you know okay all right so let's talk
about what's happening here and then
I'll show you the code so what I have
here is just simply away
Upham like I said I change the code a
little bit usually detects motion so you
see this webcam it's always on so
typically what happens that button is
usually not there someone walks past it
captures pictures every second and then
it just spits out who you are here is
kind of odd to do here so I have a
button there but let's look at I only
put back a subset of things that come
back let me show you actually what
happens in the code so I'm going to
close this down and I'm going to
actually go to the code and explain to
you first thing um let me close some of
this and get some more real estate so
you can see I'm just going to show you
the pertinent stuff so what i'm doing
here is after I do all the credential
stuff and all the other try-catch we
have an API I'm using the Java SDK I'm
using the Eclipse toolkit here we have
an amazon recognition client right so I
live in the east and US so I didn't
change it I probably should have but I
didn't so I am saying I want to be in
this region I'm passing my credentials
that are there and then I'm having it to
build this so then it does a compile now
you have different requests if you saw
the image that the code on the screen
ahead that was for objects so I want to
detect labels here I wanted to set to
text faces so this is a different API
there's several of them I just shown you
too so what I want to do to detect faces
and this you can actually do a face
collection here but obviously I'm just
doing one so that code is taken out but
what I'm doing here is I'm detecting the
face and I'm actually taking the image
as it gets clicked in real time and I'm
converting that into a byte buffer and
then I say I want all of the attributes
to come back that it detects on my face
after does that now multiple people can
be obviously in the picture and you'll
see that code is still there I'm just
not really showing it to you on the
screen I'm actually taking this is some
of the stuff I added I'm just taking the
first face because it's just going to be
me up here and then I am running a
little function I had to update face
info to get the UI to update that's
boring what's really more important
is when the face details comes back so
there can be multiple faces Here I am
actually saying I want every attribute
that it can ever come back with so like
for instance infected face range you
know different set of attributes so I
want to show you what's all coming back
because I literally wrote this out of
the stack trace because I knew I was
going to be here so you can see how much
stuff comes back I'm promise you I'm not
going to scroll that fast so when I
click the button before it's detected to
face 26 to 43 the bounding box is the
demo you typically see people do so they
take that bounding box and that's wings
you can put another image on top that's
where that bounding box is coming back
the age range only happens if you say
you want all attributes it determines
whether I'm smiling if I have I glasses
on sunglasses gender beard mustache if
my eyes are open if my mouth is closed
and if you'll see with all of these it
gives me a confidence level on whether
or not it believes this is the case so
if my mouth is open what kind of
emotions I have you notice it wasn't
sure about my emotions the higher if it
got was 29 and you'll notice I'm only
spending about one emotion but that's
not what the service does it actually
captures every emotion it perceives you
to be so here you see I just on the
screen just came back happy but you see
it detected three things it wasn't sure
whether I was happy calm and angry but
you notice the lower the percentage the
less likely it is this case and then it
gives you landmark of your faith so
where your left eye is when your right
eye is where your nose your mouth left
people etc etc your brow up brow left
for right things that nature so I could
keep going down it pretty much gives you
a lot of information it comes back more
than what I obviously showed you because
all of that couldn't fit on the screen
and then finally it gives you what we
call a pose and equality and I'm going
to make a point of saying something here
about the quality with the network so
you saw how I was wasn't sure when I was
Melanie I don't know I should feel about
that but your brightness or your
sharpness when you're taking a picture
you'll fine
iein so just something to know as you
use the service the clearer the picture
is that you know the appropriate light
the more accurate it will be that makes
sense right so you'll find that in
low-light conditions or odd conditions
you may not get as much effort see so
that's nothing we did wrong or promise
you is just simply it's trying to detect
what it can and then it's actually
picking up those shallow shadows I
wanted to say that because last time I
did this talk song was like just doesn't
work at all blah blah blah but it's
because of the shadows
alright so let's go back to the slide
it's a lot more code there but since my
time is waning I want to keep going
alright so as the screen comes back we
talked about recognition so that's image
recognition facial recognition etc that
models are for that what we also have is
Amazon poly and this is life life like
text-to-speech so the point of poly is
that it's accurate text processing its
intelligible and easy to understand and
it's supposed to add semantic meaning to
your text so if I have a customized
pronunciation for something you can
actually put that into the text and then
have it real-time say it as you want to
say it the trick about this also which
is really great is it has 47 different
voices across 24 languages so it's not
just one language here you can actually
have the text spit back out for you in
the dialect that you wish so let's talk
about poly for a minute
today if I put in text it says today it
is sad on Washington what for no we're
close to there but ok and I run that
through Pali it should come out and say
I don't hear it yeah I didn't I don't
hear my I don't hear anything going on
today in Seattle Washington it's 11
degrees Fahrenheit all right so that's
what you expected it to say right well
what about here's where semantics comes
in so all I did here was and this is
literally what I did
I'll show you in a minute when I go to
Polly I literally typed in something and
then I put it in Polly and it takes that
text and it spits it out in audio this
can happen either via API CLI or a
console simple right
what about Richards number now this is a
computer so how does it know that you
know if I send this through Polly right
Richards number what do you think
Richards number is going to come out as
Richards number is two billion one
hundred twenty two million three hundred
forty one thousand two hundred
thirty-seven right that's not which is
nothing but this is a great thing about
Polly is I can say that Rich's numbers
isn't two billion blah blah blah blah
it's actually a telephone so we can add
some magic meaning to the text and then
therefore then probably can actually
speak it as it's supposed to go right so
instead of being two million Butler's
razaw if I add some magic meaning and
you see here I have the semantic meaning
that says this is actually a telephone
number
Richard's number is two one two two
three four one two three seven right so
that makes more sense so you can with
Polly
you just don't spit out just oh this is
text-to-speech you actually can put
semantics into your text to say I want
it to say this is a telephone number
I want this pronounciation to be this I
also want to make sure that you know I'd
speak in this dialect so the way this
works is if something called speech
marks and xs/s m/l so let's talk about
it really quickly speech marks let's say
you wanted to build an audio book and
there's a great lab out there for this
if your guys are interested in it if
you're building an audio book right
there are certain things on the page
where you need to pause there are
certain things you need to not only
pause you need to say things louder or
softer you may want to raise your voice
you need to know when the sentence
actually ends because there's a pause
there or a comma
so speech marks actually gives you that
type of information that's the metadata
that if I go into Tolly and we'll do
that in a minute I can say hey I want
you to describe when a sentence in and
when it starts so what happens with Pali
at that point instead of just giving you
back a audio stream a stream sorry it
gives you back metadata about the actual
text that came in and then the stream
matches to it the thing that gets it to
top saw for happier sadder
whispering listen new one we have out
whispering marks that I talked about in
the a SS blog is SS ml and this is a
standard and it's just assist you with
speech synthesis so that put the link
there people are really geeking out and
want to talk about or whatever
there are some limitations you have to
of course read about it we don't support
all of the tags we support most of them
but there's a few like for instance if I
wanted to use a peroxy tag I don't
support values that are lower than 80%
so if you think about decibel values and
how quality values if I can't do 80% and
I may not be able to get the speech
marks correctly so again a few
limitations not a minute but a SSSs ml
example is what I have here and so what
I'm actually going to do is take this
text off my PowerPoint because this is
actually a real thing and have it show
what it would say so all right so I'm
going to copy this I'm not going to do
it first but just to show you that this
this is actually real is it close it
down okay note it bigger
all right so let me slow this up all
right so this is poly first of all we
talked about you can have the plain text
speech here right so I can just say you
know high hanging out at I wonder how
it's going to say this without speech
marks that would be interesting this
all right so you know high hanging out
at the box UK so I can find hanging out
of the box UK ah okay data pretty well
oh all right okay so obviously if I just
put in a different speech it will just
come out right and then you can there's
a bunch more voices here hanging out at
devoxx UK and you know Joey whatever I'm
hanging out at devoxx UK alright okay so
here I can actually customize
pronunciation and how that happens is
you can upload a lexicon there but we
were talking about if I'm just in a
console right now we were talking about
SML right so you see right now it says
hi my name is Joey I'll read to you any
text you type here right so I'm just
going to write hi my name is Joey I will
read any text you type here right okay
so if I put what I said I was going to
do take the actual thing from my slide
I'll explain this in a second there we
go
all right so the first tag that you will
see is called speak you can do this in
code you can do this in the CLI like I
said you the best thing I always do
before I try to write code against this
is test it here make sure I'm not doing
something really bad so I'm sort of
making someone say something really bad
so the first time you'll see here in SML
if you one speak is actually the speech
tab that's actually a standard there
then this next tab is the next tag sorry
is what actually says I want you to
speak slowly I want you to speak quickly
etc etc I should actually brought up the
list of tags there but so if I change
this now I have 'invalid so let's see
where's my tag that is gone this is
always the trick right finding the
broken tag let's see that's closed that
clothes
thank you let's try that I know
something silly let's see still doesn't
like it ah let's see what do I have
that's wrong here
let me try my double back this is the
problem when I switched between Mac and
Windows I never know what to expect with
the quotes I should probably just stick
with my machine alright still does not
like it alright I know I have 20 minutes
left but I so want to fix it okay I will
uh I will try not to be anal retentive
in that because I really want to fix
this now aha yes that is yeah good catch
see the spelling of my last name is wal
keer that's really slow so you can do
different things with the tags here
thank you who needs a good catch
alright so believe it or not any time
someone catches on a stick and I can
catch it I have $100 AWS credits for you
AHA see now you guys want to be engaged
right now I ha fair too late all right
so you can change this and say fast or
slow and things of that nature and the
trick is with the filling of my last
name is wal kr say so it can get fast or
whatever so again this is poly and if I
really wanted to change the format I
just really quickly and do speech marks
I can actually go here and again all of
this is in code so instead of
immediately doing the speech I can say I
want speech smarts because I wanted to
audiobook and I want to do a household
sentence I want to have a sentence I
would you know I want you to give me
marks for words so let's say you're
doing the bouncy ball thing whatever
so this is where speech marks come
to play so if I change the vowel format
here you see two things happen I still
can listen to my speech and get my my
audio stream but you'll notice it now
says download speech marks so that when
I run these things through Pali the
verbage that is going to come back is
not just playing text and not just the
SML it actually is going to have special
tags it says this is limit sentence and
this is when the Senate stops I won't
download that because I realized I have
18 minutes so I got to go a little bit
faster okay so I'm going to get selects
all right back to the slides come on you
can do it great alright so everyone
should crossing my fingers know what
this services so if you are not familiar
with Alexis oh I heard that one of my
compadres was downstairs doing Alexa
workshop skills okay so Alexa obviously
you talked to the echo you say hey Alexa
I want you to order me you know a book a
hotel or hey don't let me forget to run
around the block three times or whatever
you guys tell Alexis to do the the
technology that enables Alexa right to
have that natural speech interface is
Amazon Lex so the technology that allows
you to speak to Alexa and you have that
KO word is now available to you to put
into your applications what this does
here is you can obviously improve human
interactions and I have all of the great
things that you know you can do with it
Oh before I forget do we have a
challenge elects chat bot challenge
going on with some pretty hefty prizes
if you guys want to play with slack and
write a chat box so if you're interested
just go to the AWS blog I wrote about it
and share some code which you guys can
do about it okay and after that prizes
stuff like that
but if you want to play with Lex that's
a great way to get started so what is
Lex about so how many of you have built
anything with Alexis keel
he was downstairs come on guys herobrine
no one what's the one guy you know just
cuz you raise your hand
I got another $100 give credit for you
see you got you guys went out okay I'll
run out by the time you guys decide to
engage it's okay alright so let's talk
about how this technology is enabled for
Alexa and what you can do here so if
you've written anything with Alexis
skill some of this will seem very very
familiar the first thing you do is you
create an intent just what it sounds
like not the Android intents but intent
that says this is the actual I want to
have happen when the user talks to me
now let me say this about Lex you do not
have to say Alexa with Lex you guys are
programming this not us so there is no
code word unless you determine you want
to code work and I'm we're going to
build a bot really quickly really
quickly so you'll see but anyway the
intent is the first thing so for
instance this example is I want to book
a hotel then you got to put everything
into utterances that you want the person
to say that Alexa will respond to so I
would like to book hotel booked that
hotel for me now can you book hotel for
me please etc etc etc now once you have
the utterance to them that you want them
to respond to then you need to put in
the slots of what the possible answers
are now all of these don't have to be
required you see this in a minute but
some of them obviously have to be
required so if I need to book a hotel
obviously city is probably a good thing
to know where you want me to book hotel
is so that I may require that the type
of room you may or may not want that to
be required that's fine but again that's
what slots are for the responses that
you're going to give back based upon
what they're saying and there are things
in those slots responses that you can
say are required and there are other
things that can be optional and then
after you go through all of this and you
can tie this to lambda so I can then
have this to go out let's say I make a
bot that says find me a hotel in the UK
a-and it says in what area and it says
okay near devops UK and then you know it
might ask a few questions then I can
have lambda then go out run an API get
data back from that and then respond you
know with some type of intelligence very
similar to what you see if you're
building an Alexa bot the only
difference is I can now do this for
anything whether it be web mobile etc
alright so let's get into building
really really quickly a quick chat box
so I knew this was going to happen that
my time was going to be waning so I
actually started one my goal was for us
to build one together but I don't I knew
where I wasn't at that time I just knew
it all right so we're going to do we're
going to go through this one and we're
going to try to build one really quickly
but let me just show you how this works
all right so the first thing you'll see
in the editor oh let me just run this
first so I there's two ways to I don't
know if I even went through this on the
slide I went so fast there's two ways to
interface with legs
I can either text so text to speech or
just like poly and it uses some of that
technology or I can speak what I want so
typically Alexa just lets you speak this
allows you with legs to have that's why
you can do things like with slack or
facebook Messenger and cetera it takes
both so if I let's see if this actually
works well let me explain it first I
have some several utterances I have a
bunch of them I want to order piece of
please I want to order a pizza I want to
order piece of typing you'll see these
blue and different colors I'll explain
what that means in a minute can I get a
piece of please order a pizza for me
whatever and then here are the slots and
I'll explain how you create your slots
in a minute but anytime I put in a slot
how they may respond so someone may say
I want to order a veggie pizza right so
that's one of the requirements I need to
order a pizza for you anyway
so I'm going to take that if they say
that and automatically put it in a slot
so here is a different one and then I
could put a confirmation prompt to say
thanks
you I you you know ordered your pizza
and stuff like that
let's do the example first and then
we'll try to in the little bit of time
we have left to quickly build one so I
want to do this for Oakes I should
probably stop talking if I'm going to do
audio input if not sorry can you please
repeat that yeah I know you're going to
say that because none of those other
mixes alright alright so I'm going to
click the button and actually see what
I'm supposed to say so what I have to
say if I want a correct response one of
these if I don't say the correct thing
this is where and again this is what you
guys do here is where the error handling
comes in and you see I have sorry you
you know could you please repeat that I
can say what the heck are you talking
about if I want to put that there you
probably shouldn't do that but you know
you could do that and it's going to
allow me to try five times and then
finally it's going to say hey I can't
understand you goodbye but you can
change that to be whatever so I said
something wrong it says sorry you can
and you repeat that this is in the
console but obviously my goal was to
startup Android and see it in the mobile
but that is not going to happen so let's
just go with the console all right so if
I actually now say when we supposed to
say I'll say I want to order a pizza
let's do the whole thing I want to order
a pizza
so you see who you want to cheese
pepperoni veggie or all meat pieces so
it asks me two options
so now I have to respond now there's two
ways that you can respond again I'm
talking to it because again talking
everybody's least Alexa I can also type
what I want to say here as well I don't
have to talk I don't have to just hit
the button and talk to it I can take
that voice off and say cheese and then
it'll come back if you notice this time
it didn't talk to me because again I am
typing it's now thinking we have a we
have a conversation that it maybe was
over text because this actually works
over text as well you can create Lex
where you can text it to say something
I mentioned that yeah so you can't
Exodus that you can text it to do
something and it will and it can either
respond to you either via text or voice
or life so you saw it typed I wanted
cheese and it says what size pizza do a
want so if I go back and do it with
voice large it will take audio a type of
crust thick or thin so again these are
questions that are going on here so
there's two things to note when you're
developing against this because I'm not
going to have an opportunity in the
nine-minute I have left to show I'll
post micro to show you the code of what
this will look like in code and doing
this on an actual device but two things
you should know there's two types of
input that comes in I've talked about it
but this is where it becomes important
when you're going actually to doing
speech it's going to processing is what
we call a post context right that's
whether using SDK or API are over HTTP
or whatever if you're using voice it's
going to use what we call a post context
and that's important because the slot
that it uses are a little bit just very
slightly different that if I'm using a
post text context you'll see all this if
you go through the documentation and
things of that nature but just know if
you are developing something it is best
to prepare for however they want to talk
to you we'll take it but make sure if
you're writing it in code you have to do
your due diligence as well obviously
we're doing this here in the console
because we've already built this but in
code I always make sure that I'm able to
take either one so okay I want what type
sticker thin it's not going to like that
because I've just been running my mouth
and it's going to go I have no clue what
you just said so oh I said thinking okay
so my response is kind of hopefully
because that was just rushing but it's
ready for fulfillment it says okay do
you want the type of she is a piece of
large across the span all right that is
a but and I will start doing one really
quickly but we're not going to have time
I'm going to do I'm going to start one
in three minutes I know I have to do the
five minutes for for talking and I
haven't even finished my slides
but I will do it quickly so if I was
create you have some sample ones someone
goes through that this boring so if I
wanted to say if I wanted to create a
but about we could create literally a
bot about DevOps right if I wanted to
say what's the next session right so
DevOps UK I choose my Oh what did I
thank you I'm typing too fast I can
choose my output hello my name is
Kimberly it tells you what sounds like
Kimberly has a little husky voice there
it was fine and then we do the warning
hey if your writing is for a child you
need to make sure you're doing the right
thing so I'm not just doing it for you
guys
wow that's three minutes like that okay
so just really quickly I'm going to
create an intent let's say my intent is
so you can do one that's already there
but I want to do a new one let's say my
intent is a conference schedule right
and if I hit add and then I will do the
sample utterances that I want to know so
I could say well yeah what's the next
session right and I could add that
here's the trick what if it will it can
detect the time because I can actually
put a time in there there's two things I
can make custom slots so I can take
slots that are already there
similar to slots that are from let me
make this a little smaller and I am
really time is really flying so you'll
see here that I can use slots that
already exist or I can make my own so
the piece of type four ones I did my own
these sizes when I did my own but
there's a bunch of them so region city
actor airplane bubble blah the date so
let's say I required a date so if I said
or rather a time probably would be a
better one
so I can require a time so I could say
you know what's the next section session
and be like okay well what time are you
interested in bub lie now I'm at six
minutes but I you know you can actually
build a bot that does that
and I really wish I had time to do that
so if we wanted to build a bot for
instance I could say Amazon time and the
slot for the time was like session time
and now my thing is turned red and said
I've only have five minutes ago so I
will not finish the spot unfortunately
but come see me if you actually want to
so that might actually be a cool thing
to do
let me finish up with I should hopefully
be at the end yes okay good I didn't
time it as poorly as I thought I did
well I did because I didn't finish my
bot but okay I'll pretend like I had
head to the right time right so here is
a summary of all of this you can
absolutely start your deep learning
today right I did nothing I configured
no models I didn't go into machine
learning even though I do do things in
MS net and I think it's really fun but
if you're just getting started today you
can automatically put things like
natural user interfaces in your in your
application or facial recognition and
typically you would have to have created
a model to do that before all of these
are available to you without you ever
doing a model or creating a neural
network now I hope you guys will get
into it and create more neural networks
but again you have the ability today to
do that I wanted to make sure I ended on
how do you get started with this in code
it's only got to show you just the Java
code for recognition and the second part
of that is us adding a button and put
poly in that word to talk back to you
not a lot of time there but there are
samples out there that you guys can take
immediately and they're in all languages
so whatever language is your favorite
you can use for this but these are just
a few there's a ton more but again I
wanted to make sure that you guys had a
opportunity to start just in case I
didn't finish all the code which I did
and then with that four minutes QA I
almost did the five minutes right
because you didn't have a sesame yes
mmm-hmm I'll go back to it later oh
absolutely
so the okay so I'll just add you know a
session so session time so I'll say you
know what time so we'll just go ahead
and finish that add that right so now
I'll have that slot and I said it
require but what if I said you know I
want up topics right so conference
topics right right that's what I wanted
what I would do then is instead of here
I would go and actually free the slot
type so I can say I want you know
conference topics and love about the you
know description and I could give some
sample responses there now here's where
the great thing where the code comes in
I can give sample responses there but I
can totally expand that by Thai when
they respond to a lambda function so
asynchronously and service Li it will go
out and say okay here's all the topics
so say you have all your topics in Bay
base and it could fill that slot with
more than what I have here
actually it's not that's the great thing
about it this is just really a
placeholder so it knows so for instance
let's say I only do two topics here
right let's say I just do you know a
server list may I right I'm going to
save that slot type and so now when I'm
taking a conference topic in here I can
now put conference topics as one of them
here's the great thing about that I can
then take whatever you say coming in
once I get that slot and I'll show I'll
actually show you the lambda function
and the two minutes I have left of the
of the but we were going to build I can
take that slot because now I have a slot
type created I can say okay I got this
information in what are the accurate
validation for the slot type for what
other slot types do I want because this
is my own slot type so that way I can go
out to dynamo or Mongo or whatever I
already have a start of a slot type and
said these are off actually all the
correct slots that are available for
this so you don't have to put it in here
it's not a finite thing it's just really
a placeholder of some sample ones so you
can test in a console but if you're
building in code I then once I get the
slot type in I can then go out to
databases or whatever else and then fill
that slot type is appropriate trying to
think if I have one that does okay let's
see this one I was showing some folks I
think this is I altered the sample let's
see if it has here yeah
so here is one where I'm actually doing
validation right so I allow them to put
in any type of flower type and I
actually built a slot that only has one
time is up I will build the slot that
only has one flower type that's roses
but in my code I actually take in the
flower type here and then I go out and
say these are the flowers that I will
accept and that those flowers are
absolutely not in my bot in the console
it's something I'm doing my tying it to
code so you have totally the ability to
customize and have as many slot types or
types as you want I'm over time but
if you guys have questions I will stand
here quietly and answer them before he
kicks me out here any more questions
yes yes yes yes so actually the demo
that I was going to do here but my
co-workers reminded me that I only had a
few minutes was I was going to take
ffmpeg and actually take the streams of
every like 30 seconds and then have it
give you the objects of what was on that
on that spring so I was going to
actually take that and slice up a video
a short one but that's still would've
taken some time too and then slice it up
send up send that to recognition and
then have it tell me based upon this
scene in a video what are the objects in
there so absolutely that would have been
a cool thing to finish the time this
wasn't going to do it all right so the
guys who I promised you you to see I
didn't forget please don't forget to
come up and let me give you the thing
thanks guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
