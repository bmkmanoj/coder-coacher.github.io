session or first session start with the
conference built to last
unusual topic last year I did micro
services with I think it were micro
services one of the most asked questions
introduction about about me I really
enjoy still Java and more and more
JavaScript why because nowadays
JavaScript becomes more and more like
Java it always almost looks like Java so
and so I'm working with Java and
JavaScript from 1997 so I'm cool ends in
1997 and started my my work as developer
Java JavaScript C C++ in 1995 I think
before 1995 I did a little bit C++ and
since then just Java ok by the way if
you have questions ask any times we
don't have to wait until the conference
ends some blocks of course if you have
any remaining questions after the talk
first Monday of the month I answer
everything live on and uploaded to
YouTube so there are things it's going
for three years already some workshops
you have them in India agenda and this
is my only slide actually this is this
actually philosophy of me being a
developer so if something becomes mature
it becomes boring and you can observe
this for for several years to give you
an example in one project this was I
think eight years ago or something there
were two teams one web team which
created internet apps and the other team
was a back office team which created
swing apps and everything worked in the
swing camp but the developers were
unhappy and everything worked
that didn't worked in the indiewebcamp
and everyone was excited so they're at
the task forces and no sleep and so
forth as I said it was several years ago
and I asked you know the young
developers in the swing team though
what's the problem you try to move away
from swing but everything works and
after some conversations they told me
does the problem whenever heroes
regardless what happens now we implement
a feature and it works so everyone
expects that it works we do it it works
and we go home and and we are completely
forgotten in the corner and you know
DeeDee Webb guys are the hero because
there's always something happens and
something breaks and there are fixes and
whatever so what we did we just changed
the teams of course we swap the
developers and the more major developers
were happy with swink and the young
developers are very happy with web
component development you can observe
the same in virtualization no more is
excited anymore so we can spin over note
10 virtual machines on my laptop I think
five years ago everyone did it here on
stage and docker becomes also similar
nature I think no one talks about micro
services and Daka anymore rather than
what properties unique kernels probably
or servers which becomes boring in three
years again so this boring in maturity I
think is this very good very good thing
and the last last time others more
funnier so I'm also working with some
startups in one startups two years ago
they really wanted to have scale out for
for for for a micro service Sergey just
and do it and do Scala everything else
was Java and actually uh
recently they asked me know whether they
still need Scala so I never told you to
introduce color I mean why and they say
okay because we think the Java age would
be good enough so yeah if it is I mean
go away or not and they asked me you
really no problem some noise of your
eyes actually you forgot why you
introduced color you just wanted to have
it without any explanations now I mean
they are it became boring to them so
they're playing with Scala for two years
and now just just would like you know to
implement the business logic and there
are certain there's my observation so on
and as I started with Java
started as I said 1997 the problem with
Java back then was the same like the
problem with JavaScript right now
there was a node 10 frameworks per week
and all the frameworks were completely
different and completely incompatible
with each other and all the application
service back then we had around 50 were
completely independent from each other
and I think it was not I think I know it
is was impossible to implement something
for one application server and deploy it
without any recoding or whatever not
even servlets to the other one
so what XML was not even invented so it
was impossible to implement a simple
servlet and we deployed a service
between application servers what's
really exciting but now I wouldn't be
exciting anymore you know - making
servlet work on jetty tomcat and Wi-Fi
for instance I just which was boring so
I'm just you know put an annotation on a
tablet and it just works so in meantime
so my strategy back then was of course
Java so if I run j2u in Java
I forgot all these no stupid vendor
extensions just focus on the standard
and then as a developer I have the
chance to survive and also my clients if
they are not dependent on those strange
ideas back then strange ideas what I
mean by them I don't know whether you
remember there were application service
half in C half in Java or half in C++
which really strange you know
persistence and caches or whatever
completely different what we have right
now and if we are not depending on this
stuff it is more boring but you can
sleep more because more people are using
this the more people are using is more
boring and you can sleep more and for me
sleeping more is more fun so I think
back-end is solve at least for me Java
EE works well enough it is portable that
is perfect it is boring and which is a
good thing
what I found out last year does if you
watch my talk I implement a micro
service with Bank and the problem is
what we do with the front end right so
I'm in front end we have react angular
and UGS angular 2 which is completely
different from angular 1 and and and
everyone still believes is like like and
just an upgrade and we have polymer a
web components or how to deal with the
front end and my talk is split in two
parts back end in the front end I would
implement the back end first without a
lot of explanation because I did
times then focus more on the on the
front end and you can ask me questions
challenge me or whatever so so let's
implement the boring back end so um the
most boring stuff but it's actually
surprisingly popular is mavin five years
ago mavin was I would say was said to be
heavyweight or whatever but right now I
asked developers and it seems like
everyone likes maven which is a good
thing and particularly with Java 7 or
Java 8 it looks like this so no one
cares whether you use wave it or not
because always that chart should be the
chart so and the nice thing is if you
probably know Java 8 is around the
corner so if Java 8 will come out
everyone is excited on what I would do I
would replace the 7 with the 8 exactly
what they did
if 7 came out so I replaced the 657 and
we just move on so of course you can
then use useful features was not like
everyone is waiting you know for Java 8
and and and refactoring everything
without any reasons so this is where I
say the major a boring way of developing
and what you should focus more on
features and make your clients happy if
your clients happy you also would be a
little bit more happy so this is what I
can tell you and all all the new frame
vendors all the stuff repeats every five
to ten years anyway with different names
of course ok any questions no questions
so if yes you have to shout because
you're a little bit dark so I'm not your
the audience
so our PL devoxx let's say fun is the
app boundary and fun resource and what I
would like to do is just to implement a
simple service called micro service nano
service or whatever service we will
change the name in the next years anyway
and Jason object and it would just fun
and this is going to be get returned
Jason create object builder and
the box and fun and build so this could
look like this and so what it means I
was Jason object from Java 7 dot even
Java 8 and it will never change I can
replace Jackson with jettison jettison
with with moxie format will remain the
same
good think so but this is too simple so
we just need to two more classes to have
more a complete microservice and I would
like to implement what's a class called
fun service which is a terrible name but
I don't have a better idea right now and
this is going to be a little faster so
this is the stateless and this thing and
then this is boundary it's perfect and
what I also would like to do is to
introduce a class and this called class
is the entity and this is the fun class
and this has a name node name what we
need content and a constructor sorry
constructor with the content and a
method and this is something unusual
lots of conversations to Jason so hence
we don't know you know or since we know
the only interface with the outside
world in modern apps is rest you know
why not to be depending on the rest JSON
or whatever so what I can do right now I
would just create the same what I did
before create object builder add let's
say here what was it let's do this
content this content and build so this
is standard and I don't need any mappers
D TOS everything is gone and of course
the question is what happens if I rename
the field I mean nothing happens when
you see nothing so I don't need mappers
and D TOS or whatever so I'm set so and
to make it more complete this fanservice
would return the fun
and we turn new fun and say here there
Vox PL of course or bet the name would
be 33 degrees right exactly so stateless
and inject fun service fun and here
would be something like fun Punk'd
punches dot German so uh this to Jason
okay so this is set this is enough so
what I wanted to show you this is the
simplest possible microservice in Java 7
it would run on white flight told me
whatever and the interesting part is we
only have one dependency will never
change we get Java 8 we replace eight
and seven with eight Java nine eight
with nine it will always compatible why
because nothing disappeared so far from
Java EE so this is boring so there will
be no migration projects anymore and
this is very true since Java 5 there
were not really Gration project and
anymore except someone used to know
vendor specific extensions which is
always a bad idea
ok back and done and let's see whether
it actually works so I would like to
build that so oh this is maven build and
then run it and if there's time
remaining I would just also deployed on
docker but I did it several times so
doctor should also work in milliseconds
no problem are some problems here what's
wrong with my browser browser crashed
this never happened
ah because the internet disappeared this
is cool
localhost:8080
what was it fun hopefully resources fun
as you can see Java always works
browsers not always so what it cannot
even kill it so um but cool I have
multiple browsers if Firefox will now go
away I can launch Safari in Safari goes
away we should stop the talk so but um
we have here we got it now another
question now what to do what to do with
it so I can just go Co and get this this
back and the point is if I build it it
would take I don't know one second with
everything and this is what we do in our
projects everywhere this is a
microservice is the probable in the
cloud if you don't believe me go to
youtube channel i did it several times
in a three minutes you can create
something like this and push it to
Oracle cloud Amazon Cloud or whatever
cloud you have questions no what about
the front end and so the front end
similar approach so um what I would like
to do first choose the right folder this
is important select still running the
fire on T Chrome for squid I'm killable
cool okay so I'm index.html
this is html5 and what I would also like
to do is to create a JavaScript file new
JavaScript file or is it and call it fun
yes
so um let's imagine the following so
what we can have is first I have to load
a script and this is a good idea to load
it at the end and by the way I only use
for HTML and JavaScript I use NetBeans
right now because it's quicker usually I
use Visual Studio code if this a
standalone project is also nice
editor from Microsoft but it's open
source and a nice nice support for
JavaScript and html5 and CSS so and this
is a fun GS so now it's loaded and what
I would like to do to have is let's say
input type text and this is going to be
input let's do this and properly on
button is organized buttons all click
and one output output output so with
output input okay good enough so now
what we can do here class fun and say
Lance fun equals new fun and what this
is is a comma script 6cs 2015 and it is
available in most browsers without any
transpiling so you can use transpilers
with transpiler means it would take this
and create the old JavaScript but all
the time the transpilers will disappear
in the hope is all modern browsers will
just understand this out of the box and
this looks and feels almost like Java
and becomes more and more like Java all
the time so there are small of course
small differences like there is a
constructor looks like this and I can
say console.log hey Joe so if I would
start with the Chrome because I don't
know D just do this again now it works
effect so armed the fun is loaded in so
input input so and what I wanted to have
not my rest interface rather than the
page and this again see hey Joe
so it loaded the the page not a big deal
is okay what is showing more right now
that we can write classes with with
JavaScript but what I could do I could
say in EDI and say this in a dua and now
I can say this for instance input text
equals document query selector and let's
say input so this little bit dangerous
because they can be multiple inputs
right now there's only one it works
usually what you should do of course I
ID equals what could be fun of course so
it would be this - fun so in the query
selector is available also in most
modern browsers and it basically kills
jQuery so okay jQuery is more than that
but the main idea of jQuery is
incorporated in the query selector so
it's very easy to identify to find
elements by name by classes by path so
query select selectors absolute standard
and what it means absolute standard it
will never disappear and probably never
change never change I mean I don't
expect to change in the next five to ten
years because in the in the browser the
same as in Java EE the same boring stuff
I think Java so if I have this I could
of course say this input text and say on
key up equals event and say con
all log event so just go this route
reload this and as you can see I can
receive the events with the key so what
I could do I could say e dot key Y and
others because it is here and just do
the same no just do the same and see
didn't save that it's not saved as you
can see have the keys so um now I could
say nice knife thing so what I could
also do I could go here and say this
output equals document dot exactly query
selector and let's go with the output so
if the output element and I could say
this dot output in a text or in a in a
text or HTML equals e dot key I think so
do the same as you can see so this is
the keys of kind of kind of how to call
it data binding and what I could also do
I could of course I not on key up rather
than on change so and now it will little
bit different so if I exactly if I go
here undefined
this is not key I think is a target
value let's see this is D F so now it
waits until something happens and
onfocus lost it updates the D values the
thing is what I showing right now this
unchanged on click or whatever it's a
part of the browser Dom this is not
angular it's not ember it says nothing
it's just absolute web standards and all
the frameworks have to use it anyway so
what you get from that if you write such
a code like this it will last forever
there will be no migration projects it
will work on mobile on standards and
whatever and if you look closely on this
this is not that different what we did
previously with Java pixels wink so
actually some migraine
project it exactly did migrating from
all twink to html5 without any external
frameworks now you can say okay but it's
boring what you're doing right now how
to communicate with the back end let's
try that what I could do i implement a
method fetch fun and this fetch fun
first I need my an OD and this is the
URI so Alecto there is actually an found
out called fetch so and and this fetch
so by the way there's a trick if you go
to the Internet's and can can I use this
one page and we can check for instance
the fetch as you can see the fetch is
available everywhere except Internet
Explorer 11 so arm and Opera Mini
I mean opera minion is not through
through requirement but in some of my
Enterprise project actually it is enough
to support already edge and chrome so
this is my current project it is
completely fine they don't even have a
year right now if the edge or chrome so
the question is what happens if we have
to support Internet Explorer 11 and
there are polyfills so the trick is if
you search now for fetch polyfill you
will find a github project and the ski
top project is a polyfill what it means
it makes the fetch work for all the
browsers in this case Internet 11
Internet Explorer 11 so what it means
instead of using framework what I try to
do is to use these standards and if the
standards do not work or all the
browser's I use polyfills and if the
browser disappear ideality polyfills so
the application the application becomes
smaller and smaller and smaller and
faster and faster over time and we did
several project this way one project was
in the internet it was extremely crucial
to be extremely fast
of course the more framework code you
loading the so slow it gets and we use
standards this and web components with
at the end questions so far
no questions everyone excited I guess
so I'm fetch this was the OD and this is
actually not necessary to have the full
Ori because we know that we are loading
from the same point from the same
resource at the server and then promised
already billed them so I can say the
response is console.log response let's
see what happens so I will reload the
thing here were yeah
is it saved and not on the reload I will
have to invoke it even in JavaScript you
have to call the methods so as you can
see I got the response from the server
so a nice response but I have status is
something happened I have the headers
here and can look what the headers are
so but it's get getting even better so I
could say this is nice but I would like
to have this as Jason and now go to then
and say console ah sorry
Princeton Jason and by the way this fat
arrow is like the thin arrow in Java if
you do a little bit JavaScript this way
to confuse Java and JavaScript but over
time it will go away but right now log
and Jason so now if I repeat that I have
to Jason content so that it agrees so
what I would like to have is a method
update output and this is the content
and this would be this for instance this
output in a text equals content dot
watch dot content
Ali let's say payload is data
come 10th so this would be this update
output so do the time and you see here
this is from the server without any
external dependencies no framework
standard Chrome so the question is of
course how much code will a code here so
in one point of time now I cannot just
have one class here and of course what
it could do you could add additional GS
this is actually the approach right now
the problem with that is it's a little
bit too early so I'm using chrome say
exactly 59 59 and this is the official
build Chrome 60 and Firefox 34 will
support input like the Java import so
what I what I would be able to do soon
and actually even right now I could go
here and say the following import import
service from like this service Jes and
it will just import whatever was
exported in the file and this is part of
the standard so now of course you cannot
count on the not released chrome 60
right now
so what is the polyfill for that for
instance a framework like web pack which
we bundle all your stuff so we could use
a wet web pack and web pack will search
for all the imports a create one large
file but in one point of time next year
we get chrome 70 and Firefox 60 or
whatever it is not necessary so and the
web pack if you if you process this with
a bundler like web pack for instance it
will last forever because it would
create one long one long file which will
be supported by all browsers but you get
the idea instead of using some required
stuff or whatever no one knows I would
rely on the standards and what the
standards are is actually absolutely
absolutely clear as w3c or what WG this
is the water
working group they define the standards
and whatever frameworks are on the
markets they have to use you know the
same under underlying an HTML and Dom
API yet because they're running in
browsers the same stories whatever web
frameworks I'm using in Java container
99.9 percent of all frameworks are
relying on servlets so if I know this
this is okay then I can use servlet
filters in the fourth okay cool so what
we discuss right now was what we did
actually we have a synchronous
communication with the backend wheezing
fetch which is absolute standard and and
what we also have is a nice UI but
actually the UI is not a nice and you
would like to have it centered somewhere
on it somewhere in the middle which is
the I think the most tedious a task in
html5 to centre something and so what I
would like to use is to use a style
sheet and I don't have it so I will just
create one and call it style and what I
could do I could say body so and of
course here save it saving is always the
problem so save style dot CSS so and and
now I can say this play is flex so the
Flex is already like a I think is is
grid layout in swing similar to this and
where's my can I use can I use flexbox
is the name flexbox and you can see I
know internet explorer is not a nice
screen but there's a green with box but
this can be used everywhere and I
actually always use flex and a ditch all
the CSS grid frameworks I don't need
anymore
flex is the absolute standard and on
that note the next I actually did the
proper the proper title of the of the of
the session would be the Java EE stick
way of developing html5 because I try to
find a standard first
and then apply it for CSS there is CSS
next the next tank and what a CSS next
is you could use the feature features or
future features of CSS and with
polyfills and FD the feature will be
released in all browsers you can ditch
the polyfill so we don't need any no
preprocessors postprocessors whatever we
rely on standards right now and hope
that the application gets smaller and
smaller over time exactly what happens
in Java in all my projects okay so we
have this is a CSS next also are
interesting projects and what you get
already right now our CSS variables for
instance for free this is actually the
main reason why most project use how
it's called less or sass okay questions
amazing no questions first time no
questions in Java Ino talks lots of
questions but it's obvious this is not
that obvious and no one asked question
okay cool what we have we have D our CSS
okay now we created the display flex and
justify content is Center and the next
with a line items is also Center and
this should be enough to do this which
is not exactly what I would have Center
justify content a line items
oh it's called no no Center is okay I'm
not sure with the illini items and I
think it is it could even now this
service
the problem is of course this does not
exist
this was just an idea this won't go end
on token import is not supported in this
of course so I will have to remove it I
forgot this actually so now it looks
almost better so what I did here is
style body display Flags justify content
a line item center and a link row style
but it doesn't fly so do it again
it's a pity it should be in the middle
but look terrible and but you get the
idea so imagine this is in the middle so
it cannot load the CSS I guess wait a
second and the Flex box what it is you
can you can you can say still no ok then
see whether it's vs. law
this is default let that it works
somehow okay this works and if I do this
it should be in the middle
it isn't yeah but what what the just
remember remember flexbox is supported
everywhere what flex book is you can
just design one row on one column and
the basic idea is you specify the
attributes on a container and then
attributes on the item and you can say
you know this is larger this is smaller
and whatever but this is already more or
less responsive so this would be in the
middle what I forgot there is one
justified aligned items or justified
this would be centered and there is
something else on the horizon it is
called CSS grid and the CSS grid is
something like grid back layout so it's
very powerful grid where you can pixel
perfect pixel perfect align the items
that problem the problem is CSS grid
grid exactly the grid layout
oh it's getting is getting better but is
not supported everywhere so pretty well
but this is a little bit buggy but it's
getting you see released April 11 2017
and if CSS grid comes out I think most
of these years sq trembles are no more
necessary so you can fully rely on web
standards and ditch other frameworks so
what it means what we have already in
Java right now most of the wars are
kilobytes so if you don't believe me go
to the interviews on my on my blog there
are large projects and the wars were
well below one make 600 kilobyte or
whatever because they only contain the
business logic no external frame box and
you can have the same in web so what you
get of course your assets JPEGs whatever
they are of course large but you don't
need anymore
any additional framework and
particularly not for small apps okay I
was told to watch the counter but there
is no counter so we have infinite time
which means okay so we covered what we
should remember CSS grid flex box both
our layout frameworks use French in HR
is no more necessary fetch is way nicer
promises and asynchronous loading are
already well integrated and what I
showed you also are our JavaScript
classes which looks more or less like
Java quark yes everything so our method
you can specify media types headers or
whatever so we use this complete
whatever and forgot to mention this
fetch is particularly interesting
because if use fetch behind the scenes
or fetch events are emitted from browser
and this is crucially important because
there is a thing called service worker
and the service worker in browsers is
based on web worker and the web worker
is something like executor service in
Java so there is a thread port basically
when the service worker is a web worker
with access to a cache so what it could
be relatively simple right now are
actively symbol it means I would have to
look up the API because I don't do it I
know every day but I could set up a
service worker and what will happen the
fetch would ask the service worker do
you have to Jason already for me I could
establish the cache control on the micro
service and I could implement an offline
app without any additional frameworks
because service work is also part of the
platform so as I think also standards
are boring in this particular case is
actually exciting because also it is
easy way to learn you know there's only
one Service Worker spec there's only one
fetch spec so I don't have you know to
read books and tutorials I just look at
its pagan or exactly how the API has to
look like very good questions other
questions
the CSS next it is a kind of
preprocessor with the polyfill but but
the main trick is they're using you know
the the future attributes of CSS so over
time you can ditch the preprocessor yes
and I think it's part of Pro CSS like a
deep Dee Dee Dee post processor post
process no proposal post processor very
good other questions no other questions
okay
so um it works surprisingly well so what
I would like to do is to show you
another standards we have ten minutes so
I would I prepared before the session
something even more exciting then what
it is everyone everything converges
actually to here and whatever you're
doing right now with angular react or
whatever everyone try to create a
component and I created a component
happy Duke and this is if you if you
look closely and your angular two code
on angular one angular one they were
directives and angular 2 is actually
template there's well actually one
template pack already and what would you
actually do it create an HTML tags which
are replaced by some logic and this is
part of the standard so the first first
thing is link rel import href Duke HTML
this rel import what it means a web
component a standard web component gets
imported and the standard web components
is defined like this this is just a ACMA
script six or es2015 class class happy
duke extends HTML element HTML element
is a standard element of the web browser
part of the browser Dom when this
connected call back if standard callback
is not part of the framework is like
post constructing Java or before in
j-unit and what I did here connected
callback I said this inner text equals
hello Java and this inner text means I'm
inside the Dom element already so I'm
setting myself you know the content of
the text
and then I'm observed the attribute with
the name message and the attribute with
the men messages here by the way in
JavaScript we also have static get and
attribute changed callback is also part
of the standard so whenever someone
changes the attribute it will also
change I would get notified here what
you also here see the dollar name dollar
old value dollar new new valued this is
the way in the new JavaScript to replace
the string string interpolation is a
nice way and custom elements is also
part of the browser it's a custom
elements that define happy Duke happy
Duke this is the name of the tag and the
happy Duke is the class here and you are
set so if I run it and by the way what I
will use to run it is this so um there's
a browser sync as a nice tool so if you
develop html5 apps standalone you would
like to have the live synchronization
with the browser which is really nice
and it was the browser sync tool this
this tool is now included I guess in
angular CLI but in in web pack and you
can just use this this so you install
you this node module browser sync and
this is a start the server watch the
source start please Google Chrome and
there should be no notification on
changes so on because I use it very
often I just start the script and this
is the hello Java but the interesting
part is the a/d happy Duke here so this
is a true element so this is the element
from the browser and you can see
attribute change message null he
imported so the message was changed from
now - hey important and the Duke was
initialized and he couldn't load it to
give favicon this is the error actually
which is not a big deal but the cool
thing is with the browser sync now I can
go here and of course change something
just you will see it so hijae's hello
Dook Dook so this immediately changes
the state so you don't need to know
offensive frameworks where pegs whatever
this is also know just two files and the
standard and this time that is called
web components and there are actually
many components out there so if you go
to web components with org this is a
these are ready to use components built
on this standard and I don't know
whether you know for instance Vardhan
this is like a Java primer what they did
to decoupled the web components from
valid itself so if you search for
instance for Vardhan you will find value
elements and dividing grid should be
somewhere padding grid is a really nice
and powerful table and for us Java
developers nothing new but the
JavaScript developers really like for
instance button elements and they focus
full on the web component standard for
instance and also all you know the
Google elements met or whatever can be
already included as web components so
what you get with web components first
the API so I'm a larger project in a
bank and we had trouble building
performant UIs and the first question is
know how to intact what is the API
between you know and widget and the app
and here it's crystal clear it's the
attributes of the element and if someone
changes the attributes you get notified
what also coolest there is a scoping so
there is a shadow Dom whatever you do in
the shadow Dom in the CSS it cannot be
is not visible from outside so it cannot
leakages like a private component
styling so this is everything it sort
which is not sort of templating so what
you will need still a framework to to
know to to to replace a placeholder with
the value or go with this approach what
I did it works perfectly in web
components as well so what you could do
of course you could you know define your
elements here standard elements look
look them up with document query
selector and change the values this is
what we did four years in SWT and Java X
and swing so exactly actually that the
same code
okay we have four minutes everything
blinks here though our questions
four minute questions for developing the
applications it's like a built-in server
which synchronizes my my browser my
editor with the browser browser sync
pattern very large I mean there was
several I mean html5 application should
be not that large because no one will
use them but I mean no no this is
browsers in this poor I mean what needs
production there is not a server this is
your development server but we use it
all the time and there were no
performance issues and it uses
WebSockets behind the scenes so it tells
you know the Chrome update justice and
this is very efficient protocol it's
called browser sync so I will show you
and usually the browser sync is a part
of larger framework you can use it
directly it's very simple so I use just
alius and use it right away this is
executable and this was did the trick
okay other questions the custom elements
supported everywhere which is
controversial is this import link and
the cool story in web components is
there's only one per little supported by
everyone so there is a polymer project
from Google which I also use and what I
like in the polymer - oh not one - oh is
the goal of the project is to disappear
that in one day they will be replaced by
the standards which is a really nice
idea and the only Ilham the only
difference polymer and this HTML element
edit right now you would extend from
polymer element and not HTML element so
this would be the difference and the
thing is polymer - all uses web
components polyfills
and I think Mozilla expects and was
sonic I think there are several
frameworks and all of the frameworks use
the same polyfill and the polyfill is on
github and all members are using this so
an older browser is not supported with
the polyfills it is supported and the
controversial thing is as I said import
link rel
because there is no dispute should we
use import what I showed you in
JavaScript all this link rel this is not
set in stone right now yes polymer - yes
I mean what media it works I mean what
it means works you know it is a Internet
Explorer 4 on static spectrum probably
not but I mean in my environment it
worked well enough we did yeah yeah and
before this last year and and and and
and the view years ago I use react a lot
so they're really nice this not a frame
book so you have library and angular 2
looks to me like j2e from 1945 without
any convention of the configurations or
whatever you do you have to do it five
times in all places without any don't
repeat yourself on whatever so I don't
get it but let's see what happens and by
the way web components and polymer for
instance YouTube was migrated to polymer
so if I ever saw you youtube this is
polymer web components it is not that
trivial okay any other questions
one-minute ask questions pattern my
clients my job is not you know to to
convince clients to do something like
this what I what I told them it's not it
worked like this so in one client they
use no angular one with crazy depending
singular one they cannot even upgrade
due to angular 1 5 now they would like
to do create a new project which has to
be including the old approaching and
doesn't work so they asked me what to do
so okay if we use angular 2 right now
you already know that every half year
you will have to migrate because we'll
be breaking changes every half here so
if you okay with that we go with that
I'm consulting perfect every half year
we have something to do or we can we can
use this and this sounds crazy a bit but
if you're a Java developer you are K
with that I would say in two days you
know exactly what to do and what I
really like about this approach there is
only one clear way you know how to
approach this there's only one standard
not 50 frameworks and if you know that
whatever angular does and the others
everyone has to rely on this API anyway
so this is a thing for me is this
exactly the
freedom freedom I see right now what I
saw in 1999's j2ee came out they cool
the first time I can just focus on the
speck and forget all these frameworks
vendors whatever and exactly what I see
right now I focus on ECMO script six
which looks like Java to me of course is
not that object-oriented like Java and
behind the scenes there still functions
but there's a good enough and experience
from other developers to really like the
approach it's not like this tells you
you are crazy
and they like you know the clear path
this is a very important thing otherwise
I don't know whether you saw react
angular and ember for instance their
complete different piece I mean if you
look at react it looks completely
different to angular 2 and by the way
angular 2 looks completely different to
angular 1 and angular 2 is actually more
more similar to react than the two
angular 1 just crazy world exactly what
we had to know 18 years ago in Java very
good
other questions complete different no
because there was no reason right now
and with Java EE we have thin words and
with thin walls we can deploy faster and
deploy faster means more productivity
also it's more boring it's more
productive but this is what I showed you
last year so if you watch the video I
use all the time or if you like min - 50
50 seconds but they told me they forgot
to introduce the speakers so I have a
little bit more time so I'm docker file
so what I usually do is say from let's
say ax whitefly wild fly and you can
still ask questions so this is copy
my philosophy is if you if you rely on
standards whatever standards you have
standards are boring because they are
slow but they are good enough and if you
rely on standards there's no migration
it can cool fully focus on business
logic and this is my approach for years
and it worked perfectly well and what
gives you a little bit more confidence
more and more startups are also behind
the idea because they say we could you
know create a research project or just
implement the first use cases in in in
two minutes
standards here
maven clean maven clean deploy keep it
simple between install sorry clean
package or not even clean just package
and dhaka built - t are there Vox fun
dot so now it's built the dock image
docker run - D this is full stack sent
to a 7gd k18 whitefly full 10:1 probably
minus D minus P H - H - hopefully is
open 8080 - - name fun it was sorry the
Vox fun I hope the folks fun dock
yes wait a second what addict I'm always
done with his thing localhost H - H - H
- H - does his wife lie and fun now we
have a microservice with fun with 33
degrees which does something and darker
history devoxx fun what you can see here
only the 58 seconds ago I create the
image with six kilobyte so the whole app
is six kilobyte and whitefly JDK and
sent over seven were not built for weeks
and this is the reason why I use Java e
because we travel you have deployment
and with the deployment there's clearly
separated the deliverable which is the
thin war and D and D and the platform
changes very very rarely and more and
more we have to push the clouds and if
you push six kilobyte is significantly
faster then pushing up at war or fetch R
so this is but if I wouldn't have the
clouds or I if there will be no docker I
will probably use spring boot or there
is a no white rice from swarm payara
micro or application composer in Tommy
exactly the same story but never use
them as well okay sorry
I'd add the question developer so if I
show them developers and say ok you are
crazy no we would really like to have
angular's ok what I can do then might
the team always wins but angular 2 only
we have ok angular 2 and react is what I
can answer in angular 2 the problem of
react react is crazy fast and react
fiber even fastest we can have crazy if
you have you know a very complex
application like a dashboard with lots
of changes react will have a crazy fast
updates so you could have incredible
performance in one project I suggested
angular - it was a huge project it was
my Gration project and with angular 2
you can have modules so we have one team
one module and there were lazy loaded to
a huge portal
so you saw absolute the case for angular
2 but this is one project out of 30 so
we use angular 2 and I could absolutely
explain this edit values in angular 2
but the project was crazy by itself
because was too huge but what I can do
all other projects were react or
standard work component perfect and
other questions so I didn't mention the
backends too much because I did it for
the last five devoxx the next year we
can push something to the cloud whatever
but you saw how easy it is to create a
docker to push it to the cloud is just
you know how expensive it is to put six
kilo by to the cloud and if you would
like to see it
in youtube I have Amazon and Oracle
cloud and jelastic push to the three
clouds and Java app full stack without
any optimization not a pen Linux no web
profile in the micro profile full stack
the largest possible server because also
the experience was the largest possible
application server I mean in this in
this environment know if you don't have
docker or clouds no containers no clouds
and you have bare metal server then then
pet jars could be interesting the
problem what I have with Fed Wars or
fetch arses you build everything also
just six Club I changes this sounds
crazy to me I don't get the idea why I
should do this yeah this takes one
second to think they will never achieve
this MOSFET work I mean whatever SSD you
have or whatever this is unreachable and
for me it is you know the immediate
feedback and fast loops is the most
important thing productivity is more
boring but I mean it works and it's good
enough and if I show them I mean I got
so many Java project because my my my my
my my way to show how it works I don't
go to the client to say hey look we have
20 api's and we have a decoupling
whatever no one cares about your
decoupling is so it has to be fast and
has to be well-documented and the team
has to be on your side cool
other questions I think now it's minus
seven minutes so the I think the speaker
in the introduction was shorter than
this so thank you for coming and see you
next year with this a similar topic so
and probably just HTML or JavaScript
whatever you like so thank you and see
you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
