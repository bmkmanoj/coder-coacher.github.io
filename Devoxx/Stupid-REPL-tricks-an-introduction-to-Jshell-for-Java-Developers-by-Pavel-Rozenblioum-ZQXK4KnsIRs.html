about jeschill today I'll start by
talking a little about Java 9 then I'll
explain to what I read eval print loop
is and then we'll have a demo the
biggest part of session but the first is
about me that's what I do in my spare
time I work as a Java developer for a
company called J way and we're
consultants based in malmö Sweden we
have offices in malmö in northern
Sweden in Denmark in San Francisco
we almost so many we're hiring and yeah
if we're going to talk about that with
me later
yeah I'm available somewhere so this is
my version of Oracle's disclaimer do not
believe anything I say I'm talking about
the future she feel and future might
change and I have no control over that
if you have any questions feel free to
interrupt me at any time there are no
stupid questions but all attempts to
prove me wrong will be punished so JDK 9
schedule is has been changed a couple of
times but we do expect to get a final
release sometime next summer and despite
that there are already builds well there
have been built for a very long time so
things that I'm going to show now
available very is defined just Google
JDK 9 and Lea fighter download website
from Oracle so what is J shala J shell
is a read eval print loop for Java read
eval print loop have been around for a
long time I think the first one came
with Lisp and I think that none of us
and mysteri were born when that happened
and in some cases even our parents
weren't born and basically it's like a
command line
with access to job api's same as bosch
where you have some kind of api's same
as you can find in python ruby and not
foreign languages I think that Java is
one of the last ones lots of major wants
to get it but better late than never
read eval print loop makes much easier
to evaluate code you don't need to write
a big class you don't need to compile
you just write code and run it and well
run as you go which makes some things
easier something's harder it makes it
much easier to test out new api's and
test out new things but it makes it
harder to write big things so from my
point of view the main value of this is
when you want to try something out see
how something works play around with
things and so on so now it's time for
the demo so let's hope for demo gods are
with us and nothing explodes so let's
start by zooming in a bit so that you
can actually see what I'm writing so
let's stop J show the command is J shell
and here we have a shell it looks very
much like sandy UNIX shell where you can
type things and something hopeful
happens so let's start something simple
well two plus two is four I think and
here we can see the dollar one in the
beginning of a line that means that J
shell kated available for me called
dollar bond and it works just would
expect it to so if I type dollar one
plus five we get nine so 4 plus 5 is 9
and so on so this is a most simple case
but every time you type something that
ivalice into volume J shell creates a
variable for you
so that you don't need to it yourself if
you don't want to but if you do you can
do it so I could write int foo equals
two plus two and then I can do things
with foo of course we want to do more
complex things that we want to call
functions and we can do it we can do a
system out and as you probably noticed
I'm not typing out entire file you did
not so because you don't see what I'm
typing but I'm not I don't need to type
everything I can use tab completion just
a wooden ID so I write o you press tab
and it types out the rest and it can
show me what methods are available and
print line hello dear Vox there is no
need for semicolons J shell tries to be
very lenient with syntax so it will
still ask you to close the parentheses
because if it's not just know that you
are done with her function or whatever
you're trying to do but it's try to be
lenient much more lenient of a Java
compiler we can call other functions for
example I can do more complex things
like use a lamp
and I probably screwed something up I
need two columns here as you all know
address is not in java.lang package
which is Verona think we get by default
in the regular Java class Eris is in
java.util package and we can exit here
because J shell has some predefined
imports to see which they all we have
the command called imports starts with
the slash and here we can see what's
imported right now and we can of course
import more things I like stream so I'll
import Java the tail stream and now
imports will show streams also and I
will be able to call functions from that
class now from my point of view as I
said earlier the most interesting part
here is that we can play with new things
and see how they look how they work and
so on so in Java 9 and now one of the
features that I like the most is
connection literals so we can write
something like this because I'd set off
want to frame and we get him except
instead of having to create a set of
adding things I would like to know what
type I will get it's sometimes useful
and get close and I see what it's an
immutable collections set M which
implies that it's mutable which is
probably a good thing of course I could
do the same in an IDE by writing a test
case or writing a main function that
prints it out or something else but this
feels much more natural much faster much
easier now look never get same type when
I have a smaller set now here I get 2
set 2 which is
that different fermentation of the same
clothes and I would like to know what
happens if I try to put two identical
items in a set and I get an exception so
we can do a lot of things like that
we can't play around with with code much
faster and much easier than we would
need to do would be able to do in an ID
or in a main class of course sometimes
we want to do something bigger than this
we want to define our own functions our
own on classes and we could do it here
as well so I can define find a public
class public static int return one and I
can call it so foo foo and I get and I
get one is expected now I've written
lots of code now and somewhat is
probably useful and I would like to save
it and J shop supports that so I can do
a listing of what I've done so far and
that's a lot of useful things as you can
see and we can save it and I can save it
in the file called devoxx Java and I can
exit and now I can view the file
we can view the things that we could
afterwards yes so let's start J shell
again and we can open dear folks in Java
and now it takes you to all the things
that executable and I Pro hopefully have
my full class with me so this allows us
to use Java as a full scripting language
let's see what happens there is an edit
command and here's my class I want to
hit to return to instead and now it
starts to so now that that edit hasn't
been saved in very gional file yeah
now there is o no integration but you
could add it to your class both so there
is common cold class both that add
suffered a loss you can add the jar file
then you can do it to things with your
jar file well it's not a full-featured
ID you don't get everything you might
want it's mostly for small things just
like you would never write a complete
Python project from the command line you
would open it and edit under things now
you can also
you can also write ran escaped by
editing too but but by just appending
the filename to the commercial command
so let's create a small script and I
would like to system mine thank you
so I can run my script by just adding
the filename to after jeschill command
so since I had L ended a stirred
vajacial and I can now use Java as a
regular scripting language thank you yep
that it's not supported in there as far
as I know it but it might be coming up
in a future version they're not done yet
any more questions yeah in that case
thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
