here
my name is Michaela I work at Google
here in Zurich as an information
security engineer so I usually do web
security but today I'm going to talk
about something slightly different
somehow related which I hope you find
you find interesting which is extracting
knowledge from cryptocurrencies
so how analysis of the Bitcoin
blockchain mostly but not only that can
lead to interesting discoveries and how
trackable are for example Bitcoin
transactions what kind of technology can
be developed to do that
what kind of information you can take
out and finally in the second part we're
going to talk about new generation
cryptocurrencies that are meant to be
more private than Bitcoin so that they
have anonymity built in such as monaro
or Z cash and if you have any question
even while I am speaking please feel
free to just interrupt me that's
absolutely no problem ok so first I'm
going to talk about
Batallion I'm Pete iodine is an
open-source framework for analyzing the
Bitcoin blockchain that I developed as a
proof of concept in 2011 2012 so a few
years ago when Bitcoin was much simpler
the blockchain was much smaller and when
if you if you've been into Bitcoin when
the mangog such exchange was still
active and basically bit iodine is a
collection of modules for extracting
knowledge from the blockchain and we'll
see in a moment what that means so first
of all is Bitcoin anonymous there is
there is a misconception especially in
the media and mainstream media that
bitcoin is anonymous and so it's for
example didi first choice for criminals
and for the dark web markets this was
mostly due to the fact that the secret
the first let's say mainstream dark web
market decided to accept Bitcoin
exclusively as currency but the fact is
that bitcoin is not anonymous and it has
never it was never meant to be anonymous
in fact it creator Satoshi Nakamoto very
clearly explains that anonymity is not
at all design it's not at all a purpose
for Bitcoin and actually transparency so
the transparent nature of the blockchain
where this public ledger where every
transaction is public and you can verify
that a transaction for example occurred
at a particular time stamp so if you
think about it this is much more
transparent than I don't know like a
credit card payment because anyone can
see anyone else payment the thing is you
don't see the names right opt above the
people that are transacting but you see
you basically see pseudonyms and these
positions are called addresses so
bitcoins Bitcoin is not enough is
anonymous in a way I mean it does not
require usually to be to be used if you
skip for example exchanges or companies
that require have to adhere to kyc
compliance regulations they don't
require ID did not require accounts they
have a lot of properties similar to cash
and if you use traditional anonymization
techniques 444 the internet such as tor
or VPN or i2p well then you can also
hide your IP address and then it is it
would be hard to to see who you are but
at the same time as I said all
transactions are public so this means
that analysis of the blockchain can in
theory correlate addresses and we can
get information out of those addresses
so this was the let's say how big bit
iodine was in 2012 there was a block
parser that was getting the data from
the Bitcoin daemon
and then there was a cluster Iser that
clustered together addresses that were
belonging to the same entity so
basically a single person or entity
could could have generate as many
addresses as you wish wishes and then
use them for different purposes right
and then they could be used maybe
together group together to spend money
and this allowed to cluster them
together and so we will see what what
doesn't mean in in a in a few minutes
then there were some visualization
modules for graphing and exporting and
there was a classifier module that
applied labels to clusters such as these
clusters is related to gambling activity
or to a known user name that was for
example scraped from the web maybe
especially back in the days it was very
common to leave a Bitcoin address static
Bitcoin address in a forum signature in
a Bitcoin forum signature saying
donations or tips and basically this
associated immediately write your
Bitcoin address to your at least
username and maybe your activity also
could reveal more so there were a few
scrapers that were crawling Bitcoin
related sites such as the forum the OTC
market and so on also the OTC market at
the time was kind of an eBay for trading
Bitcoin and it had a feedback system so
it was also easy to get information
about for example some known scammers
and so on so for example if you got I
don't know like a loan request I would
like to borrow some Bitcoin and this is
a address and then you put it in
battaglia dine and batard I told you
well this is associated to a known
scammer then it would it would no even
know that immediately and also there was
another module that was getting the
trades from at the time the Mongol
exchange for basically tracing also
Bitcoin that entered and exited the
Bitcoin economy there was pretty
interesting at the time because the
market was much smaller and it was not
very liquid so for example when very big
players and at the time
there were basically two big players -
it was the mangakas exchange and the
Silk Road the darkweb market decided to
sell Bitcoin there were it was very
noticeable because they were just a few
entities that had thousands of Bitcoin
so that also helped investigation of the
secret and we see that as a real-world
use cases in use case in a while well if
you follow if you're into Bitcoin you
know that the Mount GOx exchange failed
went bankrupt and the owner Kerr play
also had to you know bow well if it was
in Japan so he had to bow and say sorry
to to everyone so well this part is a
little bit outdated it's no longer there
so this is how a transaction graph looks
like every node basically is an address
and that the address doesn't say much so
at the time in 2012 I think early 2012
at the big the big nodes in the notes
that they received the most money were
gambling gambling addresses that did not
change on purpose and address is related
to exchanges mostly so for example the
one dice you see that was a very popular
provably fare Bitcoin gambling website
which was called Satoshi dice and which
I think still exists by the way it's not
no longer the most popular but it still
still lingers there and nowadays it is a
little bit more complex but maybe we
will talk about it but I think it's a
bit hard to understand what's going on
by just looking at the transaction graph
so what bit iodine does is using using
some heuristics to group together
addresses in ownership clusters and in
entities what I called an entity graph
basically every node is an entity so a
person or well an entity in a general
sense and a transfer of value between
entities is different and more
meaningful than a transfer of value
between addresses like pseudonyms and
disallowed to for example see you could
say well this gambling website received
this amount of Bitcoin and spent this
amount of Bitcoin
a particular day while you could not say
that by just having the addresses
because there were hundreds maybe of
addresses so how does it do that
how does Bitcoin group to the other
addresses so one of the eristic which is
still valid nowadays with a few caveats
is that when there is a rule in the
Bitcoin protocol that basically every
input has to be fully spent so basically
if you have addresses that have some
inputs as bad in spent inputs and you
want to send money for more of that
input you have to basically you can
either send more transactions or if you
want to bundle them in one transaction
you have to spend money from different
addresses but by doing that and by
signing the transaction you kind of
reveal the fact that you own both or
well all of the input addresses because
you must own the private key to those
addresses to be able to bundle them
together as multiple input addresses so
when a transaction has multiple input
addresses we can safely assume that
those addresses belong to the same
wallet at least and very likely to the
same user so this is under the
assumption that owners do not share
private keys I mean this looks like a
very safe assumption why should they
share private keys right because
otherwise other people could spend the a
lot of people Bitcoin but in some cases
this can happen for example if you leave
funds in a Bitcoin exchange well then
especially now with multi signature
transactions we have to be a little bit
more careful but in 2012 this was a very
safe rule and this allowed to to group
together a lot actually the vast
majority I think it's more than 80% of
addresses in two clusters the second
heuristic is based on what they are
called shadow addresses or change
addresses so as I said and spent output
of a transaction must be fully used as
an input for a new transaction so I give
an example if let's take these
this transaction so I want to send 0.21
Bitcoin to one Liz I have 0.1 Bitcoin as
an unspent output in my one Mickey
associated to my one Mickey address and
then also 0.1 in another and 0.1 in
another so what I have what the wallet
does is it usually bundles together the
0.1 the 0.1 and 0.1 and then sense
creates an extra output which is called
change address which is an address you
just generated to just get back the
change which in this case is 0.09
Bitcoin so if we are able to
automatically guess which one of the
outputs is a change address so it
belongs to the same to the sender
basically to the payer well then we
would have more information right we
could say easily that for example the 1g
here was just generated to collect
change and so it is exactly like an
input address so it belongs to the same
person who owns one Mickey for example
so this is a little bit more more tricky
right of course because it was not
always in the same position it was not
always well it should not have always
been last and also well so we could use
some heuristics such as I don't know
maybe well it is more common than like
payments have a round amount like 0.2
and for example a zero point zero six
eight three one eight five seven it's a
change then it is actually the real
payment but well this is would be
probabilistic right what happened is
that I found a bug at a time in the
official Bitcoin the Bitcoin daemon
which at the time I was accounting for
more than 90% of the transactions with
conscience actually it's no longer like
that so there was an off by one bug in
the randomization of the change address
and basically there was this get randint
there was it was fed an odd number an
integer there was one less than
the actual so since it is get randint
one basically always returns zero so
this means that if there are just two
outputs track 1 which means 1 pi ye well
then the change used to end up always in
the first output so and in general never
in the last output so this this bag was
there from 2009 to January 2013 which is
kind of a long time because I mean this
is just a privacy issue it's not
fundamental flaw but this allowed to
greatly improve the accuracy of the
clustering and so especially considering
that transactions with exactly two
outputs are very very common because
usually you have just one PI e right we
have just one beneficiary and you just
create a change address so basically was
always the first and it was very it was
very nice because by combining the two
heuristics you could get less clusters
and bigger clusters so higher-quality
clusters and also thanks to the
combination of the two mystics 90% of
addresses were in known singleton
clusters so it means they were at least
class so together with another address
which is interesting right because it
means that people using Bitcoin have a
chance of for example preserving their
privacy by not using you know for
example multi input transactions but
they basically don't care because just
10% of the addresses are not class or
transferable together and yeah so this
was very very nice and by the way the
this data is of course 2012 so it's very
updated but I have a new cluster Iser
nowadays that scales to the current size
of the blockchain and the numbers are
very similar it's around 70 to 80% of
the addresses are in a cluster and on
singleton cluster or still so it went
down a little bit but I mean
it's like singleton addresses are very
rare so now to the classifier at the
time I added some metadata to clusters
so basically some labels first seen last
seen the amount of receive of bitcoin
received and sent by the cluster right
not by each address so it's like a sum
and number of transactions if the ratio
of transactions coming from mining for
example or gambling or well exchanges or
donation addresses because they are
public or if it was an empty cluster he
was associated with a scammer it was
what he called a disposable cluster
which means like it's just a few
transaction in a short period of time
occurred and then the cluster was
abandoned and also if possible
I put the username the Bitcoin talk
which is the biggest Bitcoin forum user
name or Bitcoin OTC market username and
it was very surprising because a lot of
clusters had their data user name
associated at the time so it was very
very bad for privacy I mean I did this
in a this is like a Python scripts I
could like a collection of Python script
is not NSA grade but it was very easy to
have on my computer a lot of identities
by just running something like this so
this is an example you could see that
for example this so this is an address I
know this is a cluster okay so a cluster
has zero balance eighty-four
transactions it belonged to a new sir
which is called salty was called salty
and it's a known scammer so this means
that it was been flagged as a scammer so
it has negative verified feedback and
well you would not you know lend money
to this person and the address that
would that was used was not of course
that I put for like this query was not
the same of the one that he used for
scamming people of course with iodine
cluster together
if this information is insight so I hope
is this introduction is kind of clear I
now would like to talk about some
real-world cases the first one is about
the Silk Road so the secret was dark web
market that sold almost everything
except weapons so it used to sell a
prescription drugs prescription drugs
drugs and other things it was taken down
by the joint operation FBI NHS dia and
so one of the addresses does move most
founds during 2012 was this 1d address
that had this balance so this is a chart
of overtime of balance of that address
over time and it was impressive because
it was like seriously an order of
magnitude more holding more Bitcoin than
than others so there was some
speculation about who owned this address
but no one was sure some was saying that
it was the mount GOx that the largest
exchange at the time and some said well
it's probably the secret instead so what
I did at that time I signed up to the
Silk Road and I deposit there's a very
small amount of Bitcoin and you're
giving a one-time deposit address so
they just generated on the fly a Bitcoin
address and asked you to deposit money
there and then I've waited a few days
and follow the coins so what I found out
that is that the coins were mixed so
they were put in something that's called
a mixer or a tumbler so they are like
automated programs that try to hide the
tracks of Bitcoin by mixing them
together with others and doing that in
several steps usually around
I remember correctly the one that the
secret use is called Bitcoin fog and
Bitcoin fog used by default eight steps
so of course at each step it is harder
to follow
back like the taint as the taint of
coins as it technically said so it's so
this was kind of a bummer because when
it put the one-time deposit address in
Pattaya dine it told me yes it is in a
cluster but it is in a cluster of more
than 25,000 other addresses which was
exactly what would the tumbler the
Bitcoin mixer wanted to do make analysis
more difficult nonetheless it was
possible to find a connection between
the addresses in the mixer and that this
large one decay and it was actually just
the two steps a two hops connection
which was found by a module of betadine
and a few characteristics of this money
transfer strongly suggested that the one
decay address is related to the seek
road but it could still be Mongols so it
is inconclusive but it is it let's say
it made people think that the it is very
likely actually that one D address was
owned by the Silk Road instead so at the
owner of the city creator that was not
really an owner the creator of the
secret Ross William ullberg was charged
on October 1st 2013 with a few things
such as narcotics trafficking conspiracy
computer hacking conspiracy money
laundering by a joint operation of
Americans authorities and was very
active on social media I had a LinkedIn
profile Facebook profile with past
profile and I I would like to show you
something which I find interesting from
an operational security point of view so
his nickname was Dread Pirate Roberts in
the in a secret so the owner of the
secrets were only known as Dread Pirate
Roberts well there were more than 26,000
bitcoins were seized by the FBI but
still 600,000 bitcoins are in an
encrypted wallet which apparently no one
owns the keys of it's not certain well
says you no longer owns the keys of that
and also there were some numbers that
were like the Fed the Fed said that
there were more than nine millions
Bitcoin transacted and that earned
600,000 Bitcoin to Ulbricht in
commission which is a lot of money at
the time Bitcoin was around if I
remember correctly $400 now it's we are
at by the way today we are Bitcoin
prices an all-time high
it's so you can do the math it's
millions of dollars that's a lot so he
made a few mistakes on the Bitcoin talk
forum he used another well it was not
that bad another nickname Altoid
but what it did it was used to hire
developers using his personal Gmail
which is Ross Ulbricht
at gmail.com so this basically is very
clear indication that Altoid was a guy
called Ross Ulbricht right and then
using the same nickname Altoid it posted
on Bitcoin talk a piece of code a PHP
PHP piece of code containing an address
1l something that was very very very
very very traceable and basically it was
just a long stream a long chain of
transfer of value and basically all the
value was transferred between this and
the 1933 it is very famous address in
the Silk Road investigation and this is
considered to be the cold wallet so the
ones that no one's apparently owns the
key of which which held more than
100,000 Bitcoin and the investigators
found this address the one in 1933 so
this allowed to find out basically
Altoid is Ross Ulbricht and the Ross
Ulbricht is connected to the Silk Road
was developing the secret sorry because
yeah I probably forgot to say here it's
saying I am developing
market okay it's not it's not it's not
this one but it's pretty interesting
because it was very adamant about what
he was creating said I'm creating an
open market with no restrictions and of
course this was not it was not very very
stealthy okay there's more
of course there's there's a lot of drama
in the investigation if you've never
read or heard about secret investigation
it's very fun story also because there
were some corrupt FBI agents and two
went to jail because they also tried to
extort
Russell Russell bricks of some money
it's very interesting so a vendor a
secret vendor try to extort wood under
the nickname of friendly chemist well
attempt to extort Dread Pirate Roberts
money providing proof that he had the
names and address of thousands of
vendors and he demanded a half a million
dollars so he said what do you think
will happen if thousands of usernames
order amounts addresses get leaked all
those people will leave and be scared to
use it again so according to the FBI
Dread Pirate Roberts Roberts
solicited another user red-and-white
which was an agent undercover to execute
friendly chemist and he supplied full
address and paid them 1670 bitcoins well
at the time it was 150 K to have him
killed and the agent later provide fake
photographic proof of the alleged murder
which was also very very soona graphic
and would be tired ein I was able to
spot the payment the hitman and that's
also an old piece of information that
could help build the secret cluster it
was very nice of course no one was was
actually killed in that region around
the date matching description so red
parabolas basically was calm then it was
later revealed that red and white was
actually an undercover agent so this is
it for a four secret battalion was also
used in the secret trial in New York
by the defense actually and there was
some let's say some some doubts about
the amount of Bitcoin that Dread Pirate
Roberts earned in commissions that
didn't change unfortunately the the
substance of the of the charges so the
judge just did not allow a witness to
talk about this anyway the second use
case it's real-world this case too is
about the first mainstream ransomware at
the time it was called cryptolocker and
it was also the first one to to ask for
a ransom in Bitcoin he said Bitcoin most
cheap option and just send two bitcoins
to this Bitcoin address in 72 hours yep
in 72 hours and you will provide the
decryption key so it used to encrypt
victims documents with strong encryption
and demanding a ransom in Bitcoin for
decrypting them unfortunately Bitcoin
price really ballooned while this was
out so they had to reduce the amount of
ransom like ten bitcoins to two bitcoins
to have a better night to finally 0.3
Bitcoin because bitcoin was was going up
really really fast and he couldn't catch
up with that so this was another
interesting data point so by getting
some used deposit addresses from victims
of this ransomware I was able to build
the cluster of the cyber criminals and I
was able to identify 771 ransoms paid up
to December from September to December
15 of 2012 and also to quantify the
amount of ransoms paid and it was
approximately 1.2 Millions
so this estimate is conservative of
course because this was just a cluster
we don't know if it is the only cluster
of the of the cyber criminal but it is
still an interesting data point and
usually you're not able to do that if a
malware analyst you're not able to do
that easily because usually they use
Western Union or money pack and then you
know it's a little bit hard because
usually have to get as a law enforcement
you have to get a warrant go
- usually Eastern Europe countries which
are have a history of not being very
cooperative with law enforcement and
basically criminals rely on that so this
is very interesting because actually
Bitcoin underneath the transparent
nature of the blockchain actually made
investigation much easier so this is
these are two charts on at the top there
is the infection rate by Dell
SecureWorks this is a work I did in
collaboration with Dell SecureWorks so
on the top at the top there is the rate
of the infection rate found by antivirus
and the chart at the bottom is the
number of ransoms paid found by overtime
found by Battaglia dime so as you can
see the peaks kind of a line and this is
very nice this is very nice and as far
as I know this was the first analysis of
this kind done performed by malware and
analysts so this is also another cool
use case also by running the classifier
I was able to find a list of usernames
of exported people so for example
Bitcoin users Caesar oh nine is among
the victims I don't know the guy but I
know that so I'm done with the we're
talking about Peter lang and now I'd
like to talk about a little bit about
the future of cryptocurrencies so the
need of more anonymous and private
cryptocurrencies because as you as
you've seen bitcoin is not anonymous
doesn't intend to be actually there is a
proposal now so everyone can can propose
an improvement to the Bitcoin protocol
they're called be IPS
Bitcoin improvement proposals and one of
those would introduce some degree of
confidentiality in the transactions but
let's say the core developers of Bitcoin
do not believe this is a major selling
point of Bitcoin so the need is there of
course and not just for illegal for
illegal transactions but also just to be
private for example
donating to WikiLeaks or sub supporting
free journalism in countries where there
are repressive of freedom of expression
so there are many legitimate ways
actually of needing a private payment
system that is like digital cash so the
two most famous cryptocurrencies that
are meant to be more anonymous and
private are Monero and z cash I'm
starting with Manero Manero came first
first of all and it's based on a
protocol that is very different from
Bitcoin it's called crypto note it is a
PAC by default and optionally
transparent so it basically means that
by looking at the blockchain you can't
really have a rich list as you can have
in in the Bitcoin blockchain because you
can't see the balance of the addresses
so in Bitcoin when you have an address
you can see the balance very easily
because you basically just wind and just
some do you break some of all the
transaction that pass through that
address and then you have the balance
right but there's no such thing by
default in Manero and also an important
property is a link ability transactions
cannot be followed through the
blockchain in a way that reveals who
sent or received coins and how they
achieved that I would say you know in a
second
the transactions are not fully
confidential because right now the
amounts are in clear-text so basically
you can say the only thing you actually
can see from a transaction is the amount
transacted right now you can see exactly
who sent not even the pseudonym so the
address and to whom you see just a
bucket of senders and a bucket of
potential receivers so you just have to
basically guess who sent to whom and
also there is some anonymization
software basically at or like software
built in hiding IDs by default so how
does it work
a crypto note protocol basically did
what some mixers used to do they just
try to confuse analysis by putting using
what are called ring signatures so
basically a lot of people sign not just
the sender's sign a transaction
and few people verify a transaction and
it is very hard to to follow back this
kind of of things so basically it's hard
to say who actually sent between the
people who signed a transaction and who
actually received even and for example
on top is a hobbit con words I mean I
know I know Bob's balance and by
generating forcing the generation of
one-time addresses at every transaction
it is impossible to have what they are
also called the multi input transaction
I mean the multi input transaction are
there by default on purpose too as a
decoy to make basically the first
heuristics we talked about about MIT
Highline useless for Manero so manera is
used in a dark web market which is now
probably the dominant one but I'm not
sure I mean I'm not following very
closely right now but it is the one that
has more vetted cryptography krypton
notes protocol is pretty understandable
if you have even a let's say simple
understanding of cryptography it's not
too hard but there is a new
cryptocurrency called Z cache which uses
super cutting-edge crypto which no one
understands and I'm not I'm not the one
to say that like the world's most
renowned cryptographers say that they
don't fully understand the crypto behind
these things it seems to work so Z cache
provides a link ability which is a
property we've talked about and full
confidentiality so basically you also
the amounts of the transactions are
hidden but it uses this kind of
cutting-edge crypto which is very
similar to homomorphic encryption so
basically a lot of academics are
involved in the team and they're not
really I mean I can just speculate that
are mostly interesting in pushing this
new kind of crypto in the users of this
kind of new kind of crypto in real-world
use cases
just to prove if it works or not so it's
basically a big experiment and the cash
is actually run by a single company
while Manero is completely open-source
the cash is also open source but it's
run by a single company that by default
takes a cut from the early transactions
to fund its development so it's a little
bit different also this this technology
is very very powerful this crypto but it
has a huge drawback when some kind of
parameters are general some kind of
parameters have to be generated in what
are called a trusted set up so basically
a computer may be air gapped has to
generate some parameters and then the
computer should be set on fire so in
theory this should happen publicly in a
what are called parameters ceremony they
call it parameter ceremony so there was
disguise and they just got a computer it
was air gapped and people who'd attend
the ceremony it was public and then they
just after they generated these
parameters they just drilled into the
computer into the computer they set fire
I think they put some explosive it's on
YouTube if you want to say just look at
the cache trust the setup ceremony and
it's pretty interesting but anyway a
collusion in this trust setup could
allow someone to generate to counterfeit
money so this is actually very bad and
just the existence of a trust to set up
if you think about it is pretty bad so
basically these these proofs are called
secret the computer called the Zika is
nartz and basically they're magic they
can verify the correctness of
computations without having to execute
them which is one of the properties of
homomorphic encryption so for example
with oma morphic encryption you could
send something encrypted the
counterparty doesn't have to be able to
be able to decrypt it but still get some
information out of it for example if it
is correct or not
there's an excellent tutorial which I
think I will send this PDF and so you
can click on that and it's very hard to
follow actually if you're not a
cryptographer I am NOT it's but it's
interesting so I see I see why academics
are really into this and yeah so this is
the biggest disadvantage of this if the
parameters are not destroyed counterfeit
money could be could be forged so at any
time the value and the promises of the
currency could just fall because someone
was able to break the crypto or was
colluding in trusted setup so thank you
I hope you have some questions and I'm
here to answer
yes so I'm just one question to them to
what this means in like real life the
implication that you basically can in
most cases follow back a transaction to
a very long path because like in in
actual money at the moment when you have
like law enforcement just closes like
one account and you cannot not allow to
transfer money anymore to this account
but basically what you said in Bitcoin
it would be possible to basically go all
the chain back end when one who wants
once touched by a criminal then you
basically would not allow it to use it
in legal context anymore it's a trying
well Bitcoin can't really be regulated
right I mean of course it you could add
a rule to the Bitcoin protocol then when
money is tainted somehow then it's not
spendable anymore so for example if
there is a hack and someone steals from
an exchange and you find the taint right
the taint of the steal the stolen
Bitcoin in theory if people think well
this is bad we don't like thieves we
will just ban you know these tainted
coins so we just remove them from
circulation right it's like burning cash
right well Bitcoin works that the miners
vote with their hashing power so it is
completely democratic it can't be
imposed from a central authority the
majority of miners would have to agree
and also to an extent the majority of
nodes would have to agree so just normal
computers running Bitcoin software so
this is very hard and personally I feel
it would not be a great idea because it
would hurt fungibility of the currency I
mean cash for example it is very likely
I mean on 500 francs unlike almost 80%
of them there are traces of cocaine
right that doesn't mean that you can
spend a 500 francs and it will be
disastrous if any banknote that was used
by a criminal activity in any way would
not be expendable anymore right so
I mean it would happen like basically
what happened in India when they banned
hi like large banknotes it was very bad
for for the economy it hurt really the
economy but anyway to also to to to
reply its answer to the first part so
battalion has been used by law
enforcement and it has been used well
something based on bit higher than
actually it has been used together with
traditional investigation so usually the
law enforcement where it was interested
in just reaching a real-world exchange
so saying you know well we know that at
this time this transaction ID went to an
exchange so that they can get a subpoena
or a warrant and go to exchange and say
please give me the real-world data of
this and usually there there's a link to
the bank account there too right which
is usually stolen or in some weird
places and so on but from there on the
investigation becomes traditional so
this was eight normal investigation not
replace but aid and it happened for
example even here in Switzerland
battalion was used for investigating
some local Bitcoin scam there were some
people robbing other people out of their
Bitcoin and it of course filed a
compliant and in some cases the words
was it was even successful so that's
yeah it's interesting
I guess they're normal questions okay
