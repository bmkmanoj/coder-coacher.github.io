with the session can you hear me well
yeah it's okay first of all thank you
for coming to this session my name is
Martin just last year here at Vogue
day's vienna i spoke about the security
sandbox model of the java platform and
we touched upon very briefly about how
does the new module system in java 9
affect the java ecosystem today in this
session basically I'll cover what are
the new Java 9 security enhancements and
I'll show you some examples to get a
better idea on how to apply them in
practice so just before we start with
the actual session my name is Martin I'm
working for a company called coffee
compensating where I'm a Java consultant
I'm also one of the guys who helps
organize the events of the bulgarian
java user group and i'm also a very big
open JDK enthusiast and you can follow
me on twitter i tweet mostly about java
so in this session basically will first
do a short recap on what is the TLS or
the transport layer security support up
to jdk 9 and then based on that
knowledge we'll cover what are the new
security enhancements in Java 9 such as
DTLS or Datagram Datagram transport
layer security al p.m. which is a very
interesting extension on the TLS
handshake protocol and we'll also review
the rest of the security enhancements at
a glance as you know Java 9 has a very
major introduction which is the jigsaw
module system and one of the nice things
about the jigsaw module system is that
it doesn't affect the security sandbox
model of the Java platform this means
that we can use the security manager
scheme with the permission checking
that's being implemented since Java 1.2
and apply that to jigsaw modules without
any change one of the new things that
has been introduced in the gemenon
module system is the possibility to
specify concrete permissions per jigsaw
module with the new syntax that extends
the format of the security policy file
another thing that jigsaw allows us in
terms of security is to basically
improve the security of our applications
and based on the way we deploy modules
now
application we can remove some code that
is unnecessary and in that way improve
the security of our application and this
is in fact one of the goals also of the
jigsaw module system to improve the
security of the JDK itself by building a
smaller JDK out of modules that you only
need you just need you just improve the
security of the JDK okay so let's get
started first what do we have in Java 9
in terms of TLS support so basically
what I'll cover here is a short recap of
how does Java support the transport
layer protocol and based on that
knowledge we'll discuss the new security
enhancements so up to JDK 9 we have
several versions of TLS protocol
supported by the JDK and these are
versions 1.0 1.1 and 1.2 and currently
there is a version 1.3 which is ongoing
in terms of being specified in a formal
specification and that version will be
supported in later versions of the jdk
eventually and as most of you know TLS
is the predecessor of the SSL protocol
it allows you to secure communication
over the Internet
you can enable TLS in your organization
typically one of the best practices that
most organizations enable is to enable
TLS in all layers of communication
between the different applications
within the organization however there
are other interesting use cases behind
TLS and that's the ability to enable SSL
VPN some of you probably when they need
to connect from home to your
organization's network probably they
need to go over an SSL VPN solution and
just before we discuss what are the
security enhancements in Java 9 we need
to understand how the TLS handshake
process works this is in fact the
process that triggers just before we
establish secure communication between a
client and the server and the first step
which happens in a TLS negotiation is
that the client proposes to the server
the TLS version and the cryptographic
Schiffer's that are supported by the
client the server receives that request
from the client negotiates what is the
TLS version
the Schiffer that supported by the
server and the client and also sends
back to the clan the server certificate
which contains the public key of the
server at this second step the client
receives the required response from the
server then fetch is the server
certificate and probably does some
certificate verification certificate
verification allows the client to make
sure that the certificate that the
server presents is valid and the way the
client does this is using a protocol
which is called all CSP or a certificate
revocation list and typically those two
mechanisms are exposed by a certificate
authority to which the client connects
the client basically looks into the CA
certs file which is part of the JDK and
tries to determine whether the server
certificate is valid against any of
those certificate authorities presented
if that's not the case then TLS
negotiation fails when the client
verifies the server certificate it
optionally may send its own public
certificate to the server and this is
used in case we need to establish
bi-directional communication between the
client and the server and the server on
its own hand may verify the client
certificate when the client sends the
client certificate it also sends the
generated secret key that is used to
encrypt the communication between the
client and the server and at that point
the client and the server negotiate that
they finished the TLS negotiation phase
at that point we have the generated
secret key that is used to encrypt the
communication between the client and the
server so this is basically the TLS
handshake process at a glance and based
on that process there are different
extensions that are provided by upcoming
specifications of the TLS protocol to
adapt more functionality to that process
and up to JDK 9 TLS is supported by
means of the so called Java secure
socket extension which is a secure
equivalent of the standard Java sockets
as you know them this is implemented by
means of a so-called Java cryptography
architecture provider by default the jdk
provides a cryptographic provider
which is called Sun JSS II or Sun Java
socket extension provider the core
classes of that provider are part of the
Java vex net and javac net SSL packages
and basically the secure socket
extension in the jdk provides two modes
of operation one is the standard secure
socket mode or the blocking mode of
operation which works pretty similar to
how standard sockets work the only major
difference here is that you need to set
more parameters such as key stores trust
doors and so on we'll see some examples
and there is also a much more complex
mode of operation which is the non
blocking mode of operation which is
established by means of the SSL channel
API one interesting wrapper around the
TLS support in JDK is the HTTP URL
connection class which is used to allow
simplified communication between HTTP
endpoints so basically it's a wrapper
class around the secure socket extension
and to look into more details into the
two modes of operation the secure socket
the blocking mode of operation is
provided by the SSL socket class as we
already said it's used in the same
manner as a regular socket and the most
important point here is when is the TLS
handshake process triggered so basically
TLS handshake may be triggered at three
different steps first one is if you call
explicitly the start handshake method on
the socket this triggers the whole TLS
handshake process that we saw a few
slides ago another way to trigger the
TLS handshake is if you try to get the
session from the socket the socket
checks whether TLS handshake has been
triggered and if not it triggers the TLS
handshake process and the third way to
trigger the handshake process is by
trying to read or write to the SSL
socket these are the three ways that
behind the scenes the socket API in the
jdk triggers the TLS handshake and to be
more specific here is an example of how
this works this is an example of a
secure socket extension server first we
set a property Java property
Jawad net ssl keystore which specifies
the location of our key store where the
server starts stores its public
certificate that's sent to the client
and then we also set a password for this
key store then we use an SSL server
socket factory which is basically a
factory class that allows us to create
server sockets and from that SSL server
socket factory we create a server socket
on port 4 4 4 4 and what we do is we
accept some connection on the server
socket this operation as you might guess
is blocking so at that point we we wait
for some requests to be received on the
server then we read the input from from
that request and while we have something
in the input stream we print out some
message and at the end we make sure that
we close basically the socket and the
connection so this is a very simple
example of how SSL socket server looks
like and on the client side we have
something quite similar first we set two
properties that identify the trustor for
the plant the terse store stores a list
of the certificate authorities that are
trusted by the client and that are
specified in the CA certs file which is
part of the JDK installation so we first
set the location of the thrift store
then we set some password for the thrift
store then again we uses an ssl socket
factory to create the SSL client socket
we click create the client socket on
localhost again on port 4 4 4 4 and then
we write something to the server when we
do that we finally make sure that we
close the client socket and the
corresponding streams this is a very
simple example of how an SSL client
looks like and the second mode of
operation of the Java secure socket
extension or the non blocking mode of
operation is much more complex than the
standard socket SSL socket mode it's
provided by a class called SSL engine
and this class makes use of two methods
which are called wrap and unwrap to read
and write to write and read data to the
SSL engine and how this is done basic
we write some data to an application
byte buffer which is basically a buffer
on the application side that receives
the packets that are to be written to
the network then we use the wrap method
to send those packets to a network byte
buffer from which they are sent over to
the network and when we receive data
using the SSL engine class we read that
data using the unwrap method from the
network byte buffers and write it back
to the application byte buffers from
where our application handles it and
it's much more complex API to used in
the ssl socket API
however the SS the TLS handshake process
might be triggered using the SSL engine
class again in three distinct steps
first is if you call begin handshake
method on the SSL engine class this
triggers the TLS handshake process in
the similar way as we do with the SSL
socket or if we call Europe or unwrap
methods and TLS handshake hasn't been
triggered then it's triggered by any of
those two methods this is in general how
the non blocking mode of operation works
as we said it's much more complex like
the ssl socket API and it's typically
used with an API which is predates Java
9 which is called socket channel however
since it's a much more complex API that
you need to debug when you work with it
you may need to enable some properties
that allow to inspect what happens
during the TLS handshake process or
during the TLS communication and in
order to do that you can use the
property GX dotnet debug if you set that
property to all you'll see all the
information that flows through the
client and the server and you can make
this information more fine-grained by
specifying just specific parts of the
SSL process that you would like to
inspect for example if you specify only
handshake you'll see only messages that
are exchanged between the client and the
server when you when the TLS handshake
process is Stewart or you can specify
SSL this will show only messages that
are exchanged between the client and the
server after the TLS process is
established so far so good now let's see
based on that what we have in Java in
jdk 9
or the first thing that I'll cover is
DTLS so DTLS basically is TLS over an
unreliable transport protocol as UDP
many applications such as chat clients
or other types of business applications
require unreliable communication which
also needs to be secured so DTLS covers
all those use cases of applications
running on top of an unreliable
communication protocols such as UDP
however in DTLS as is similar to UDP
reliability and inorder delivery are not
are not guaranteed by the protocol as is
the case with TLS over TCP this is
something that the application developer
needs to establish at the application
level also DTLS targets to secure
protocols such as DNS sip and so on and
so forth just to name a few
also detail as follows the TLS
specifications that are specific to D
TLS and
d TLS is currently 1.3 in draft mode
when this specification is ready DTLS
would DTLS for that version of the
specification we support it in the jdk
as well some differences between the TLS
and TLS first in the DTLS protocol
packet we have a new field which is
called sequence number as you might
guess since basically the TLS packets
are not guaranteed in terms of order we
need to have a field that identifies the
sequence number of the concrete DTLS
packet also we have some dropped support
for cryptographic shippers like RC 4
that are not supported by the D TLS
protocol we also have a read
transmission timer for resetting of
packets as we already said reliable
delivery is not guaranteed in DTLS and
for that reason we need another field
that allows us to make sure that we need
we can establish reliable delivery if we
need to and there are also two other
differences with the TLS protocol one is
that Mak verification failure triggers
warning instead of failure in standard
TLS if there is Mak verification failure
this will
failed a negotiation process and in in
DTLS that's not the case and also we
have a new request that allows us to
additionally identify the sender of the
request and now in jail ek9 we have
support for DTLS 1.1 1.0 and
implementation is adapted to the Java
secure socket extension API as we saw
earlier SSL engine class is used
basically to provide support for DTLS in
jdk 9 which means that the DTLS API in
JDK 9 is non blocking API and typically
the SSL engine class is used with the
Datagram socket API to provide support
for DTLS in Java 9 implementation is
based on the SSL engine API classes we
already mentioned which makes usage of
DTLS a bit hard set first as I already
mentioned the SSL engine API is fairly
complex to use and it's not very widely
adopted in the Java community so if you
want to get started with DTLS in jdk 9
its i would say a bit non trivial and if
basically use Java 9 or earlier versions
I would still recommend that you go with
some third-party library like bouncy
castle they have a bouncy castle Java
secured socket extension provider which
provides implementation would 4d TLS
which is much simpler to use it's just a
few lines of code in JDK 9 however if
you want to get started with the TLS
there are a number of tweaks that you
need to make to your code to make it
work correctly another option you can
adopt is to use open says SSL via j'ni
open SSL also provides implementation
for DTLS now in JDK 9 however there are
some specifics to the implementation of
DTLS
order delivery as I said is not
guaranteed by the TLS however for the
purpose of handshake TLS handshake in
JDK 9 automatic order delivery is
automatically provided by the SSL engine
class so you don't need to make sure
that during the handshake process you
establish
or the delivery of packets also the
sequence number can be retrieved by a
new method which is called sequence
number from the SSL engine results class
it however if you need to make sure that
you read Aleve our packets that have
failed to deliver in DTLS you need to
make to implement that in your
application so we need to make sure that
redelivery happens on the application
side and yes I already said in DTLS
handshake messages must be delivered
properly and that step here is required
only for the TLS handshake process so
the SSL engine API make sure that during
handshake delivery of packets is
guaranteed and to get started with ETLs
here is a very brief example you get an
ssl context instance for DTLS by calling
ssl context dot get instance DTLS then
you initialize that ssl context with
some parameters and then crete you
create an ssl engine instance from that
ssl context when you create the ssl in
engine instance you can start
establishing communication using the
Rapidan rapids however there are not
many good examples on the TLS either in
the jdk documentation over the net so if
you want to see how it really works in
practice some good examples are provided
by the open JDK 9 destitute there are
five or six unit tests that cover DTLS
to some degree so if you want to see how
this is implemented ej9 I would suggest
you see the open JDK nine testitude now
to give them more insight about a new
API that's in JDK nine that's the TLS
application layer protocol negotiation
extension which is much simpler to
understand then the DTLS support
provides in JDK nine and the application
layer protocol negotiation extension is
a way that allows you to identify the
application protocol between the client
and the server
in fact it also does not require
additional round trips to achieve that
this all happens during the TLS
handshake
and during the TLS handshake process
when the client and the server exchange
packets they might also negotiate the
application protocol that's being used
between them an interesting use case
behind this is HTTP 2.0 2.0 if you have
a web server that supports both HTTP 1.1
and 2.0 but you have different clans
that supports different versions of the
protocol you can use that extension to
establish the proper application
protocol between the HTTP client and the
server and also another interesting
property of the LPN extension is that
you can the server can send different
public certificates based on the
application protocol so for example if
you have an HTTP web server it can send
one public certificate to an HTTP 1.1
client and a completely different
certificate to an HTTP dot 0 client and
to give you an example of how a LPN
works when you basically create a server
socket or a client socket you you get
the SSL parameters from the
corresponding socket and on those
parameters you call the set application
protocols method which accepts just an
array of strings which identified the
names of the application protocols that
the client or the server supports here
this might be either a client or a
server socket and the same thing can be
applied on the SSL engine API or the non
blocking mode of operation again you get
the ssl parameters from the SSL engine
instance and you set the application
protocols that the client on the server
supports when you do that you trigger
the handshake process from the client on
this or the server by calling start
handshake or begin shake handshake
depending on which mode you use and then
you can get the negotiated application
protocol after the TLS handshake process
is established by calling the gate
application protocol method on the ssl
socket or SSL engine instance this
basically will return your string which
says what is the identified application
protocol there is a much more advanced a
way to use application layer protocol
negotiation and basically you can
specify custom protocol selector which
uses a more advanced mechanism to
specify to specify how to negotiate the
application protocol on the server side
on the SSL server socket you call a
method called set handshake application
protocol selector and you specify in
that particular case this is a lambda
that accepts two parameters one is the
SSL server socket and the list of client
protocols that the clan suggests to the
server in that particular case I get the
current TLS handshake session from the
server socket I get the cryptographic
Schieffer that's been negotiated between
the client and the server and I also get
the negotiated packet buffer size
between the client and the server and if
the negotiated cryptographic Schieffer
is rc4 and the size of the packet is
larger than 124 bytes then I returned
protocol one other otherwise I written
protocol 2 this is a more advanced way
to determine which application protocol
you want to use between the client and
the server now to give you some more
details on what we've seen so far I'll
use custom banking application server
this is a plain java application that
blade basically provides different
modules which implement different kinds
of protocols that work within that
banking application server we have
protocols like fixed alpha XMPP and si s
IP and also this banking application
server supports different kind of
applications that can use those
protocols to interact with different
applications within the bank for example
now let's see how we can implement this
for the banking server I have a fairly
simple project which basically makes use
of the so called service loader
mechanism so the banking server loads
its applications from the class pot and
how many of you have used the service
load or utility to people ok so it's not
a widely used utility but in fact in
Java 9 this is utility that the jigsaw
module system uses to discover different
kinds of services that are specified
between
jigsaw modules so in that particular
case I use the service load of utility
to retrieve all instances of the banking
application interface and from all those
banking application instances I call
application dot execute which triggers
the logic of my banking application
giving you more insight on what is the
module for the banking server this is
the jigsaw description of the banking
server it requires only Java logging
from the JDK modules it exports some
packets to the external world meaning
that other modules can make use of those
packages and it also provides two
services that can be implemented by
other modules one service is the banking
application service which is implemented
by banking application banking
applications and the other one is the
banking protocol service which is
implemented by banking protocols and we
have two concrete implementations of the
banking protocol interface one is for
the fixed protocol which is in a
separate project called fixed protocol
if we look into the module descriptor of
that protocol we see that it provides an
implementation of that protocol which is
provided by the fixed protocol class
this fixed protocol class is fairly
simple it implements the banking
protocol service and in the execute
method I just print out that I send some
message through the fixed protocol the
banking server additionally has an
interface called banking application
which is implemented by banking
applications that would like to execute
some logic and potentially use some of
those protocol implementations provided
by the banking server and also the
banking server has a protocol service
that's used by those applications to
send a packet over a particular protocol
again here in this protocol service I
use the service loaded utility to
retrieve all implementations of the
banking protocols and for which one of
each one of them I check whether the
protocol name matches the name of that
protocol and if that's the case I send
the packet over that protocol now to
demonstrate how this works I have
demo application and my demo application
implements the banking application
service it brings something to the
standard output it creates a packet
using the fixed protocol the concrete
packet is submitted because we don't
care about what is the structure of our
protocol and I also get the protocol
service from the banking server and
called sent packet now if I compile all
those modules I've already pre compared
the modules for the banking server and
two protocols
I would like to recompile my demo
application and the way I do that is by
calling Java C minus module path modules
in the modules directory I've already
the compiled modules for the banking
server and the protocols and then I also
specify that additionally I'd like to
compile the demo application along with
the module info file that's specified by
us by that by this module I would reckon
by this and if I execute the banking
server with already the demo application
deployed I would see that my demo
application is discovered by the banking
server and it sends a message over the
fixed protocol now this is how the
banking server works in general now
imagine that we have a scenario where we
have a sip client let's say we have a
banking chat server somewhere in the
bank and that banking application server
supports the XMPP protocol in two
versions 1.2 and 2 dot o for example and
let's say that in my banking server I
would like to provide support for XMPP
1.1 version of that banking application
in order to do that I need to provide
first a protocol implementation for XMPP
that deploys in the banking server and
that protocol implementation is provided
by the XMPP protocol class that
implements the banking protocol service
and inside the execute method what I do
is basically I create an ssl socket
client in the same manner as we saw in
the slides so basically here i I specify
the trust
or the trust or password I specify here
the most significant thing is that my
sip plant sports version XMPP 1.1 now I
also have an example of the server let's
imagine that this is some chat server
running somewhere on the bank and if I
open the server to see how is it
implemented I can see that this server
basically provides support for two
versions of the XMPP protocol 1.1 and
1.2 now when I start the server and
communicate with it through the through
the client as you can see the matching
protocol here is XMPP 1.1 so basically
what I would expect to see is that the
negotiated protocol in that case is XMPP
1.1 you know to see if that's the case
first thing I'll do is I'll start the
server then I'll go back to my demo
application in here I'll change the
protocol to XMPP this is the name of the
protocol specified by my XMPP client
protocol implementation then I'll need
to go and read compile my demo
application in the same manner using
Java C and if I run that I'll see
basically that the client sends an
eczema XMPP protocol packet and that the
negotiated protocol is XMPP 1.1 as you
can see using LPN is fairly
straightforward you just need to provide
two to two calls to a method called set
application protocols both on the client
and on the server side now imagine
another scenario where we have a much
more complex DTLS server running in the
bank let's imagine that that's another
chat server that communicates over UDP
and that that DTLS server runs somewhere
on the bank for the DTLS server I have
another server running
that server basically is fairly complex
because it takes into account a lot of
additional tricks that need to be
adapted into the detail as a
implementation or the most significant
thing is the way I create the SSL engine
class securing the create SSL engine
method first I get an instance of DTLS
then I specify some parameters in that
particular case I need to specify the
list of trust tours the list of key
stores and a secure random
implementation used to generate the
shared secret in that particular case I
don't specify them then I create an SSL
engine instance I set some parameters on
that engine instance and I return it
basically I'll start the DTLS server and
also on the banking server I would like
to provide a DTLS client that
communicates with that server that's yet
another protocol implementation which is
provided by the SIP protocol class and
the SIP protocol class is also fairly
complex because during the handshake has
already set you need to take into
account a lot of tweaks you can take
that example from the open JDK 9
destitute but the essential bit here
again is the create SSL engine method
which basically shows you that it's
pretty much the same to create SSL
engine instance for DTLS on the client
side when I run when I go to my demo
application again to change the used
protocol here I'll specify sip which is
the protocol provided by that client
again I'll recompile my application I'll
run that and basically hit my demo
application send some packet to two
little s to the over the SIP protocol
basically here I have non blocking mode
of operation so here I need to have good
synchronization between the timing when
I start my server and client so I can
see some packets flowing and that's
pretty much it
so now if I'm to discuss the rest of the
security enhancements it at a glance
apart from the TLS extensions that we
just saw we have another interesting
feature in JDK 9 which is called OCSP
stapling
or CSP is a protocol that allows you to
check on the client whether the
certificate is revoked or not using the
certificate authority meaning that for
example if a certificate has been stolen
or for some reason has expired for it
for example the OCSP protocol can be
used on by the SSL client to do that
certificate checking during the TLS
negotiation process the server typically
caches OCSP responses and basically OCSP
stop like is an optimization technique
that allows you to reduce the number of
requests that the client sends to the
certificate authority you can imagine
that for example if a server has
thousands of clients and each of those
client has to send a request to the
certificate authority that can be very
networked consuming and for that reason
OCSP stapling comes in place it
basically provides the capability for
the TLS server to do the certificate
revocation checking using the OCSP
protocol so it's the SSL server that
communicates via OCSP and not the client
and also the SSL server typically caches
the OCSP responses that are returned
from the certificate authority that
effectively reduces the number of
responses from the OCSP server because
every time the client needs to do a
certificate revocation checking it goes
through the server which eventually
might have cached OCSP responses and in
order to enable OCSP stapling when you
have a client-server communication you
need to set two properties on the
content on the server on the client you
need to set basically the j decade or
TLS but client enabled status request
extensions equals to true and also you
need to set another property which is
cumson that SSL check revocation equals
true
you need to set it on the SSL client and
on the SSL server to enable OCSP
stapling you need to set another
property which is dedicated server
enable status request extension equals
true this is the only thing you need to
do in order to enable OCSP stapling
during the TLS negotiation process
another interesting feature in jdk 9 is
that now we have pkcs12 as the default
key store type in Java 9 before Java 9
we had the so-called Java key stores
which was a proprietary format in Java
however it was decided that the jks
format is a bit vendor specific so they
decided to switch that default format to
pkcs12 types of key stores which is of
course much more interoperable with
other applications that are not written
in Java for example also another
interesting think about pkcs12 is that
it provides support for stronger
cryptographic algorithms which is a
limitation in jks and as I said already
it provides better inter ability with
other systems typically not written in
Java and there are there is a set of
other smaller enhancements which is for
example the ability to leverage CPU
instructions that are provided for the
cryptographic G hash and RSA algorithms
which are provided at the hardware level
also we have a new secure andum
implementation a family of new secure
and implemented that can be used when
you establish the TLS negotiation
process also sha-1 certificates are
disabled for certificate validation this
basically is done because show on
certificate validation may expose some
security vulnerabilities to your
application and the sha-1 as
cryptographic algorithms are already
quite old and vulnerable to attacks and
also there is the default provider in
the jdk provides an implementation of a
series of Kshatriya algorithms which are
shut Ritu
five six five one two and so on and so
forth so there is a new implementation
of those series of algorithms and
there's a summary as you can see in JDK
9 we have some interesting security
enhancements and features which you
might adopt in practice if you need to
another interesting thing that we have
now in JDK 10 which comes out this month
as a general availability is that Oracle
has decided to expose its certificate
authorities in open JDK the certificate
authorities which were part in JDK free
Java 9 were basically a list of
certificate authorities that were
designated by the so-called Oracle root
certificate program and now that lists
absurd certificate authorities is
available in the CSS file which is
available in JDK 9 open JDK 9 also there
are there is a number of new
enhancements coming to future Java
releases part of them as we saw is the
support for newer versions of the
protocols for TTLs DTLS and also we have
several upcoming joy enhancement
proposals for stronger cryptographic
algorithms that you can see in the
official Oracle documentation and the
majority of those enhancements that we
saw related to the TLS support in JDK 9
and yet hopefully we will see much
better support for TLS and other
security enhancements in the JDK any
questions on TLS and security in general
if not then thank you for attention
