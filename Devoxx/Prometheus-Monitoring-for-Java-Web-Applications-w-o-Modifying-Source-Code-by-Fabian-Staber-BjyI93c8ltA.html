Prometheus monitoring for Java web
applications without modifying source
code so as the title says what we are
going to do in the next half an hour we
are going to instrument a java web
application with Prometheus metrics and
we are going to do so without modifying
the applications source code so thirty
minutes is not very long for this topic
so I cannot really give you a huge
overview of what prometheus is and the
ecosystem around the Prometheus server
and how monitoring works in general
and then also talk about instrumenting
Java applications without modifying
source code so what we are going to do
I'm going to keep the introduction very
very brief I'm just going to say what
Prometheus metrics actually are because
that's what you need to understand to
follow the talk and then we go right
into the java part and most of the time
we will be looking at Java code and
learning how to instrument java code
without code modification okay so let's
start what is a prometheus metric so
Prometheus what you need to know the
Prometheus server is a time serious
database okay so the basic data
structure of Prometheus are sequences of
floating-point numbers of 64-bit
floating-point numbers that are stored
together with the timestamp when those
numbers have been observed okay and then
the best way to show to you what a
previous is metric is I guess is by
example so I have this little example
application here it's called the wildfly
kitchen-sink there's nothing special
about it it's just that if you go on
github to this white fly slash
quickstarts repository you find a whole
bunch of applications each of them
illustrating and different aspect of
java ee and i just picked the kitchen
sink as my example applications it's a
very simple application it has a rest
interface you can access that here and
what it does it loads a list of members
from a sequel database in JSON format
okay so nothing special about this
application it's just what I will use
an example throughout the talk I'm going
to run it on the whitefly server however
everything that I'm going to say also
works with Tomcat and Springwood for
example so actually real like Java EE
application service make those things a
little bit harder so if it works with a
real Java EE application server
environment chances are good that it
works as well with something more
lightweight like spring boot with Tomcat
ok good so what's a Prometheus metric so
the simplest metric you can think of for
a an application like this would be a
calendar counting the number of times
that this endpoint has been exist okay
and I actually have this application
instrumented for promises right now and
I have a Prometheus server running here
so what we see here is the Prometheus
debugging API so if you start the
Prometheus server on port 9090 it has a
built-in debugging API that you can use
to run some queries and verify that
everything's running correctly okay and
I have a metric called HTTP requests
total so I can type this year let's
total which is my calendar of the number
of requests so if I run this query I see
that there are actually there's more
than one metric with that name and those
metrics do not only have a name they
also have labels okay and one of those
labels is the pass here and as we are
only interested in this /members
endpoint that's what we're going to
instrument in this talk I can refine my
query a bit can say I am interested in
metrics that have the name HTTP request
total and they should have a label named
path and this path should match anything
ending in members okay so if I run this
I have only one result left so this is
my calendar so it has a name has a bunch
of labels and a value which is a
floating point number so what we see
here up to now this end point has been
accessed 620 times the calendar is so
high because I have a small shell script
running in the background calling this
endpoint every second so that we have
some traffic to see something okay so
last word of introduction to that I mean
this is the
format of a Prometheus metric okay
question is how is this useful I mean
how can it be useful to know that this
end point has been called 620 times and
of course this information in itself is
not useful at all okay however you need
to be aware that the Prometheus server
is a time series database so it does not
only store the current value of this
calendar it also stores the history of
all previously recorded values okay and
I have configured my server such that it
pulls the values every 15 seconds so
every 15 seconds I have a snapshot of
how this counter evolved and what I can
do now for example with the Prometheus
query language I can say let's look at a
time interval of the last five minutes
here and then this query language has
functions one of them is rate which
takes a time in the roadless parameter
and gives me the per second rate as a
result and if I run this I see that if I
look at the time interval of the last
five minutes I can say that my endpoint
has been accessed with an average rate
of almost one request per second okay
and this is the type of information that
makes Prometheus useful you know so
knowing the current load on your system
can be really valuable you can define
alerts if there is overload or something
unexpected is going on and of course you
can relate this to other metrics that
you have on so on so this is the the
type of way promises works right but
from the application point of view so
all you you need to do is you expose
some floating point values there are
counters there are also histograms for
example for measuring time intervals and
all the actual magic is then happening
in the Prometheus server so that was a
very very quick promise introduction and
let's now look at some code and discuss
how would you instrument a java web
application okay so this is the source
code of this kitchen-sink example
there's nothing special about it and
before we will actually go ahead and
instrument this without modifying source
code we will first instrumented with
modifying source code so that we
later know what's going on what we're
doing okay so what we are going to do we
are going to stick with this simple
counter example because it's easy to
understand and everything else works
very similar and this little method here
list our members is the implementation
of this endpoint that we looked at and
what we are going to do we are going to
instrument this method with a calendar
counting how often this method was
called okay how would you do that if you
can actually go ahead and modify the
source code of course first things first
you would start adding a mailing
dependency of course so this is the pom
file and I'm going to say I'm adding two
dependencies here first is the IO
Prometheus simple client
it's a Prometheus client library for
Java and this is where the metric types
are defined like the counter that we are
going to use and other things for
measuring time intervals so it's a
simple promises client library and then
once you have your metrics available you
somehow need to expose them to the
Prometheus server so Prometheus uses
HTTP requests to load to pull the metric
from your application so your
application somehow needs to provide an
HTTP endpoint for the promises server to
make the metrics available and there's
of course more than one way to implement
this one way is that there is a
predefined servlet in this simple client
serve that dependency and for the demo
we are just going to use this okay good
so with the Prometheus dependencies up
and running we can now go ahead and just
create let's make it a bit bigger our
counter here so API is very simple I
this is the the counter metric I'm
giving it a name HTTP requests total a
little help message so that we know
what's going on and then I'm going to
get give it only a single label name
pass which is like the rest where we are
calling and then I call register so
what's happening with register is the
Prometheus client library has a global
variable or like a static variable which
is a list of all metrics that are known
to the system okay and we
sister will just take this counter and
put it to the list and then later when
our reserved that goes ahead and exposes
the metrics the servant will just go
through the list and expose everything
it finds there and that way you can
basically just define metrics wherever
you like in your code as long as you
call register it will be in the list and
it will be included in the exported
format okay so and now that we have our
counter we can just go and say HTTP
request total with a label value slash
members because that's the endpoint we
are in standing right now increment okay
so it's fairly easy nothing
nothing fancy here if we want to try it
of course we need to configure our
servlet because otherwise we don't see
much so we can do this old-school with
web.xml there are more modern ways I
don't know
web so this is very simple I'm just
going to say I'm taking this servlet
implementation the metric servlet that
comes from the mailing dependency I
include it and I'm going to map this
server to an endpoint slash metrics okay
so let's try this let's just quit our
previous example so that we don't get
any port conflicts and example one so
this is a little shell alias what it's
going to do it's going to compile the
kitchen sink application to a war file
and then start a new white flight
instance and deploy it there okay and
while white flight is starting up maybe
a few words about about this one here
this actually works it's also okay like
if you have production only code but
it's not very good coding style okay
because what happens now I mean if you
just want to use your code that way it's
nice but if you want to write a unit
test for example and you want to create
a rest service instance for testing and
you don't want to have the counter there
or you want to replace the counter with
a mock object or so this will be very
difficult to do because it's really hard
right now if you create a private static
final variable here okay so what you
usually would do in a like real world
application probably you would create
your counter somewhere else in some
applications copying or so and you
dependency injection to have it
available here and then you can also
replace it with mock objects for testing
and so on so you can structure it more
nicely but for the sake of the demo like
from the functionality point of view
it's the same okay
so white flares up and running and what
we see now we can access our endpoint
again still responding with the same
response so we don't see much actually
but if we go now to port 8080 and the
the slash metrics endpoint we see that
we have so this is the exporter format
that the Prometheus server can
understand and we have our metric here
with that name and that label and the
value of one okay if we reload the
endpoint we load this then the value now
is 2 okay so this is nice very
straightforward this nothing interesting
or nothing special about instrumenting
Java vet applications when you can just
put some metrics into your code however
sometimes you need to monitor things
where you are not allowed to do this
okay not everybody who has to monitor an
application can just add some mailing
dependencies and throw some metrics into
the code somewhere okay so one
technology that you can use to actually
do this thing if you cannot modify the
code is you can write your own Java
agent so this is what I'm going to show
you now the wrong one this one okay
what's a Java agent so Java agents
actually are nothing new they have been
around for a very long time in Java okay
and a Java agent is basically a HR file
which is pretty similar to an executable
jar regular to Java file that you can
execute and what you do with an agent
jar you can attach it to a java virtual
machine okay so when you start a Java
program you can use a special command
line parameter called - Java agent and
then it has the pass through the agent
jar and if you use this your agent jar
will be attached to your JVM and
whenever classes are loaded in the JVM
the agent will jump in and has the
opportunity to modify the the bytecode
that is loaded on the flight so we will
see in a minute how this works okay so
how does an agent look like it's very
similar to an executable jar but just
the same way as an executable jar has a
main method that's like the entry point
to the application an agent has a pre
main method and this is executed before
the actual main method of the java
application okay and what does the pre
man method - it has two parameters the
first one here is just to pass
command-line arguments in it's not very
interesting interesting one is the
second here this instrumentation object
that the JVM gives you and what you can
do with it you can call add clad
transformer to register a class file
transformer okay what's that class file
transformer is actually a functional
interface so I could use a lambda
expression here if I liked okay that's
just one method it's called transform it
has a whole bunch of parameters but the
interesting one is the last one here
it's this class file buffer so what
happens is whenever a class is loaded in
the JVM of course the the class loader
reads the contents of the dot class file
which is the bytecode defining the class
and then before the JVM goes ahead and
interprets the bytecode and actually
creates the class the unmodified
bytecode as it is read from the class
file is passed through all agents that
are attached to the JVM okay so what you
can do now you could for example go
ahead and just return the class file
buffer here in that case your agent does
nothing it just passes on the bytecode
as it is but what else you can do you
can go ahead and say I'm going to create
my own right area with some modified
bytecode okay and then you have some
code to initialize that and then you
return this so what happens now whenever
a class is loaded in your JVM the JVM
does not actually see the bytecode that
is defined in the class file it sees the
bytecode that you return here and
this is interesting because this
provides you an opportunity to sneak in
some functionality that has not been
there in the original class okay and
we're going to use that to sneak in some
promises metrics into Java web
application that had didn't have
Prometheus metrics before as you can
imagine if you do it on a that low level
it's a bit error-prone because you know
you cannot really shift right arrays of
byte code around without having some
bugs and some weird errors so
fortunately you don't need to do it that
low-level there are libraries around
that have a bit more high level API that
help you doing these things okay and my
favorite library for doing these things
is called white buddy so instead of
writing this code you can use an agent
builder that's provided by white buddy
okay let's just import this this is a
static method this is also a static
method okay so and this is a very nice
library provides you a really readable
API for for implementing Java agents so
what you do is you use the byte by the
agent better then the first slide here
is type of a filter you tell byte body
which classes you want to instrument
okay so I'm going to instrument all
classes that have a super type named
Java X servlet servlet so what I guess
everybody knows what I serve that is OK
servlet it's an interface defined in the
service specification the interface has
among other things a method named
service and this method has two
parameters so that requests sir that
responds and this is involved like an
implementation of the serve that
interfaces involved whenever a Java
server handles HTTP requests ok so no
matter if you have rest with jax-rs
or so with jax-ws or JSP pages or
JavaServer faces it's all builds on top
of the service standard there's always a
servlet involved so if we sneak in our
metrics into all implementations of the
servlet interface chances are very good
that we capture everything that's
interesting ok and what are we going to
do we are going to instrument a method
named service ok and
going to instrument it with a and advice
which is called mo advice so what's an
advice let's look here advice is a bite
body concept so it's basically a Java
class with a bunch of static methods and
those methods are annotated with own
method enter and on method exit and what
will happen now when white body
instruments the the classes it will take
this code and copy it right to the
beginning of the servlet service method
and it will take this code and copy it
right to into an artificial finally
block of this service method okay so the
first code is executed right when we
enter any service certainly a service
method in any service implementation and
the other code is executed right before
we leave the method so let's try this
let's go to the right window here exam
so what this shell alias is doing it
will compile the code that I showed you
into an agent jar and then start a new
white fly instance with this - Java
agent command line parameter so the
agent jar gets attached to the white fly
server and then it will deploy the
unmodified kitchen sink application okay
so how do you create an agent jar this
is exactly the same as an executable jar
so I'm creating a fetcher here so jar
file with all dependencies included I'm
using the Malin assembly plug-in to do
so with the predefined Jarvis
dependencies deployment descriptor and
just like an executable jar has a
manifest file that defines what the main
class is we have the same manifest file
here and it defines what the pre main
class is okay and this is the class
implementing the pre main method okay
so exactly the same as an executable jar
okay so our server is up and running and
if we accept access our endpoint again
now we see okay there are so I wrote
this these messages to standard error so
we have some little red lines now
indicating that our agent is actually
attached and doing something when we run
some HTTP requests so this is
interesting so let's go ahead
make something useful with that so what
we can do now we can say we create our
counter again the same code that we used
when we actually implemented the
application here we are going to say we
take this counter and with a label value
we can actually read the path from the
servlet request here so we cast it to an
HTTP servlet request because we know in
the demo nothing else will happen and
then we call get passed info that gives
us the pass and we say increment okay
that's one little caveat this code will
be copied into the implementation of the
servlet interface and then the reference
to this variable will no longer be in
the demo a twice class okay this code
will be in the servlet implementation so
you actually need to make this public to
make this work okay and then of course
we need to expose our metrics somehow so
I could use a servlet again maybe create
an extra War file that's just there for
the purpose of deploying it next to our
application and making the metrics
available in order to say sometime I
will do a very quick hack I will just go
ahead here and start an additional HTTP
server just for the purpose of exporting
metrics so let's just learn import
everything in IntelliJ I don't know
where do I have to click so I can show
you in a minute what it is so actually
the Java Runtime comes with a built in
HTTP server I don't know if it's safe to
use that because it says come SunNet
whatever that means but it's included in
the Java Runtime you can start it here
on port 9300 which is an endpoint /
metrics and whenever this endpoint is
accessed we are going to say we go to
this collector registry which is the
global list of all metrics available
this is like this promises concept that
I was talking about and we just write
all metrics in that registry to the HTTP
exchange so we have a very simple
exporter server going on here and not
don't need extra war files to deploy
okay and let's not forget to actually
call this okay
so just at the end of the pre main
method
so let's run it actually the the code
that I showed you is really complete
which is cool so the only thing that I
didn't show you is in order to make this
work work with whitefly I'm setting an
environment where every variable called
Java ops ok I will show you in a minute
the contents of the Java apps and then
you have seen everything that's used
that's necessary to understand this to
really run this application at home so
to say so let's just go ahead and try if
things worked so we can access this
endpoint again we see our nice red
little lines here written to standard
errors or agent is attached to the
application and if we now go to port
9300 slash metrics yeah we see that our
metrics are exposed again ok so current
value is 1 if we just view this endpoint
again the value increases to 2 so this
is this is interesting this is say a
very powerful concept because you very
few lines of code you can actually write
agents that do like magic things that
most people are not really aware of that
you can actually do them and I used the
servlet interface and it as an example
here for the demo however in exactly the
same way you can also go ahead and
instrument standard JDBC interfaces and
then you learn about all sequel queries
going on from your server or instrument
whatever standard interfaces you would
like okay like thread tools in order to
know like the usage of your pools over
ever so it's fairly simple to implement
something like that with a bite buddy
okay so let's just the quick look at the
additive arts environment variable this
is actually say boss specific ok what
I'm doing here this whole code here that
I marked is actually the the contents of
this Java apps environment variable the
interesting things are of course I
specify the - Java agent here to attach
the agent
this port at the end is not used it's
just there because I copied it from
another example so that's basically
ignored and the other interesting thing
is this JBoss module system packages
okay
actually all classes that you put into
an agent jar are available through the
clit system class loader okay so when I
put like I built the fat jar and had my
promises client library and my demo
advice there and this should be
available in in in all classes because
it's propagated through the system class
loader
however Java EE servers do not use class
loaders in the way they are supposed to
be used okay Java EE application servers
block direct access to the system class
loader it's because they are supposed to
run multiple deployments and you don't
want to have conflicts and so on so what
Jay buss does in order to really make
the system class loader work you need to
explicitly list all packages that should
really be made available to the
application ok so what I'm doing here
I'm listing my prom agent where the MOR
twice is implemented and I'm listing the
from easiest client library of course
and that makes them available the way
they actually should be available and
then things work ok but you need to do
this if you run this in white flight so
where can you go from here if you
actually go to this domain from agent
dot IO you'll find my little type
project or like like the the code that I
used to learn about these things and
what I did then I did an experiment
instead of listing all packages there
that you need you can also say ok you
just create a single package and within
that package you create your own class
loader and that class loader goes ahead
and then loads all other dependencies ok
it's not really needed if you just if
you're only dependency is the promises
client library I mean then it would be
overkill and you can just do the same
thing that I showed in the demo but as
you gather more dependencies I guess at
some point it will become unfeasible to
just list all packages that you need and
then writing your own class loader and
coding loading the depend
see yourself is the way to go okay what
else I mean there are a few tricky
things for example sometimes one servlet
calls another servlet in that case this
counter would count a single request
twice you can use for example to read
locals to mark in the current set that
you have actually seen the request and
then when another servlet is called you
just look up in the threat local learn
okay it's already been registered so I'm
skipping this so you can like this
little tweaks here and there that you
need to do but basically I mean if
basically you can't go very far with
just a few lines of code that I just
showed you okay so that's it for my
half-an-hour talk there are three
minutes left actually so I can take a
question so okay ah there the question
was where do I configure the URL and
okay I shut down the promises server so
the the docker containers can vary did
it so I cannot show you but I can tell
you there are is more than one way how
to configure a previous server okay the
simplest today that I did is there is a
Yama file where you just list all
endpoints that you want to monitor and
this is good for simple scenarios okay
this does not scale if you have dynamic
services running in kubernetes and so on
because then you don't have constant end
points and then Prometheus comes with a
lot of like service discovery mechanisms
that you can use to like it has tight
integration with kubernetes so it can
learn from the Kuban ettus master where
your service endpoints are and so on so
this is all like Prometheus is very
power powerful with this but for the
demo I just configured it in a Yama file
set it's on localhost / fort 9300 okay
good maybe one small question 60 seconds
okay so thank you this one
yeah
the the question is okay the question is
in the demo advice class I changed this
to public but I didn't write the full
reference here like like this the answer
is because the the bytecode of this here
and the bytecode of this here is the
same okay and right body does the
instrumentation after this class is
compiled it takes the compiled class
code and then a bytecode and puts that
into the classes class to be
instrumented and after compilation it
doesn't matter if you put the reference
there or not
okay so good thank you very much for
listening have a great day box and good
