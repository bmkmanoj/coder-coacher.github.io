have two rooms of people of for the key
not for this welcome and the key not so
because this room was not enough to
welcome all the attorneys so we have
prepared the second room from five there
are still few seats three here but maybe
somebody is already there so hello
everybody and welcome also in the other
room so first of all health lishui
common I Drive with my best light headed
solver the rich to the second edition of
vox Dei Jewish we are very happy about
this conference and we would like us to
repeat what we explained it last year
and what is vox Dei is because we think
we are a little bit different than many
other conferences in box days is a
network of international conferences
happening now all around the world there
will be also Vox a Singapore this year
box is also a website where many
developers writes a lot of technical
articles and share their knowledge in an
open end without advertisement yeah and
it's a community of people and that's
also an important point for us that we
feel and we collaborate each other all
together this is really something
important in at an international level
and the second point is that it's really
done by developers so we are not
conference organizers we are not even
managers that not such an expert's we
are trying to do our best and we hope
you are happy with what we have but we
have developers first of all and we try
to do this for developers our name L
audience and targets are developers we
try with rocks to be cross technology
and so we welcome talks and speeches
from many different
fix because today is normal to speak
about polyglot easel in the programming
world and we all of us often switch from
one language or from one framework to
another one what is important in these
conferences and you will see today is
the content the content of the toast is
what all of us came to select the best
ones so that you all are happy and
that's the point for box days just to
explain you why we think it's important
to have a conference driven by
developers so the first point is we all
know many developers and many developers
in their free time contribute to open
source project and these movement in
these energies you all what many of you
spent we would like to promote and to
share this across each other so also the
sharing part is very very important to
us and then in our case we try to B's
resonate it's like our goal is to
promote the sweetness and the
competencies we have increased in
Switzerland about development in the
software skills that we have here
another thing that we really love about
the developers is that the developers of
the people who does in the liver and we
really think this is one of the most
important pieces in the software
industry we don't like too many words
and planning we like to deliver
something yet another very important
point for us is that not only we are
supported by developers but we are
supported by companies that understand
this philosophy and really we have to
thank all those amazing sponsors they're
really doing a lot of efforts to support
all of us in to make these conference
possible thank you very much the
sponsors it's all over there thank you
so yes about the conference is the most
important think of the conference of
course of the speakers and I fully we
put together a great speaker line-up to
Sierra should say that because among I'm
among them but except to me I believe we
really put together a great speaker
line-up so I also want to say thank you
to the program committee that happened
me to choose the the tools and it has
been a very long and very hard
discussion because we had the lots of
Greta proposal and we had to give up to
some very interesting thoughts but you
know time is limited and I also want to
say thank you to all the volunteers that
ipad us to put together the venue and
and everything you will enjoy today
correctly thank you thank you thank you
really quickly really need a lot of
support during the world asia and we
hope we do it so what I would like to
try to do now is to see if we maintain
our promises what we promised last year
because last year we explicitly
mentioned at that our goal our first
goal is to have fun to make the
developers happy to have a happy geek so
this day you spend here obviously you
will learn a lot of things for your
company for your work but it has to be
fun otherwise it's really just too much
and not a little bit boring from the
feedbacks we got last year we reach the
goal so thank you and we hope to confirm
it one of the most appreciated things
was fierce and we have the deers against
easier at the end of the day so if you
can cancel the inflation challenge
the second promise was to make more than
40 sessions we will not do 40 sessions
here injuries what happen it is that we
have been called by the CERN guys and
easier we will do rocked a storage and
dock station in next Saturday so we are
going bigger but in two different
locations that that is the way for us to
maintain a the promise and in fact what
we see now is that work days in
Switzerland we have the only country
having already three doc days hi mark we
have Pacino's in three years julie is
the second year and then for this year
we have CERN and now in Zurich this year
we are we have 394 attendees that is
quite a big improvement from last year
and we hope the trend continues and it
means we will have almost or more than
1,000 attendees in Switzerland this year
business a great thing the last problem
is we made last year was there all
circuits to bring also in the German
speaking part of it on the rocks for
kids and then very very happy to
announce that we had it we have
organized we are going to organize is
rich the 26 of August the first level
for kids English and we will do three
workshops with 60 kids that's the plan
10 to 15 years old so if you have kids
in this H just bring them we got the
support from University of Zurich they
will offer us the location and
everything is already reserved for us
and we got the support of two big and
important sponsors that we really want
to thank the fist post in which major
foundation are the main sponsors of this
event already without having organized
it yet but they really trust in us and
they gave us the support and we really
would like to thank them for this so
please join the event
it is really really fun thank you if you
want you can also contribute so we are
still choosing the workshop so if you
have ideas and you have want to have fun
with kids just do it come if you want to
be volunteer during the day or if your
company want to sponsor this event we
will do something better for the kids so
Andy's everything is no profit and for
the kids so everybody is a volunteer
during that day yeah thank you okay so
some political stuff you have the Wi-Fi
username episodes on your badge and
those session will be recorded and will
be publishing the online apps i believe
next week or the food in a few days
anyway after marking mapping scheme of
we will have a quick breakfast and then
we will start with the widow session and
as promises that way we left the bees
and alpha 7r up at five in this console
area there will be a few sponsor giving
prizes and we have our limited numbers
of t-shirts so if you want your own
t-shirt take it at the end of the
conference on the entrance of the way
okay last finger please help us to
understand what you are enjoying what
you like what you don't so Twitter with
our hashtag use the mobile app to give
feedback to the user so the name of the
mobile app t here is my boxes so look
for it and download it before android
and iOS or otherwise using our body
machine offered by ethan and little
enjoy let's welcome Martin of the Hamas
yeah
thank you
okay good morning everyone I want to
kind of open up here with our question
to begin with here is an interesting
statement oops that's is not working go
back to the old fashioned way this
question here a software system can best
be designed if testing is interlaced
with the design instead of being used
after the design who do we think said
that and when is it a recent thing is
this someone talking about TDD sort of
in the last of 10 20 years any ideas
which dakki at any one shot at a decade
think this was said 70s good any 60s
yeah we got some people here thinking
the right way this was nineteen sixty
eight by Alan Perlis an interesting I
want to go back and look a little bit of
our history because we forget a lot of
our history and we also think
interesting about do we do computer
science do we do engineering what can we
do for ourselves the people know who
Alan Perlis is people anyone heard of
the cheering award a I forgot a few
people heard of that Alan is the first
recipient of the turing award way and
we're back in 1966 in many ways he's
been known as the father of computer
science he done a lot of fundamental
work on compilers and the first-ever
parallel programming so it's cool really
interesting history in our subject and
menaces don't understand it we tend to
go forward we tend to hack software we
tend to have a bit of fun with it we can
to build stuff that looks a bit like
this at times I love collecting
interesting pictures of internet and so
this example this is Russia Russia
doesn't have a monopoly on this my own
country dispersive huge what I drove it
is so much for safety I was going in
Australia last year they're pretty good
at it too so what do we do when we hack
every day probably a bit of that so kind
of interest and it gets all the
engineers all we solve for people are we
just hackers are we whatever but it's
kind of interesting how we're looking at
some of this like they like to software
we have now in things is getting scary
but this is talking about how much
software there is inside some of our
latest cars like 10 times more than you
get in f-22 Raptor which is a the latest
fighter we can get like way way more
than ever was on the space shuttle in
fact even Mercedes brag about this
they're talking about high it's got 250
times more code in this then there was
an original space shuttle hey this is
not good we drive around in these things
and it's kind of scary because we know
what software can do like the new Tesla
is now over 350 million lines of code
who thinks that's bug free iPhone it
terrifying working on any project with
more about 10,000 lines of code and
that's kind of typical most people
there's a lot of studies that show that
we really as humans don't feel very well
with code there's more than about 10,000
lines we just can't fit it in our heads
we can understand that we can't deal
with it so we're kind of working this
out as we go another way I look at it
it's like how many generations of
programmers do we have when you start
thinking about it exuma buddy how many
second-generation programmers do we have
we even have any third generation
programmers I I can't see in this room
soon laughs people to put up their hands
but I was only net to third generation
programmers so far they were really
impressive individuals and there's
something that happens remember we
passed on from generation to generation
what we learned what kind of very much
in the early days of this but kind of
working it out as we go anybody's
involved in any of these standards
iso 9001 20 701 capability maturity
model I get involved in a lot of us for
the stuff in the 1990s I've been writing
us off for a fur while now but so we
went from having the
well-documented that's basically
what happened with it we weren't better
at it we just had a paper trail for it
that's all when you hit a balloon we get
into this blame culture which is part of
the problem as well I think we need to
get better ought to put in a sort of see
if ur better way the way I like to think
about it is we're kind of living in the
era of sulphur alchemy back into the
1600 we do in physics alchemy was a
really big thing like most people will
have heard of Isaac Newton but many
people don't realize that he was one of
the biggest alchemists in history that
he wanted to turn led in the gold as
much as everyone else did because it
would kind of work this out we're
looking for the silver bullet what are
we doing in software how do we get
better I want to explore the subject of
engineering the adhan computer science
degree by background I spend a lot of
time and engineering department and I
think what we are doing now should be
engineering there's a lot of debate is
it a craft as it as sciences and
engineering whatever but let's explore
the history of engineering let's see if
it fits with us let's see if we can
learn anything from it so the history of
the term originally Latin and we're
talking about cleverness or devising
things this is the sort of origin
offered the first example of find is
back about 1300 s from French and it's
did it with someone who operates an
engine we're talking about a military
machine catapults things like that this
is where the word engineering comes from
an engineer from that sort of thing
later on we introduced the concept of a
civil engineer because a civil engineer
was someone who did engineering that
wasn't military because everything was
military for a long time if one decide
things of history but we drive forward
technology through war more than all
there any other means they're almost is
so let's turn to the source of truth for
everything Wikipedia let's see what it
says about engineering does it fit with
how we see the world well Engineers was
work within constraints i program java
no stairs and c++ I feel very
constrained
I wish I could have more flexibility to
do what I wanted but let's look at what
some of these constraints are like what
available resources do you have like I
heard people talk about how to see some
people's code and people look like the
program like there a god where time is
infinite the memories infinite CPUs
infinite sorry it's not we're
constrained we have to work within those
constraints and those constraints or
many forms not just physical but
imagination and technical this I think
is one of the biggest points of in June
which I think it's so applicable to us
it's we need to have flexibility for
future modifications and additions the
majority of time and by the majority I
mean pretty much all of it we spend time
modifying code even if you're on a
greenfield project the code that you're
writing today is probably modifying the
code that you wrote last week so writing
software that's easy to modify easy to
expand easy to build with is very much
key to doing a good job and that is
engineering outscore particularly what's
going to look at other constraints words
we're working on particularly i like
this concept of safety every other
engineering discipline cares about 50
and serviceability and dealing with
stuff like we need to think about these
things to what does this d mean so
things like the memory management
concurrence ate all of these things have
got serious impacts for safety and we
gotta be able to deal with the 50 in a
better way and by understanding these
constraints we can see how we can work
what are a limit or how we can move
forward so I'm starting to like this
concept of engineering as an idea I
think it does fit a lot with what we
want to do and maybe we should be
inspired a bit by other engineering
disciplines what did albert einstein
have to say about engineering since
we're here in switzerland if scientists
investigate what is already there but
engineers careered what has never been
that is very much what we do we create
this new future I the things we're
developing and software how key software
is to the world is so much about
creating the future in many ways I
remember Alan kerr saying that the best
way to predict the future is actually to
invent it we're driving a lot of us
forward so we're software
Engineering fit into their sector that
was engineering in general well the
first ever reference the software
engineering that can be fined is back in
this paper 1967 and the term software
engineers first coined at this point and
how we move forward how we get better it
was popularized by this great woman this
is woman is Margaret Hamilton she led a
lot of development on the Apollo
missions give us amazing things like
priority scheduling to the testing in
certain ways sort of get complete
end-to-end testing human in the loop a
lot of these things all come from her we
don't realize the great work that's been
done on our history I happen to have
worked with some people from NASA and
they're amazing particularly had to
focus on safety and correctness and
getting as well a lot of this comes from
her she did some really really great
work in this area well the ball I want
to talk about for a second is in 1968
whenever that comment was made by Alan J
perlis about how we should be doing
testing interlaced with the development
came apart I came about from this
conference that was held in Germany at
this point the idea was NATO got a bunch
of their baths all four people together
to discuss how do we get better at this
this software thing is getting really
important how can we do it better and
over in three days the great thing about
this is it was minuted and it was all
captured and you can read it in this
document it's worth going back and
reading this it's is a really really
interesting part of history but let's
pull out a few choice quotes from this I
think it's really good to review that
this the designs process should be an
iterative one flowchart until you think
you understand the problem write code
until you realize that you don't go back
we do the flowchart write some more code
and edit till you feel you've got the
correct solution this is iterative
development 1968 why did it take off so
long beating our heads against waterfall
when the best people in the world will
do an iterative work in the 60s it's
good we don't learn i think we're not
really winning the intelligent it sort
of category at the moment took in this
so it's another one
reliability really is a design issue you
can't add it in and this is this is a
kind of example of how many things that
we do that are quality of service like
security performance reliability all we
call the quality attributes and
architecture design is you have to put
them into the requirements they have to
be an upfront concern you can't add them
on later if anybody ever try to add
security to a system that it wasn't
thought about up front it's a complete
nightmare I love their point at the end
like if you don't do this you might as
well give up and can appoint not some
very interesting things here's another
great one the good systems that are
presently working written like small
groups more than 20 programmers working
on a project is usually disastrous has
that changed fifty years later I think
we're still in the same point our how to
approach software well let's begin with
skeleton coding rather than a minha
finish code the first forty six steps
should be aimed at exploring so
interfaces sizes are critical modules
complexity I could see if those modules
now some critical items should be
checked out don't put off the hard stuff
to the end I'm going to come back to
that one again this is one that sort of
been around a lot like how many people
have met architects who don't code I
think this is a great example going back
to then is there a gig another
interesting concept we could apply the
shoes in there forced to fly at you have
to maintain your wings by doing a number
of hours per month if you don't need a
routine your wings like sittin should
people who were senior still write a
number of lines of code promotes there's
a lot of very interesting things about
that I've seen organizations that have
debated this and the turned it around
and now everybody who works within the
technical part of a company must write
some code and it does really improve
things I've seen this elsewhere whenever
Disney was reshaped one of the things
they did it if you don't contribute to
the creative process you don't work
there anymore and a change that turned
it around they're trying to put in too
much bureaucracy trying to do things but
people who don't understand
success is very very difficult I think
this is really quite funny spits add in
some ways but many of the people who
designed so for referred to users of
them they and then we have the them and
off thing this happens a lot most of the
designers of software is manufacturing
think they do it for their own benefit
is what they're pointing out here likes
to do this for themselves not for their
customer I've got a simple term for this
is I see so many projects which people
are basically doing technical
masturbation they're doing it for
themselves is self-gratification it's
not for the customer it's not doing the
right thing and this is actually so much
more prevalent than we think we need to
be aware of these things and how we deal
with them like estimation is another
great example of their showed so this
was from building the first three
Fortran compilers this is a really
really capable team first go the head
out there are out by a factor of two as
they built the second generation this is
the same team working with refined
practices doing something that they
already knew how to do there is still
overrun the overrun by thirty-six
percent on the second go are painting on
the third go to started getting close to
it so what it shows is as humans we're
only good at doing estimation for
something we've previously done
unfortunately an awful lot of soft with
we write we have not done nothing before
so choose your house their estimation is
really really difficult to fit into this
so that's the NATO conference like I
really recommend you go off and read
that paper it's wonderful and full of
gems like that one of the other people
who was at that conference has also done
some interesting riding on this and he's
another cheerin Award winner and that's
Dykstra he also me at this point that
how we teach computer science has got
some serious issues I read a lot of
Dijkstra's work and I'm kind of mixed on
it I like some of what he's got to say
anything some of that's also a bit
extreme maybe I'm just too liberal with
it and then I don't respect this extreme
stuff but there's some very interesting
points in it they here's a grid paper he
wrote on the cruelty of really teaching
computer science
in this paper you put that a couple of
interesting concepts one of them is this
idea of radical novelty and I think this
is very key to what we do with computing
is so different to most of the things
that we do in history he talks about I
you've got to approach radical novelty
because it is so different you've got to
have a blank mine you've got to be
consciously refusing to try and link it
to anything else like the morn of the
most powerful techniques we have for
teaching is sort of metaphor analogy and
storytelling we want to relate it to
something else unfortunately things that
have a radical novelty to them they feel
badly when you compare them to other
things because they're so different and
this is where we fall down quite a lot
he gives examples of how anybody has
ever learned quantum mechanics knows
what they're talking about so if you
study physics use quantum mechanics the
radical novelty it's so different so if
you go back things like relativity
quantum mechanics or examples of us to
go forward things like the atomic bomb
or the contraceptive pill he pointed out
that these things are so radically
different and so novel that you actually
change the foundations of how people
approach things you can end up changing
religion you can change stare chicken
teams governments off it's tough because
it is so different they don't existing
systems don't know how to deal with it
we are now seeing this globally at the
moment we're by our access to
information the internet how we're using
computing has created a new form of
radical novelty that we're wrestling the
people to try and deal with and how we
work it out so how do we work with this
how do we deal with these things that
are just so radically novel and what are
the major points to pull out Dykstra
said here there's a few things in it for
him one of them was that anything that's
a concept of this level as we got to be
able to decompose it we've got to divide
in rule and we got to be able to do
decomposition on an unprecedented scale
so we're looking at if we're going to be
great engineers what are the skills we
need to focus on how do we get better
well we got to get better at decomposing
these complex problems if you're working
on a vehicle that's got 350 million
lines of code
how do we decompose that problem so we
can even remotely understand what's
going on so that's one thing to grapple
with the other thing to grapple with is
the complication of changes never in
human history have we had the keys were
by such a small change can have such a
big impact like you change a single bit
in code and you can cause the entire
thing to catastrophic we feel we don't
have examples of that elsewhere it's
such a different thing that we have to
deal with so if we look at these as
problems like how do we learn from this
how do we go forward well I find
fundamentally we're all a product of her
own experience so I studied computer
science at university but I also took a
few minors as electives and one of them
was behavioral psychology I think it's a
fascinating subject that people really
should understand and very applicable to
almost most things and what you learn
from a lot of thought is there's a
nature and nurture but fundamentally
we're a product of her own experiences
who we r becomes like what we experience
is how we learn that forms and shapes
who we are so if we apply some of that
thinking how can we get better so
thinking about how we get better I've
worked with lots of software companies
and I find there's one very
uncomfortable truths that you keep
finding it we have lots of processes
lots of ways of working but in most
organizations I see usually the majority
of the work that makes the major change
is done by one or a very small number of
people often working outside of the
process they're not fitting in with that
what did they do that's different how do
we learn from them this is something
that we're wrestling with back in 60 it
was talked about in that NATO conference
so what I want to turn a break down a
little bit off so what the some of these
individuals do what does some people do
that the observe that do things really
well and what did their focus on and
let's focus on the learning I want to
focus on three things they go what
should we learn this applicable in our
industry what can we learn that and how
do we go about the learning process
itself so let's start off with that what
should we learn
quick drink of water first so can I
interestingly I find out go to the data
structure is a fascinating subject and
if you've been following twitter over
the last few days there's an interesting
mean going around device that we don't
really need to know so much about
algorithms and data structures that's
what the implication is Saudi heated
said that the whole thing of going into
an interview and on a whiteboard having
to write a bubble sort that's a really
good example of how we should badly
interview people because people don't
naturally work in that environment but I
think this in there's a danger here and
how people take things too literally and
too much of a problem like so our
algorithms and data structures a good
thing to learn or not to learn all that
kind of argue this two ways you can look
at them one is are you a writer or
designer a creator of algorithms and
data structures are all you a consumer
of all the rhythms and data structures
and are you a good consumer so knowing
what are the available algorithms and
data structures that are out there I'm
picking the right ones in your dad at
their jobs that you're choosing the
right way to represent a relationship
choosing the right way to represent data
it's very different from knowing how to
write one say knowing about the
different types trees versus writing a
new tree from scratch if you're an
engineer in almost any discipline you
know the fundamentals so if I'm asked an
engineer that's working with buildings
and in structural engineering I know the
materials I can apply I know the
compression strength of concrete I know
the torsional strength of steel I know
highwood will behave over time doesn't
mean I go a neck wood or an egg concrete
but knowing those things now some people
may choose to go off and do the material
fans and make those things that's all
good as well some people choose that not
everyone but if you're going to be an
engineer you need to know how to consume
these things and I'll find that over 25
years of professionally programming an
even longer of just writing sulfur for
fun any work I've ever done
understanding algorithms and data
structures is still applicable stuff
that I learned about how maps and trees
and sorts and also to say
that I learned back in the nineteen
eighties still apply and I can use them
sort of quite regularly in my job the
fact that i learned to use weblogic 4.3
back 17 years ago sorry that's just gone
at the back of my brain of no use
anymore at all so they go what is the
useful things that we need going forward
I I unfortunately corrupted my brain
with the early days of egfp and ejb home
and stuff like that still comes and
haunts me the abominations that we
created its back then so what does a
good stuff what's a good stuff we need
to learn and we need to keep so Oh
Kenneth would argue spend some time
studying algorithms and data structures
there's some queer things to learn to
become at least a good consumer of them
but i think what mud is much more
important which i don't see so much to
be at about it designed fundamentals now
the design fundamentals what i'm talking
about here is understanding coupling
cohesion separation the concerns single
responsibility principle these things
are so key to writing good software
that's meant a nobleman adoptable
flexible understandable so it decomposes
correctly you don't see people
practicing these skills on a daily basis
you should be like when you look at an
air p I what are the coupling concerns
of that API what is the house should
something be cohesive you start looking
at code you go yeah that's an obvious
tryn rack this dot this dot this this
it's like doing lost a meteor tell them
to ask sort of all those two things like
knowing these things knowing how to
apply them becomes really really
critical so they just take something
like coupling so here's heard of
kinesins very few hands kinesins is how
we describe coupling an object-oriented
design it's quite a large body of work
it's really interesting yet most people
don't fundamentally know these things
they probably know the latest thing
about spring boot or whatever and sorry
in three years time that will matter
anywhere yet we don't learn the
fundamental so if we will come engineers
we need to get much better and we need
to get much more precise about these
sorts of things like if I walk up to a
chemist and i said i would like to I'd
like you to help me do a titration
people will know exactly
what I mean if you're a chemist if I
walk up to someone and say let's work on
this code it needs to be refactored nice
that may seem like a simple thing but
you do me is that that statement to some
people will mean precisely what it
should mean is that refactoring is a
behavioral preserving change is that the
tests would still just pass and you've
changed the code to be easier to work
with through to I like to use the term
refurbishment is where they'll kind of
change quite a bit of it and reshape it
and it will be different the behavior
isn't preserved it will change right
through a complete rewrite but people
will use the term refactoring and mean
all sorts of things along that scale
we're not very mature yet as an industry
dealing with this so they think it off
the fundamentals you know what do we do
every day when we start looking at code
also let's get caught in a rut think
about different programming paradigms
but I spent the early parts of my career
writing a lot of procedural code i
started off an assembly then i
discovered see you never wow this is
brilliant making a function call without
all that overhead of setting it a lot of
myself it was so nice an indie discover
things like object orientation and that
was great for encapsulation and dealing
with polymorphism and different things
it's kind of cool I never done that for
a really long time and I noticed that I
was uncomfortable with it and I started
doing a lot of things and stealing ideas
from small talk and whatnot and then
after a while someone pointed out to me
as I see pretty much writing functional
code but it's kind of interesting to go
study some of these things and so you go
off and you kind of formally learn some
of it and it really helps like learn
other paradigms really helps you think
differently about a problem so some of
the people I've worked with from NASA
one of the things that they've taught me
is approached your testing with a
different mindset in a different
paradigm than what you're developing the
code with so for example if you're going
to develop cody's an object orientation
how about approach your task for formal
specification you have to think
differently it's not the formal
specification is the best way to do it
it's a different way write your tests
and object-oriented wear and test
functional code you can do all sorts of
really interesting things to think of it
a problem from different perspective it
uses different part to your brilliant
let you see the model in
interesting ways and that will we get a
deeper understanding of things so don't
be shy to go and learn stuff all right I
find the number of people who have put
set theory at arm's length for far too
long absolutely terrifying so within
object-oriented we've been using ORM
switch I'll sort of near my flag up here
is in I think it's an abomination it's
like there's a database it's a perfectly
good thing learn how it works and use it
correctly and don't get out of true noir
and which is just an abomination in the
way it's like entering a three-legged
risk with two different species trying
to run together I get them working
together doing the right things that
they know how to do and the strikes just
says we got to get back this
decomposition and abstraction think
about what it really means but think
about what it truly means for
decomposition abstraction like to be
composed by data decompose like function
decomposed by behavior there's lots of
different ways we start looking at that
start dealing with it I look at what
abstraction truly means like whenever we
do introduce types are they really
making a concept more precise more
dispels rather than just putting it in
and building a cathedral if there's one
subject I wish I had studied more at
school is mathematics and I keep finding
it is an incredibly useful subject and I
think that the problem that we see is
that most people just don't feel with it
enough to learn enough from it and it's
kind of fundamental like if you're doing
anything with sad serious first-order
predicate calculus like learning with
some of these things are how do we deal
with it we understand deeper
understanding and it doesn't mean you
have to go like to really grow adapt to
adjust the fundamentals so for example
as we start to go more and more parallel
we're going to hit the problem off we
can't go faster we can scale up in the
same way so you've got a look on tasks
and instructions and work out how to
make them commutative how do we make
them associative like these are basic
concepts of mathematics but allows us to
swap orders that allows us to swap
groupings that likes us get more
progress in a parallel sense if you
start running off into the Java world
using Java streams and you didn't
understand some of the fundamentals of
that you will not get good throughput it
will not scale up
very well and so you get hit with that
so it's really worthwhile but kind of
woman the key subjects i think is
communications we're moving to a very
distributed and very concurrent world so
we need to understand good protocols of
interaction so the protocols we have
between our own micro services between
our components even we have within a
system how do they interact like does
the design fundamentals get respected
here of coupling cohesion separation of
concerns all of those sort of good
things and the protocols themselves
start to really matter so an example if
I go what is the protocol well it's not
google protocol buffers sorry that is
completely miss named and this is
another problem we have of our industry
a protocol is not Jesus in it is not
something like Google protocol buffers
they are Kodak's there are less encoding
and decoding data a protocol is a series
of messages that allows you have a
treatment and etiquette between two
different components so a protocol for
dealing with a file as a simple example
is you must open a file followed by one
or more read and write operations
followed by a closed operation that's
the protocol with which you deal with
something it starts to become important
and this is not just that a technical
level it's also really important at a
human level like we have to work with
customers we got to understand their
demands we got to deal with all the sub
communication is so key so there's one
skill the highlight here is
communications is probably than one of
the major things you need to refine and
work on every day like be it your
interpersonal communication but also the
communication your software it reflects
things like you've heard of Conway's
laws like all software texts on the
structure of the organization that built
it so if you've got two different
compiler teams you'll get a two-pass
compiler not sort of stuff if you've got
a team that's good at communicating and
having good protocols between them
you'll see it reflected in the software
as well so you can almost reverse it in
different ways like we're kind of in
this interesting world where everyone
thinks with a bell monolith and non
lesser other really so if a
monolith is yet so if you can't build a
good long list so you're going to build
a whole pile of micro services
so what happens to when you
increase the surface area of it it
smells a lot more so just running into
microservices is not the answer
microservice is a grid but drive them
from design fundamentals like you're
choosing to do it because it's matching
some design fundamentals that you want
to achieve the county aware of that so
let's move on from where can we learn
well fundamentally we learned by
practice kids learn by play as we turn
into adults why not keep playing that's
let's enjoy what we do and practice to
practice the right things if you're in
any sort of discipline where safety is
important you drill you drill that under
pressure you do the right sort of thing
so every day we should be thinking about
our our practices enforcing good
behavior or the enforcing bad behavior
like are you being sloppy you ignoring
the tests are you just letting our red
bills continue for a long time what are
the practices that we approach the stuff
starts to become really important but so
consciously practice how we get better
how do we get these things going like so
how do we focus on the design
fundamentals and do it well we have to
work in teams and this is a good thing
and that's another great where that
people learn as humans are grit mimics
we learned from other people so one of
the best things you can do is work in
teams with other people you're going to
learn from people you enjoy working from
and so from a career perspective we
should see guide great places to work
one of the great things we have in this
industry is we have way more work than
we have people who are able to do it so
if you're in a dysfunctional environment
or you're not learning you're not
getting anything from it we can exercise
with their own two feet and go somewhere
that does we should work in environments
where we enjoy it we get something out
of it or we try to change it and good
for the better turn to do it in some
sort of a think about where you're
actively going work like if you wanted
to plan your career choose where you're
going to work is one of the best things
you can do for that you'll start going
the right way and there's one kind of
interesting strong point around this is
I I've managed the number teams have
been CTO a couple of times in a few firm
and one painful lesson I have learned
very very quickly is that don't work
with us holes it's a really simple thing
get them out of your team because
they're just damaging and dangerous and
they let me will be shy will be this
free of the deal with them it's much
easier to deal with / up a problem early
and deal with it as like good people
should communicate it they will go back
to that early sort of point is we got to
work and Conway's law shows us that
software will take on the organization
says you have built it if you've got a
difficult person that then you could
have a difficult piece of software
somewhere on a lot of miserable people
dealing with it so either help them
change or sort of mix and make the team
change and so that you take things
forward by you change the team or you
change the team now if you're running
the team there's something you can do
but if you're not in the team you're
going to running the team you can help
influence it from below or you can
ultimately go somewhere else we can't
always get access to all of the people
we want to so how do we learn in
otherwise well one of the wonderful
things we have is lots of great research
papers out there they can tell us so
much and help us learn from it there's
been so much said about this I'm not
going to really add to it anymore other
than sort of encourage the point it's
just great to go read stuff whenever you
go into a new area and you don't know it
and you can't get information feel free
to go read papers on it but also read
code I think the open source movement is
one of the greatest things we've done
for our industry because if you're in
almost any other discipline one of the
best ways to learners learn from the
work of other people like Stephen King
was once asked he's a famous writer at
how do you get better at writing books
and his answer was really simple as we'd
other books read other good work by
having good software out there that we
can read we can learn from it and that's
what we should do regular should be
radiant code and reading as much as we
can do with your colleagues code do code
reviews do feedback do them in a really
healthy positive where code review
shouldn't be about sort of anything
negative they're actually a great
learning experience for everybody all
right and treat them not wear and sort
of think about her
we should also think about it's going to
learn something and you don't know
something on a project the hard stuff do
it up front there's a number of really
good reasons for that is by doing
something up front is you'll start to
refine your estimates much quicker but
you'll also get much more time to go
through that learning process and
getting it right when we start something
new don't do all the easy stuff that you
already know down so you can easy do
that at the end and you can do that on
the pressure when you're rushing you
want to do the hard stuff up front when
you're fresh to you the most time to do
it and you get the ability for that to
back in and do it well and get the time
to do the second point all right point
I'm going to talk about it later but one
of the other things we can do is we can
also learn from online so this whole
nonsense about we get someone into a
room and we get them to write on a
whiteboard as part of an interview like
in their daily work we have access to
internet we have ideas we have also
degree of things we read stuff online
right if I go back to the early 90s and
remember interviews rolls asking people
to recall stuff like can you remember
how to do such and such with the advent
of the Internet those people are
completely redundant the ability to
recall doesn't matter anymore what's
important is can you read on their
information and tell whether it's good
tell whether it's applicable to what we
want to have that's the really really
important thing that's right there so
whenever you go on to stack overflow and
you're going to cut them pissed the
important thing is how you couldn't be
some the right thing how do you know
that it's good how do you know that it's
applicable so let's sort of explore that
topic a little bit but first up like if
we're going to learn one of the most
important things we need to be able to
learn is time we needed time to do that
and to get time what we have to do is
we've got to automate it as much as we
can because the hard stuff we want the
time to see it for that you'd only waste
in your daily time on the brain
repetitive stuff it's also error-prone
it's wrong it's got the driving the
wrong way we should be investing in see
I like this should not be a company
today that does not have CI I know
there's many do but it's just wrong if
we're going to come engineers I'm going
to do it right we gotta have this whole
automate it has to
work really well when we start learning
the most important thing to do is to
focus on the feedback cycles so when you
don't know something how do you get from
not knowing to knowing more in the
shortest possible path how do we get
this feedback cycle short that's
actually the fundamental of agile our
job is all about reducing the cycle time
and feedback cycles on stuff so we get
to find out much sooner rather than
putting stuff off a band focus on that
same as we play what's a dealer stuff we
got experiment we if you don't know
something be very comfortable saying you
don't know and create an experiment we
move forward but as we do experiments we
should measure we're going to measure
and do things in the right sort of way
and get the right sorts of answers but
whenever you do measure is one of the
very important things is about to be
followed good scientific honestly it's
so easy for us to fit data to a certain
belief system we need to try and divorce
ourselves from that there's some great
stories from Richard Feynman's work
particularly on the space shuttle
Challenger whenever that happened at the
Rogers report the commode it's another
great thing to go raid if you ever get
the chance and nearly dares the group
that was put together headed by Rogers
to find out what happened with the space
shuttle had Richard finding on Adele
said Neil Armstrong had a bunch of other
quite well known people on it and to
begin with Rogers wrote an interesting
note saying that Fineman is a pain in
the ass he just questions everything he
doesn't mess accept anything he is
always going against a lot of the rest
of the team but after a while would
Rogers come to learners he wasn't being
awkward he just realized that a lot of
other people were just trying to fit an
answer I'm trying to the right by the
end of it is report on fireman was he's
got the greatest scientific honesty of
anyone he ever met and that's it's quite
a rare thing so even if we do measure
experiment do all the right things as we
got to analyze the data but don't fool
ourselves like always ask oh my actually
feeling myself I trying to set the data
to the answer be comfortable with it's
not clear so to go and do it again
and probably the most important point
around how we change their behavior on a
day-to-day basis is this concept of
revisit and refine so look at an
interesting thing in how our brain works
we work in short-term memory and we have
long-term memory so if you go to do
something you're doing it all within
your short-term memory to begin with so
take a simple example is you write an
email you write that email and you go
and read the email back again straight
away you don't actually read the words
of the email you read what you think you
meant to write not what you've actually
written if you leave that go away and
come back again so maybe another dare do
another task or something come back
because that's not gone from your
short-term memory is you have to truly
reread again and by truly rereading is
you get to see what you've actually done
not what you thought you've done this
applies equally with code applies with
anything we do that's a creative
endeavor so when we plan and do our work
on a day-to-day basis we need to be
thinking about how do we plan the time
so you do something you leave it you'd
go do something else and you go back and
you read it again and you visit me
refine I keep finding that I can really
improve the quality of code like
following data as a simple pattern
you'll also have learned more things by
doing other stuff later go back and
revisit so you think about the waterfall
approach is actually designed to do the
worst possible job you can the iterative
stuff we need to take it much much
further not just that we doing lots of
many waterfalls is but we actually go
back and revisit and refine and do
proper refactoring and also be honest
with ourselves at times because that's
not good enough how do I make it better
I can we go forward what can I pull out
an interesting point here so having
worked with some of the NASA folks I
love one of the questions that one of
the guys Todd Montgomery I've worked
with a lot always asker's when you do
something is walking go wrong it's kind
of a bit of a problem that they have the
fierce and written the reality of it but
it's actually really important for us
like I've seen working on distributed
systems where so many people just assume
stuff always works
you get to work with some of these
people as they don't they assume that's
always going to feel it's a completely
different mindset and their code
appropriately their code would cease be
in mind to do that here's another grid
report that's worth reading it looks
into production outages of code and
beast upon the production additives are
investigated some root cause analysis to
see what some of the cases were there's
some really interesting stuff around
high 70 odd percent of them could easily
been caught by unit tests but one of the
most important things I think that
really stands out is twenty-five percent
of production outages but they studied
could have been dealt with if the error
was not ignored real errors were raised
and they were just ignored in many of
the cases there was an exception
blocking code with it to do call made in
it saying must fix this before
production that is real engineering when
you don't do those sorts of things
that's when you've been very how much
your versus doing the true engineering
so it's kind of bird on in mind but most
outages after human error are actually
how we handle errors most people just
ignore them so kind of getting this to
the end I but fundamentally we've got
this hugely complex problem we have a
war on complexity we need a fight we're
going to have cars for 350 million lines
of code or more and them we just can't
reason with that I think we need to
think much more along these lines it's
think about lines of code spent like you
don't measure an aircraft there by the
width you measured by what is capable
off and you want to keep the weight down
to an absolute minimum we're going to
think about how do we get lines of code
dine all right one of my favorite
measures on any given team that are
loaded via people on these lines of code
delete it delete the dad code the league
code all the time see if you can add
features and remove code so kind of
quickly in closing knife whoops it's
going to don't feel bad we're living in
this year of software alchemy we're like
the physics of the sixteen hundreds we
gotta work this art we've got to get
better at it we're going to make loss
from the stacks but hopefully we're
going to get better otter probably
quicker than the physicists did
because the world is so dependent on
software it's in everything we do now so
it's up to off to try and make it better
we've got to become what professionals
are become the engineers and it's a
really cool thing to do like we work in
one of the best industry that is out
there so don't create the do epic
 and I'm not thank you very much I
don't know if we have time for questions
are have you done coupla minutes do we
have any questions are we good for
breakfast I don't you dare him yeah I
can't see a thing here oh you don't
question for money oh yes so good
morning thank you for this a very
interesting talk another question thing
you mentioned this history about the way
to refine revisit all the time in the
70s or even before how come what it will
happen a very good question I I have the
personal theory I don't know how correct
it is I think we have a large number of
organizations who put their commercial
interests ahead of the interest of
developing good software I think the
perfect example of that was the move to
application containers I what we've seen
with like mts from Microsoft will be
seen with ejb and stuff from a lot of
that consortium because a lot of the
vendors wanted to sell a platform and it
rolls a lot of thought sort of stuff
it's like you can't sell very easily do
design fundamentals that's a skill that
we need to work on I think that's across
the craft that we need to do and the
problem is our industry is so driven by
large marketing budgets particularly
through the sort of 90s and 2000 onwards
that
it was driven by those corporations who
wanted to have their commercial
interests it would pretend they were
doing things sort of to help making good
sulfur but in reality they didn't I
loved one of the comments from the guy
who was key to our not weblogic
websphere eventually admitted that it
was all wrong and he shouldn't have gone
that way but it's going to put the
industry's push because that's how they
can make money if we could work out how
to make money from good software done
well to be very very different maybe we
got to see that a lot of these things
are much more long-term with Kenneth in
a world where everything's incredibly
short term we want instant gratification
so if there's not direct calls in a fact
I on the big fan of science and if you
look at the UK in the UK any investment
we have done in science has been the
greatest long-term investment ever for
the country yet we don't do enough of it
because it doesn't return this in
political cycle the theme is like when
you have got corporations who but
they're looking at their next quarter
the next annual return unless they get a
good result to run that we get things to
take note of thrown away and that's very
much a thing of like the bonus driven
culture and the corporate world that
drives out so that's my theory on what
is who knows what the actual truth is
yes thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
