really pleased to be joined by David
Alaba see David nice to see you here and
thanks for joining us
so you're here you've got a session
today tell us a bit about that so the
session that I have today is on FN
project which is a fast so a civilized
platform so was it clear we are known
that project last year eggs are one so
it's an open source polyglot container
based service platform so I'm going to
discuss how it works and we showed that
basically you can easily use it to write
a Java based function or go function or
coding function directly any kind of
function great stuff and I know a lot of
people will know you because of the work
in Enterprise Java and some people might
be a bit confused about what's happening
now because we've seen effectively Java
EE move over to eclipse foundation and
become open-source and there's a new
name there now with Jakari so can you
kind of maybe explain a little bit the
landscape there for us now okay I will
try to wake up so last summer Oracle has
announced its intention to open source
java because we basically wanted to
reboot out of Java at from evolve so we
want to make sure that the platform can
evolve more quickly and also adapt to
the market needs in a more agile way and
we also want to have something which is
really vendor independent so that's why
we wanted to go to an open source
foundation since then we have obviously
chosen that foundation that we Eclipse
Foundation and that effort used to be
known as even 4j because I mean we
needed at that time to have a name so
easy for J is really a project name that
is hosting hold that support and since
then there is a new name so if 4j still
remains but there is a new name which is
Jakarta eg and Jakarta is really the
brand name okay well the TV ID is that
we want to preserve something that we
had in Java ensures one of the key value
and that's that's come
so you have multiple implementation of
this specification and you basically can
t sleep ports your code from 1/2
applicated from one container to the
other because the container has passed a
bunch of tests that prove that they're
compliant so in Djakarta ee
we still want to have that so that means
effectively that the TCK and so
basically the teaching are the tests
that are used to test that combines the
TCK will be open source so there will be
a broad that will be donated to the
exits foundation and then the foundation
will define some kind of process to
enforce that comparative and once an
implementation as possible TCK whatever
the name of the test will be what let's
call them together now then that
basically means that this implementation
will be a Jakarta compatible
implementation yeah so is there anything
for developers out there working with
Java really or Jakarta really now is
there any anything that you you think
they most need to understand right now
about any of these changes so yeah they
are multiple things so the first first
thing is that we Forge a jacket ie so
the first really subjective ie we did
based on Java EE egg so you take Java 8
today that could basically be in a few
months from now what the initial release
of Java EE will be it's the same code
base so that basically mean that jacket
is starting from Java innocent then
something that people need to know is
the fact that we've basically started
that initiative months ago last summer
this is something that takes time
because it's not a small project I mean
there are a lot of underlying project
under the e4j umbrella like last fish
jersey majora blue TCK that will soon be
open source and so on so we are
effectively working on the Oracle side
and on the cube side to make sure that
this happen as quickly as possible there
are already a few repositories which
have been put on the
he forger side but it will still take us
a few weeks maybe months to get it there
so what we want to achieve I mean the
first milestone that we want to achieve
is all the older Java a coach would be
on the Eclipse Foundation side and
basically me that that will allows the
e4 j project to build a first
implementation that will have to pass
the Java is eight
TCK so we'll start from that this is
really the major milestone of commands
to get as soon as we can I know you see
once we have got that will prove that
everything can be built on the active
side so there is no dependency anymore
with anything that is Oracle led in
parallel we are working on defining how
we will evolve the different technology
about a part of the platform and then it
allows us to basically evoke the
platform so people still hear the Java
EE name still here jackassery they're
here AE 4j and that's a very good remark
so there's some conclusions regarding
Java EE and e4j or jacket.i so Java it
was not rebrand or renamed into jacket
IE I mean today we have to Java 88
product implementation such as GlassFish
we will soon upload logic and so on so
Java as a brand remains it doesn't
disappear it's only the revolution of
the platform that we now need done under
the Java EE brand
thank you very much if there is if
anybody is still confused about this
there was I know there are resources out
there that they can go to maybe you
could suggest a few places that people
can go and and and get get some more
knowledge so I would anyway if any any
man anyone whose interest is even
remotely about what's being done within
the Java space I wouldn't understand to
join the community we have to keep in
mind that there is Java EE but under the
visor out there there are a bunch of
project and bunch of API all those API
are moving so if any
is just using for example to jax-rs API
they should be engaged because of young
they will be able to define out repeat
all that API is evolving so the way they
can be engaged today is basically by
joining the mailing list on the reef
reject our community there are a lot of
discussion going on but I mean it's good
to see that the commenting is really
King or moving with the baton forward
perfect
David thank you very much for joining us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
