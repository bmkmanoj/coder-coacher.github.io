a little bit too pretentious with the
title which might result in not so many
people coming here of course in a Java
conference getting the best of
JavaScript and of Scala might not me
might not really give you a good first
impression but I'll try to convince you
nevertheless so I'm going to talk about
scarlet GS which is a dialect of Scala
that compares to the JavaScript platform
and when we mean Java platform it's
anything where our JavaScript runs so
that might be the browser but also note
reyes or AWS lambda or the command line
with nodes as well so pretty much pretty
much anywhere and to give you a feel of
what it means to develop in Scala dress
on on a daily basis I will basically do
a live coding session so this is about
my only slide I also have a concluding
slide but that's that's it okay so
without much further ado let's go to
well to my development environments
which is Eclipse one of the few
remaining people in the scala community
using eclipse and what we are going to
develop today is this simple memory game
also called also known as pairs and of
course for that I need to launch my
server
oops
so here's my simple server running okay
so it's basically this thing where
you're supposed to remember oh I got
lucky here and I have a score here and
basically that's it so first things
first let's fall back go to the last
commit with a good get reset hearts and
no good anymore there we go okay so I
intended to do a show of hands in the
Big O yeah if I clean up the lights I
can see you so let's see who among you
still uses or has ever used a language
that compiles to JavaScript and I was
not JavaScript's a a fair number of
people among you who used Scala is good
so you all knew some someone said okay
excellent so this is pretty much about
the smallest program we could write it
has a main method typical it gets the
documents creates a key element sets
some text content so as if you're
familiar with JavaScript this should be
fairly reminiscent of the Dom API and
for good cause it is the thumb API so if
i refresh this guy all I see is this
tiny hello which you might not even be
able to read okay so since I'm not
really a front-end developer myself I'm
going to follow up a tutorial because I
don't know how to write games so I used
this tutorial about phaser so phaser
which is a JavaScript library which is
intended to be used for for front-end
game development and I'm basically going
to follow this tutorial which was of
course written for JavaScript developers
and implement
in garages instead and we have 46
minutes left to do this so that is the
server parts and skipping it the HTML
part I have done as well because that's
boring here it comes
so apparently I have some some event
loop thing with a bunch of methods for
the lifecycle of the game preload create
updates
whatever that means I want to see the
code ah here some code okay so let's
let's copy this this so and so there it
seems and let's copy that
right here instead of my main methods of
course doesn't really like it because
that's JavaScript so here the system
there seems to be a class declaration so
let's move it here and fix up the type
errors so instead I'm going to have a
class game so of course that tutorial
was written in the ACMA scripts five
ever so classes are declared as
functions of prototypes but we prefer
actual classes and I'm going to declare
a preload method which is written this
unit which is kind of void in Java and
then I have three more play like this
create update and render yeah okay so
that part we translated I can remove it
and this guy should be indented okay so
now of course
yeah no semicolons in Scala and we
prefer immutable vowels most of the time
okay so now of course I'm supposed to
instantiate that class from phaser which
is that JavaScript library and Scala
being a statically typed language
doesn't really know about this thing so
it tells me yeah
the phaser is I don't know what this
thing here so we'll have to help it a
little bit and give it some information
about what what this JavaScript library
is so I'm going to create a phaser
objects in a subdirectory in sub package
and since that guy is going to declare a
bunch of things from the JavaScript
world I need to import the right tools
for this now I can say okay this this
phaser thing I'm not going to actually
implement it right here it's just some
some types and declarations from
something that's written in a native
JavaScript library and so I edit a tit
with @gs native and then I have some
additional stuff to declare the fact
that it's a this javascript object nor
the sky objects and also I need to tell
it where to find it it's native but well
is it well it's in the global namespace
so phaser just puts a global variable
named phaser and the in the global
environment of JavaScript and I'm
telling it there it is
okay so that should at least tell it
that yeah I need to import of course
this thing so I have phaser and score so
now it knows about phaser but not a not
about game so game apparently is a class
this it has a new constructor but let's
let's verify this so I have here the ID
API documentation of phaser and I'm
going to a little bit translate this API
which is given to me as a form of
documentation online and translated to
actual type declarations that colleges
can use so of course this library is
huge I don't want to spend 4 hours now
translating the entire API documentation
in the types and not getting any work
done right so I'm going to do that in a
very iterative way where I just declare
the parts that I need right now and then
continue on that's that's typically what
people do so it has a bunch of things
but from the tutorial I only need
apparently the fourth the first four so
I'm just going to use those and so this
one whoops
this one is of course also a native
class game and it has those parameters
but of course it's a typed language so I
guess width and height should be
integers renderer by the looks of it oh
it tells me here that's a number I guess
it is an int as well and a parent which
the documentation says is a string or an
HTML element but let's go for string
okay so that should let me instantiate
that thing
okay we're we're getting somewhere this
is of course not a corrects skaara
string so let's use car strings and now
it's still not quite happy with phaser
that auto which apparently is a constant
so let's declare it as a constant so
this is this guy apparently I'm giving
it renderer so it must be an int yes and
so there is a little bit of guessing
game at this point
because I'm using it just better which
is completely untyped following a
tutorial that was written for JavaScript
which is also untied and so of course
I'm trying to give a little bit of
guessing here but the good point is I'm
showing this right now because at some
point people want to call a JavaScript
library that nobody has written
bindings for but usually you just
imports library that someone else has
written bindings for so we don't
actually deal with that stuff all the
time
okay so I got a bit further this is I'm
going to complete basically that part
using all this manual stuff of doing
everything and after that I am just
copy-paste saying what I did before
because that's going to be really
annoying really fast so it seems that on
this game thing there is a state field
and from the documentation that I looked
at before it's basically a state manager
which is another class and that one has
some methods so we have here an ADD
methods which I think has your name
which is string and some some
constructor some class that that
represents the constructor in Java
Script and that that's a really
JavaScript if thing we don't really have
a type for this so I'm just going to use
J's dynamic which is just any JavaScript
thing that we don't actually statically
type we just leave it as dynamically
typed I should make that bigger okay and
the other one was tired so we have Toit
which also takes a name which is a
string and is also native and then this
should compile almost except that this
thing here so this is a caveat of Scala
is the fact that in JavaScript a class
is also a value it's the thing that you
can hold that you can give it somewhere
in Scala you have to
different things of the types and then
you have the objects in the classes type
but if the class is a Java class that
extends to your subject for example you
can just ask for its its value in
JavaScript using this this construct and
now it's just not happy with this guy
because I forgot that part okay that
should be good
similarly compiles everything okay
so that's my server running that's my
build tool being recompiling all the
time i save so you didn't really see it
doing anything but it compelled the
javascript file so all I need to do is
refresh and you we have a black
rectangle sound good
yay oh it's someone who plotted there
I'm really happy okay so so I seem to
notice there is not much of a culture of
questions during these talks but if you
feel like asking questions just shout
don't raise your hand because they're
all in black for me so I don't see you
but you can shout question I want so
good okay so let's move on to more
interesting things we can finally go
back to our tutorial here and go further
so here they're explaining a bit of
sense a bunch of things that I'm not
really interested in understanding what
I'm doing more I can get results so it's
good let's just focus on the code and
that permit there is this preload
function which seems like it's loading
some assets some files so let's copy
that and put it in our preload function
okay so of course it doesn't really like
it so I don't really like those
repetitions here so I'm going to use a
loop at instead but let's get back to
that after let's just first fix the
syntax because what is really annoying
and there we are okay so now we have
type errors of course because they start
load again is not declared but at this
point like I said it's going to be very
annoying for this life coding session to
repeatedly go inside my declarations and
add relevant things and anyway that's
not typically the experience that you
feel unless you're using some obscure
library that no one has written binding
for so I'm going to just take those I
wrote earlier and copy paste them here
Taron and now I have this load thing
here so now actually phaser it it takes
to a game instance and turn turns it
into a state so effectively
your class game can actually extend
phaser that states and it will then have
this things like loads and so this one
if I jump to definition it's right there
inside the abstract class states that
just declares what phaser is giving me
as tools in my in my state game okay
so that load is a loader that has an
image function that's I guess loads
images so I can use it like this it
seems to type check which is good but
now we had those two this thing here so
I'm going to just use a loop from 0
until 10
so until says from 0 included until 10
excluded so effectively from 0 to 9 and
I want to use either 2 string here and
here let me use a string comprehension
to get the oops the I so the dollar I
inside the string comprehension says
takes to the
of the variable I interned turns into
the string okay
so this probably doesn't do anything
because it loads assets so this is just
the same as before but since it's
JavaScript if something went wrong we
wouldn't know about it so let's just
actually look at the console seems
nothing's wrong it just says phaser with
love it's not very helpful okay so so
the nice thing here is I'm starting to
get some it's probably didn't show
really big I never understood how I was
supposed to enlarge to go to completion
box for presentations but I get these
type checks Auto completion from from my
IDE so I can just use those things even
in JavaScript and I get all the goodies
so that's quite nice I can also do
without this because in staccato like in
Java this is implied control to in Scala
in JavaScript so that's a little bit
nicer okay so let's go further and now
my tutorial is here so I think now we're
getting to the point where something is
going to show up on the screen which
would be nice yeah so it seems like
they're creating things so let's create
things I like copy-paste things create
okay so apparently there is there is
here a for loop in Java Script that's
very imperative it has a variable don't
really like variables if we can avoid
them so and anyway it's trying a penalty
to add two sprites to per I to per digit
from zero to two nine and that's of
course because in the Paris game you're
supposed to have to be three so instead
let's declare the numbers that we need
and that would be
zero until ten and a second
second time zero until ten so that thing
here would be a sequence of numbers so
that would be zero one two three and
inline concatenated with again zero one
two three one two three until nine so
that plus plus here is a concatenation
of arrays or sequences or whatever you
want to call them so now that I have my
numbers I can create my images so the
image is not sure fault would be
something like for each number I'm going
to need one sprites so I will have this
that game that adds that sprite
copying here zero zero and the key is
empty string plus I which is actually
number the two string is a little bit
better okay so here instead of doing
images that push and creating a mutable
collection and fill it in fill it in I'm
just using a for comprehension here
using the yields keywords which I mean
it's I'm going to lie a little bit here
but it basically execute this a bunch of
times for each number in this thing and
each time it gives you the result of
that expression and it will return you a
list with all these elements so now here
it says I have an index seek of phaser
that's right
so you can see that I'm not actually
writing any types most of the time
that's color type inference working for
you but I could as well so just for the
sake of it's like let's write here an
index seek a phaser dot sprite and it's
just it also died effects
it's a bit more explicit in this case
because a bit complicated so it's better
to follow okay then so I did that part
now I need to shuffle these images
apparently in the tutorial they provide
the shuffle function but SCADA has one
so let's reuse it so I'm going to take
the lips not that one you told Randall
shuffle of images not shuffled and yeah
I have a shuffled collections of my
images good ok so now it's that's the
placement part so let's - also a double
loop like this except that in Scala we
can combine names bit better arguably 0
and all 5 and so ok let's translate
things so I have items 5 plus J then I
have my cards so cards is the back of
the of the images so images is all the
Front's I'm also going to create so here
again they're creating the collection of
cards one at a time but I'd rather do it
in a functional way right from the start
so for each image in my images I'm all I
also want a another sprite which will be
also at 0 0 and it's key will always be
back so that's the back of the of the
car the one that shows the question Mike
we don't know what it is yet so now I
came to Valkyrie equals cards of index
and I can position it so I can tolerate
it's positioned that J times tire size
so I need of course to declare tire size
this is a constant and trust me it's 130
okay we're getting there I did size and
I think if we stop there we should see
something so let's for the sake of
making the presentation it's more lively
have a look at the code right results
right now yeah okay good so far any
questions no okay let's continue
so uncomment this so I also need to
position the the front card so images of
image images of index image that xj x
style size image why I tell size and the
front I wanted to be not visible and
then I also need to declare some some
events here because the force it needs
to be a little bit interactive so the
back of the card needs to accept inputs
it's an optimization from phaser let's
if sprites doesn't have input enabled to
true we will just bypass its in a bunch
of input related processing then there
is this events thing and I can say onion
put down that add so I'm just following
the codes from from here right and here
I have a listener which is a function
which takes no arguments and it's going
to do some things for now I don't know
quite what
should probably have the index of the
cart and I'm just going to declare it
right here so of course that should not
be visible to the outside so let's keep
it private
okay and then I have two more which is
events on input over so that one happens
when you put the mouse on top of the
sprite and here I'm going to use the
others and likes for functions that's a
little bit better when you have multi
and multi-line functions and in this
case I want that card to change its
alpha value to one point the to 0.5
which of course will have the FIA will
be halfway transparent when we put mouse
over it
and when the mouse exits it we want to
restore the Alpha value to one card five
holes one okay so now we should have
translated the whole of this guy so
let's remove it and hopefully we can
please see the over effect so I
refreshed virtually wasn't done
recompile now it is so now we have this
small effect here okay it's it's it's
basically all type checks so far so you
can see that now that we actually have a
declaration for those for that fazer
library which is interact with it just
as it I mean with like with any other
Scala or Java or library and we get all
the good features of the of the editor
okay so I basically now we're on for the
real parts of the I mean the game logic
which happens where I when I click on
one of these cards so here obviously I
want to first hide the back of the card
and show the front of the
to review it so the current card should
be cards of index but of course I
haven't really declared cards here it
was declared here but that's a different
that's a different scope that's a
different function so one thing I could
do instead of putting this here in the
class is I could instead put it right
here
as a local function that way it has
access to my deck of cards here another
possibility we'll have to turn cards
into a field of the of the game class
but that would be a little bit I would
need a variable for that and you know
scout out on like virus so I'm
completely lying by the way because I'm
doing lots of mutable states interacting
with the library anyway so this is we're
not being functional at all in fact very
pragmatic about these things for some
definition of pragmatic of course okay
so I can also fetch now the front of my
my cards and I will of course hide this
one hide the back and instead yeah I I'm
using the names of the lab of the of the
tutorial but I don't really like them
because I never know which one is the
back and what was the front
so let's rename that so back visible is
false and front visible is true so if I
just take this now I can flip cards but
of course I'm not actually playing the
game so let's continue one thing that I
want to test this well if I mean it
depends now I have I have several cases
either I just clicked on a card the
first card and it needs to show up and
wait for me to click on a second one to
test whether they're the same or I have
clicked on the second card and then it
needs to compare them and if I was wrong
put them back and if I was right
increased in green my score or I could
already have flipped two cards but it
could still be in a state where he's
showing them to me for a couple for one
second or so and waiting until that
second elapses to hide them back and let
me get let me get something else so I
have three kinds of states where that I
could be in so I'm going to declare
those things and for this I'm going to
use a sealed abstract class which is
basically a hierarchy of classes and I
have a couple a couple variants but not
any other variant so one thing would be
I made no guess so far let's call it
guest state it's even better so either I
have I have I'm making no guess right
now I'm wait I'm waiting to click on my
first card or I could be in the wrong
guess states where I have clicked on
both of cards and they were but they
were not identical but then there is a
case in the middle which is I have
clicked on one card and I'm waiting to
click on the second cards but then I
need to remember which cards
I clicked so here I'm actually going to
use a class which is one cards let's say
and then I can store the index of the
card that I have clicked so this here
says that if I have something which is
typed as a guest state it can be exactly
one of those three things it's either a
no guess or a 1 card with an index or a
wrong guess but it cannot ever be
anything else because that class is
sealed so no one else but me can extend
a class
right so the question is why would
wouldn't that be a trait you can also
make it a trait I have a tendency to use
yield abstract classes when I can
because there's some times more
efficient than sealed traits but it's
it's a purely meeting so let's let's
roll with sealed face okay so it's also
the fact that everyone understand what
the class is and in the Java conference
people who might not know what the trade
is so for for the purpose of this talk
good trait is an interface basically
okay so now I need to store my state so
this time there there's no way around it
I will need a variable so guest states
which is a guest state and it starts as
a notice let's put it with the other
fields here okay so now when I click on
the cards I can test in what state I am
so I'm going to do what we call pattern
matching which is a bit like a switch
but for steal traits kind of I'm
simplifying things so either it's no
guess and I need to do things or it's a
one card and it has an index yeah it
shouldn't use index because I already
used index or first index and if I
forget one it will actually tell me so
here the average tell me match may not
be exhaustive it will fail on the
following input wrong guess so it can
can tell me that I handle no guess in
one card but I don't handle wrong guess
so I also need to in the wrong guess so
if I'm if I'm in the wrong state what
I'm supposed to do is well not allow the
user the player to flip a third card at
the same time right so I'm just
going to return from this and wait for
the next time that the player comes back
after the timeout has elapsed and the
cards are flipped back to there in the
no gas state that's also an easy one I
basically just need to store that I'm
now in a state where I have I have one
card so my guest state is going to
become one card of the index I clicked
and that's about it
the hard parts where all the game logic
is basically is the one card case so
here I have two possibilities either
it was the same cards as last time or it
was not the same College last time so if
first so for that I need to find not the
index because the index is the position
on the grids but I need to find what's
the number of that card so how can I
know that that is a good question
oh yeah there was a trick that I can
reuse the key so the first first number
was the images first index third key key
is actually yeah disc that I gave so
every sprites has a key which uniquely
identify Mina Klee but identifies it to
fazer and I can just really start one in
an actual codes
I would probably find something more
clean than that but yeah whatever
and I compare it to the key of front so
the the front of the card I just flipped
and if those are equal then that's a
good guess if it's a good guess all I
have to do is restore the guessed States
to being no gas and increase some score
by 15
I haven't declared scores I need to do
that
scores an int it started 0 0 and
otherwise I need to put the gas states
and the wrong gas and I need to remove
some points and then then I need to wait
I need to wait for about about a second
and then flip them back both so the
easiest way to do that right now is to
use a set timeout with a thousand
milliseconds and in 1000 I want to do
something which is restore the states to
no gas and flip back the two cards so
let's call it first just do that so I
need to flip back my cards which is back
in front so back would become visible
again in front would become invisible
and also I need to do that with the
other cards the one from the first so
images of first index that visible
equals false and cards of first index
treat visible equals true okay that's it
anyone spotted a mistake before we try
to run it no good apparently the type
checker didn't either so let's try I
click on one doesn't do anything and
click on the second one
oh the wrong they're back they were
flipped oh I get lucky this is the right
one yeah awesome cool so it seems to
work and if I try to click rapidly on a
straight one it doesn't let me good so
the only thing left is that I haven't
displayed the score so let's see how
they do that I have kind of not followed
the tutorial in
I know it by heart I guess by now so I
would eat do click we did the game logic
we did and update where is this place
score here score okay so they were doing
something with debug texts that probably
is not a good way of doing it but that's
what they do so and they do that in
renderer which is going to be called
like 60 times a second or something
ah it doesn't like that yeah first I
need to fix the syntax errors okay so it
doesn't like that because value debug is
not a member of game right so let's
let's have a look at game right it
doesn't have a debug methods well that's
that's because I wasn't very careful I
didn't really add all of the all of the
methods a phaser I just I just had added
a few that I was going to need turns out
I forgot that one well I could add it
but just for the sake of it I'm going to
cheat and go the untyped way Oh No so
I'm going to just cast this thing into a
G is dynamic and tada
it works so no it's not type checking
anything anymore if I add some
characters there it's not going to
complain right so but let's let's just
trust the tutorial hopefully that's
going to work so now that it has
recompile this thing let's see
oh yeah it's displaying some things
probably too small but you can see here
score zero and every time I lose I'm at
some points mmm nice
yay I got plus 15
is going to be very embarrassing because
oh yeah a 75 so I think the maximum you
can get here is 500 but that's if you
get really lucky and you get all the
pairs right but if you play well you can
always get at least 450 but yeah that's
not gonna happen this time
okay so that's about what I had planned
so I'll ask one more time into our
questions at this point
no questions then I would ask something
else but else would you want me to code
up right now that I haven't prepared for
that game yeah let's not change the game
but no anything some idea no sorry
Oh what would that do so so right now if
we do if we if we double click on the
same item
nothing nothing happens because that's
the that's the front side of the card
and that the front side of the card
doesn't have click enabled so it just
ignores the click I mean what we could
do is flip it back and cancel but that
would kind of defeat the purpose of the
game but I mean why not let's fall with
that there doesn't seem to be a better
option right now so let's add so now I
guess we need to add some events to the
front side of the cards so that would be
here so I would add image that on no
image that events that on him put down
that and so if we right so I have the
index so guess what we well first
yeah we need to check that we are not
that we are either in a in a case where
we have only one cards flipped because
if the two cards are or or flipped and
then we have a timer in the in progress
and I don't want to mess with that
so let's only allow that if the guest
state is a one card and we don't really
care about the argument because it has
to be indexed in this case and if that's
the case I want to flip it back so I
want to not show the image I want to
show the back of it and I need to reset
the guest state to no guess okay so that
should do it
except of course it's not happy because
I'm have not dealt with the no gas and
wrong gas cases so I'm just going to
tell that that in this case if it's
either no gas or wrong gas I don't want
to do anything so I mean here doing
nothing
okay so that should be good okay let's
see
it's recompiling we combine done so now
if I have one card up it doesn't work
yeah I haven't activated inputs does not
have input enabled so it's just ignoring
this thing image to its input enabled
true recompiling very good
yeah seems like it works okay well
that's about it so thanks a lot and if
you want to help take further questions
or a fine after thank you
the source code for this this
application yes it is somewhere it isn't
my github page so I will probably have
the opportunity to give that information
somewhere to the conference but in the
meantime that here so it's sjr ID which
stands for Sebastian or Berlin or
scholar GS research and development and
it's ecology as fazer demo it should be
at the top of my repository right now
because I've updated it recently so here
you have the full codes it's actually a
little bit better because it has nice
nice stars a visual display of the score
using a range of stars and it has a
fairly more comprehensive part of the
phaser library so the source code is
there
right so the question is where would we
find more of those pre translated
libraries so if you go to the college's
website you have a tab at the top which
has libraries and there you have
JavaScript facades so here you have a
bunch of libraries that have been done
before and that people that people have
done by hand so these are these are
pretty pretty well curated and
high-quality for for Scala use if you
don't find the one you want here so this
includes things like Scala for react and
angular for jQuery for a view as well
for a bunch of these well-known
JavaScript things I think there was one
for d3 yeah most of the really big
javascript libraries you will find there
if you don't find a one you want you
also have definitely Scala which has 600
of them those are directly and
automatically imported from the
typescript definitely typed repository
so those are more exhaustive there are
more of them but they're not hand
curated so the quality might be a bit
less the the skull they might not be as
idiomatic to use from scala environments
but there there is always better than
having to write them yourself good I
think we're done Thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
