thank you for coming it's great to see
such a huge interest in becoming more
productive with IntelliJ IDEA so my name
is Victor crop
I am software developer at jetbrains
working there for many years oh really
I'm developing some plugins for IntelliJ
IDEA and of course I use it daily and in
next 15 minutes I want to share with you
how I set up my IDE and how I do
software development in IntelliJ IDEA
and first I need to me the disclaimer
its tips and tricks type of session if
you have been to similar session before
here at DevOps it or at any other
conference well probably you'd better
find another talk there are a lot of
great talks happening right now if you
are using IntelliJ IDEA Manan like 10
years you again probably won't learn
anything new today so I'm mostly
targeting beginners here and well let's
get started I titled this talk Zen
habits of using IntelliJ IDEA because
when I do software development I want to
concentrate on code and so that any
other things won't disturb them to be
more concrete let's make let's change
one letter and make 10 habits of using
IntelliJ IDEA and the first one is I
always use the newest freshest latest
releases that are exist and before you
need to go to our website and check if
there is a new build available now
like since a year we have a nice cool
toolbox app it is available for Windows
Mac and Linux is a small application
that runs in background
minibar on mark or system tray on
Windows or with a with Scholten Linux
what it does at least all the ideas we
recreated jetbrains you can install any
IDE with a single click when it is
installed and as you see you can have
several versions side by side so you can
have a stable release and used early
access build to test the brand new
features and here you can go to settings
and this is the most important check box
here you click install updates
automatically apply changes and from now
on IntelliJ IDEA will be updated in
background and the next time you start
the computer you will have the latest
build already waiting for you ok but
that's not oh that's not everything and
there is another tab here and it lists
all the projects you have on your
computer
you can start IntelliJ IDEA and open the
project in a single click from this view
so let's switch to the IDE and this is
how IntelliJ IDEA looks by default when
you first started and here I want to
show my next habit I clean the view so
that nothing distracts me first of all
you see tip of the day well you can
check them quickly and disable them
because there is better way to learn new
things in IntelliJ and in help menu
there is a productivity guide it is
again a list of tips how to use IntelliJ
but what's better it also counts how
often do you use any particular action
and you can sort this section by number
of times you used them
well you sorted in ascending direction
and go through those actions you never
used and learn something new it's much
better than chips and on startup well
then we see a window full of different
toolbars there is a lot of things here
attracting our attention instead of
focusing on code so what I do I hide
project view it is shown with the alt +
1 or command 1 on Mac so I will be
showing this on linux linux and windows
shortcuts are almost the same and
shortcuts on mac when the different
toggle and all that otherwise you will
see all the shortcuts and the green bar
at the bottom of the screen so we I had
the project view what if I need to find
some file
well there is find file action and
worked with the ctrl shift and on
Windows Linux and can command shift all
on Mac from here you can in this pop-up
you can type any file name and go to
this file directly you can also use the
recent files pop-up is controller
command in then in list
well recent files next thing I usually
hide is a tab bar
and to do this we can quickly invoke
find action action with will control
shift a and search for taps placement
option and find action pop-up you can
invoke any action or even tune
intelligence settings right from this
pop-up so I choose tap placement none
well control tab shortcut works as
expected
even the tabs are hidden well we have
also line numbers here we can hide them
from context menu or search for the
option with the find action and if I
need to go to some particular line
I can walk boot line control G augment L
and type any line and column here they
are also displayed in the status bar at
the bottom of the screen and this is
probably the only thing I don't hide in
IntelliJ because it shows useful error
messages progress indicators and there
is a deep branch name over to the right
here as well well by by the way with the
go to file action you can also type
first letters of a file name then colon
and then line number and you will
navigate to that line directly and if
you for example place another column and
not a number you go to the column a
deadline
well there is another thing here on the
left and this is a gutter bar displaying
some icons well some are useful like
these ones allowing you to run
main methods for example but this one
that indicating you have lambda in this
one hand well I find them pretty useless
and we go to find action again type
gutter and can quickly navigate to
settings page from here you can either
disable all the gutter icons or just
choose some of them well some of them
are really useful tried only disable
lambda lambda marks icons of lambda
functions so next up here when you
navigate through code you see the symbol
under the cursor is highlighted well I
find it a bit distracting that every
time I move the cursor something good
highlighting some everything blinks so I
disable this this option as well and
highlight and capital movement highlight
usages of well if I need them I can
invoke highlight usages and file it's a
shift control f7 or command on Mac and
well the last thing is the current line
well again I don't think it's very
useful we can go to the state settings
we can search here as well we find a
color scheme
settings control and disable background
well yeah this is this one is strictly
to disable but while we are here again
enable another useful option and that is
disabled by default it's semantic
highlighting well enable it and show
what it does you see all the parameters
and local variables are now colored in
different colors it helps to identify
different variables and for example here
I have an example of similarly named
variables but they do get very different
colors so I won't mix them oh well there
is another thing I forgot here at the
bottom it's a breadcrumbs - well when
you are editing some HTML it might be
useful and displays the deeply nested
structure of HTML documents but in Java
files it's almost useless and we disable
breadcrumbs as well
well now I'm pretty much satisfied with
my setup I see
oh well no at the at the top there there
is another bar and it's called a
navigation bar now we disable it and to
invoke it when when we need it we press
out home or command up and Mac here we
can navigate with errors with downer
opens the package or folder and you can
go to any file right from here well and
there were run configurations on the
right and I will show them later
well yeah now it looks clean and nice
and let's move to the third third thing
set your own shortcuts so I've already
shown some shortcuts and I will show
more you can find
this cheat sheet on our booth and the
conference hall it's really useful to
learn these shortcuts to get used to
them but there are much more actions in
IntelliJ IDEA that we can assign
shortcuts to so we need to carefully
choose some of them probably most useful
but for each and every project you may
want some something else you can for
example you may want to change some
shortcut for an existing functionality
for example there is search everywhere
pop-up and it is invoked by double
pressing shift button and well I find
this somewhat strange well what does
this search everywhere do it combines
recent files go to file go to class go
to symbol action in one so you may
remember just a single shortcut and use
this to navigate into everything in your
project the different types of content
is grouped here and we can tap between
these groups between files methods
actions and so on but I prefer to invoke
and this action with another shortcut
and to set shortcut I go to settings key
map find the action I want and assign a
new keyboard shortcut for this so here
our the assign control comma you can do
this with the other shortcuts of with
other actions you may find useful for
you personally and for anything else
ctrl shift a is your choice well done
IntelliJ IDEA has a lot of built-in
functionality but it also features more
than 200 hub to thousands plugins on our
plugin repository one of the plugins
we've already seeds
it's called presentation assistant in
this place this green bar down this
blood and the bottom of the screen but
there are a lot more you can enter the
right two types of plugins provided by
JetBrains and we installed my own stuff
JetBrains plugins all third party
plugins
you can find them by pressing browse
repositories and for example plugin that
i usually install called dot ignore and
it helps to edit dot dot git ignore and
similar files so just install them from
here and they will be updated by
IntelliJ as soon as the new version
appears so now you have carefully
crafted setup and you don't want to lose
it so that there was an option to save
your settings before with the plug-in
settings sink and but it required a git
repository to store the settings well
it's complicated setup so we decided to
address it and in the IntelliJ IDEA 27.3
we introduced a cloud sync this built-in
functionality it is available in the
status bar you click enable sync and
then only oh you personal shortcuts on
install plug-ins synced
between your computers if you have any
or at least if you have just one and
they are safely stored in the cloud and
it used jetbrains account you already
use for intelligent license this plugin
is now in preview you need an invite to
try it out so come to our booth and
conference hall we will send you one
okay we've done with setting
synchronization so let's finally do some
coding you can create a new file with
ctrl alt insert our alt option and on
Mac so in I'll choose create Java class
and for for example I will have a
database of comic book characters and I
will load it from from file and filter
it somehow a little bit so let's create
data class superhero for this so I see
the project view here it appears from
time to time navigate back to the code
format you use as escape and if you want
to close it and now we get back to code
you press shift escape and if you by the
way if you have many windows open you
can press control shift f12 to hide them
all I have using now a different
instance of IntelliJ IDEA we've seen
have several installed and this one uses
dark theme so to quickly switch themes
you can press control backtick and here
and bottom you see look and feel and you
can choose either dark lights or dark
theme or IntelliJ it's white theme
so and you can you speed accessories
numbers five and one to enable dark will
again this pop-up also can help you to
quickly switch key map for example if
you do pair programming with your
colleague who exists to some other
keyboard layout for example well back to
our code
well let's create some fields and this
data class so our superheroes have name
and in the database there is a number of
appearances of this character in comics
and the year of first appearance oh
that's that's enough for an example so
we created several fields in the class
but now it's not properly formatted with
ctrl alt L you can invoke formatting on
current file well we have private fields
we need getter and setter methods with
alt insert you can work generate menu
and here you can choose generate getters
and setters you select until you fill
thoughts for which you want generate
getters and setters press ok and you get
drop-down and from the same menu you can
also generate constructor and also
initialize fields from from it well and
here we heard about Kotlin this is our
language for a JVM and you can convert
any Java file to cotton from IntelliJ by
pressing ctrl alt shift key
so and this is how this hue class looks
in Cortland well yeah I do all the new
stuff in Cortland but for this demo I
will stick to German or show some other
things then IntelliJ can suggest you
forget
so we with the generate menu we can
create equals and hashcode methods as
well so you don't need to manually type
all these things well let's go further
and load our database so we need main
method for this and there is an
abbreviation for this PS vm public
static void main and what it does it
invokes a place life template code we
can go to settings live templates and
here there are a lot of life templates
for different languages and for Java
like for some if if now the shortcut
that will type if somewhere ball falls
now for you well how do you read the
file in Java you use file line-by-line
you use bufferedreader if I start start
typing the outer pop-up completion
appears and I can apply the first
suggestion by pressing enter well under
there is better options
if I press spacebar and then the first
suggestion is applied and it also
inserts a space after that and it works
with some other symbols like dot or
semicolon or
breakers for generic types and so on
when I start to type a variable name
until J already suggests some variance
from the class and from type name so
this was a basic completion but the Rye
another type of completion in IntelliJ
and it is called smart completion and I
prefer using YouTube wherever whenever I
can
it is involved with ctrl shift space and
it tries to find the already existing
instances of the applicable type at that
code point so we don't have any buffered
readers available and here but we can
press control shift space again and what
it does and looks for some chained calls
so for example it found a static method
and because it was the only suggestion
it inserted it automatically now we can
create bufferedreader from like this we
need hype well I typed it quickly
I used path class and it's not yet
imported and this pop-up appears you can
apply suggestion by alt enter and it
inserts the appropriate import for you
if there are several classes with the
same name in different packages you will
an get pop up with
with all the suggestions where you can
find the one you like my load a file in
this and well intelligent can not only
help you to create new code it also find
errors in your code so for example here
we must handle a checked exception and
there are options mitre to add method
signature was rented with a try-catch
well there is another I think we can do
here we can use try with resources block
well we can apply this suggestion as
well and there are a lot of useful
suggestions if you invoke out enter
somewhere in your code so do it from
time to time and you'll see that tells
you can learn you some Java as well
there are some simple refactoring is
available right here so for example here
you can merge a nested tries into a one
and there is even more useful type of
completion which is not very well known
it's called a complete statement with
the shift control enter you can
selectively correctly finish a current
construction or if it's already using
tactically correct block you can just
get into it or after it it depends on
context so you don't need to navigate by
arrow keys member bam well let's let's
quickly read this file so here for
example I can type it by hand but if I
invoke complete statement action inside
and condition in while loop it inserts
braces for me and put the
cursor inside the block and so we line I
want to read line from this
bufferedreader and I can use camel humps
to search anything incompletions or go
to actions
so here I'll type our L and it found a
red line for me well from here I can I
need to assign and return value I with
control W I can select things in editor
so but considering the present control W
you expand the selection will shift it
shrinks the selection but actually and
at this position in the file I can just
invoke extract variable refactoring with
ctrl ctrl V and del G finds that there
is a single possible expert expression
here and creates variable for me well I
need to check that it's not now so what
I do
I split into Declaration and assignment
well i'll tenter and then i want to put
this check for now into a while
condition well I need to move lying
outside the loop with out shift and
arrow keys you can move lines in the in
the metal body or even you can go out
there well and then select well I need
to surround this snippet with the
parentheses to check it for now and
there is very useful option of this it
is
smart keys surround selection on typing
quote I have it already enabled and what
it does when I have a selection and
press for example opening parentheses it
surrounds the country selected block
with parentheses and superhero split
comments and thirteen fields in the file
again and here I invoked extract
variable on when the cursor woundn't the
beginning of the line and it suggests an
expression which I want to extract as a
variable the whole thing and then and it
create the superhero but I forgot the
structure parameters with ctrl P I can
quickly see the parameters for the
construction and then I need in a number
of appearances so I use not this one but
integer.parseint and you see if I type
opening bracket and insert the closing
bracket for me also I can select a part
of code and press ctrl D to duplicate it
all it's not always the best way to do
things but still well here we do some
something wrong because we don't
and a possible number from that
exception so let's it start into a
method by using ctrl alt M let's go type
bars and and IntelliJ found the second
snippet
well that is similar to the one we want
to extract method and suggest to use the
same method called here as well by the
way you can navigate between methods in
a file and a class by out and arrow keys
another useful thing I select an
expression and then there is round with
action and it can quickly surround this
expression with trycatch and even
inserted the number format exception for
me because it knows that it is possible
from Javadoc possibly well and this pc
just written known okay that's cool here
with the control and square brackets you
can navigate between open and closing
brackets in the file or in the methods i
grouped at the beginning and i need to
create a list of superheroes - james
suggestions for heroes you it's not
completion rate list well it's done but
the rand not only superheroes in the
comic books there are bad characters so
let's just call them characters we can
invoke rename refactoring right here and
it will rename the class for us well in
IntelliJ found some variables here in my
code with the similar names I can select
them all with
a-and vocal refactoring and well it is
renamed including the variable so here
there is another useful option in any
completion in IntelliJ so when you play
a completion in this situation with
enter it adds the selected item and the
cursor point but if you apply completion
with tab it replaces the next word under
the cursor well in this case it's not
very useful okay just like this at the
end with a complete statement we finish
the statement without inserting the
parenthesis by hand and all that's
quickly filter the list with the stream
API
yeah let's filter it by number of
appearances wellnitz
mm and then let's count it complete
statement and IntelliJ suggests the the
return value of the method is not used
yeah it's means since we introduced
variable and yet another type of
completion available in IntelliJ IDEA is
a postfix completion so when it's when
you first type variable and then you
decide what to do with it for example
here if I choose s out it inserts
system.out.println for me we can finally
run this code and here on the gutter we
have run icon and suggest that we can
run the item in the context with control
shift f10 well run no such popular
characters in the database for some
reason well let's make it less well it
doesn't work but we can debug it of
course let's put a breakpoint somewhere
on so for example here would control the
fate you put a breakpoint but there is a
lesser known option with ctrl shift F T
you can add some condition to a
breakpoint and with another control
shift F 8 you will see all the
breakpoints in the current project and I
promise you to show how to access run
configurations without shift f10 you can
access all the run configurations
available in these projects and
speed accessors with numbers here you
can edit all configurations and there
are a lot of them available here in the
menu well from this menu we can also
debug and configuration let's put
another breakpoint and if we we and the
blueprint is hidden you see everything
here with f8 you go step by step in the
application we have seven you can get
into the method cost and this our
library calls and well probably we have
problem here because I've put equals now
it should be the opposite and the thing
is also here you see in the debugger you
see the variable values right in your
code editor Union don't need to see them
in watch windows or somewhere else see
right here but control of 10 you stop
the debugging and fix the error and with
shift f10 you run and your code again
and well right now there are 31 shared
popular character with the modern
thousand appearances in comic books
let's make it a bit less put a break
point on this line at this time and it
detects the lambda on this line and
allows you to set a breakpoint inside
that lambda but I will put a breakpoint
on the line itself not indeed lambda
with control of it again you can disable
any breakpoint I start debugging again
what I wanted to show here is this small
button trace current stream chain and
there is no default shortcut for it and
it's very cool for stream API you press
it it detects that you have a stream
chain on this line and I can show you
how your streams are changed between the
strange change calls well okay thanks so
over the years about complete statement
action well there are two types of
completion I want to mention they are
not well known but they're useful and
they deserve this the next thing we want
to commit our work for example in get
with a control key we invoked my changes
window and in this window you see all
the files available in the project but
there are also useful options like
reformat code optimizing ports clean up
whatever you don't want to miss to do
before the commit so we had some message
with control enter we make a commit then
suddenly we realized that some files
missing I think the comment we select
them as well and there is an option to
amend commit it changes the last commit
we added relating new files to it and
this is an example of code analysis so
it actually said that it find two
warnings in our code but right now I
want to commit it anyway
when I'm working I usually go to this
analysis results and review all of them
so oh I still have a wrong message in my
comment and well this is the first
commit we have and here so here is
another problem we have committed if I
change already committed file on the
left-hand side you see a modified
markers and if you are at that place you
can invoke rollback right from here with
control all set so you don't need to go
somewhere deep to rollback your comments
now let's make another agreement and
here with f2 you can change the message
of any community and also the even a
code completion is available in this
window but git integration is not the
only thing IntelliJ offers you there is
also a local history show history and
this is the window detects all the
changes you made any file at any time so
you can revert in the video changes
right right from here you can go back to
the history as much as you want it's
very useful thing if you forgot to
commit something together and deleted
file accidentally you can recover your
work right from here it sometimes it
saves a lot of time
next up another useful habit is don't
leave the ID ID unions integrated wealth
and environment and a lot of things you
can do right from the ID so intelligent
provides support with provides
integration with maven Gradle and and so
you can for example I have a gradable
project here and I can invoke any Gradle
task right from here if I need terminal
window with out of 12 well I sometimes
forgot shortcuts - you can invoke the
terminal window that works as you expect
and the right and there is another
useful thing I use quite often it's an
external tools integration so in
settings you can create some external
tool in this case it's just list files
command you can invoke it from the go to
Action menu works but what's even better
you can you can assign a shortcut to it
yeah here in external tools we have this
command and we can assign a shortcut to
it and if you're for example do web
service development you sometimes want
to test your rest api and there is a
cool thing in IntelliJ IDEA 17.3 it's
with the ctrl alt shift insert you can
create a scratch files with citizens
kind of temporary file and of the type
HTTP request
okay everything here you type a request
this is a recipe I the service we can
run it without enter right from here and
get a result you can rerun the request
all the results are stored right here in
the editor with control B you can go and
expect individual results and by the way
with the throw out left or right you can
go back and forth through the history
and also in this window you can compare
two results of your request in diff
viewer two types of gifs available in
IntelliJ with side-by-side and unified
gif and for example if you are
inspecting div and can change this
window you can revert some changes right
from there well that's mostly it and the
last thing I want ask you to do is
report bugs because when you report some
issue you encountered with the 98 not
only helps us to fix this issue but it
helps you to get the fix sooner to
suggest new feature will consider to
implement it the results it is also
possible to submit a performance
snapshot if you feel ID is slow on some
tasks and it will help us again this is
a win-win situation because you do some
help to us and then we get fixes back
and we give a free license for active
reporters well that's it I promise you
ten habits let's quickly recap them
update regularly with the jetbrains tool
box clean the view remove everything
that may possibly distract you from code
install some plugins and sync them with
the cloud sync use smart completion and
complete statement action use advanced
local history feature in idea to restore
your work if you lose some and will use
a lot of integration available in the
IntelliJ IDEA well the time is almost
over we will be happy to answer all your
questions regarding a IntelliJ IDEA or
any other idea our booth and the convert
conference hall
thank you for attention and have a good
conference
