about cutting these cells
it's supposed to be 42 minutes but maybe
50 1/2 everybody heard something about
cotton or visited some talks about
Cortland today oh it's really nice so
most of the talk will be caught in life
so if you realize that you're missing
the point please go ahead and ask me at
the moment if you are not understanding
something's going on my screen and so I
first of all feel worse about myself I'm
joining us on Twitter I'm working at
JetBrains I'm calling user and the nice
thing is I'm not from a cotton team but
I'm using content for many many years
and created probably one of the first
production plugins using cotton and JVM
I'm doing suicide development and term
jetbrains toolbox I'm using cotton Java
go and other languages and let's turn to
Diesel's so if we take a look on
Wikipedia we would see that the main
specific languages it's the meaning of
the DSL acronym and these are languages
which really helps to solve some
problems for a given domain and they are
not that universal as general-purpose
languages which are for example Java C
go and other languages like that and
frankly these cells can be split into
two parts the one part is the specific
languages which are created to solve the
specific problems and we know them for
years this can be SQL language that can
react and so on the problem is to those
languages it's really complicated and
tricky to start using it in your build
process because you need to start from
scratch you need to create the parsing
lexing and the whole stuff then you need
to talk to guys who setting up builds
for a project and then you need to set
it up for continuous deployment can't is
delivery and all that stuff this can be
really complicated but sometimes it's
necessary
probably my tackle conjured brains MPs
if you really desire to create such such
a complicated language
and there is yet another and pragmatic
pragmatic way of creating languages is
to use your existing language which you
are using for a project to create
something you need and examples are
fluent APRs or builders which we tend to
use in Java for years this may help us
to create something which is more
readable and better understandable which
helps you to express what you need for
your use case and the nice thing you can
use existing stack for it and this is an
example of G cells say you using the
basic language for some reason you may
come up with such a such a thing it
might in my place or examples are
related programs we'll take a look how
these can be created later on so to sum
up the D cells is something how I
understand it and what time we present
it later this is something which is easy
to read for you for your team this is
something where you can easily express
what you need for example let's say you
need to create the graphs a cyclic
graphs for some your application for
example in tests and you can create a
builder a PRI or fluent API and which
helps you to define such graphs for your
tests and then you can share this
snippet to your colleague saying hey
this my graph and we can fix it and
create yet another test for example and
this is easy to express create new
graphs and easy to understand if you
sharing these some to somebody they are
able to figure out what you trying to
say to them
so such details are really really nice
to use for configuration for example
friend of my credit a really nice a
kubernetes DSL for in coughlin to set up
the pots for kubernetes templating if
you need to create some output for your
client site or suicide application for
logic for user interface and so on and
so on
and let's take a look on this example
first so this is a part of HTML and say
our application is generating this HTML
to send it to a browser and no matter if
it's running on the backend or or a
client side
we need to generate something like that
although
and the problem is that we need to put
something which is context dependent
into it like user names some information
and so on and actually we ended up to
having something like this on our behind
behind the curtains and I can recall
only the Gees piece which were
generating some stuff like that when you
take a look on the source by the way
anyway anyone still recalls GES piece oh
nice number of people and this is how we
used then if we have such a thing in our
sources it can be quite tricky to patch
it to include some more text it's really
can be tricky
without IDE support to include the close
closing tag if you changing it to not to
forget to code some codes in the right
way if they have some attributes inside
and the things can be turned a little
bit nicer if we have a valid program in
our language it can be any language you
use and here we can see that the eight
every block at least isn't the block in
this language and we make it clear that
we are not forgetting to close it we are
not able to mix close call stacks for
example here and if it is done correctly
IDE and compiler are our friends they
are able to help us to make sure this is
right this is correct for example if
it's done right you may see that here
you have code completion you're
highlighting your IDE is able to say hey
at that place you can say for example BR
tag or you can build string or it can
call body from these parameters and
everything is understandable you can
navigate to implementation details and
take a look for Java Docs or cotton dogs
inside and figure out is it what I am
trying to do or it's something else it's
really nice and if we're talking about D
cells and Kotlin there are set of things
which are really really nice the cotton
is open-source language we know it for
years and it's tightly typed so if you
have the third bound clutter in your
program the types of everything is known
an IDE and you everybody knows what's
going on inside
what is the receiver what is the
parameters and so on the nice thing
about cotton is that
tax of language is done the way where
you can create the details or snippets
like I've shown you few slides before
really easily and having this sum up
we'll have a good IDE support we have
compiler which is able to check on a
compilation time that the diesel is the
valid and we have code completion and we
have even more you can create the same
code snippet and you can compile it to
all platforms which caught in supporting
this is not only the JVM you can reuse
the same code in Android JavaScript and
native and even more you can create a
common module which you can compile once
and reuse on every platforms you have
around and of course are learning
something new in particular learning a
new language or learning a new features
is way more easier if you try it
and next we'll try to create a small
application which deals with an existing
Java part so here I have a tiny
application it just says hello I can
start it it even works and here I have a
number of Java Java files you see you
see the text right it's okay okay so
here having a modifiable bodger's say
all classes of course I can write it in
cotton and cell lines but it's a Java
and will will not change in this Java
code see you have a library you're out
at some products on library you cannot
change but you're going to be using it
and here I have a module it has four
fields to string fields to another
produce inside so here have two
parameters here I have one parameter and
we have a builders the tree or thing the
same the same stuff with the setters and
getters so we are able in and the build
method at the end and I here have an
example so this example oh I'm gonna
close this way yeah so this example
builds these three objects for our
domain and now we will try to come up
with a exhibit with a nice-looking
detail which shows how one can create
this one so first step for me is to just
take this one and copy it to an existing
cotton file we're here
and I paste it here and IntelliJ helps
me to convert my Java code into cotton
code and there will be several changes
let's do it
so the first thing I can spot is here
so in Kotlin viewer we have a type
inference local type inference in this
case and in cotton we do not need to
specify type several times in one
expression Colton is able to figure out
that the type of builder is a Ocwen
builder of course if we need explicit
type we can specify it this way but of
course in most cases we don't the second
thing is that in cotton we don't need to
write the new keyword we don't have a
new keyword in cotton instead we simply
say the type name and we call construct
over here the tract over here and that's
it
next nice thing about is about the
properties so I'm here I'm calling this
the setter from a Java but in cotton you
can consider it be a field play like a
field it's called the property the same
thing you have for example in c-sharp
for years and of course in Colin if you
still need it you can say set set you
need to type it manually first name from
this is possible in cotton as well so
you can call the method from a Java but
if the method is called set something
you can use something as a work as a
property this is done automatically you
don't need to change in your existing
Java to have this and this looks way
better than the things before let's now
take a look how these program runs and
here we realize that we have sort of
like a problem in our data class we have
no right implementation of to string and
as I said before we are not going to
change our code so we need to create an
agility function which prints it up in a
readable way right so for this we create
a function in quadrants one called and
function is created with a funky word
then I would say print print so client
is a Java client and this one returns
string so accordingly you define this
this way so the parameters are specified
here you can use
by name then the type then return type
is despite this way and here I simply
say return and say clients didn't
Twitter handle so I would return
something meaningful probably maybe not
our second company and say neighbor the
next freaking cotton is that if you do
this one you can drink it to an
expression body we can do it this one so
and then cotton is able to infer type
for you so if you don't feel you like to
specify types explicitly you can drop it
out and have it this way then we have a
parameter templates for string and let
me convert it to template it will look a
little bit better so now we can do it
like like we used to have in Java
I guess everybody from ass has now a
huge number of static classes with
static functions which helps us to deal
with some EPR ice newbie oh yeah nice I
see some hands in school but you know
this is not the best thing we can do out
of this actually I would like to be able
to see something really really nice I
would like to say it this way would like
to say client to console string this one
would looks really nice and I can do it
this way so I can generate an extension
function of course in my case I can
generate the member function because
does Java sources are in the same
project so I can touch it but I don't
like to do it so I can generate an
extension functions in question in this
in for this type over here and it would
return string ah oh and this is a body
we don't need now so in cotton this is
really syntactic sugar so what we do
here we create a kind of utility
function and the trick is that the
quadlin allows us to call on utility
function to be looking like a member
call that's it
so if you take a look and white code
side you will see that this is a slight
function inside which takes the first
parameter of type client and here as in
the Plymouth
I can I just copy-paste this one and
here guy here goes
yet another trick so I let's say I just
say this way for short and of course and
of course I don't have a client variable
in this example and the thing is that be
it an extension function means that
inside this body I can use this keyword
and this keyword refers to an instance
of this Java client type and be it since
it this keyword we can avoid it and we
can have it this way so we can just
think as this one is a part of this
class but actually this is to keep
static utility behind and this is not of
course I can do private for for short
and we can go further a little bit and
say we need its I I'd like I need this
one this is also possible and this is a
really nice disability limb block so I
want to have a field or property which
does the trick for me and I can create
it really nice and easy way I just copy
this one I say here Val so I create an
readable property and here you specify
the the name of it and you need to
implement the gate function oh where am
I and you need to implement the gate
function for it and that's it now we can
say it this way so this is how we can
beautify and exist in api's and let's
take a look further how we can benefit
from it in creating these cells so let's
recall we have a huge block of code over
here and we need to make it look really
nicely and and the first step the first
step is to figure out that here we have
a hidden knowledge we know in this code
snippet how to create a builder and let
do the first you or think let's create a
function which takes an object which
actually builds this in this our client
Java client class so I create a function
right right we can do it in Java so I
create a function create client which
takes supplier
which takes supplier do you know the
supplier type oh no no not supplier
consumer do you know consumer type from
Java okay not enough hands I guess so
let's take a look here this is standard
type from JA 1.8 it has one meaningful
method which called accept and from T so
and we pass supplier which takes Java
client builder here and returns Java
client and this one does a really really
trivial thing so it first creates client
builder then it calls except from a
supplier so we trying to say the
supplier is one which is supposed to
create the builder for us
oh here it's supposed to be job client
until there and now we return result
right so this pattern can be used in
Java for example if you're doing some
say transaction behind the curtains you
really really like to control the entry
and the leaf and you make these clothes
this consumer generate the data for you
say urine anything like that and now we
can convert this code into the hoenn
following thing so we can save all
client is create client and here we
create an anonymous object for short
which takes which is observed which is
consumer from Java client builder and
here we implement this the one method we
need we go here and say implement it for
me
and here we I named it builder and I
just copy paste the whole meaning in
here so the trick is that now I no
longer need to know how to do there is
created instead I am just creating I am
just passing something which is able to
build the fun the result for me and I
know I need this one and logging in that
one and and this should work as well
is it used and this by the way this one
is how one can create an animus custom
column there is a knife thing as you are
able to specify as many types as you use
you need in here you are not bounded
with one type as we have an integer bar
and sometimes it's allows to minimize
code but if we're trying to create some
lambda looking interface we have a
helper in Kotlin and we can convert it
to lambda so we can simply say I create
a consumer this is the name of the
interface I creating and that's it but
the good thing about cotton is that we
have lambdas and the higher-order
functions in a language level so instead
of passing the consumer interface like I
created it from a Java style way you can
say the directly here I need a lambda
function which takes one parameter in a
brain in braces and this parameter
returns unit so unit in cotton is a type
which is synonym of void in Java so you
can say we say unit instead of weight
and yes B as it is a lambda we no longer
need to call any method on it we can
call it logical form of a function like
a normal function and this one now I
need to drop this one here to make it
looks look this way so this is how you
can pass a lambda in question there is
no nice things if you do not like to
name the parameter you can use name it
and once this is a default name so you
can omit this declaration of the
parameter names if you have a lambda
which takes only one parameter you can
just avoid this and the second trick is
if in your function you accept the
lambda and this is a really nice
disability work if you have a lambda as
the last parameter you can move lambda
outside of the braces so it will look
like this you see that so this is how
you can use of course if you have a non
parameters you can pass it here but we
don't have so we can simply an ontology
shows me that this is not necessary so I
can do it this way but still and we have
a number of things written here which
are kind
of long run so we have it here and I
know this solution what I want to do I
wanted to have it this way so I wouldn't
say just first name is this and why
should I say it on every field I try and
to complete this is this is the next
record I need to write and I don't like
it so let's take a look on this one and
on that one so we have an extension
functions as we created this to cancel
string for example function and as we
have an extension functions we actually
allow to create this type use this same
type of function as a London so instead
of saying this I can say that so I would
say that the create client function
takes a lambda with a receiver so this
is like I'm taking an extension
functions with which is defined in place
and if I do this I have a really nice
syntax so I can call it inside like this
like like a function so I'm taking an
extension function and as it is an
extension function I call it this way
like an extension function that we did
that with a console string over here the
same thing but it changes nicely the the
thing what is going on inside create
client so now I have this inside thread
client which is pointing to this Java
client builder class and as it does this
keyword I can avoid it to have it this
way is it clear now okay okay so now we
can simplify things and we can drop this
away drop that away and drop that away
well it's not the end since we have
really complicated part over here and we
need to get rid of this and the first
thing is that we hard code these so
additional builders and there is no
reason to do that since we say we said
we're going to create the client so all
builders are supposed to be defined
somehow right and this one can be done
in this following way
create a function which is actually an
extension function for Java client
builder and it's called say Twitter and
this function takes builder I will be
copy pasting code it's easier so it
takes
Twitter builder and this functions does
the following it says I would write this
way Twitter is equal to Java Twitter
builder apply as built trigger and let
me explain let create this function let
create this apply function for us so of
course first step we can avoid this one
I hope it's clear now because this is an
extension function and this keep working
the optional and now the apply function
the apply function is from a coordinate
standard library let's take a look if we
it's quite it I think it's
understandable so this is an extension
functions which is extension which is
it's of generic so it's extension
function for every type T and it takes
the block
it runs the block and returns itself
back right so if I can copy it it's
lesson let's do with some line types to
take a look to make it a little bit more
understandable so instead of G I have
this one I have I have this one I
supposed to be copy paste in this one
have it do I have
oh okay
so we can take this one put it over here
and then we have type T which is which
is again the joke line builder and so on
so and the second thing if you have a
type of lambda in your function of
course you can pass the lambda in next
function just directly without having
anything specific inside huh so this is
how I can create this and since I have
this Twitter here I can simplify this
blog and I can replace this one with the
following short part of all the code
I should be yeah is it better well I
think so similarly we can fix the second
one and let's see let's just copy-paste
this this code snippet and of course we
don't need to declare this apply
function explicitly since it's in the
standard library it's really helps us
doing things and I'm gonna have a
company builder so I pass the company
builder here I say company I say company
company here and of course I need a
company builder instance over here and
it calls company and now I can drop this
whole thing and replace it with a shiny
looking lambdas and I do well do this
one and I can drop this away so as the
result we started from really
nice-looking Java builder quite long
quite explicit understandable everybody
can read this and understand what's
going on inside and we ended up having
the same exactly thing looking this way
well if we for example talking about the
readability you can share this to
anybody from your team saying hey I
creating this object and here how I do
it this resembles me other things like
JSON for example when you create a POJO
you can see another stand what's going
on inside and the actual thing is I have
not changed anything as you see it from
this one I have not changed anything
from my draw
sources so beat the sources be the
library the things we'll play the same
way and the main and the main trick when
you're building these health is that you
can use this lambda with a receiver and
you can simplify things and turn it into
things like that of course you can do
some more accurate overloading stuff and
more other stuff it's really nice and
you can take a look on examples I have
so if there is if there is not some
questions I gonna switch to the
presentation back is it okay
okay so when you start creating your
details you need to you need the
commentation you need to understand the
language you need to understand how you
what you can do out of this language and
there are zero keywords you can google
it and I'll upload my presentation so
you can just click on the links and this
is extension functions this is lambdas
and there is a really really nice
article types of builders in a Content
documentation site
this shows how you explains how you can
create the details like we showed we've
seen before and if we now take a look on
the example I had a few slides before
this is the same HTML we're trying to
generate and now we see the DSL sample
as I shown now I hope you able to
understand how you can create such a DSL
from scratch it's it should be not that
complicated you create a function called
HTML which takes a lambda with the
receiver then you create a function head
which takes another lambda with the
receiver on the atom type and so on and
so on and then you have this one and the
plus here you see that for example plus
hello or plus this this is a most this
plus is a reloaded greater so we unload
the plus to make it possible to pass the
string into our builder we need to call
some function we can call it line we can
call it print line and we can call
somehow or we can use the Parader to
simplify the robustness of this example
and the this code snippet was from the
existing library it's called cotton X
dot HTML we can find out it on and
github
this existing library can use it you can
use it for JavaScript JVM backends it's
cross-platform : library pure cotton
cold and as a rack wrap-up I have a
really nice example this is a code
snippet from guava libraries it's in
Java and when you see this guarded by
annotation it's really nice if you try
to have a contract in your code you
saying that okay I have this two fields
which is supposed to be accessed only
with a lock being held but it's really
tricky to make sure that in your code
base during the evolution this is not
changed and to solve this you may have
some static code checks you may do code
reviews you can do whatever you like but
this is really a nice example how we can
use quadlin to solve it the other way
and say we just extract this state to a
dedicated object and I have two
properties here declare this way
cotton is able to infer types for us so
it's getting easier you don't need to
specify top seed pista in this case and
then we create what we need to do we
need to create this crossword by as
shown on the first line and the ideal
usage of this state is to say hey I need
to use this state let it have help
necessary walks for me but I don't want
to specify those blocks explicitly so we
create their function we use the call
guarded pass the lambda with the
receiver inside the receiver this of
type state and inside this block you can
modify state but you cannot do this
outside of this and the implementation
is really straightforward all you need
to do you need to create an reload
operator so in Cortland you can define
operator so the guard is the variable
name in this slide and to allow another
lambda on a variable name you define the
function called invoke and you use a
specific keyword operator to let Cosman
understand that you are going to create
an operator and then we use the same
pattern as I shown you during the live
coding stuff so but we use a generic
here to make
it's more handy say you modifying the
state and you want to return something
as a result and the nice thing this is
lock with lock this is a standard
function from a cotton library it takes
log cross the action and then it is undo
undo it unlocks it that's that's so easy
and on the on the declaration you may
see the default parameters in Quadrant
for every function you may specify
default values in my case the lock
variable in a constructor of the cause
is specified with the default will your
entrant lock so if you have specific
lock you may pass it if you don't you
can simply say guarded by from state the
first line and that's it enough this is
enough and we don't use new keyword in
coordinate we can simply say type name
and the parameters for constructor this
is how you can benefit from ad sales or
trivial des health for your daily life
for it's quite easy I guess
and it's and then you don't need to do
static checks because you're able to
make a compiler do the static text for
you so you don't need extra step for
your build steps in this case and of
course during this presentation there
were several things which I forgot and
you may see for example the long name
for a function in Cortland you can say
you can easily say something like I can
I think I think I'm not forgetting this
so you can say for example create the
client and now I rename my function so I
use this called the reverse quotes
create the client so you can define the
function this way and then you can if
you do in a d-cell the that can add more
sense to a DSL if you use somewhere here
you can create the season to not the
company but say something long or if you
for example doing the JUnit test with
JUnit 4 it works pretty well you can
name your test with spaces inside run it
and you'll see the long names in a test
runner Fortune IntelliJ it worked with
Gradle
this is nothing to do and you can also
overload the number of operators not
only PLAs but they standard operators
you expect from a c-like languages like
you have an in Java you can even reload
the operator in work as I shown before
to past lambda or something and you can
overload the operator for indexer access
like this one and this is really nice
this can help you building a decels or
really easy to access gathers work
something and there are several things
which are really nice called the
delegated properties and delegated
implementations in Cortland you can say
you have a property which is set X by
lazy so if you specify an object with a
dedicated get value and set value or
only get value for on modifiable
properties then you can specify
something inside for example this one
creates the first one creates an X and
the lambda initialized lambda is
executed only once when you first trying
to code it's really nice the second one
is a delegated implementation so if you
have an interface with a hundred methods
you don't need to do a call of this
interface if you're trying to delegate
it instead you can use these by syntax
so you can say object a implements B and
the B interface is implemented from a C
which is instance of C it will minimize
the code you need and helps for example
building these cells as well and if we
start thinking about this there are
several more keywords I would really
like to share this is delegated
properties operator reloaded of course
types of builders this is really nice
thing and if we take a look on how these
cells are being built I would say this
is a iterative process so you start with
a DSL you want to have then you try
typing it then you may use IntelliJ to
create the functions operators and
anything so just trying to make
something not something that is
compatible then you realize what you
have and then you may repeat so for
example you may start doing something
you have
this one and then you create it turn and
realize if it's no-go who go and here we
have an in fixed function calls to the
print input and go to our in fixed
functions which takes in from the left
side and something from the right side
so in fixed keyword when you declare a
function helps doing this one and I I
think yeah we have have several moments
to take a look on this so if we go here
we see that the the trick is done this
way so you can say in fixed function
which takes in from left side the number
of line and the string from the right
side that's it and if we let's see
similarly you can think what is
unthinkable and this is I hope nobody
will use it but this is a valid one
cortland thing you can do it if you if
you need it for some reason but I hope
you reiterate building your DSL further
and realize that it's not not the best
thing to do and talking about details
and doing this sauce is really nice and
of course there are a huge number of
diesels which are here and of course
cotton standard library contains a
really really nice tiny micro D self
like also apply and so on also we have a
curtain curtains and cotton excursions
library this whole thing is built on a D
cells when a function with the receivers
it's really nice take a look on it and
there are other DS health like for
example this one here we trying to do a
data binding binding and the idea was to
try playing with them expose looking
expressions but the idea was not to call
this expressions but have a cotton
language implement in this expression so
in this case the division is operator
which is overloaded and so on so we can
write like an expression and you can
have custom functions you can have
anything to like and this is a valid
cotton call
there is Gradle script cotton this is
really nice when you are able to write
your Gradle scripts in a in a cotton
language in this case IntelliJ and other
IDs is able to understand what you have
inside the closures what type is the
receiver what what properties you can
use what functions
what methods are there it's really nice
and then it works better because you are
not able to do it real mistakes in a
groovy for me it was like possible it's
quite easy to forget something there is
a d-cell intensity by the way who is
using Tim City okay so but the nice
thing about that is that is able to
generate the diesel for you so if you
have a configurations you build plans
then you can click and say hey I need a
diesel out of this and it generates the
diesel for you and then you can start
relating on these so making it more
specific for your build plans it's
really nice and spring from work I hope
you've been listening to talk the
previous lot about the whole spring
forth with cortland it's really nice and
there are nice details inside which
helps you doing your stuff if you do
inability testing there is really nice
spec library which helps you to define
with them do you sell like on the right
part of the my slide you can use diesel
like stuff to define things make this
one and define your BDD specification
test and of course there are more direct
way more examples and you might follow
these links you might create your own if
you create share it it's really nice to
take a look at people can do and do is
really nice thing to start with you can
use tri-dot : lambda torque there you
can type call your cousin called just in
browser you can check or you can solve a
tiny tasks like a cotton corns this is a
really really nice thing if you want to
try court even if you want to learn
things inside language and the
respondents like if you want to ask
questions if you want to communicate as
far as last time I checked it was twenty
or twelve thousand people in there maybe
more so during during this and asked
questions were read answers if you like
it and so I was expecting it to complete
in 42 minutes so we have few times a few
moments to discuss questions
okay one more trick for the end if we
take a look on our diesel we've created
it's nice that it fits to it we can
tweet it so it fits 280 of tractors so I
I tweet it with a with a photo from a
stage
so yep thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
