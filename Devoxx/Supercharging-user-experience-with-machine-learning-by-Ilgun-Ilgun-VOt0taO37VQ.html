this session is about a search tool a
search for essentially that we built
with myself again and also my colleagues
Cedric but today unfortunately he
couldn't make it to here so it's gonna
be only me presenting the topic to you
let's start directly since it's a
quickie first thing we want to mention
is that we are not researchers which
means that we are developers like
yourself well given that you're
developers of course so the main thing
here is that if there would be a
takeaway from this session it would be
that the entry barrier to machine
learning nowadays is quite easy so that
everyone actually could do it well given
the interest of course and well so it's
a search tool it's called periscope it's
just a coincidence it has nothing to do
with this trimming tool that you might
know but yeah we didn't know it either
anyhow so this is how it looks like it's
basically open source it's based on
Wadden which is a web framework on the
right you can see the image basically in
this example user typed car and then we
provide them a bunch of results and also
as you see there are there is website
which is actually the name of the result
provider that we will speak about later
and also note that there is a microphone
icon in the right which actually gives
the idea that we do speech recognition
which we will talk about also and also
there are links to the main project and
I work for Magnolia CMS so there is a
Magnolia integration also but it's
completely free and open source so this
is how it looks like it does live
resolve listing so in this example user
will type car and then we will show them
a bunch of results from websites and the
other one is from Wikipedia so keep it
in mind and user can also freely
traverse or move down or more up in the
results and with the Enter key they can
delegate to a certain action which we
will see later so this is how it looks
like this is the main periscope as I
mentioned before there are results
suppliers
which actually supplied those results
that we actually happen to show to the
user in the end so there's a result Pro
suppliers are quite easy to write they
are completely pluggable to the tool and
this is how it looks like I already
mentioned Wikipedia and websites which
is actually if you implement the title
that's where the title comes from it's
just a plain string the interesting
thing happens in the search function
actually given the search query that
user types in or speaks to or whatnot
you receive a bunch of results which
happened to be list of results in this
case and if something goes wrong which
we hope not but then you can throw
straight exception so our goals we had
actually three goals that actually we
use machine learning to first one is
searchable images so in this example as
you see we like cats well I guess
everyone does any also when the user
types cat it will go and fetch the cats
in the particular that database or data
source and well this is solved by deep
learning we happen to use rest at 50
which is a residual residual network
which happened to have 50 layers and why
we use it is that because it it's
offered by many frameworks many tools
already the pre-trained rest at 50 so
that you can just use the model like v2
so we didn't reinvent the wheel there
and also 152 a layer variant happened to
be in the first place in some
competition also there is a link in
below which actually points to the paper
and it's actually really interesting
read have a look at it if you if you're
interested with the topic and well so
how those networks are trained well this
section is straightforward you can do it
yourself too for us we use image net
database which is which has a millions
of labeled images it is based on vert
net nouns vert net itself is a database
so there are more than 500 images per
class let's say you have cat in you have
500 cat images and these are pre label
so that you can train your network and
as I mentioned before pre train networks
are available already and while there is
a Magnolia implementation for it which
the link is the following it's free it's
open source in this case if you are
familiar with JCR we used toward the
properties but you can store it anywhere
you want and this is just happened to be
Magnolia implementation but main
algorithm and the main network is all it
there so you can just adjust it to your
needs and the second one was speech
recognition so think about a case if you
are lazy or if you have some
disabilities you might really need to
speak to the Machine right well I am
lazy in this case so I like I like
speaking to it when it understands me of
course but it's pretty accurate we will
see so this is what we used there is a
web speech API which is actually
embedded in the browser so that you can
use it currently it's only available in
Chrome and also Firefox but it's in the
spec so it's gonna be available
eventually for all browsers and it's
pretty accurate so this is just a script
and basically you just create a new
instance of speech recognition you get
your recognition and then you have an
you have a lambda which which gets the
result events and then this event well
for instance for English it's zero and
the second one zero zero is the variant
of it so it gives you a bunch of results
and with the competency so you can just
check and which is better and then
return to the back end so in this X in
this example in particular we returned
the transcript which is the text to the
back end to the research but you can do
whatever and you have to start the
recognition of course and the most
interesting interesting thing according
to me at least is the adaptive result
order that we do it's actually ranking
so imagine a search tool Google already
does it right while others to when you
typed car for four let's say you
selected the fourth one next time when
you go and type car you want to know you
want to rank it higher so the user will
be
seeing it at the first rank right so
with this with sort of deep neural
network it is it was easily achievable
so when user types car in the second
round we directly show the user is the
first rank and for this
well the main challenge was actually the
following we have two dimensional array
which happened to have 128 code points
in ASCII and also we have max character
which is 15 so this is our input and
then we do a initial combination because
imagine a case if you are searching for
Facebook you don't read the right
Facebook there you write face your eyes
face B maybe you write FB but this is
the main challenge because all these
actually initial characters or the small
characters going go to a same page so we
have to associate them somehow and
therefore we did the following we
associate the three adjusting characters
and then train our network current
linked and this is how our output layer
looks like we have n units which is the
size of the result set and neural
network gives us the results is the
following from somewhere between 0 &amp;amp; 1
the higher the better and it also gives
the estimation of the relevance
according to and this is unsupervised
learning because some results are coming
from the network some of them are
directly coming from the result
providers but they are not ranked so
this is our setup it is it is not a very
deep network as I said we have the input
layer we have the initial convolution
and we have just bunch of fully
connected lives and in the end we get
out so it's actually demo time enough
talking the first thing I want to show
is speech recognition this is Magnolia
by the way this is how it looks like
let's try what
help okay that's the more effect okay of
course it will not work when I want it
to work
I'll okay well great well anyhow if you
were to write out which I will try later
maybe I really can't pronounce it I'm
not a native speaker as you might guess
and then we already have the protect
images which actually point to direct
from our database so we can see actually
if they're accurate or not
let's let's take for instance the fourth
one we go we check there's a small
preview well it really looks like apps
so I give I take it as correct one and
one the next time when I go and actually
type help as you see it's ranked higher
so this is what I was talking about
ranking but I want to try one more time
the spiracle I don't know what to say
though well yeah let's stick with the
cat's cat
hold on a minute okay it taught this
text okay
if I really speak to it if I really
speak to you well then what's wrong
anyhow demo effect it works I promise
straight well accent is the problem
let's try Java so as you see actually it
directly tries to we have the concept of
voice comments so if there is just one
result we directly try and execute
whatever the comment if you predefined
it so that's why it actually says the
comment fails so you can also use it as
such for for really tricky cases where
the user really goes and have to do many
clicks you can just
do it by the volkl comments and well
more interesting case would be for the
ranking especially is that imagine a
case where you search for a car well I
get a bunch of results and let's say I'm
interested with one car games ok that's
interesting website and then next time
when I go it's the first ranked one
right so so far so good but what happens
if I put car G well I'm not really
interested with the cars right so what I
want to actually say go to s PB cargo so
what I expect is that the car should go
to the sv big cargo but the car should
go to the car games and since the
training is happening now as you see now
the first item is the car and with the G
well it is ok it has to learn now it's
ok so as you might guess our learning
rate is quite high because we have
limited users and this is on the fly
directly we don't have a pre trained
model for that and frankly that would be
it from me and the takeaways would be
from this session is UX can really
benefit from machine learning and deep
learning has matured it was fairly
straight for us fairly straightforward
for us to go and build something of
course we had to read some books I'm not
gonna claim it's super easy but I can
easily tell you don't need a PhD for
that I don't have one and the entry
barriers are quite low nowadays so yeah
that's it from me any questions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
