technical issues unfortunately we're not
allowed to use macbooks as a lot of guys
here so welcome to next talk we would
like to share our experience with open
shift at SBB and what we are and what
our main learnings for the last one and
a half year my name is Tobias Templer
I'm software engineer at SBB my
colleague here is Phillip author who is
from outcome and that spp we work
together in a team that works with open
shift and all technologies and processes
around open shift so let's set the
context for today basically we have a
GIS layer for computing starch and on
top of that we're on the open shift as a
path and for docker orchestration our
developers mainly as working two areas
with open shift here on the on the left
hand side you see what we call on git
repo the developers have the
possibilities to use existing git repos
and build images on openshift deploy
their applications to changes all in a
kind of self-service stuff or a DevOps
tile on the other side what what's
called infrastructure images is we
provide some basic infrastructure and
like databases messaging for example no
sequel databases Cassandra clusters and
so on that developers really easily can
instant
she ate with existing templates and use
them right away in their project today
we mainly focus on a kind of develop
view or a developer perspective of this
context we try to cut off details how to
run and maintain an open shift cluster
and you try to focus on how I would
develop his work with open shift and
what are the main learnings from from
the developer point of view first to
give you some background at the moment
we run free open shift clusters and as
one what we call in-house cluster on our
own hardware and two additional ones on
AWS one for productive usage and one for
development usage and totally we run
about 1,500 contains numbers are already
outdated by now to give you a kind of
idea of this scaling we use for in-house
cluster we use about 700 CPU cores seven
terabyte memory and about 3 terabyte
storage numbers are increasing rapidly
at the moment we have on our productive
announced cluster about 400 openshift
project on AWS is about 15 we provide 24
7 operation for all of our productive
clusters we have a team that do the
whole on-call stuff in the background
and we also have several big players or
big applications from SBB that runs
completely on
open Jeff Kloster example you may be
know the spb mobile app for checking
trains we're buying tickets and every
request from the mobile app is going to
the backend on openshift running on AWS
and and there are also some other big
applications for example if you if you
buy a ticket that train station your
calculation will be served by backends
hosted on openshift since summer 2016 we
had a general availability of about
ninety-nine point nine percent so not
too bad for cloud project a project to
be successful you need to have certain
technical features because in
capabilities available and this includes
things like reliability if something
fails your applications you have to run
scalability build support build support
deployed in support locking and support
to find your services or some naming
service supports monitoring legacy
support so these capabilities are
important for your applications and
leave a look now into how we achieve
these capabilities the important thing
is to achieve them it is a collaboration
among the open shift that provides will
feature the development stack that
provides some features and the
application and together they achieve
these capabilities we will just look
into some of them we don't have that
much time here build the capability of
built what does the application have to
do the application in our case has to
deliver either the self running jar file
or its own doctor file so that's that
it's fast then the stack allows lounge
lounge a build of a docker image ABI
Chopra now Jenkins
it allows to build the image and we have
some support to handle a cell phone in
charge means we have a basic contain
image that supports it and open shift
for this topic and allows to run the
builds on the platform the guys that
maintain spoke rims that Jenkins
infrastructure are quite happy about
that it takes a lot of CPU power for
this some learnings out of that movie
stalker it's important step one uses
caching to make the builds quick and SSD
are a good idea for for the doctor and
the incredible images are stored and in
open shift as there's a lot of security
I constraint that an application cannot
attack something you cannot run your
container as root with this causes some
problems and in as developers if you
want to do more elaborate things next
capability reliability and scalability
what is the task of the application the
application has to indicate when is a
chronic container alive and then is a
container usual alive a container that
is not alive should be killed by the
compiler infrastructure so that it
starts again and is in a better shape if
it's not usable it doesn't get requests
from the external world then the
application should also support that it
can run in multiple instances so it
shouldn't require the nodal drum and it
also has to tolerate a container crash
soup containers can crash at any time
the platform doesn't product and give
you the county that the container won't
be killed so your application has to
support that then M your application
also has to make explicit what route it
needs that means what external URLs come
to your application and internals routes
in open system specific service what
other services you need that's important
load balancing and finally we recommend
applications use some trailer vibration
patterns so that certain problems will
be solved by the application fails then
we have some support for this in the
stack here we have returned to spring
actuator to provide container aliveness
and contain the fuser better contain is
usable please please being activated
very easily done and things like the
circuit breaker component and which
implements one of the failure isolation
pad and what does open chest do open
chest ensures that any instances are
alive and if some instances are dead at
a certain time it kills them so that
again n will be right and you can
increase then or decrease nmsu you want
it openshift also does load balancing
for the external and where else arriving
but also internally if you use another
application in on position and as open
tisk can supervise your load on your
containers and if they sort of load it
can scale up so it can increase n and
then you have more cable can handle more
load so one learning is that the
difficult a nurse can be killed at any
time and when other learning is that we
have to distinguish between analyze a
usable container and we tend also to
publish information about more details
ages of the container that use
interesting for people I am seeing
whether the applications runtime
deployment and in particular the rolling
upgrade deployment what is in the
responsible of the application the
application has to update a database and
schema 28 time something has to change
it in the task of the application it
should support backward compatibility of
the database and if other parties are
using the application it has to provide
either backward compatibility or offer
multiple versions of it service for the
ddl updates we have fly during the step
so the application automatically updates
the database whenever the schema is in
the wrong version and whiskey's
recognition basis and things with visa
requirements of the application and the
step open taste will end orchestrate the
rolling upgrade that means it will kill
one of your old services and launch a
new one and so on until you have only
the new versions running now one
challenging that respect is and we have
different in stages in projects you have
a test development stage tests age
integration stage you can have as many
as you want and if you pass from one
stage to the next we have to manage all
the configuration so that you have again
the same services running and that your
version that one sign is passed along
now mocking final topic here and the
applications task is to write locks
standard out the defined format this
correlation IDs so that requests that
belong together can be correlated and in
the stack we have pink cloud views for
four days that can be used and in
openshift you have storage and indexing
of locks and a search queen so that you
can have a look at what your quiz on
like and some learnings in this area we
had and have sometimes some issues with
overruns because if you have a lot of
logs that are written out and eventually
your network is is in the limit or your
provider is on the limit we currently
use the South solutions of the services
to an external service for that and then
other problem we still have but two
million have resolved is data protection
issues and the logs are currently not in
Europe and that you can send me a
problem
okay we already heard some of our
learnings and here are our top priority
learnings we experienced maybe the most
important learning from last year is one
container does not count what it means
an open shift you always have to be
aware that your container can fail at
any time this can can be due to
different reasons maybe your application
as an error and needs to be restarted
but it can also happen if maybe due to
hardware failures or maintenance and
your pot need to be restarted or your
container needs to be restarted on
another node in the cluster so really be
aware of that and he never go to
production until you scaled at least two
two instances also test for reliability
we do at SBB we do this on two different
levels on application level we use a
chaos monkey that randomly kills running
containers and we try to investigate how
the applications behave in case of
failover but we also do more
infrastructure reliability testing so
for example we shut down the master node
or kill some work nodes completely and
check if open chest behaves correctly in
the way that it restarts spot on other
nodes in the cluster so service on the
one hand it's really cool because we can
empower the teams everything can it be
automated you're really independent in
developing applications of course we
also try to use step-ups processes and
faults as much as you can
but it's also a bit tough because until
now the application or the engineering
team only needs to know some of the line
of code but now they really have
responsibility over the application or
container they need to know the
infrastructure maybe they need to know
the monitoring do 24 7 so there is a lot
more responsible responsibility to the
team talking about experience we also
see a lot of new technologies no sequel
databases messaging systems and we still
have a lot to learn how we can use them
what's in case of error what happens
with fixes and so on we also learned a
lot of poker be aware that if you use
the JVM in a docker container you really
need a lot of memory and beware of the
second point at the moment poker league
and the number of CPUs of your
underlying hardware to or into the
container that leads to situation where
your jvm thinks that there are 50 course
for doing garbage collection so another
ideal situation the last point I want to
mention here is infrastructure images as
we already heard openshift have some
restrictions on running containers on
the root privileges and it's not
possible or not possible default so most
of the time you end up re-engineering
some dr hopf images and add support for
running as a non-root so that's one
point you have to consider and the other
thing is when it comes to cluster
technologies based on IP addresses you
also have the problem that you you're
not guaranteed to have a fixed IP
address because your container can fail
at any time and so you cannot rely on
the IP address to build up your cluster
so you need some other ways to do this
so to summarize this up mainly three
points first time is over we need one
minute first of all we were surprised by
the success we had with open shift at
spb it's now really and challenges to
our classic websphere platforms second
point openshift itself it's really
stable and of course it's the young
product and still need some improvements
but the open source community around
open to the origin as well as the guys
from reddit do a really great job and
last thing if you use spring boot that's
the right choice it really fits nice
into the docker container openshift
ecosystem and speeds up your development
so to come to an end there are still
some rough corners here but the
direction is really promising and it's a
lot of fun to develop with open shift
thank you and please leave your feedback
at the end and if you have any questions
come to us we will we are glad to help
you thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
