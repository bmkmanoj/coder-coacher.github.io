by michael haha thank you very much
joining us Michael hi and can you
introduce yourself yeah so I'm a
computer scientist at the university of
frankfurt and i'm doing my PhD work
related to visual programming concepts
for complex simulation workflows so and
i use a lot of java technology to
accomplish that the people i think
probably familiar with you ought to be
devops conferences you bring your 3d
print yeah exactly so we're printing
exciting stuff and we also use these
visual programming environments to
create nice 3d geometries and yeah now
we print them and build small robots and
just cool stuff yeah so what are the
coolest things that you built so
depending I mean the one cool thing is
actually a fabric like object that you
can actually move when you take it out
of the printer and then also I built a
drone so I printed the drone arms they
replicate our birds phone basically from
the inner structure so and it really
shows where 3d printing can go and then
it's really usable today definitely if
you have probably save some money for
some people that they've come for
Institute from the drone racing left
yeah yeah we can from New drones one of
the challenges when it comes to 3d
printing as a programmer as a programmer
it's you want to create stuff right so
your complex geometries and I came to
the conclusion it's better to do that by
programming and so it's the problem is
writing an algorithm and still having a
visual idea of what you're getting out
of that so that's kind of the challenge
there so yeah and on the side of your
PhD in your universe yeah you've got an
exciting projects but you mean what ya
talking about earlier yeah that's
actually so I have a project called VR
else to do so we have a visual
programming environment that uses the
java reflection api to automatically
generate user interfaces from that and I
want to make programming much more
interactive and keep basically the
visual programming and the text based
programming in
sink so that you really can do stuff in
the text based programming environment
and move it to the visual and the other
way around so you don't have these
distinct phases so when when actually
programming started in like the 50 60 s
or whenever people had these punch cards
and it was a completely non interactive
process to do programming and then you
wrote a program basically by editing
these punch cards manually and then you
fed them to the computer and then you
had to load the compiler and do that and
when we moved from that to interactive
editing that was a revolution and now I
want to bring that to a level where we
can even do visual programming but it
compiles at runtime and also keeps in
sync with the actual text based
representation for bringing it from the
nineties into the 25th yeah in a way
because yeah so um the thing is that
with the visual programming editors that
we use today the ideas are quite old
like 90s or even earlier and they have a
representation like XML files and you do
specialized interfaces for that but you
don't do general-purpose programming in
that and you cannot mix both concerts
and that's what I want to accomplish
with figural paradigm shift which is
kind of well well a with you yeah yeah
and also um at the moment we use a lot
of groovy to do that so we we we get the
ast from the groovy compiler and add
this to the visualization and but we are
also looking into extending that to Java
and other popular languages so because
it's actually a concept and not a
product that that we sell or something
what they do you out with this project
very early days so virile studio can be
downloaded already so the visual
reflection thing already works great we
have it out for some yeah link below
exactly and it's just it's open source
you can just download it and also the
other parts are in the github repository
saw the really language model parts that
I'm currently working on
but these are more yeah we don't have
end user applications for left so you
can compile it and work with it and yeah
just drop us a line if you're interested
in it and it could also be interesting
to work with language developers
together because we we also try to add
new paradigms to the programming model
that you could incorporate into the
actual language so if you have visual
programming in mind we look follow it
with the following the progress on that
definitely sounds promising idea yeah
well maybe extra testing to yesterday
thanks for the interview yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
