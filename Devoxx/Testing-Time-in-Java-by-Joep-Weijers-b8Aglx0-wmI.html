joining in enjoy your lunch I'm gonna
tell you a bit about testing time in
Java
I'm your buyers I work as a build master
at top desk and at top desk we have we
create our own service management
software and we want to deliver quality
releases continuously so in my role as
build master I also educate developers
on testable code this presentation is
gonna consist of three parts first I'll
introduce the example application that I
use to explain testing time in Java the
second part will be how to unit test
this application in the third part
I'll look into end to end testing this
application so I created a simple small
time-dependent application and it's
login system really simple not very
secure but I did include one of the a
wasp recommendations namely the locking
out a user so his password can be
brute-force after too many incorrect
logins so the way I implemented this is
if you enter incorrect credentials three
times then your account gets locked for
five minutes so you can talk again not
even with the correct credentials now
the method that is that I use for this
is called five minutes ago to determine
if and five minutes have passed and this
is also the method that I look into for
the unit tests so how are we gonna unit
test this method method well we can
write a new test just take the current
time subtract yeah five minutes and call
our method and that should be the same
right well I have two problems with it's
this test one is that it's not a unit
test it's depending on the underlying
system because it cost system current
time release so by definition it's
not a unit test and the second problem
is that this is a flaky test there might
be one or more milliseconds difference
between the evaluation of the expected
and the actual result so then this test
would fail once in a while so it's not
really the way to do it and well as any
self-respecting developer I type into
Google how to test system current time
release I end up on Stack Overflow and
the answer is don't use it use your own
implementation of system current time
beliefs so that you can in your test you
can change the implementation
implementation and then yeah it will be
you can test it since Java 8 Java has
some convenience for this it's called
the Java time clock
it's a implementation of a clock you can
ask it for the current time release and
well if you pass it around through your
code either through dependency injection
or you get it as a parameter in your
time dependent code then you can use any
in your test you can use any of the
specific implementations for tests like
fixed clock or yeah slow clock so how
would the the method look like if we use
this this clock
idea well we get a clock as a parameter
we ask it for the current Millis since
the epoch and then subtract the time the
unit test will then look like this we
pick a specific point in time and then
we make a fixed clock so it's not
running always returns at the same time
and then we do our assertion so now we
solve both the problems we're no longer
dependent on system current time release
and the clock always returns same value
so there won't be any difference between
the expected any actual result well this
has some downsides the obvious one is
that you have to change your code to
pass that clock everywhere or dependency
injected
and that is really a problem if you have
code that's not under your control some
examples it's the yeah FIU till date
constructor it uses system current time
release internally so you yeah if you
use date
you can't override it
another example Google guavas cache that
might be a yeah an option to implement
the login attempts with that uses nano
time internally so so not the clock so
and another problem that we at top desk
ran into is we have a very big legacy
application that we still have to
maintain and we want to test it but it's
really infeasible to introduce to change
system current time release everywhere
and all the dependencies so we had to
come up with our own solution and we
call it the time transformer the time
transform is a little Java agent that
overrides all the calls to system
current time release and system dot nano
time and you can tell the time
transformer to use your own
implementation of time obviously the
default implementation of time is just
use current system time release and
current system dot nano time but in your
test you can use a transforming time
interface we we add in and well let's
see how we write a unit test using the
time transformer so first we make sure
that the time is the transforming time
and next we pick a same point in time
and then we use a fluent API on the
transforming time to change the time to
our specific point in time and then we
stop the clock and then afterwards we
have the same assertion again so there's
one caveat here unit tests should be
isolated so you should clean up after
yourself by restoring the original time
or your next test will go
haywire so this is a little example of
how to unit test switch and application
these methods I'm gonna look at you at
the end to end this so the simplest way
is to do a manual test and that might be
an option if you release once a year
have one big regression test then yeah
waiting for five minutes to make sure
that the time has elapsed that's fine
one board for a longer interval so if
you have to wait hours or days then it's
not really useful you can speed up the
change the time of your PC to make the
application think stuff is going faster
but this has some nasty side effects
like Outlook will go haywire your login
sessions will expire so it's not really
the best way and in addition as I told a
topdesk we like to deliver quality code
continuously so we're not going to do
manual testing so I'll grab my selenium
and we'll write a end-to-end test using
the given then given when then format so
given that the user is we start the
application we make sure the user is
logged out by logging in three times
with the incorrect potentials then when
the five minutes have expired and the
user log uses correct login then he
should be successfully logged in so yeah
for this is a presentation we're
obviously interested in when user Locker
time has expired
and we can do a naive implementation
just sleep five minutes and this might
be a valid option if you say run your
end-to-end test once per day during the
night if you don't care how long the
tests take as long as they're done in
the morning then fine this will work but
yeah we want to deliver quality software
continuously so that means we want to
run all our end-to-end tests all the
time so our solution for this end-to-end
test is also you
the time transformer so yeah this is a
black box and to end test we start up
the server in a separate process and we
just only use its yeah we use a web
browser to test it we use its 80 HTTP
api's so we need a way to communicate to
our server to tell it to change the time
in this case well the system under test
it's a web server so how do we change
state in web servers we write an HTTP
endpoint so that's what I also did in
this in this test example application
and now I change the implementation of
the user local time to call this test
/transform time and point to tell the
server to change the time so when this
is executed the server will think it's
five minutes later the endpoint in the
server looks a bit like this just parse
the time from the parameters make sure
the time is the transforming time and
then we apply our change don't put this
kind of code in production make sure
it's always behind a testing flag or
somehow because you don't want to have
this on your production systems so keep
that in mind
will the time transformer solve all your
timing problems well for us so far they
have but there are some downsides so one
of the downsides is that it's a Java
agent and you need to pass Java agents
as JVM parameters when you start up your
application on your unit tests so there
is some maven magic required so if you
use maven to get it to work and the
biggest problem I have with the time
transformer is that the best way to do
this kind of stuff test time is second
example that I showed in the unit tests
passed at Java time clock
it is wasn't feasible for us so we
created this time transformer basically
as a last resort to desk out that was
not set up for testability so should you
have a legacy application or a valid use
case for this time transformer can I use
it and yes you can we have just open
sourced it so everyone can play around
with that if you have any questions
about it feel free to grab me an in
person or to ask via Twitter and I would
also like to recommend our technical
block from top desk well if you like
this kind of technical talk which you
obviously do else you wouldn't be here
at devoxx we have some more here so feel
free to have a look around there thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
