software developers be working on an
application there was a designer
involved that she has left and the
client wants a new feature maybe the
client wants a form from text inputs and
a button what do we do how do we decide
where do we place the text well big load
the text be where we put the buttons
where do we put the forms even as a
developer we have a lot of design
decisions to make so I was working on a
project with a designer and we were
working together on these different
features and we noticed that a lot of
the time you make a design decision and
it has an influence on the development
part a major development decision and it
as an influence of the design part and
released a collaboration between the two
roles not something you can split or
hand over with a PDF so as a developer I
find it really interesting and also
really practical to know a little bit
about design myself and for this talk
remember i'm just a developer I'm not a
designer but I spent some time into
looking into practical details that I
can use that make my work as a developer
easier when it comes towards design and
this talk I would like to discuss a few
of those practical details so first of
all when we talk about design in this
talk we mean the design of the
interaction between the user and the
product so for instance the design of a
website or a mobile application why is
this important well design has a big
influence on what the use of things of
your product it's about communication
with the design you can tell your user
how your application works and for
instance what kind of actions to perform
to get certain functionality the goal of
the site of design is to give your user
information in an efficient but also in
a please above a
you want to get the attention of the
user and you want to be able to have a
clear communication with your user so
design is important because it can make
your product stand out amongst other
products it also gives you the
opportunity to provide the unique
selling point think about Apple they
designed stuff different than other
stuff like an audio player and gave them
the unique selling problems it also
gives you the ability to provide trust
in your application remember a few years
back when it was still not common to buy
stuff in the internet you look at the
website and you thought do I trust this
website and I'm going to give them my
money to buy a product from them you
want to use design to make information
easier to find to make your applications
user friendly and also bet designs will
make people go away so design is
communication and one of the main forms
of communication is text and the
majority of the web contains of text so
let's start a text first actually when
you look at text then choosing the right
phones but also the rightful size makes
it text easier to read and people
actually feel better when reading the
text and it will also be able to read
the text faster and the you the reason
behind this is that our eyes follow a
natural pattern and reading text and
with your design challenges around
phones or size you can go with this
pattern with yoga also can go against
this pattern which makes it text harder
to read this is why it is important to
choose the correct sizes and the correct
forms so there are literally thousands
and thousands of forms to choose from so
how do you make the selection of phones
now basically we have two groups of
forms we have some cell phones and cell
phones and the cell phones they have
little endings at the end of the stroke
and the Sun set of rooms are those
without so the forms of the top are the
song Sarah forms and the forms at the
bottom are the cell phones
and the basic rule is if you have a
heading or just single text and you want
to text to stand out you use some Sarah
forms but if you have big blocks of text
so for instance a body you use a Sarah
phones because of the line endings they
look better if you have a lot of words
or a lot of letters in the text so what
is helpful is if you don't have a lot of
forms to choose from but you limit
yourself to certain proofing
combinations so for instance these are
three proven combinations of homes that
work well together the combinations of
some cell phones and cell phones which
you can use for headings and body pics
so to start your design you can say we
just use two phones and it should be a
proof of combination and whenever you
need text you just choose either of the
phones so you don't go choosing new
phones for every text you make just
limit yourself to really a small set it
will take some research about what kind
of forms you like but you can even reuse
these combinations in different
applications or even on your resume or
in a presentation okay now that we have
chosen our phones we want to choose the
size and you shouldn't do this random
body I one trick to use is that you can
have a range of sizes and you just limit
your design to this range of sizes this
is a range in where the smaller phones
is seventy-five percent of the bigger
one so we use a fixed proportion to
determine the sizes in our range so then
we get 16 21 28 and so forth this gives
you less variables to choose from and it
actually this limitation will make a
design clearer and more consistent
because you're not just random picking a
font size you're actually if you want
the smaller you just go a whole step
down or if you want a bigger you go a
whole step up and there
the reason that we use a fixed
proportion and that's the topic we are
going to prefer next because proportion
has a big influence on how your
application design is perceived
sometimes you see something and you get
the feeling that it's just right are
usually this is caused by the fact that
the proportions are chosen correctly so
if you look at the example on the left
it looks much more dull than the
examples on the right these look much
more interesting and lively and you
probably have heard of the golden ratio
the golden ratio is about sixty-two
percent it's a proportion and it's
actually funny it's not proven that the
coda ratio is the best ratio apparently
it's somewhere between sixty and eighty
percent so a ratio between sixty and
eighty percent makes lots more
interesting and we for the previous
slide for the sizes we used seventy-five
percent so what more can you do with
proportions well I have a look at the
Twitter logo this was actually designed
by using circles of a fixed proportion
and there's a bigger circle and a
smaller circle and the smaller circles
is sixty percent of sixty percent of the
bigger one so instead of just taking
sixty percent one step was skipped
without that also works so you can use
these proportions to create images or to
create logos and you can do much more
stuff with it you can also determine how
big your white space areas will be or
where to put items on a page you can
make a frame or proportion with boxes to
lay out your items on the page
another powerful form of communication
is cooler if you look at the three faces
the design is exactly the same except
from the color but we immediately know
that green is good and red is bad so
polar can really be strong influence on
our user perceives your design the nice
thing with color is that they are
associated with teams and they also
trigger emotions so think for instance
if you have a brand and you want people
to trust your brand you can use a bluish
color but if you want to be perceived as
youthful or both think about coca-cola
Nintendo Lego you would use red as a
cola so when you go on choosing its
color first think what kind of emotion
do you want to trigger when the user
sees your design and an important thing
about Golar is you shouldn't overdo it
actually if you look at the screen of
your phone just the icons of the apps
the bigger brands they probably only
have one color and then white or black
or grey so Facebook the icon is just
blue for instance LinkedIn's blue and
white so if you pay attention you see
that the big brands only use one or two
colors and then together with some gray
scale from white gray to black the most
used colors are red blue grey and yellow
and in general we distinguish warm
colors like reds and blue colors are
cold colors like blue and what happens
is that a warmer colors they tend to pop
so if you look at the design and
something is red it looks if it comes to
what you and if something is blue it
looks that it's line further away so
with this color you can also influence
how you look at the picture and how the
composition is perceived
so limited amounts of colors and use
gray white or black two complementary
colors if you need a little bit more
variation in the design so let's do a
little quiz this is a brand color and I
want to know if you can recognize which
of the three brands use this color so
who thinks this could be a starbucks no
one won anyway too okay baby what's up
three okay uber one okay I don't think
it's statistically to significant but
the most amount of people chose what's
up it's actually what's up uber is I
think gray gray bluish and starbucks is
really a dark green so people recognize
your brand by the color so it also works
the other way around so think about this
when you pick a color ok so to summarize
this if you have to pick a phone don't
go looking at Google homes and look at
all the phones stick with a few proofing
combinations you can google for this
they're even tici tici to PDFs with just
a few proven combinations and they will
be combinations of serif and some set of
phones if you choose phones for the web
use at least 16 points 12 is already too
small people perceive bigger test better
bigger text better than smaller text so
16 you're bigger and use a range of
sizes so don't reduce random sizes take
a proportion make your scale of all the
sizes and use that whenever you use your
text in the design make use of
proportions so stick to a fixed
proportion and when you have to lay out
your items on a page you can just make
boxes of these proportions and then you
can make a composition based on the
boxes but even if you do more
complicated stuff stick to discuss
portions and finally colors again be
consistent don't overdo it just pick one
or two colors and complement with gray
white or black so the basic the summary
of summaries that's what we saw this
morning I think in one of the talks is
be consistent because otherwise your
design will look not really nice it will
look a bit rough so consistency really
is the key any questions thank you very
much for attending</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
