how everyone say thanks for giving up
some of your your lunch time so my name
is Charles Davis I work for Microsoft in
the visual studio team in the UK our
visual studio technical specialist and
so I guess very quickly what I want to
talk about here really today is how
you're not going to see Visual Studio
the IDE but I want to show you how with
both the visual studio tools so the
backend tools but also as you how
Microsoft has really changed and how
we're very happy to and want to support
other technologies and platforms other
than iron stack so that's really the
intent quickly for today first foul on
that is he probably aware of some of
these but Microsoft is my only slide by
the way off this on a demo the Microsoft
really has quite fundamentally changed
it's a very genuine change over the last
few years and so I picked out a few
examples that one top right is very
famous now Satya our CEO in front of
Microsoft loves Linux slide 8 for as you
or our cloud platform about 30% of the
workload on on Azir is Linux and so it's
a very significant platform in terms of
how it's being used on our tools and
platforms as well if you're looking at a
zero civically there is a whole Java
developer center and so everything
that's available all the services are
available within Azir whether that's
things like cognitive services or
storage or data or compute or if they
might be we're all accessible and
available to Java developers and so
there's an entire Java developer center
there and you may not be aware that
Microsoft also did things like we've
joined the Eclipse Foundation as well
and so we're working to put tooling
inside other IDs so and generally we are
approaches if there's a community if
that's a useful thing to join will join
it and will contribute it to it so
whether it's open source or not whatever
the conditions might be and that's what
we want to do but what I thought I'd do
is just give you a quick demo in the
time then we have available I'm just
saying you get a sense of potentially
what I'm talking about so
drop out of the slides hmm and the
example I just want to give you like
most things as many many variations that
we could see here but if I've got a very
simple java rap here doesn't do anything
jiggly exciting but if I log in and
remember my password there we go let's
try that again is all I want to do is
show sort of a from a sort of DevOps
each IP example is let's go in and make
simple change let's go and change that
text and so that we can see a change to
flow it out and this app is deployed on
a machine running in as you it's a Linux
machine that's running inside our cloud
and if I going to have a look at it it's
actually this guy here this GD Tomcat
that I've called it and it's a Linux box
running inside as year and it's got
Tomcat my seek all that kind of stuff
installed on it so what I want to do
here is if I was to let's go and there's
my dog okay is if I was to go and open
up eclipse it's coming here and to make
a simple change like that what I'm going
to do is come in here and let's say it's
not my dashboard but the dashboard this
is a Java project I happen to be using
maven and the source who's going to go
back into github so we we support get
within our tooling but in this case I'm
saying use github so just as an example
so what I'm going to do let's do this
really simply is I'm just going to say
let's just push that change across say
that I've updated the title and we'll go
and push that into into github and then
what I've set up and I'll show you this
in a minute and we'll look at a bit more
of the details but is what I've set up
is inside visual studio team services
which is this set of tooling here this
is cloud-based support for your entire
project and so what I've got here is a
dashboard I just met a little bit bigger
I've created a dashboard that's giving
me some oversight over things like
builds and releases in this case you
don't need to but but in this case what
I've decided to do is say that actually
we're going to watch for any commits to
github and if there is a committing to
github then we'll kick off a build
your continuous integration running
essentially here but actually I've
delegated that out Jenkins so what I've
said is you don't need to be using all
of our tools within this stack either so
here what this is doing is saying yeah
recognize there's being a commit
now go and delegate this out to Jenkins
and so this is my Jenkins instance and
we can see that there's a job running
inside here and if I look at my github
repository and just refresh that and we
can see that that's the the file that I
just updated so my Jenkins instance is
just completed we've got a build so
that's been completed inside there I can
see the build successful I can go and
look at the details of it who kicked it
off etcetera and then the next step that
I'm using here is I'm using our release
capability to sell now I like to push
that out into my environments and so
what we're seeing here is that this is
now in progress in the development
environment and if I dive into release
54 we can see it more that again so
we're in progress in dev and if I just
can't have a look at the logs for a
second just explain what's going on and
what it is doing is just basically
saying go and get hold of the altitude
of the build when you see in this case
was from Jenkins and then go and first
of all I've said provision the
environment so we're using in this
example infrastructure as code so
something we refer to as armed templates
as a JSON file that says this is what I
expect to exist in the cloud in this
case what I've said is either create or
make sure it exists a Linux box which is
running Tomcat and my sequel and then
having done that which is what it's
doing at the moment it's just making
sure that exists is then going to deploy
that app out into Tomcat so here we're
doing provisioning then deployment we
could also run tests and we could go in
sort of deep revision and so on as well
so just while it's doing that if I go
back and look at the definition of that
for example this is how I've defined it
so I've said I've got a dev QA and UAT
environment you have a Zen easy like
call them what you want and then within
the dev environment this is the
provision step and what I'm saying is
going you don't carry out an action
in this case creator update the resource
group and I'm using what as you terms
these arm templates and so I are what
I'm saying there is run this jail or
basically use this Jatin file and that
is the definition of the machine or the
environment that I want to deploy to so
that's what it's picking up on and then
I'm just dropping in a task to say
actually deploy the war file that was
created in the build into as you into
the Tomcat instance in his ear and I can
choose from a library of tasks so I
could choose as a whole load of as your
specific tasks as you might expect up
there but I can also integrate with
other tools and technologies and so it
might be and we've got a lot of
customers that use this essentially as
an orchestration engine to say when
these things happen then go and do these
things and those other steps might be
integrating rather technologies like
chef or octopus things like that may be
deploying out into orchestration
services like Cuba Nettie's or strain to
docker integrating with third-party
tools etc there's a whole load of stuff
you can use if you can't find it there
then we've got a marketplace and that's
a community site where there's a lot of
of other extension so have a look giving
you'll be nice if you could just do this
at this stage somebody else may well
have done that and so you can extend it
using that but if I go back into our
release I should have finished by now we
can see that it succeeded in the dev
environment go back to the logs we can
see all of that succeeded so if I go
back into into my dashboard and we
refresh then we can see that my code
change has made it into this dev
environment so those the only Microsoft
this if you like that I'm using choosing
to use and this is the orchestration
tooling in the form of team services and
as you're in the form of the platform
that I'm deploying to but all of those
are adjustable so you don't need to use
you know any combination of that or or
anything within that and if I go back to
the release and what if I when keep
progressing it but it's now sitting and
it's saying the
I've set up approvals I don't want this
to automatically deploy to the QA
environment I'm saying that somebody
should come in and approve that and so
as a pre-deployment approval I could
defer that so the typical scenario I'd
say around that might be maybe I'm a
member of the QA team I'm a tester et
cetera means I'd be very happy to take
this latest release we're in the middle
of a test run so if we could perhaps
deploy it tomorrow night pick a date and
time whatever that might be then that
can take place and we'll start the test
run after that's being deployed so you
can use that not only to just get the
the key approvals but also defer and say
this isn't the right time for this to
come into that environment if we don't
do that here but I just say this is OK
for for QA approve that and then that
will start the same process but this
time in the way I've set this up into a
separate QA environment running in the
cloud so you can start to control that
in in that way the I guess the last
piece of the puzzle let's go the right
way okay is although I don't need it for
this example
is how do we also reach back into
perhaps the tools you're using things
like Eclipse and IntelliJ and so we've
we've got extensions that you can
download and this bizzy's what we refer
to as the the team Explorer everywhere
and so if you want to access things like
product backlog items bugs that kind of
thing you can access them from within
your IDE so in this case I'm already
using that I'm just using git the sort
of get level integration we're picking
it up from there but there's that
ability to reach back into the
information that's stored in team
services you can access that inside
eclipse we've got the equivalent
integration into IntelliJ IDEA as well
and we we want to continue to support
with those so we're not trying to
provide a new Java IDE more monsters
support the ones that you're using and
adding those capabilities so those have
you can use them so that's a very quick
gamble through hopefully just so you get
a sense of what I'm talking about key
thing as I say here is the we can build
release pretty much any technology any
xx platform
I happen to chosen as you hear we're
very happy to support Linux if you're
interested in things like containers
Micra services and a deeper look at
these you side of this there's a longer
session tomorrow I think it's the
10-10-10 session whatever it is there's
no zero session then which we're going
to do sort of for an hour so please come
along to that if you're interested above
on that just wanted to let's quickly go
back into the slides and now just should
be I guess the sides be right available
if you're interested in a sort of case
study I just saw this one actually
yesterday by sheer chance and so this is
an organization that's done pretty much
what I just walk through and this is a
this is the output of the hack that link
so it steps you through how they've set
it up how they've integrated Jenkins
deploying a java app using J for org
actually an artifact terrine as a stuff
so if you're interested in that that's
there but on that and just throw it over
to you guys for questions if you're
interested we have more at the stand to
come if you want ask other questions
I'll be at the stand today and tomorrow
there's a Microsoft stem there's more of
us there as well I've also got a few as
you ER passes so it must be some dollar
conversion rate bizarrely they're 68
pounds worth of free is your time and
but Sophie only of those ask me
questions I'll give them away on that I
see we've got three minutes left so Oh
so thank you very much your time there
throw it over to you guys if there's any
questions that I can answer in this
quick session
Irani yes yeah so just in terms of the
two of these to do the build and the
releases that was the team services yes
and then it's optional taster it's
optional whether you use
Jenkins or absolutely it just the team
services is the thing that links all the
yeah absolutely good yeah so to make
that a little bit clearer and sorry cuz
I'm rushing through on time but yeah
absolutely so team like most things is
there's a great deal of options within
that but essentially what the team
services is providing is the the over
the overall project support and so that
can include all very much set up in this
one that we include things like Kanban
boards for backlogs
all your charting reporting all that
kind of thing and we also we do support
I happen to put the JSON files in a git
repository in team services but I chose
to put the source code of actually
deployed in github so in fact there's no
source code in this project but that was
my choice and when the exactly as you
say when you come to things like builds
if I was to go and set up a build that's
a release let's come under that on a
second if I was to come set up a bills
just to give you an idea of some of the
options is you could say well actually I
want to create a build based on and
Gradle maven whatever happens to be and
let's choose one of those randomly
within that you can then also choose
where is my source code if the inside
team services or is it sitting
externally some would say absolutely so
yeah we've got a whole range of
customers using it and lots of different
ways there and essentially our you know
our concept there is use the tools that
you find useful if you've got stuff
you're using today carry on using it
it's not a rip and replace for those go
and put stuff around that if that's
suitable use the whole off you wanting
but yeah you good money for questions
say again I was going to fling it at
youth but probably hit your eyes I think
so there you go any others before I and
I'm close on time any other questions
yeah yeah yeah that's really good
question she said yeah absolutely and in
fact the same applies for for Eclipse
and IntelliJ as well is the so turning
on what you want to do obviously as you
provides a whole raft of things pretty
much yeah absolutely so so there are for
example you know let's say you want to
trace an app service a so it's basic
most basic thing would be a web
application then there's a download then
inside Visual Studio absolutely you can
do file new project blah blah blah there
are templates for that and they're also
extensions you can add into eclipse as
well for example to do exactly the same
thing so yeah but a lot of that is
covered I mean there's some really nice
stuff actually to combining all of this
in that sign show today but if you're
doing for example containers is you can
right-click inside visual CD and say set
up continuous delivery and it will
create the build and release flows for
you and point you back to zero
service that kind of thing I don't know
if there's any touch on those areas so
yeah so definitely bit again some free
Azir money as a that's right okay and
you want to think I'm a probably out of
time if there's any more happy to take
them if not come and see me we're out
the stand and there's other people
covering other areas as well but I very
much thanks you time thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
