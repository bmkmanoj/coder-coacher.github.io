you today I like to start a little bit
of scotch feel it helps me speak a
little easier a little water probably
too much my name is Matt Rabil and I am
an old-fashioned Java developer I'm a
hick from the sticks I grew up in the
backwoods of Montana no electricity no
running water I had to walk two miles to
the bus stop every day and yes it was
uphill both ways I have two children an
11 year old and a 13 year old so I do
have a teenager now I also have a middle
child known as a 66 21 window bus it's
been 11 years so it's I bought it you
can see a picture there and yellow
I used to say it'll be done in a few
more months now it'll be a few more days
so I thought it'd be done by this
conference but unfortunately not to help
fill the gap my wife and I bought a 4x4
bus that blue one in the background also
known as a synchro and and I bought it
because I wanted a bus that run so
that's pretty nice but enough about me
what about you
how many Java developers do we have here
today that's about 95 percent of the
room how many people have been doing web
development for 20 years 20 years yep we
got six of you seven how many have been
doing it for 10 years okay so that's a
good portion probably a third of the
room how many just started in the last
year nobody okay
well got some experience in the room how
many people use JSF we've got about 25
keep your hands up if you like it
hey there's some hands that stayed up
what about GWT anyone using wit we got
about 10 or 15 okay how many people like
JavaScript this is way more than most
conferences get so congratulation there
that's about I'd say 20% of the room so
if you've been doing web development
since the 1990s
are you still hip is the question and
and if you're someone like me an old
stodgy old fashioned Java developer then
then probably not but do you want to be
a hip Java developer and if you do one
of the easiest ways to do that is to use
Java 8 there's parallel collections
there's jsr support with the date and
time API there's functional interfaces
there's lambdas all right there's a lot
of neat things there that make
programming in Java a lot easier there's
even natural in the JavaScript engine if
you want to write JavaScript on the JVM
that's supported so let's define what a
hipster it a hipster is one who is
exceptionally aware or interested in the
latest trends and tastes so in Java land
there's some latest trends there's
annotations right we used to have XML
hell now we have annotation hell but
they're better than XML and they get you
a little closer to you know the code
that you're writing
there's environments for dev test and
production and this is even you know
part of the Java EE spec now but a lot
of people use this to build their
applications and have different
environments and different profiles
there's micro services there's container
list deployment and monitoring all those
are you know pretty new things and
pretty hip things in Java LAN spring has
one of the best track records for
hitting us in Java LAN they've got this
spring boot product now that's been
around for a couple years I started
using it and I guess late 2013
Josh long actually demoed it to me at
devoxx he was very excited about it so
that was nice
imbeds Tomcat and jetty or undertow
directly so you don't deploy it to a
container you can but you certainly
don't have to and it provides
opinionated starter palms to simplify
your maven configuration and if you're
using Gradle that's supported as well
and an automatically configure spring
whenever possible provides
production-ready features metrics health
checks externalized configuration in
fact I used it on a project in late 2013
mostly because of the externalized
configuration which allowed you to
basically deploy to different
environments and configure you know the
different end points or the different
database configuration outside of the
actual jar or war file so that's pretty
cool no cogeneration no requirement for
XML and Grails three is even based on
spring boot so they have this thing
called spring initializer that allows
you to get started to spring boot really
easy I'm you can use curl you can use
your browser you can use IntelliJ IDEA
how many people have not heard of Spring
boot nobody okay how many people have
that's just to see who's sleeping so
okay well I'm going to do a real quick
demo I'll try to do it under a minute or
two here I gotta adjust my monitors
first I've got some things out of whack
then we go to mirror everything okay you
guys see everything okay thumbs up
alright I got this weird headset here
okay
so fire up IntelliJ how many people like
eclipse
oops ten
how about NetBeans geared ins in here no
there's three that's good
so spring a neutralizer it doesn't
require to login to the Apple Store
luckily but IntelliJ comes with this
nice little spring initializer feature
so we'll just create you know we don't
need anything too crazy we'll take the
web and we'll take the JPA and we'll go
with the latest version it's pretty
slick and we'll just call this demo and
it basically allows you there's an
application class that gets created not
application properties this demo
application and within here you know
there's not a whole lot of code but if
you add a POJO so this is just a simple
blog and you add a repository that's all
you need with JPA to do a repository
with spring JPA and then we add a
command line runner that just basically
prints out repositories that are in
there
can go in here create a new data dot
sequel file inserts a couple values in
there go into our poem XML we add h2 and
then back to our demo application and we
can even create a controller and that's
all you need to develop a REST API
basically with spring but-- so you know
we get 80 lines of code there
and we can start it up and curl local
host oh we got to do blogs there it is
so now one of the fastest REST API is
you can create in the business so that's
pretty cool I change my mirroring
preferences here back to not mirrored so
quiet so you know just by doing that I
feel pretty hip starting to feel a
little hipper when I got here so put on
my converse not going to time because
that takes a little longer but you might
notice we're in skinny jeans for you all
so the latest trends in web development
we got Java MVC frameworks css3 with
animations mobile first development
front-end optimization which I've been
on so many projects where this is
something that people just don't do in
the beginning where you can do expires
headers or gzipping or you can do
compression of your or concatenation of
your JavaScript files and all that and
it's it's just so easy to do and you can
get so much faster you eyes out of it
and I encourage you especially gzipping
and expires headers and rest api so you
know those are something that are almost
ubiquitous now and we're progressing
towards reactive api is you know rest
isn't the greatest thing but it's pretty
darn good so angularjs is one of the
hottest if not the hottest JavaScript
MVC framework out there if you look at
Google Trends you can compare it to
ember j/s react.js knockout backbone and
it's just way off the charts compared to
those JavaScript frameworks
if you look at regular Java frameworks
spring MVC JavaServer faces quit its
even catapulted way beyond those and
doing a lot better than those are just
you know more popular it's more
headlines and if you look at the most
starred projects on github on github we
have bootstrap as number one and we have
angular as number three free programming
books by the way number two was not
aware of that but you can go out there
and you know download those are parent
lis this is from you know just yesterday
so very you know new information so when
it be hip if someone took all these cool
projects spring boot and angular and
married them together and you know had
bootstrap in there and and it was all
you know working nicely together well
Julian Dubois and his hip team did it J
hipster so J hipster is a technology
clap stack that basically produces an
application that uses those three
frameworks so it comes with responsive
web design by default html5 boilerplate
is in there Twitter bootstrap is in
there it's now just called bootstrap
angularjs internationalization with
angular translate it's got sass support
if you want it you don't have to use it
it's got web socket support if you want
it with spring WebSocket uses yelman to
generate the project which gives you you
know easy installation of JavaScript
files and if you don't need you know a
single page application was something
like angular you can use timely for its
template engine to generate web pages so
anything you can do in spring boot you
could do with J hipster because they
aren't really doing anything on top of J
or you know as a augmentation of spring
boot they're just building on it so it's
a complete you know spring application
with all that stuff in there and it's
ready to go into production it's got you
know the metrics built in it's got eh
cache or hazel cast you get a choice
between those it's got the HTTP session
clustering if you want it was with hazel
cast it's got optimized static resources
has just got all this you know good
stuff in there and so if we look at the
project as of October 2015
275 pageviews just on its website in
October so it's got a lot of people
looking at ten
downloads' 2961 stars if we get you know
five more from this then I'll be happy
and 159 contributors so it's it's very
much one of those open source projects
that's not really owned by anyone it's
very much made from a community of
people you know trying to make it easier
for other developers to basically you
know use this kind of stuff so that's
pretty cool
and I'm tired of this tie so I got a
better one
I feel like I'm wearing this headset so
some point I could just take it off
remind me if I do so you can compare it
to JBoss Forge if you want their number
of stars they only have 158 so J hipster
doing pretty well twice the number of
stars is wildfly in fact the Downloads
130,000 since it started just since I
started you know downloaded or recording
download statistics this year I already
mentioned all the different foundational
frameworks project options Java 7 or
maven Gradle how many people use maven
that's like 60% of the room how many
people use make really not one ok Gradle
Gradle fans the other 40% okay and then
you can choose from authentication type
so it's pretty cool that you can use
cookie based authentication traditional
you know session based authentication
you can also use token-based
authentication or you can use OAuth 2
sequel or no sequel using MongoDB or
Cassandra or any of the sequel databases
caching each cache or hazel caste grunt
or gulp like I said it's got
authentication and security built in
spring boot metrics dashboard it's got
all that integrated so let's look at
just a demo of a couple applications
I've written
so the first one we're going to look at
just to kind of show off its features is
21 points so if you log into this one
login as admin someone change the admin
password now see that or the mmm
look at a different one right good thing
I have to
now I'm connected so we're in so this is
just you know some of the features that
come out of the box here's what user
management looks like it's got a user
tracker this doesn't really show up when
you're using a stateless mechanism if
use in session based you would see it
metrics so it shows you know all these
metrics that are provided by spring boot
but don't really come with a UI and it
shows how much you know heap is being
used or HTTP requests all the statistics
for all the different services and even
your eh cast statistics it's got health
checks shows of my emails down but
database elastic search and everything's
up configuration you can actually tweak
this on the fly and audit so you see you
know who logged in and if they're
successful or not and even logging this
is a very handy feature in the sense
that you can control your logging you
can switch from info to debug on a
particular you know org dot spring
framework and it will actually update in
real time that's a feature log back but
they provide you know UI here for it so
you know that's that's basically you
know it and then there's account and
password all those are standard things
as well as you know switching to a
different language ships with English
and French out of the box those are kind
of neat
and Yaman Yaman is basically a workflow
that compromisers or builds on three
different types of tools the scaffolding
tool called yo gotta like that name
yo build me something the build tool
grunt gulp and a package manager like
Bauer and NPM so it's easy installation
new JavaScript libraries with Bauer
it's build an optimization with grunt or
gulp and it's testing with karma and
phantom Jas so it doesn't really invent
anything new there it's just leveraging
stuff that's in the JavaScript ecosystem
already how many people have heard of
browsersync
ok we got about five or six I don't
think I'm plugged into any audio but I
have this video here we'll see how it
sounds Oh browsers whatever your fault
this is when you take off your hit there
right so for example if we got a class
here and hit safe all browsers are
reloaded this works for CSS to be really
this example we are compiling sass into
CSS and then browser sync
we also synchronize scroll position as
well as clicks and form inputs we have a
user interface that allows you to toggle
sync options on or off as well as track
history and push URLs to devices
and we also offer remote debugging using
the popular winery project as well as
some simpler CSS helpers and a latency
throttler so that you can test your
website on a slower connection browser
sync is a free project it's open source
it's installed on the command line via
NPM and we encourage you to check it out
so if you're not using it I definitely
use it it basically saves you from
hitting f5 or Shift reload and it just
does it for you all day long and so all
you have to do especially if you're
using something like the latest Mac with
El Capitan and you have the split string
going you can be developing in one
screen as soon as you hit save the other
screen reloads it's pretty awesome saves
you you know at least a few minutes a
day so now I want to you know show you
what J hipster does and create a small
application with it
and you know using yo J hipster so my
goals with this demos it's 610 right now
I hope to be able to do all this in 30
minutes so generate a basic blog
application cried entities and then add
some security features and deploy to
Heroku I've never pulled off the deploy
to Heroku in a presentation so let's see
if we get there today so we're going to
start with this simple demo application
it's got a name an email and a blog
which is you know name and a handle and
then an entry which has title content
date and then we can have tags on those
so you know one-to-many many-to-many
relationships and all that so we'll get
set up here close this one get our
mirroring back
so we don't need IntelliJ right away
close everything down okay how's that
font can you read it in the back or you
want a bigger it's okay all right
so we'll start with the oj hipster it
was the base name your application so
this is a new feature that just got
added how many people have used Yaman
before in a project raise your hands so
probably 10 or 20 about a third of the
room one of the things that does that
I'm not used to as a Java developer is
it creates the project in your current
directory and it creates them with a
bunch of dot files for like configuring
IntelliJ or configuring jeaious lint and
things like that so right now you'll
notice that I'm about to create it in my
home directory and it's about to put all
kinds of files like in my home directory
that I don't want so just in the last
week someone added the feature that it
basically defaults to the name of your
current directory so because of that I
know that hey it's mr Abel and I don't
want to be in there so it's a great
feature they just added if you make a
directory and then CD into it that's the
best way to do it and then it defaults
to that directory name so we're going to
do org J hipster we'll go ahead and just
choose some defaults here sequel I like
Postgres in production I'll use h2 in
development I'm you can use the H cache
or hazel castile let's go with the H
cache search engine yep elastic search
clustered HTTP nope spring WebSockets
nope
I'll go with maven grunt or gulp I'll
just go with grunt because it's
recommended I don't need sass right now
translation support yes and gatling or
cucumber I'll go with Gatling and so now
if you thought may even download the
Internet
holy cow NPM like that thing downloads
the internet and all its friends to like
if I did a line of code count on the
node modules directory after it runs
everything that thing is huge it's
there's over
the in lines of code in this project
that I just created after everything
runs and at least may even like puts it
somewhere you don't remember about right
it's in your m2 repository directory if
anyone doesn't know there's a there's a
new maven central mirrored at Google so
this is maven central debt storage
Google API is calm I did some tests I
wrote a blog post about it earlier this
week it's about 25% faster than maven
central so if you use it and you're
downloading a lot of jars you might get
you know a couple minutes back in your
day so if we go ahead and open this
project
how many people like IntelliJ is new
licensing scheme nobody it's only 89
bucks to upgrade it's not too bad so we
got a lot of stuff you know downloading
NPM still going here luckily I I ran
this beforehand so some of the jars
already downloaded but if we look at the
project it's got a bunch of neat
features here you'll see I didn't even
know that you could have an editor
config but it'll configure indent style
spaces versus tabs
it'll configure for certain files to to
indent by two instead of four for JSON
files so there's kind of some neat
configurations in there and it basically
overrides or configures it right out of
the box for intelligent recognizes that
there's some other ones in here browse
our RC tells it where the bower files
are this is what you'll send to people
when you have issues with J hipster the
co - RC JSON it basically has all those
choices you selected when you create the
project so if you want to create similar
projects you could just have this in the
directory and run that yo J hipster and
it creates all that for you and if we
look at you know all the things that
come with this project it's got a
standard you know spring boot
application Java with different profiles
configured it's got some logging it's
got some async in there it's got
configuration for elasticsearch database
ace cloud database so it ships you know
with all these things for you
out-of-the-box security for Ajax based
security even a mail service and API is
for account nada ting and logging and
all that so you know it's pretty great
and even we recently added maven wrapper
so you don't have to have maven install
it if you don't want to you could just
use that and then you know here's the
palm with all the the different
dependencies so a lot bigger than your
standard spring boot palm but the
greatest thing is there's no real J
hipster code in here right you own this
all this code it's not downloading any J
hipster dependencies so you know you
could send this to your boss and be like
I wrote ten thousand lines of code today
check it only took like five minutes and
PM was the thing that took the longest
so if you look here you know three
minutes 43 seconds for it to do the NPM
stuff I don't know this this is a funny
demo because it justit's an account
right how many files it's mostly that
node modules directory so I'll leave
that going we don't want that one that's
in case I really mess up so we can
create some entities here so what do you
want to name the field we want to add a
field name it name string validation
rules yep minimum length 10 next one yet
we said that handle string validation
yep and no more relationships yeah user
has one name of the relationship yep
that's fine we're going to allow any to
one we're going to use the login field
and we're going to have another one when
I call this entry we haven't created yet
and we're going to allow one too many
then that's it and you can generate a
DTO if you want if you'd like to have
wrappers around your objects it supports
that I'm not going to do it then we're
not going to have that many blog so I'm
not going to create the pagination so
those are the files that creates there's
not that many Java files because we've
been doing Java long enough that people
like the spring folks have figured out
how to make it so we just write a couple
lines of code for our repositories and
the biggest class in here is probably
that resource class we're developing the
API but everything else is pretty small
and then there's a whole bunch of
javascript and HTML generated for you
that follows a lot of the angular best
practices and you'll even notice at the
bottom there there's some JSON files
which are the translation mechanisms or
the translation files so then how it
works and I only know this because I
messed it up a few times is if you're
creating something like a blog and it
has entries and then you have tags if
you if you want to create the entries
that have tags for some reason it's in
the documentation and I wrote it down
somewhere I just can't articulate it
that well it doesn't work basically so
you have to create the tag class first
it's basically the non owning entity you
create the owning entity last and since
entry owns tags then we create that last
so that's with many to many
relationships so with the tag we're
going to add a field we're going to call
it name string yep required that's it
and then it has a relationship to entry
and it's many to many is it the owner no
and I'm not using DTS sure we'll put an
infinite scroll on that and then we'll
do the entry this has a title string
validate yup required we have content
and then we have the last one which is
date we'll do that as a zoned date time
part of the Java 8 API we'll make that
required then we have relationship with
the blog and we have a many to one and
then we want to use the name when we
show that and then we have a
relationship to tags many to many then
we do on that we want to use name
okay so that create a bunch of files for
us so if we go back here we can look at
our domain and we can see blog was
created and true is created tag was
created and as well using liquid base it
created a number of files for creating
those tables so here's the blog table
tag table entry table and since it's a
standard spring boot app we can look for
that application class we can just run
it well it's still building something
back here the old updating indices oh
it's done that's nice so start it up
take a look at it make sure it has you
know what we want
so there we are comes with two users out
of the box it tells you that right there
you got an admin and a user so if we log
in as admin see that we can go to the
entities we can create a new blog call
it admins blog admin and we'll assign it
to that admin and we'll create a user's
blog sign to the user and create a
couple entries
the beer is great my name comes with a
calendar picker that's actually this is
part of you know html5 so if you specify
it input type equals data does that for
you we'll say 6:00 p.m. and we'll assign
it to that users blog but we need some
tags let's go create some tags will go
devoxx J hipster beer travel fun then
we'll go and create another entry we
flew Icelandic air we love them they
give you nice pillows and blankets and
they go through Reykjavik so we'll make
this one this was on Monday we left
Denver around 4:30 p.m. and we'll put
this on the users blog as well and then
we'll add one for the administrator he's
all mad this admins rule
we'll make that a bit ahead of time he's
probably up early at 4:00 in the morning
write in his blog and he's just doing it
for fun so the problem that we have here
is now you look at this we log in as you
know a user we go to the blogs and you
can see that means blog and you can edit
it so that's not good we need to lock
that down a bit
so we're going to do that is we go into
this blog resource that's been built for
us and we look at this blogs and we say
well not just find all but find by user
is current user and so this is actually
part of that blog repository they built
this in there for us this is part of je
hipster they just said hey you might
need this method so find by users
current user is already there and that
gives us the ability to say okay well
let's compile blog resource then we
refresh are we looking at entries you
ever look in the entry so we're back to
blog and now you see they only see their
blog right and if they create a new
entry same thing in this drop-down
there's only theirs so now we need to do
the same thing for entry resource
find by blog user log in order by date
descending okay I mean easy method to
remember they have this security utils
where you can get the current users
login and then this is spring data its
sweet because you can just create
methods like that and they actually
perform sequel queries behind the scenes
so you can see that's finding the blog
relationship user the login field and
then order by date descending so if we
compile this one save it compile it go
back to this one pile it now to be fair
if we were using Eclipse I wouldn't have
to compile them all right it would
compile it for me so that's pretty nice
and then if we refresh here now those
things are filtered out all right now we
can make this entries a little better if
we look at this we say well you know I
like to use HTML and I write blog posts
so the beer is great I like that it's
strong great because it is strong and
great but you'll notice it doesn't
escape that so we have to go in here and
we have to say you know where's that
entries page and where is that content
at and let's wrap that with a span ng
bind HTML and now that should work right
no so you get to look at your console
and it says you know you're using an
unsafe value in a safe context you say
okay well I know angular well enough and
I need to go here and that guess and say
ng sanitize and so angular by default
doesn't allow you to do you know precise
scripting sort of stuff in there it uses
a way of parsing that HTML and only
allowing safe HTML through so you see
there's nothing in that content right
there but if we refresh then there is
and if we were using browser sink
then we wouldn't even had to refresh so
now I'm firing up browsersync you know
back to that page cool thing is if we
went and said okay well you think you're
so smart how about putting a script tag
in there and the nice thing is that
angular smart enough not to actually
show that and parse it so that's a nice
feature of angular if we were to go back
into our entries and make that look a
little better we could take this table
out put in something a little more
readable I'll take the little thing
that's fine so this is just you know
formatting HTML changing it up a bit but
now it looks more like a blog post and
then you can edit it and that all still
works you can put you know tags around
here you could even change it so you
know that is a different type of field
so entry dialogue is where those
dialogues are and we could say well I
want a text area right instead of that
input field and then I'll give it rows
equals 10 look at there I did all it for
me right refresh and everything so
that's Bower that's not where that's a
browser sync not so much J hipster but
it's a pretty cool tool and that's
that's one of the things I encourage
people to do is there's not that many
folks that are actually starting new
projects right greenfield projects that
J hipster might make sense for but
there's so much knowledge in the project
that you can learn how to do something
with angular or a spring boot just by
looking at the source code from a
generated project so that's pretty nice
and so we're looking at 6:29 and I said
at 6:10 I could do in 20 minutes right
no I said 30 so I think I'm okay yo J
hipster or
- man I feel hip so we're going to call
this you have to have a unique name or
this will fail most of the time so I'm
going to do J hipster devoxx will do it
knee you kind of dirty some more scotch
if anyone wants them
so this basically creates a couple
classes for you there's a whole crew
database class it creates it also runs
all that NPM and the grunt stuff from
maven so I got my hipster tattoos feel
they rub off are they still there
they're still there I'll be wearing this
all night and so one of the things I
learned is I wrote a couple blog post
recently about setting this up in in
Jenkins and when you run just the the
regular spring boot run process it
generates it does a lot of what NPM does
for you so it you know does it install
it downloads all that Bower stuff it
even runs like the unit tests so if
you're setting this up in Jenkins you
don't need to do a whole lot from the
NPM or grunt perspective you can just
run the build like you would from maven
or Gradle and it has plugins that that
run that NPM and grunt stuff for you so
it looks like it uploaded pretty fast by
the way we're staying at a bed and
breakfast down near central Antwerp and
it has got the fastest Wi-Fi and just
internet connection that I've seen at
home we have 60 Meg's down and up here
it's like a hundred so well done on the
internet so look there goes it says it's
up Heroku logs tale see if it's really
up
so it's it's starting starts with five
connections as the max pool size by
default you can change that to 20 with
Postgres by default the my sequel
version on Heroku only allows 10 so
that's why we're a bit conservative and
only have 5 there
it also does liquid base as a async task
both in development and in Heroku so
that means it starts populating and
building your database but it finishes
you know and is non-blocking and lets
everything keep going so that's kind of
nice
I'm you'll notice it failed to load
elasticsearch there here's a trick I
learned is we have this application so
if you look at elasticsearch on Heroku
you're like what 10 bucks a month like I
like this stuff for free you can
actually use elastic search with the
same configuration that it has in
development which is just putting it on
the local file system and so in prod
instead of trying to connect to a
cluster you can just do that and so if I
redeployed which I will do towards the
end of this talk elastic search will
work just fine and so I have seen these
on a couple of my applications this
memory 103 percent it's exceeding those
are just warnings it really doesn't seem
to affect the performance of the
application I have a couple applications
that run it using a gig of memory and I
still get those same warning so it
doesn't really seem to affect it whether
I use 512 or or a gig so if we close out
of that
Roku open there we are we're to play it
in the cloud we can log in someone can
go in there and change the password hack
away you can sign up there's sessions so
if you guys all logged in I could start
canceling sessions for you but
so it also ships with Gatling as I
showed you and cucumber those are two
options there is a bunch of performance
tests in here that you could run against
you know that blogs API and what I found
is it handles pretty good even on you
know local machine it's about 4,000
requests per second I'm just testing it
locally until it falls down so you know
if you want to scale up obviously just
add more machines if you want to be
stateless and you'll do even better has
anyone used Gatling a couple people so
if you don't if you want to do
performance testing and and you're
looking for something that maybe uses
your existing data it's a great tool
there's a there's a way to actually you
know grab and talk to a database and
populate the test with data from that
database it's also really nice in that
it can record your test so what I do is
I create a bunch of unit tests or
integration tests that talk to the
database or talk to the the API and then
I just record them and then boom
there's your you know scenario and you
can play it back so UI testing there is
a couple unit tests that ship for the
JavaScript classes that are in there it
doesn't generate JavaScript unit tests
for you it does generate unit tests for
your java code but not for your
controllers I wrote a blog post recently
about I'm using protractor to basically
drive the UI with webdriver j/s and that
works pretty well and and so I hope to
contribute that back to the project so
you know you could run tests against
your UI to verify everything works so
it's pretty sweet right angularjs Java 8
microservices what more could you want
there is more there's themes and this is
where bootstrap really comes in and does
a really nice job as most people
download bootstrap and they use it and
it looks like every bootstrap site out
there
it's like the new maven site of our
world right they all look the same but
the beauty is there's a huge theme
ecosystem out there that you can
leverage and as long as you're writing
your HTML with the certain classes that
bootstrap advocates then boom you have a
new theme and it works pretty well so
for example we could go back here
and we could say what's the name of it
bootstrap angular material design
there's a theme for that so it's not
that one it's this one here so you can
say let's try that
and it's put it in there and then this
guy's still running no we stopped it now
it's using a new theme all right and all
we did is install a new bootstrap theme
so pretty slick the way it does that is
there's a wire DEP task that you'll see
that runs right here and actually in the
index.html it knows what Bower
dependencies you have if there's CSS it
puts them at the top if the JavaScript
dependencies that puts them at the
bottom so you don't have to mess with
like figuring out okay I just added this
to Bower now how do I get it in here so
again you know this isn't J hipster
Pacific but it's a pretty cool feature
that you could add to your own projects
especially if you do an angular stuff
and so this theme this angular without
the a at the end is the name of this
theme mangu yeah we use it on a project
for a client and it's it's $20 if you
use it as an individual so I bought it
for that J hipster book site you might
have saw me using it there my client
bought it and they actually have a
product that they're you know selling to
the general public cost of a thousand
dollars I think it's up to 1,100 so
still not that expensive and bootstrap 4
is actually shipping with supported
themes that are $99 so you can actually
buy a theme it's supported by the
project and I believe it's a one-time
fee and you know you get a pretty slick
looking website not just the default so
angular 2 is coming out with a whole set
of wonky new syntax it's got you know
brackets and parentheses eliminates
controllers directives scope angular
module goes away and JQ light goes away
so there's this great tutorial I just
want to throw it in here if you want to
go learn about a lot of the typescript
type of syntax that they're using with
angular 2 this is a great two minute
video on it you can get them from my
slides later so I wrote a book on J
hipster I liked it so much what I found
was in early 2012 I started using
bootstrap in late 2013 I started using
spring boot and late 2013 as well as
angular so I've been
using these a couple years and then I
saw Jay hipster come along and I was
like wow you're doing all the hard work
for me I want to write a book about it
because a lot of their site basically
says hey if you want to learn about
angular go learn angular over here if
you wanna learn about bootstrap go to
bootstrap site so you know I wanted to
add a little more than that so I wrote
it's 130 pages it's developing that real
world 21 points app and it's free you
can download it from info q as a PDF as
a mobi or as a ePub document and one of
the cool things I learned was then I
created the project that 21 points
project had 8500 lines just generated
for me after I generated the entities it
generated like 4,000 more lines of code
but then to tweak it and do what I
actually wanted to do with it it only
required you know another thousand lines
of code so the real meat of me writing
what I wanted to write didn't take a
whole lot of code and by language you
know Java is still most of the code
there's a bunch of JavaScript in there
too and there's HTML so you know pretty
nice if you want to learn more about Jay
hipster please come talk to me there's
also all these wonderful sites here this
YouTube video here is by the project
founder he actually did something
similar what I did but he did with bank
accounts and so if you want you know a
demo like that you can go and look at
that and like I said the mini book was
released just a couple weeks ago we
actually plan on keeping it up to date
with Jay hipster and with angular
angular to support forge a hipster is
actually coming when angular 2 is
released and what Google is said about
angular 1 versus 2 is that they will
basically publish angular 2 as the main
project when there's more traffic to
that website so there's angularjs org
and there's angular yo angular do is the
number 2 there is an upgrade path so you
can use them in the same application and
and there's also a pretty exciting thing
that's happening with J hipster we
recently started looking at John Pappas
style guide which is basically a style
guide that says write your JavaScript
this way and use your angular this way
and you'll be ready for angular 2 and so
we might be incorporating that in small
chunks over the
couple weeks so you can stay hit by
following me on my blog hit me up on
Twitter I'll upload this presentation
later and I'll post my code to a to
github so that 21 points application was
something that I wrote and one of the
things I did was I wasn't quite ready to
publish it and you know let people look
at the source of the project and I
thought I could get away with that for a
little while but the book is out there
and people are asking for the source so
I thought that at devoxx here I would
open-source it so I have this tweet here
that I saved
let's see if I can tweet it so it's part
of my talk I want to open-source 21
points on github so that I did it not
that
so if you have any questions I'm a hip
guy so I like to drink it beer this rose
for date supposed to be pretty good
any questions all right do I get more
beers I got one more it's a delirium
tremens I was recommended as well
there's plenty of scotch ooh funny story
on the way over here I had to get all
dressed up for this talk and my wife and
I were probably halfway we're halfway
maybe a half a kilometer and I realized
you know what I forgot my laptop never
done that for a talk before so going
back and got it but I do have a bunch of
J hipster stickers up here if anyone
wants one any other questions it's got
to be a couple over there my glasses are
a little dirty yeah
so the question was since a lot of the
code is generated how do you upgrade so
the nice thing is is Yaman has a feature
built in for that and what happens is
there's a couple like get things you can
use where you do rebase and then you
know continue after that you can go back
to the last time you upgraded what I
typically do those I just it's got those
files in there that you use to generate
it so you can regenerate it basically
you can regenerate the project you can
regenerate your entities if you want to
but you don't have to and then you just
go through there and do the diffs right
and say okay this is new code or this is
my code
another thing that I've started doing is
creating new classes for functionality
instead of like overriding existing
classes because then it's a little
easier to upgrade good question
anyone else well hit me up on Twitter if
you have more questions we got one over
there way over there yeah you just need
Java and then whatever build tool and if
Gradle has a wrapper so you don't even
need you know that and there's a maven
wrapper - so just Java basically and
then NPM and all that you'll need yo
write yeoman so you need to install
yeoman and I think grunt from the
command line or gulp and then NPM and
node nope spring boot comes with Tomcat
embedded so he asked if Tomcat was
installed comes at Tomcat or undertow or
jetty embedded so you don't need to
actually install a container and
actually one of the things they added in
spring boot 1.3 you might have seen it
they have this dev tools that I didn't
have to actually start and stop anything
so it does live reloading kind of like J
rebel and you know allows you to compile
classes and reload those in the JVM and
it also has the ability on a UNIX system
to actually have it as executable so you
don't even need to do Java - jar you can
just fire it as an executable so someone
discovered that Java reads like jars
from I think top to bottom and so you
can put a script at the beginning of
that jar and it'll actually execute it
so kind of cool anyone else
I think you're free to go that's the
last talk of the day right
thank you come get some stickers and
some Scotch if you want some</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
