as short as possible so no one is late
for java pose especially the java posse
members and i'm i'm a huge fan so 50
shades of android studio first I need to
show where am I how important i am so
you don't leave the room blah blah let
me pass those so why does talk it's it's
a funny story because I used to be an
active commuter so when I was doing more
android stuff and somehow Google's
switch to end intellij instead of
eclipse I needed to learn IntelliJ short
guards and how to use the ID and
everything and it was a kind of pain
because we take lips I know how to look
for the logs or how to fix something how
to fix a bug report or even fix it
myself and commit the code and I used to
give a lot of eclipse talks and stuff so
well I decided to learn stuff so that's
how I ended up writing an android studio
book too so let me start with the basics
so most of stuff i'm going to show will
be a hands-on stuff on the IDE I group
stuff into several categories so I'll
stop start basic then move more advanced
stuff including writing plugins for
IntelliJ so let's show you the basics ah
the most basic thing you need to learn
when you're using Android studio is the
preferences which is kind of very
friendly because you don't need to
remember where stuff are there's a nice
search mechanism which just magically
finds anything you want to change phones
you type forms and you end up with
everything to reach has some kind of
settings with fonts or you want to edit
SDKs you type SDK and you end up with
all the preferences with the SDK let's
see Oh debugging stuff so i'm pretty
sure you previous around something on
android studio but let me run an
emulator and show you the basic
debugging tools it's pretty amazing up
you can basically check every variable
and stop the execution at any point you
can change variable videos or create
conditional breakpoints are basically if
you're coming from eclipse background
you're not going to miss anything from
eclipse debugging tools while we are
waiting let me see actually not it not
up yet so while we are reading let me
see what else I can show all shortcuts
okay first let me show you the debugging
so what I have here so I just are
important sample template project from
Android studio I'll just put a
breakpoint here and show you the basics
so once you click the back it will start
the application in debug mode so you can
do it with the emulator or with a real
device basic Dave and execution hits the
break point it will stop and now you can
go line by line or jump to the inside
the method call you can see the list of
variables in the context here you can
examine the values or even try to change
it I'll cut it short this part and let
me show you some shortcut so I actually
there was a talk from Hadi holiday I
guess our popular spelling right so like
a bear
basic short version of it if you're
interested in learning more just go
watch his dog it's just a it is the
original one so um I have some cheat
sheet here so the most beautiful of that
let me start with a story when I
switched from eclipse I I didn't want to
use Eclipse shortcut team so I state
with IntelliJ shortcuts which was
because I want to do that to learn the
IntelliJ shortcuts but somehow I ended
up knowing nothing so I did everything
by right clicking or trying to find it
over the menus so luckily in time I
downloaded a key map of PDF and try to
learn more stuff so let me show you some
stuff I really use and I still use in my
daily bird so comment all is good for
searching stuff so as you can see from
the example I typed before here it
allows you to use Joker characters and
you can even put the line number you
want to go so let's type something else
for example I see here I have device
list activities or device and if I put
like 32 I'm like online 32 so it's
pretty smart and pretty useful double
shift searched on everywhere so if
you're going to search anything just
double shift and you can search it
anywhere something i like is to use
comment 7r to see the class structure
you can switch back to project structure
by
c'mon comment1 then let's see what else
Oh comment ii comment e shows you the
recent files so basically you can easily
navigate you don't need to keep the tat
even the tabs open basically it has all
the history and something even better is
command shift e which shows you the
recent data that file so you can just
switch back to something you have just
down and it's actually pretty useful
that it might be one of the shortcuts i
use most let's see what else i have
comment p is pretty beautiful so if you
want to go to the implementation and see
the details you click on a class or
object and press command P and the ID
takes you to the implementation class
let me switch back to some codes so if
you want to see the the parameter info
of comment ki will give you the
parameter improved method call you can
also use comment of be for the type
declaration
and finally the navigation shortcuts
okay i have a small list of navigation
shortcuts which i would like to use a
command and square brackets will bring
you to our previous and next steps in
your navigation history so it's just
jumping to the places i focused on the
editor so this one is pretty good with
just stepping back or stepping forward
to where you left let's see what else Oh
something again I used heavily is if you
want to move a block of codes command
shift and arrows will let you move stuff
around and another beautiful shortcut is
command shift V which brings you them
which brings you to everything you
copied before so you are not limited to
one item to copy and paste it you can
just go back and check anything you copy
it in the past looks like I visited
t-mobile let's see
another interesting shot that is let me
see what it was shifts of click will
give you multi cursor support I'm not
clicking the rightward shift alt click
yeah so you can edit different locations
at the same time and it will be changing
of course is not good for effecting so
don't use this for detecting but it's
still amazing to see different cursors
anything at the same time let's see
another app shortcuts I really used to
use it in Eclipse was organizing the
imports which is compare control I out
oh which will optimize and organize the
unused import alt comment elle reformat
the code so before submitting your code
you can make sure everything is in
proper grammar I think that's enough for
the shortcut so let me see what I have
from the slide templates okay um one
thing I really hate it was when I create
a new activity or a new project or just
any new component there are a lot of
stuff I need to delete so basically you
can edit any template in Android studio
so if you right-click and inside new
selected file templates you can edit any
file templates we have class interface
and as you can see as its own grammar
you can easily change the default file
templates from here but what I was
interested in was actually editing the
activity or service template so if you
go inside let me show it from the
beginning if you go inside your Android
studio installation then content plugins
androids and templates you can basically
edit any application any project
template and make it work like you want
to so you don't need to delete any are
generated code you can just edit the
template and make it work just out of
the box let's see what else I have
plugins ok before plugins are actually
let me show you a bit on constraint
layout which is kind of something it's
almost one year olds right so not on you
so i have a new activity here let me
maximize this part
so the new constraint layout finally
gives a better drag and drop Rui editor
so you can create new layouts and it's
kind of nice you can see the blueprint
next to it you can create constraints
and you can see how it changed as you
move it's pretty nice and if you're a
child it's pretty stable two of the I I
haven't used it heavily but I didn't
like the constraint layout and so far it
currently work for me another let me
just stop it constraint layout and
continuous lights off you keep on time
so another nice feature with
intelligence the plugins and I was
because in Eclipse I could either write
my own plugins I was kind of very lost
in the early days because I didn't know
where to who can read to fix something
or rather it my own functionality so
first of all then you start Android
studio and IntelliJ comes with its own
plug-in repository which you may find
most of the stuff you need if you want
to go more and write your own stuff you
first need to start with downloading the
IntelliJ platform plug-in SDK and then
at the plug-in SDK as the one of the
SDKs so that intelligent knows how to
build the written plugins for the studio
so next you start a new plug-in project
by selecting the IntelliJ platform plug
in and let make sure to show this
a project I did I think it was the
example in the book yeah yeah so I am
the installed base we kept like a SDK
here so it won't compile but at least I
can show you the code so basically the
idea is very similar to eclipse plugins
if you have done in its development in
the past there is one plug in XML which
declares most of the stuff you want to
integrate with the ID so for example
here I have several stuff one is visit
which you can see here so this is just
like a project or unit wizard which are
kicks in and ask you several questions
to decide how to create something so
here I have a custom wizard and if you
go to the custom wizard class it extends
the module builder you can create your
own module wizard steps and for example
this this one I have a file chooser and
then a radio button I guess and when the
steps are complete you can execute the
flow by the with the collected data from
the user and just create or to what
you're supposed to do let's see what I
am what else i have here so you can
easily add many items or pop-ups let's
see the pulpit example actually for the
pop-up we have a editor action so
basically this pop-up bill this is a
pop-up menu which will appear when you
right-click in the editor so let's
switch the cold so basically it is that
this expands and action and when the
action is are formed
get a copy of the editor project and
other stuff you may need then again you
execute your flow and do what you want
if i remember right in this example I
was okay this is another story turkey
shelter that has some non-standard
characters which is like dots you and
some other levels so basically this
plug-in kicks in and converts all those
letters to unicode which was pretty
beautiful for multi-language support and
multi language files so I think that was
the first plug-in i did for eclipse of
and i switched the ontology although i
don't much use turkish anymore I still
get to plug in to see if I can mimic the
same functionality let's see and finally
I have a pop-up so the pop-up basically
again is an action and it will just
create a new message and as you can see
from the event you can get the project
info and other stuff you need in the
context so i guess i covered the plugins
from yep i can switch the next topic so
july eight on android so with an android
and we have the functionality of B we
have the option of using Java 8 through
Jack to enable java 8 basically you need
the following configuration in your
Gradle file I can't say everything where
very stable but it's nice to see and try
lambdas and other dry weight stuff
usually if your project is not huge and
doesn't have a lot of stuff most of the
stuff works and if you have a lot of
legacy coding the project you may have
some difficulties in this setting
basically the last two lines is for the
IDS of it won't complain and now the
syntax is Joey syntax next let's see a
bit about Gradle so greater was another
new topic if you're coming from exits
background and actually drink while we
were building Android applications on
Eclipse we didn't even have a proper
official build system so we had two dark
ages of copying jars into libraries and
stuff luckily Gradle first helped with
that and also i feel it's much faster
with than maven actually i had a java
one talk last year comparing may want to
cradle the stats are really nice so this
is a very basic Gradle files with no
repositories and dependencies basically
we are applying to java plugin and if
you have any repositories we need to
declare here and also same with
dependencies and java settings so this
is more a complete Gradle file although
it's still very simple right now we have
the repository and we had at j unit as a
dependency so declaring dependencies a
little different than maven but it's
pretty much a similar so you can easily
convert any maven dependency so Gradle
if you have local files you can use
compiles for
and use them as dependencies you can
also use workspace modules dependencies
so you will be debugging and using the
same code in the ideal basically a maven
configuration of the right side becomes
as the one on the left when we copy
everything to greater than actually we
can even make it shorter by combining
the dependency configuration so
basically in the first example we have
the compiled group and name and
diversion is separate properties but
actually the Gradle syntax allows us to
combine and write them in one piece okay
finally writing Gradle plugins another
thing I was interested in okay I didn't
like to write plugins I guess so another
thing I wanted to know was how to write
Gradle plugins gretel supports Java
skull and groovy but I most mostly did
experiments with Java support of course
the plug-in can be applied the plug-in
year old can be applied with apply
keyword inside build.gradle each plug-in
needs to implement the plug-in project
interface which will bring the apply
project methods and then you can
implement your code a very very simple
Gradle plug-in will look like this so we
have a custom plug-in which implements
the plug-in interface and the apply
methods will receive the project which
the Gradle plug-in is running on so here
we can have our own custom tasks
to stuff we want basically we can copy
stuff around or other stuff he may need
to apply this plugin you need to add the
fly plugins and plug-in name inside your
Gradle configuration I guess that's it
so if you have any questions of the
epicenter and I think I might have a
copy of my book if anyone is interested</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
