he's speaking about scaling and this
came up because we were just chatting
about languages and I was saying oh you
should do Java but Georgiana said well
if you see what we did with PHP maybe
you change your mind so what do you mean
by that what project were you working on
with this PHP magic well it's um I've
presented okay study about them the US
airline which is on Alpha low-cost
airline so they felt it upon the tube
meaning they helped a lot of visitors on
the website and what we managed to I do
is to actually allow them so that during
black friday and cyber monday to have
income of extra 10 million dollars and
canadian dollars extra yeah well so
that's quite the challenge and hp's
playing of very important part in this
architecture it's um something that we
learned along the way to use some clever
tricks to speed things up and we look at
the data holistically um analyze the
entire process instead of focusing on
technical solutions we we were really
thinking of how to minimize every
communication between components so that
the footprint of the data transfer is
very small but the functionality is
really working and if you will try and
have a look at some of the new tricks
that I was presenting you will notice
that we uncovered a very clever way of
doing it testing also on infrastructure
level not just on the UI level so I
think you will have a lot of things to
gain by actually taking the content of
what I've presented what can I may be
testing leading with it for my baby
testing any sort already person because
we were introducing the concept called
silo where you take the entire
functional diversification
Antoine and boxes and say okay this is a
philo and then horizontally scaled the
silos on a permanent basis but at the
same time what you can do is you you can
raise another silo that you've been
wearing the exact same and unfortunately
using different tools so for example you
want to change your cash back end from
Manchester biomedis order differencing
in the second silo you hide these things
up from the user and just use the new
library and see if it works with maybe
one percent of the projects a real
production laid off so you're not in our
laboratory try to figure out easy / work
it just check that it works in
production and we don't disappoint your
users because you only drive a very
small portion of the traffic in that
second scenario you can even a be tested
infrastructure so instead of using like
10 machines maybe you need 20 motions
you can scale things inside the silo as
well ok and if you want to change your
psyche for cash with the Java you can do
that because it's called hidden inside
the side until you sign a fair and
ethical you talk about parallel request
this is a stylized come into the
parallel request no that's something
that is internal to the way we
implemented work inside one final so in
PHP because well if is what
multi-threaded it's a scary difficult to
achieve parallelism and what he did was
them use another trick we call it the
204 trick and every time you make a
request to a nine point the endpoint
will need to validate the paper that is
coming and check that the permissions
are correct you are allowed to make that
call but then immediately will return to
offer and the PHP process can continue
working so you can have no running
processes just because um it's a
convention so the tool for trick says ok
I fully trusted that you will take care
of my problem thank you for
acknowledging that and that other thing
that the content needs to do in this
time you can refresh the UI the static
assets and everything and just go
to process and ask for dior live data
afterwards so you can do a lot of things
in parallel what with the Armenians
rizal quite clever purchasing so you do
almost pretend when you get there
question you go you pretended this
request is complete you go okay I've
seen your request hmm and that way you
don't have any requests long-running
request um this is a trust thing so once
you return or four for getting the
component that was cold when you give
back a floor fourth kind of make a
promise that you will finish give me the
word and as a pulley will never know
that until they ask you check for the
data but one very important thing that
is happening is that um if a perfect
problem occurs in the process that is
fulfilling that request it it will not
be seen by the users so these are will
not see 50 pages or anything like that
because they will be asking continuously
the cash yes the device present in the
cache and if it's not we can say oh can
you try making a circular or I can do
something else so we are most
effectively training server problems
into a very friendly yo X so the user
can always recover from what they were
doing even if something really bad
happened on the server side generating
is completely random black friday yeah
you didn't have a situation trying to no
idea the train take you expect for
things to be already sold which like or
you expect that your specificity that
you chosen into claim is noticing by
somebody else I'll job willing to go
back and try again so this is the not an
issue is a clean eating the user session
but if you are just showing white pages
or unified by the server issues and then
they will just hot on your application
and in your plan and they will not
return outside black friday to purchase
anything else on
