secured yet but I'm going to talk about
security which is something that a lot
of people feel really positively about
really and then I think so like people
it's like eating properly you know that
you should do it but nobody does yeah
there we go okay then yes I bruise and
so what's the the biggest problem you
have trying to be a security advocate
that people it's just like healthy food
everyone knows they should do it but
when you actually like nuts and bolts
let's get started they're like I have to
go to the bathroom and then they never
come back do you think part of that is
Gustin done defending it's a gap and
understanding and also I would say an
unwillingness to really admit but they
don't know where to start
yes I'd say I would say it's a failure
bravery I'd say that people just need to
be like you know what I have no idea
what you're talking about
not a clue and it's really hard to say
that when everyone is like a security is
super important no one wants to be like
oh yeah I know it's penny what you
mean the reason I ask that is because
I'm finally after having you doing tech
and being live it's missing quite
happily when I don't know something
which I wrote a long time ago
especially interesting people like this
going John I actually have absolutely no
idea we're talking about please tell me
and maybe that is the problem because I
did I do find that to be a problem when
I work in companies of the people and
getting to stage where people can be
open about understanding so that you can
properly learn to reach each other
exactly if it's hard and especially in
security for whatever reason and I also
don't know okay so we need some kind of
way to get people to admit the first
step which that they don't know security
the first step is admitting you have a
problem yes yes and so on once you've
got the problem okay now we need some
resources exactly
so where do we go for those google yes
yes no I mean there's there's a there's
literally security stack overflow
it's exactly like six like stack
overflow but it's for secure
I didn't know that yes okay all right
what should i search for in stock over
so depends on what problem you're trying
to solve and this is where most people
tend to get stuck yeah okay so anyway
start so why I don't know why people
hash then why do people hash things well
hashing is an integrity solver so it's
proving that the data was that was sent
or that's being stored is actually the
data is being sent or stored but it's
not encrypted no it's not you can prove
that it's been tampered with
okay so it's proving that something has
happened to it so it's either that a
hacker has gotten into it and changed it
I've stolen all your money for example
or I've gotten into your do this or that
the date has been changed in some way so
that you know the database now vomits
out you know a bunch of stuff it
shouldn't exceed rec center so so it's
proving what the data has been altered
okay so so we have encryption which is
protecting data and we have integrity
which is validation it's validating and
it's also promising that you are you so
if you and I are sitting and talking
integrity is you proving to me so if you
sat here with like an ID in front of you
with your name and like a picture of you
I could read it and be like out that's
still you okay
so apart from encryption integrity
whereas the other steals wish to know
about well there are three main security
legs and scranton most reality so
keeping information secret and then its
integrity like you just died on the side
and then it's actually and this one
comes as far as people is availability
okay yeah so I'm so maybe yeah I know
people are like really but everyone
knows what a denial of service attack is
and a denial of service attack is a
failure of availability yes I thought
would not look good no it doesn't occur
to most people this is kind of a fourth
one that I kind of jammed in there and
it's not technically security theory and
I would argue that traceability should
be in the main three so when when
something bad has happened your ability
to actually detect and figure out what
what have happened so logging making
sure that your log files actually show
what's going on in your system - I know
but most people don't do so now I've got
my different areas of security
I guess I need to look at magazines
maybe attempts I say well what we do is
I wrote part of a service and we decided
to make it cure by just putting it on a
private network hmm is the data fun
clear-text yes hmm well it depends if
it's on a private network how private is
it I mean you don't have a live I mean I
know it's right over there so don't
point because then it's no longer
private you see the problem I see now I
know where it is and I mean I could be
highly untrustworthy so - we've just met
exactly I didn't check my ID I didn't I
could be Bob I made a number of
assumptions exactly and most people do
and that's where that's where Security's
problems come from that's exactly where
security problems come from this is
actually a like a brilliant example of a
security problem because people assume
like I can trust
Amazon therefore I don't have to verify
that it's actually amiable I can trust
Google I can trust Facebook I can trust
that my private network is actually
private but you probably left your
computer alone with one of your
colleagues for a little while and it's
got USB ports and they aren't you know
soldered shut - my passcode is the name
of one of my dogs yeah see that's easily
guessable that's easily guessable so on
the true-true but I'm going to guess you
don't have a million dogs so sooner or
later - Ashley yeah see I have three
okay so I win you almost a cure
yeah and we're good here I have three
testers no but I mean I mean if it's the
classic problem of if you make an
assumption and then you just kind of
build everything based on an assumption
and if your assumption is false
then your entire security house of cards
fall apart unfortunately sorry yes okay
so screen except in number fake special
I haven't verified who you are no you
haven't
and there's no integrity no conversation
isn't secure okay and it's going to be
on YouTube and available to everyone
oh no I've revealed my password you
should be able to change but yeah you
should probably do that just should be
wrong in your life characters to be
honest yes yeah I'm just going to go
with a solid yes and then and what's the
other problem it was the other thing
that we have done
ability availabilities well I break your
computer with a hammer or drop it on the
ground it's on github but yeah the data
is in the day shoes on the laptops so
yeah unencrypted Davison yeah okay so
next time we have an interview I'll try
harder oh good I'm going to sit with my
ID the entire team it's going to be
amazing I'm just going to have it
printed out maybe we should mimic and
maybe we should mimic a handshake no I
should keep going and I would like to
verify that you are a siren that would
be really funny we could do it honey Jay
yeah they'll become my donkey you're
gonna have to have a giant ID than to
and this is some piece yeah it's a
cookie oh that would be funny I would
like that okay cool promise next time I
come back
giant ID thank you very much thank you
very much very good Eastlake you do it
make sense</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
