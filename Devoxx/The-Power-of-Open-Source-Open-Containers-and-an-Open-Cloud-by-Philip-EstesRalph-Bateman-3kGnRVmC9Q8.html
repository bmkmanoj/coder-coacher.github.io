talk to you about three basic things
open source open containers we're going
to specifically talk about docker and an
open cloud architecture and we'll
highlight some of the things that IBM is
doing with open source technologies like
docker Ralph and I both worked for IBM
and I'll let Ralph introduce himself
okay so minus Ralph bateman I'm actually
from the herdsman laboratory in the UK
we spent the last couple of years doing
a lot of work with with various open
source technologies and one of the
things we're going to have a chat with
you about in the next hour is how we've
put docker into our bluemix cloud
platform so we'll have a little demo and
we'll probably have a show a little game
at the end of how you can actually run
games inside containers all right and
i'm phil estes and i work in ibm's open
cloud technologies lab in the US and my
specific role at this point is that i
actually work upstream in the doctorate
community i'm a docker maintainer
working on the core docker engine as
well as some other parts of docker and
we'll talk about that in a few minutes
but first of all who's heard of this
small company IBM surely some of you
have heard heard of them we might even
have a few IBM verse here iBM has been
around for over a hundred years now and
if you aren't aware of what they're
doing maybe this is what you think of
IBM which is going way back to the era
of punch cards some of you might
actually be younger than the punch card
itself and then typewriters in the 60s
and 70s if you can believe that IBM had
75 percent of the typewriter market with
the Selectric typewriter but bringing a
little more into the modern era
mainframes mainframe computers
the sort of sound like dinosaurs today
but you might not have heard that IBM I
just announced new mainframes in the
last six months running purely on Linux
some mainframes have been a bread and
butter of IBM's existence and actually
an interesting note about the one you
see here the IBM model 3 our system 360
model 20 was actually developed here in
europe and i believe was manufactured in
france so this is from 1964 was when the
system came out and if you can believe
it Ralph actually worked on mainframes
when he joined IBM yes I am an assembler
programa have changed a little bit but
as we go i started with assembler but we
don't want to talk just about the
history of IBM would you believe that
IBM is probably one of the instigators
of the open source movement and to to
understand that you have to go back to
actually this era of the system/360 in
that era the end user of a computer was
rarely sort of the end user of today
someone who didn't know much about
computers but could purchase a computer
and use it for basic basic computing but
in this era the end user of the
computing of the computer being
purchased from IBM had to be an expert
and many times had to know how to make
changes to the operating system and so
in this era IBM systems were actually
shipped with the source code of the
operating system so the expectation was
that you got the source code and so in
that era came out a movement called
share that generated conferences and
user groups where that actually would
share modifications to the operating
system and so if you even read the
wikipedia article on open source it
references the share era as really the
foundation of what we call the open
source movement of two
a so digging just a little bit deeper a
colleague and I recently wrote this
ebook on the history of open source and
bringing that into the modern era of
what does that look like today and how
is it transforming the cloud this isn't
a pitch to go by the book this is a free
download you can see the URL there to to
get a free copy of the book if you'd
like to hear more about the history of
open source but the reason I mention it
is that coming up to today and the cloud
technologies that we have in the modern
era in the cloud things like OpenStack
docker and even Cloud Foundry
platform-as-a-service these are all open
source communities the IBM has heavily
involved ourselves in and today we're
mostly going to focus on docker but
we'll look a little bit at ibm's open
cloud architecture and what that looks
like recently just a few weeks ago
actually one of our vice presidents dr.
angel luis diaz mentioned that you can't
out innovate the world and that's really
the message of open source is that no
single company could output the the
amount of of code that's being generated
these days the amount of projects if
you're aware of github and you look at
the thousands and thousands of projects
being created almost on a daily basis a
few statistics that help put that
together so the Linux Foundation has an
umbrella of projects called the
collaboration projects just these
projects alone it doesn't even include
the Linux kernel has generated 115
million lines of code that in a recent
report has been valued at five billion
dollars the core docker engine so we're
going to talk in a few minutes about
docker itself that project has over
twenty five thousand nine hundred stars
as of a few days ago almost 7,000 Forks
with more than 1,000 people who have
contributed code to the docker project
and then looking at OpenStack the
OpenStack foundation itself has 28,000
worldwide individual members more than a
hundred companies are actual sponsors of
the OpenStack foundation and those
companies employ again many hundreds and
even thousands of contributors including
IBM and so really the message is that we
have gotten deeply involved in
open-source software at IBM both in our
initial contribution to Linux over a
decade ago and now with openstack cloud
foundry and docker and we believe that's
really transforming the cloud as we know
it so shifting gears from just a pure
discussion of open source we'd like to
take a few minutes to talk about docker
itself which is both an open source
project with a community as well as the
company docker in fact a couple of them
are speaking across the hall as we speak
first of all anyone here played around
with docker use docker tried it out ok
we have a percentage maybe a third so I
won't be labor this but I think it'd be
helpful to get a picture of what docker
is first of all many times it is
compared with virtualization
technologies based around hypervisors
and sometimes that's a hard comparison
to make because of the differences of
not having really that system image and
the boot sequence so the way I like to
think about docker is that you have a
set of processes that have a shared
Linux kernel and the docker engine
really is the arbiter of starting and
stopping these processes there's a REST
API there's there's the client commands
of many people if you've tried docker
you've probably tried docker run Redis
or docker run engine X and so these
these commands interact with
her engine which start processes on your
system now the important piece is that
the isolation that you get with docker
really relies on a set of core Linux
kernel technologies that have been
around long before docker existed such
as C groups namespaces the Linux
capabilities the Linux security model
restrictions like a parmer or SELinux
and so these things provide what feels
like a virtualization like environment
where in actuality these are just
processes that have been isolated using
these technologies and so beyond just
that core engine there is the ability to
interact with a hub either private or
public where these images can be stored
and so now that's general ecosystem of
other projects that I've listed here
things to compose multiple containers
together a swarm machine in just recent
weeks advanced networking options have
been announced there's now integrations
with other other orchestration engines
Kuber Nettie's maces but the core focus
of docker is to be able this promise to
build ship and run distributed
applications via this common tool box
and so maybe just to take an extra
minute of your time especially for those
who haven't used docker or don't haven't
fully gotten the basic concepts maybe
just a simple practical example so most
most docker images start with a docker
file where you can specify an image that
you're inheriting from you can specify
other metadata like who's maintaining
this this image and then you can run
commands you can add files you can add
tar balls and you can expose ports and
then obviously at some point you want to
run some command so that when your
container starts you'll be able to
actually execute something and so when
you build a docker file this will
actually generate a docker image that is
comprised of a file system
in this case the bun two layers will be
there or whatever libraries I've added
and my program that I've added into this
image is now a shippable transportable
component that I can share with others
via a registry or use myself on my
laptop or put into a cloud and so there
a set of commands obviously that you can
interoperate and I think Ralph will be
able to to show these in more detail
when we get to the demonstration but you
can build run look at what's running tag
your images and push them to registries
so though these are all sort of the core
concepts of what it means to build a
docker image use it and run it and so I
think what you want to be left with is
the understanding that a docker
container contains a file system which
could be a set of independent and
shareable layers docker uses a copy on
write file system concept which we
probably don't have time to delve into
that but that means that actually you're
sharing if multiple containers are all
based on a bun to each container doesn't
have its own copy of the abundance
ignition space sharing technology and
docker a configuration which says what
ports am I going to expose what command
will I be running and then obviously
once I have this file system and
configuration I can take this and push
to remote repositories tag it share with
others and obviously there's much more
to docker than just that but hopefully
that gives you a basic understanding of
what you can do a docker in the interest
of time I was going to show a small
example but Ralph is going to do a great
job of showing you some some various
examples but I think maybe a great way
to differentiate virtualization from
containerization is that many times when
you think of a virtual machine image it
has to have your kernel and kernel
modules and all the libraries in the
boot sequence in the case of
correct I could actually create a
container from a single statically
linked binary that does one thing for
example I could build an HTTP server and
go in about 40 lines of code and I could
build that into a static binary and
create a docker file that adds that
single file to a container and now I
have a single shippable sample web
server that is actually could be as
small as five megabytes has no other
files no shells no configuration files
and that's a great way to test and run
and play around with containers in a way
that shows a vast cost saving space
saving from a full virtualized image and
Ralph will be able to display that in in
more detail so what is IBM doing with
docker as i mentioned i personally am a
upstream contributor we started working
with docker approximately in summer of
last year we had a single contributor
and now we have over 25 IBM errs across
the world actually working on docker we
now have two core engine maintained errs
myself and one other IBM ur and we have
not only contributed to the docker
engine but we worked in compose and
machine and swarm and some of these
other components that I mentioned a few
minutes ago so you can see our growth
over time roughly over the past year in
a few months of our contribution rate to
the docker community and so we again we
believe strongly in getting involved in
open-source not only to use it in our
own products but to benefit the entire
community and so we've been able to do
that with our contributions to the
docker community so finally bringing
back open source open containers to an
open cloud iBM has created something
called bluemix which most of the
demonstrations Ralph will take us
through can use the bluemix service but
this is an
standards public cloud platform that
also is now available in local and
on-premise variants but because it
offers both OpenStack and docker and
cloud foundry it allows the developer to
choose what environment i'd like to work
in with containers with platform as a
service or with VMs based on open sac
and allow the tooling that we've added
around that around DevOps and
third-party api's and services to allow
developers to build your own apps your
own way and so Ralph specifically works
on IBM's container cloud which we have
built on docker itself he's going to
show obviously containers running in
that environment showing that we can
maintain the full life cycle that we can
both use the standard docker commands
but also allows us to add features like
logging and monitoring and then if you
broaden out to that entire open cloud
architecture we have IBM containers on
docker we have virtual machines on
OpenStack and we have all the runtime
platform as a service capabilities on
Cloud Foundry all built on top of our
soft layer data centers and bare metal
infrastructure so that gives you a
whirlwind tour of what IBM is doing an
open source what we're doing in the
docker community and how we're
translating that into offerings to the
developer through our bluemix platform
so at this point I would like to have
Ralph show some some great demos of what
we can do in bluemix and with containers
ok so thanks Phil I'm so fell off the
beginning who's used docker before yeah
ok good anybody use the new features
things like docker swarm and things like
the new Dhaka toolbox and cut matic and
things like that yeah some good so what
we're going to do is we're going to do a
couple of little demos and we have a
slight technology
from that we'll just drive me mad but
hopefully you'll be okay in that it
won't duplicate my screen so everything
i do on here you can't see ya which is a
bit of fun and so what we're going to do
is imagine you're a new developer coming
into a shop and you've been told you've
got to get useful pretty quickly
standing standing show these days if we
can I go over there here we go fine
Denver time so if we have a look and one
of the first things that we look at
downloading these days just so that you
can use docker you can use docker in the
environment will come on to how we use
that inside bluemix which is our
platform as a service but if you just
want to put docker on your machine and
just get going really quickly this is
where you start so I've actually done
some of these downloads already so we'll
take take the dead box tool box we can
download it I've learnt that the Wi-Fi
here is not quite as fast as anybody
would hope it is I don't know if anybody
else is finding that I was getting about
point five of the Meg download speed
earlier so either are tethered to my
phone to cheat so once we've downloaded
the toolbox we get something called
climatic and kite matic links in with
your github account and it links through
into all the systems that you've got on
there now what we're going to do is
we're going to take a simple engine X
system stick on a machine just run it in
the docker container so if you were
going to stand up a HTTP browser or a
simple engine X then you download it
you'd install it do a load of code
changes and it take pardon oh maybe half
an hour or something like that to
actually do it so I don't have half an
hour and hopefully it'll be a lot
quicker than that so I'm just going to
go and create I'm going to go off
connecta docker hub hopefully and then
we will use the downloads that have come
through in the system come on connects
docker hub
excellent even the Wi-Fi slow why it
says it's downloading all right will
well we'll leave that downloading over
there once you've downloaded it once
it's all actually downloaded into
climatic then the main system will show
no it won't download it that's funny so
the main system will show that you're
you're running kite Matty you're running
an engine X proxy now I'm going to try
it one more thing and then I'm going to
flip it over to the video and see if
that will work
so imagine we have downloaded the engine
X proxy imagine we've actually got
everything there I'm going to flip over
into here's one I prepared earlier just
in case the network really didn't work
which is a shame why even prayed to the
devil gods this morning just to see
whether or not the demo would actually
work nicely so yes this is what would
have happened if we'd actually
successfully done it so we download from
kite Matic we link into the system and
we do a download of the main system that
comes down we come through do the main
download it successfully connects to the
Internet unlike our system here and it
goes off and actually sets up the
install and does the install of climatic
in the main system once we've got that
then we just click on as i did but fail
to work it out because our internet
isn't working does a download of the
engine X proxy successfully connected
docker hub and does a download and that
whilst barely readable shows me that I
have an engine X proxy actually running
with a with a web server so it sound a
simple port but that's actually running
quite nicely now once I've got that I
can actually show the various different
interfaces on there and I can log up the
quick start from chi-o-matic which shows
me a nice little docker command line so
the doctor command line then shows me
various different interfaces which are
barely readable on there let me see if I
can make it a bit bigger I'm going to go
bigger slightly better for anybody hey
that's better so this is going through
and just setting up where we've logged
into our bluemix cloud environment so we
log into the niobium container service
and we show that we've got our engine X
proxy running down here on a local port
okay once we run that through in the
demo then the main environment will come
through and we loaded the web browser
yes that's fine
now once we got a web browser in there
and we've actually shown in the main
environment then we can nice and simply
do changes to that so if I wanted to
actually do a change and actually
download something based on the engine X
proxy I'm going to do a clone of a local
get project just to show how simple it
is once I've downloaded that get project
it's a simple node sat on top I can do
modifications on it so I've downloaded
I've downloaded now my node clock which
is a get get project that's available
anybody can go and download it and that
will show me periodic symbols through in
a time clock simple HTML file based here
once we take the HTML file we'll do a
couple of modifications on it and we go
through there's a couple of typos in
here that I've actually made so I'm
going to put a quote on the end of the
middle there because that completes the
HTML syntax properly and then we'll go
and change the title at the top so that
we actually show it for the demo now
it's Phil saying earlier you can do all
of this on your local machine so nothing
i'm doing here needs any other cloud
provider we've got the various
capabilities between bluemix local bloom
its dedicated and bloomix bloomix shades
for the bluemix cloud system once I've
got it working nicely in my local
machine the first thing I want to do is
run it so the next thing we're going to
do is actually do a run of the
environment and we're going to do a
build of this which will just ba
pursuing the command prompt and we'll do
a docker build including my my
environment so node clock was the gate
application either a docker build in
there and that will build us the actual
environment using that docker file that
Phil showed earlier so we've got a
docker file in there for the environment
and that will do it quite nicely so
let's wait for that happen build the
node lock my new build
oh I miss the dot see it really was a
live demo so do the dot does the
download does all the install installs
all the component parts where Phil
showed you through that docker file for
those of you already know the daka
apologies but where Phil showed you
through that docker file in including
other bits doing a nap get doing an
install pulling in various on the tar
files then it works quite nicely so
we've downloaded that we've done the
mail install the builds all worked so
the next thing I want to do is actually
run that on my local system now if
chi-o-matic was working nicely and it
had an internet connection then i would
show you it running live on the system
but unfortunately i'm going to let you
watch the video there and that now it
tells me that i'm going to run a node
i'm going to run my note note clock new
which has got the couple of edits on
there and i'm going to change it so it
runs on port 8080 so port 8080 will be
the exposed poor in dhaka that actually
runs and now i can lob at a web browser
blob on environment and that shows me
the sample of the application actually
running now it is a very very simple app
all it does is as a digital clock
running on the periodic table all right
I heard the chat earlier all about
science so I thought we'd include a
little bit for it that tells me that
Mike my container is running nicely
change that to 80 80 and that's now
showing me the new container that we put
in with the couple of Corrections and at
the top we can see just highlighted for
demo so it shows me that I've got the
old one that was running with the
previous build and the new that was
running with the new build so that that
works reasonably well now the next thing
to do is to actually run that in the
cloud environment what we want to do
there is we've already done a build
we've done a build of the environment
next thing we need to do is phil was
talking about there's a registry
involved so the bluemix environment the
bluemix environment that we have which
is our platform as a service has a
multi-tenant registry inside it every
user has a registry that they are able
to use and it's keyed off a namespace
very similar to the way docker hub does
it so you do a build up here but you
specified this time of minus T to tell
it where the registry is so I'm going to
use a name
it's called mole pigeon and I'm going to
load that in run a build tag it and push
it up through into the system this is
our bluemix environment our path
environment once we've done the the main
build coming through show my registry
i'm going to show you EU GB which is the
new london environment that we've
actually done i thought we would show
that rather than the environment we've
got over in the US so i'm going to do
this building going to put mole pigeon
in i'm going to put my notes lock knew
once I spell it right and we'll build it
from there that builds nice and quick
because we've already done previous
builds of that environment with those
changes so you're only changing the one
layer that has changed you don't need to
build everything else from there we need
to do a docker push so using the cloud
environment we've already shown that we
can use all the same docker commands to
push into our environment as we could
using our proprietary commands or the CF
commands of cloud foundry commands so
we've got an extension to the plug-in in
CF or you can use the native docker
commands so this pushes through into all
the environment and it shows me where my
tag has gone and I've tagged it as
latest and I've got it's at that on
occasion so the next thing to do is to
go into my bluemix environment my PA's
to refresh that because we've done a run
on it or we've done the load on it and
that should now show me a container
that's actually been running now in the
bluemix environment if I list the images
that are actually loaded in the cloud
which is the CF IC command I can see
that I've got this note clock new
creative 29 seconds ago actually created
24 hours and 29 seconds ago but it was
created when I did this so next thing to
do we've got our image we've got our
environment we saw that we didn't have
the container running the cloud so now
we want to run it so let's do the CF IC
run command we're going to use the the
other syntax now we're going to use our
plug-in that we've put in Cloud Foundry
we're going to do the same thing and run
it on port 80 80 80 so that we can run
the app up in the cloud we're going to
run that through the environment and
then we should find a container running
in our path environment
now the thing that we do with all the
container service at the moment is I
bluemix is that we allow you to have a
public IP every trial account every user
and fill a show this at the end you can
get a demo into the bluemix and there's
a couple of free trials going on you get
a public IP into the container and you
get a static route that you can bind or
static route if you're in Europe that
you can bind into the container so that
you can run direct things into it you
don't have to have strange ways of
getting in now we've also come out with
the support for things like docker exec
so you don't need the public IP you can
get in there directly using the
container ID but the facilities are
there so if I do a cfi CPS the same as a
docker PS i show that I've now got two
containers running that the second one
don't worry about just at the moment
hopefully i'm going to i'm going to try
the devil gods again and see whether or
not it works for the second one that
then runs I then paste in that public IP
address with the 8080 port and we're
running and that is running on a public
IP inside our IBM container service in
Europe and 1217 it really was yesterday
that's not bad 30-17 was closed so the
other things that we do for free for you
which is part of the reason why we're
here talking about how we're doing
things in cloud foundational services
and how IBM is extending this cloud
platform is we give you a lot of
capability for free for things like
logging metric statistics so all I've
done is I bound my application I ran it
in the cloud all of this just turns up
because it uses stood out so I've got a
logging environment that all of my
containers can log through into I've got
a metrics environment that as you can
see is just starting to come off because
I'd only just started running the
container I'll show you and hopefully
I'll show you in a second where we can
see more of that interface but this
enables you to to look at your own
containers and look at multiple of your
own containers running inside our cloud
environment now as we said there are
offerings on dedicated there are offers
on local if you want things closer to
your data center or you want things
dedicated for your customer but that
environment works quite nicely so that's
the first demo that's the failed demo
let's let's ignore that one but
hopefully that was that was slightly
useful
let's go and have a look and see with
whether or not we can play with these
devil and demo gods again so the second
demo that I was going to show you is
hopefully something a little bit more
interesting there's actually minecraft
so who's played minecraft who's got kids
to play minecraft mind play minecraft
there we go so so mine spend most of
their lives on minecraft so I got them
to have a little play for me I've got 10
year old Nate your old mason spend most
of their lives on the system at the
moment so what we're gonna do here is if
I can minimize that that was it all good
so here's one I prepared earlier I'm not
going to connect to the to the docker
hub I don't know what's wrong with out
this today but I loaded up yesterday a
couple of images for Minecraft as we
look at the minecraft server minecraft
as you know is java based application it
runs there's a simple docker file for it
if we go and have a look at the
dockerfile for it ah CD minecraft pat
doc file so that is the daka file for
minecraft so it's very simple based on
ubuntu does not get pulse actually
something off off amazon I've played
with the 1.88 version which is the
latest one that's out and it sets up a
couple of things accepts the license
then there's a start command because we
want to run it I could run it locally
but that would be boring we've already
shown that we can run things locally on
the machine so actually running this in
the container service would be more
interesting partly because I'm sure IBM
doesn't want me running games in their
container service but also partly
because it's a fun thing to do so we've
done a couple of extensions in the Star
Command because containers when you
first instantiate a container they take
a little while couple probably about 10
seconds to get networking to get the
public ip's all routed to get everything
actually working in the environment so
we've put a little delay in there of 30
seconds when the container first starts
up just so that it can make sure that
base environments all there so that's my
docker file
once we got the Dhaka fire exactly as we
did before we would just do a simple
docker build so run the docker build run
the push exactly as I did before I'm not
going to go over all the commands again
partly because I know the images up
their studies actually working so if i
do a cfi see images then that shows me
all the images that we've got and it
shows me the minecraft container the i
created 20 27 hours ago something like
that so now the more interesting thing
is I did that push and I did the run and
I actually made it so that it would run
on a public IP address so if i do a CF I
see p.s same as a docker PS that we
looked at before but hopefully live then
it shows me that I do have a successful
container running on to 55 65 is the
port that it's actually put in the
docker expose so we saw that in the
docker file and that's now a running
minecraft server running in a container
on a public IP address in Europe so
let's let's see let's see what happens
you've got it ok let's wonder what
happens so there's my containers
minecraft server excellent ok then one
number two works I'm happy with that and
so here is our container running in a
minecraft server but for those of you
that like to have a bit of fun and will
suddenly realize what my kids like we've
built docker in the world so there's
your doc a whale so this is a minecraft
server running anybody can log into this
it's a public IP address but if you want
to come in and have some fun it's
absolutely fine the latency is really
good running on it so yes ok this is a
game yeah this is a graphical game it's
heavy on network it's heavy on actually
doing CPU so you can see all types of
business use for this because if you can
do a game in it then you can do a lot of
other things in it so the changes as
anybody would expect are showing things
quite nicely now what I showed you
before which is the slightly more
interesting part is that we get logs and
things for free so as we get logs for
free I can go back into my bluemix
container over here so I'm in my bluemix
dashboard this is the IP address that
I'm actually running my minecraft
container in fingers crossed there you
go live demo does work Thank You devil
gods so we can show that over the last
little while nothing's been happening in
the system that I log in and all of a
sudden it starts spiking I'm starting to
do things I'm starting to use the
environment and my container is running
nicely on there so the other things that
we can do as we showed earlier is you
can look at some of the monitoring and
some of the logs now I showed in the
demo before I'll in the video before I
showed that there was just a couple of
little blobs coming out and you could
couple to see a couple of things coming
through but as this has been running for
a couple of days you can see each time
i've logged in to try it so you can see
my cpu usage as we spike you can see
actually growing it is a container group
actually the minecraft server doesn't
quite support multi multi service and in
a cluster yet that support is coming
we've got the infrastructure ready so
that we can spin at multiple busters on
it on a heat template because this does
run an OpenStack so that we can spin at
more clusters more minecraft servers in
the cluster based on demand so when we
get there it'll be nice so this those
shows where our CPU is spiking it shows
our memory utilization growing up some
slightly and it shows me as I fly around
the world it shows the network traffic
going up as you would expect so the
other thing you can look at is obviously
the logs now minecraft for any of those
those those of you that have looked at
the minecraft server log the one message
it spits out almost hugely is can't keep
up did the system clock change it's just
a message that comes out on everything
on there and one of my colleagues is is
in the game at the moment was just left
the game so bold pigeon has been
disconnecting and joining probably about
50 minutes ago so this is a public
public server it's only for demo
purposes we do shut it down at the end
of the day but if anybody wants to have
some fun then please feel free but
please don't blow the whale up it took
someone ages to do that okay so they
with a couple of things I wanted to show
you on the demo I'll actually show you
the interface working I can shrink that
and then I'm going to disconnect that
and go back to that with that thank you
very much for listening so anybody have
any questions apologies that the first
demo didn't work I'm going to go and
have a look and see what's wrong with
docker hub in a minute but I'm pleased
the second one did yep thank you so any
questions about any of what we've talked
about either the open source aspects of
IBM's involvement in OpenStack docker
cloud foundry or the bluemix platform
the Ralph has shown you excellent if not
there's one more slide I guess that we
just put up the IBM does have a booth
booth 30 downstairs there's actually a
very interesting demo going on there
there's a foosball table connected to
some analytics and bluemix and they can
talk to you a lot more about what we're
doing there and and if if this is
interesting to you obviously Ralph
mention there are free 30-day trials of
but as you want to go deeper there are
some offers for the dev ox community
again go to you can go to the IBM booth
and get a lot more detail on that and
we'll be around for a little bit if
you'd like to talk about anything else
but uh I think that's it thank you
thanks awful listening</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
