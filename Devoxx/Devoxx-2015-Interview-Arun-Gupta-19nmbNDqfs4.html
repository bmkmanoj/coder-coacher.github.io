joined by formerly of red hat now of cow
face Aaron Aaron just to kind of fill up
my readers in on the details you
recently moved to couchbase right I did
yeah so about six weeks ago I joined
couchbase and what are you doing at
catch bass I run the and the vice
president for developer advocacy team so
cal space is a no SQL database you know
you can use it as a key-value document a
key value store or a JSON oriented
document database so every time you
think about I need to store my document
you know as a JSON document that's when
you think of couchbase we just have to
release couchbase 4.0 a few weeks ago a
really good traction you know from the
PR of course but from developers we are
seeing good traction as well in terms of
the features that we have introduced
over there nickel which is which brings
query into json capabilities very unique
feature not just querying and other
document databases do that as well but
bringing SQL syntax to database or
document database is pretty cool things
like you know how we have a culture
based light which can run on your mobile
device and synced up with the server
some cool features for developers I
think it's particularly important isn't
it because it used to be people thought
of no SQL they kind of thought that like
one no SQL company everything it was the
same you're just kind of different
variations but actually all the leading
providers all very different niche
solutions right wait wait until one of
the things that I want to clarify no SQL
doesn't mean no SQL it means not only
SQL there are other means to query the
days on database as well SQL and then a
layer on top basically so in this case
typically in a SQL database uses select
star from table where this clause with
couchbase we give you the ability to
bring the exact same syntax that you are
familiar with to document database and
that's the cool part and what have you
been talking about at devoxx this week
yeah they're walks I'm a runner I am a
marathon so I had a nine hour of
marathon speaking sessions yeah today
and today graduation thank you well
received feedback well received people
seem to like it so yesterday I had three
hours of debauch a talker and coupon at
his university
which was a pretty hot topic I was in
the biggest room the room was free
packed a lot of interactions good almost
200 Twitter messages that I got you know
we were interacting constantly telling
people about what are the design
patterns and anti patterns of darker and
COO Benares so the morning was the
university we talked about lot of docker
one dot nine features which is pretty
brand-new released just last week so
talked about docker networking talk
about persistent storage compose for all
of that how doc containers can be used
in real life for production and then it
gave a flavored a little bit on cou
Benares as well and how you can use
those cubanelle docker containers to run
in cuban areas there was a production
scenario of two vanities that i
explained just to give people an idea of
how they can assess their size of a
kubernetes cluster so that was the
morning session then the evening session
afternoon session rather was again a
three-hour hands-on lab that room was
again packed back to literally 20
minutes before the session started so we
started early so many people they learn
again the talker and cook on it is
design patterns one thing that I love to
do in general is incomplete open and
transparent way so all that material is
available on github and of course i've
blogged about it and will put the links
below so if you for can find that yeah i
think the interesting kids obviously
people are very aware of dhaka and
keeping it tastes but maybe you aren't
quite sure how you would combine them or
kind of how you would take you in it
isn't to your production cycle it
because it's just not as widely blogged
about exactly and i think that was the
whole intention of giving the university
first so then you see me coding and then
in the afternoon you come on board how
do you build your first docker image
what does it mean by a docker image oh
and as geeks we get to enjoy it when we
see it coming you know how do i run a
first container oh my port is not
forwarded until you get your hands wet
you know you don't get a feel for it and
that was the exciting feeling happen do
you think there any aspects of docker
cuban estates it can be intimidating to
people that you see people kind of
struggling with meeting these workshops
they have they have so for example you
know just understanding the basic
concepts you know people tend to come up
all the time how does it work in darker
and how do i think in the darker land
so that is sort of one of the aspects
that people have seen struggling with in
that sense what you need to really think
about docker all it brings is a
packaging format it doesn't solve your
application architecture and problem so
you still have to kind of look at the
API and the good design practices it
does bring like Java gave us vora which
is write once run anywhere talker gives
you poder which is packaged ones deploy
anywhere so it gives you that
flexibility of deployment so that's one
of the facts that I've seen people
struggling with with Cuban Air is
typically the issues that I have seen is
where people are having a difficult time
wrapping your head around all the
concepts that they are there what is the
part what is the relationship with a
container what is the service what is
that application controller those basic
concepts putting their head around it
and the fact that they have to manually
write that configuration file is a
little bit daunting for them and I'm
guessing that over a period of time more
tools will be built which will say here
is my project generate my Cuban it is
configuration file with it and you go
figure out what the right thing needs to
be done and I think that's gonna be a
big win for Cooper natives in general
sense I'm just on the sense of docker at
devoxx I was speaking to the one from
take the outside the door ecosystem last
week and they were very surprised to
hear the Java developers are so excited
about docker well some of these
functionalities you kind of have anyway
it's not like in other languages why do
you think Java people are so excited
about doctor and the tools it brings I
think there is a big big correlation
between that as some people i talked to
this internal doctor is going to get rid
of Java Java won't be government anymore
which is like you know the rumors of my
death are exaggerated to give it that
way so I think dr. is very complementary
to Java I know Java brings you write
once run anywhere but you still have to
figure out what is your operating system
how your jeddak is going to be tuned
what applications are you going to use
what no SQL or relational database
you're going to use end of the day you
have to build an application with all of
those different services on components
so docker really solves that for example
with docker compost you can say here is
my big application I'm going to run a
wild fly server I'm going to use my
couch base as a no SQL database and this
is how the talk with each other doctor
gives you that ability
you can package that application very
nicely independent of the language so
make it truly polyglot not just be
restricted to Java and gives you that
nice ability where you can package that
application you can't say hey it works
on my machine and not on yours right is
dr. engine is the base layer you know
you a platoon has to behave exactly the
same way I think that's the beauty that
I like about docker yes especially in
Java people are kind of increasing like
a oracle announced JavaScript frameworks
library / however you want to kind of
define it like three but you've got kind
of all these new language options with
Java developers are going to have to
pick up right I mean one of the cool
things is you know as part of the darker
file itself you can specify your JDK
settings you know how do I want to peel
my jdk you know what how many thirds do
I want all those settings really go into
your darker file as opposed to an
installation script or something like a
chef for a puppet so I think that brings
that makes it really complementary to
Java in that sense thank you very much
your chest into a sarin and we look
forward to reading your new upcoming
rough oh thank you same here as well all
