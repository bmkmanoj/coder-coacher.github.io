hi he's giving you talk quite usability
yes so we're actually chatting casually
in the other day about you done see and
about how there isn't a lot of focus on
it or as much as you would like to be
can you explain notes well it's not so
much a lack of focus as much as not
every single company or every single
product gets to take this into account
and I don't think that's normal because
usability well when you think about it
we do make things for humans or other
systems to be able to use so if we can't
use it the way it's meant to be used
then it doesn't work at least in my book
I shouldn't have to torture myself to be
able to use your product and what I
noticed more and more is when I work
with certain clients that are at the
beginning stage of their journey or some
clients that are very limited in terms
of budget usability gets thrown at
whatever team wants to pick it up or it
implicitly agreed that oh somehow this
will work out and magically our product
will be usable which is not the case
so it's interesting you to say that
because I've been in officiated either
in many occasions and in doing that
yourself and so if you're designing your
own usability test where would you start
so are there any resources people can go
to there's quite a few and believe it or
not there's quite a few resources on
medium.com that get started that you
know people were tired of waiting for
this to be a regular occurrence so you
can find people's opinions and what they
experimented with and what works for
them on medium there's also a
fundamental book by Steve Kruger which
is don't make anything so if you want to
get started somewhere just start reading
this and you'll understand this in very
very simple terms there's also quite a
few tools that enable you to do remote
usability testing and usually these
tools have amazing resources to help you
around I am NOT going to choose to name
a few but then you
then I'll be asked you know why didn't
you name this one or that one you just
can't figure them out quite fast and so
when I think these birth testings and
I'm complete novice ignorant of use
testing I think of tea-things automatic
testing and then getting people in to
use your app is that something well it
depends how you approach usability
testing you can test remotely with a
service where you know users will be
recruited for you or you can also
suggest some users or you can do this
in-house
you know in a conference room basically
and have either better testers or or you
know a few users that represent some
segments of your audience or your
customers test it out so there are some
pitfalls and especially when it comes to
choosing users oftentimes people will
try to choose users that are already
super users yeah that already know the
product you know like the back of their
hands and the problem with that is
they're already problem they're already
trained so they're not going to have the
same frustrations as the beginning user
or a brand new user that doesn't even
know your product or the industry it's
in the other thing is when you take a
remote route and you trust a company to
outsource this user testing recruiting
so who's going to be testing a product
how what when the biggest problem I
found and it's a pitfall is that these
users also primed they're also used to
testing things because that's how they
make money and it can be good or it can
be bad because they may not represent
your target audience they may not
represent the regular user because they
are a type of super user as well yeah so
it's finding the happy medium as to who
are you going to have test your product
it's not the biggest challenge it's one
of them the other one is actually
integrating usability testing in various
processes in a company because it
integrates actually quite well it
doesn't cost very much and it doesn't
delay any development processes but a
lot of people try to push it at the end
and it's one of the worst things that
you can do because then you've invested
so much time so much energy in building
some
that you are involved in you're anchored
in its success so you will not accept
some of the feedback because it means
that you have to go back and fix it yeah
see you again kind of a vicious cycle
yeah I'm assigning kind of OSHA my steez
village testing you can do and for me I
would not necessarily have it automated
because one of the first things you have
to figure out is what are your
hypothesis what do you want to test and
what areas are what types of user
testing you want to do so there's
various types that you can do and the
ones we keep talking about currently you
and I are more of this scripted kind but
you could also go for card sorting you
could validate your personas I mean
there's a lot of things I can do in
terms of usability testing and I think
that if you want to get started and
you're more of a developer go with the
scripted kind because then you'll figure
out what is my objective what are the
parts of the website or application that
I know my users are going to have
frustrations with or maybe you have a
vested business interest so you have a
business objective people should be able
to buy X and if that purchase flow
doesn't work
then you have a problem because the
product is not going to work in terms of
business so figure out what you want
what the different tasks are and then
create a scenario and you know retest it
can be part of a cycle it's very
iterative but I would not trust it to be
automated because you always have to
have that thinking in the back of your
mind what are we testing this time and
why what's the priority human element
