crowded room here my name is Robert
Salta I'm the chairman of the apache
meth project I'm responsible for most of
the inflammations done for java 9 I've
done this talk a couple of times but I
had a much more time at that President
edit conferences so at this time I've
only got 30 minutes so I'm going to do
it a bit different I'm going to migrate
the project at just an example project
to Java nine first a little bit of
history so in 2013 we started with the
jaw line early releases and there were
no remarkable issues for when running
with the maven in 2015 we started with
the implementation based on jigsaw and
with the first release ninety-nine
percent of all java method projects they
failed to compile the reason for it was
that it could not find the java compiler
because with maybe we are not using the
command line but we are using the java
implementation to compile the open jdk
was able to fix that within 72 hours and
it was released quite fast so we had up
till now 0 lines of code changed in May
of core to run on Java nine so like I
said I'm going to migrate an example
project it was it's quite an old project
it was used in the maven by example book
it's a multi-module enterprise project
and it's using still spring to and
hibernate 3 so it is old first of all
who has never used maven
okay because I'm not going to explain
maven this off and who has never used
off has no experience with Java nine
absolutely nothing that will be art okay
yeah i think tomorrow there's a session
by ellen Bateman and mardra notes they
will go into detail about all the
specifics of Java nine so I don't have
time to explain it so just it will be
kind of complex probably but just follow
the presentations tomorrow and maybe it
makes sense afterwards so I picked up
this project is example project and I
did a small couple of changes so I added
the maven shade plugin to make it much
easier to create an executable boobage
are the other thing is unlocked the
mason jar plug in and may even wore plug
into in this case both to the six which
is the latest of the tooth experience
and I also edit an h vm to dbl to create
the database so i'm working with maven
three dot 30 40 snapshot and you will
see would have a colorized output the
examples will also work with maven 30
that's one of our challenges we had and
up till now we are able able to run all
the maven and the GF 9 stuff with may 30
and i'm using a jet a1 dot 8 and of
course also java nine one of the latest
early access releases so here it is it's
an multi-module project and the neck
lifts it looks like this it has a
command module the model parent to
execute all these modules to persist for
of course the data stuff the weather
service and a web app
so first let's see if it runs like this
this knife so right now I'm running it
with a Java 8 just to confirm that is it
executes still even though it is a very
very old project success ok now let's do
this set Java arm too and no failure
alright so the first thing we see here
is that the source and the target are
set to 1 dot 5 and with java 9 it only
accepts the version 6 and above so this
means that we have to change that and
let's do it here nope parents
so here we have the mail compiler plugin
with one dot five and what we are going
to do is we're going to upgrade this to
version 3 dot 620 and we're going to use
a new element and which is introduced in
Java nine and that's called release so
okay in this case I chose to use java 6
as the minimum for him to run it with
and not java five that would also be
possible but in that case i had 24 i
have to fork the java compiler so like I
said source target option 1 025 no
longer supported so if we want to use
Java 5 we could configure the move tool
chain plugin or in this case if I said
we want to stay compatible with java 6
and we use in this case the release 6
option let's see
ouch close but we're not there yet okay
so what is the problem right now so as
you can see in maven the next term Ava
version you will get a much better
coloring which shows you the problem it
has here so in this case it is
complaining about the mail from war
plugin and the actual issue is with in
extreme and this is a part which has to
do with not with this one but it has to
do with the the ability to access fields
with a reflection and that's not
possible it'sit's bit harder in Java
nine so I forgot something it looks like
so let's go back here because i was
expecting that it would fail mmm okay i
was expecting that if you are using an
old version of the may for plug-in and
mason jar plugin that it would fail with
an index array out of bound exception i
can show you the reason why so let's say
here login ID
all right and I set firm to dot six
okay this is the real problem i was
looking for so in this case we can see
that the mason jar plugin is if it is
having an issue it has an issue with
well let's see it's always looking for a
cause and let's hear the array index out
of bounds index it's getting a 1 and the
reason behind this is this with a java 9
they introduced a new version scheme and
that means that up until now they use
for for instance java version 1 dot nine
though and they are going to use just
simple nine and what we are always using
to detect if which version of Java is
used split that version and get the
second element so that's the reason why
you gets the in the index out of bounds
action so this was fixed in the maven
archive of 301 and that is an dependency
for all the other our driver plugins so
like I said make the up again and may
for plug-in if you set it to 300 todo it
will be fixed may the ear plug in still
needs to be released it will probably be
300 as well and right now there's a
fault on the maven assembly plugin to
fix that as well the maven javadoc
plugin has exactly the same issue and
that has already been fixed in to them
but for so in general just look if you
hit something which looks like an area
index out of bondage ception which with
just one just upgrade to the latest
version of the specific plug-in so we
also noticed the other issue and that
was this inaccessible object exception
we noticed and it has to do with the
awkward strong a capitulation so it is
something which has to be fixed with it
within the extreme and which is not
available yet or something has to be
improved in jigsaw
we could also think of having a terrific
implementation change it with in may for
plug-in or don't create a war and that's
what I'm going to choose in this case
just for just to be able because in the
end we are going to only excuse the
command line tool so this can be 300 and
we're going to remove this one
okay so what have we done right now so
we are using Java 9sd java runtime for a
maven and also the jdk to compile the
application with we've only upgraded a
couple of plugins and we changed we
replaced the source and target with the
new option of release let me also
explain another strong thing about
release if we have looked at for
instance this one it's still saying that
it it is a java 5 project because
eclipse is not aware of this new release
dec but what's so special about this is
a let me see that's not one I'm looking
for
almost so what that okay so what we're
seeing here is even though it is a job
of five project this three methods has
been introduced with in Java 8 and
somehow eclipse is not explaining about
it if I would compile this with Java 8
with in combination with the source and
target just being set to 1 dot 6 it
would simply compile but with this new
release argument it will really compile
as if it was targeting java 6 in this
case so if we're going to do it like
this click open you'll see that it's
saying you cannot find symbol so this is
a very strong thing which has been added
to Java nine if you I can show you with
so first this now I'm again using Java 8
but Java it is not recognizing of course
the release option so let's change that
back to know that's not a good option so
sure actually I think the default is
already this value ok so my clean
compile as you can say as you can see if
you run it with Java 8 and it's
containing Java 8 girl it's not
complaining about it even though you're
targeting java 6 so that's the really
thing that if you have the chance to
switch to that release option you should
really do that so now that it's working
with java 9 it's time to start with the
module info file who's aware of the
module info file good enough ok so the
first thing we want to do is you have to
specify the modules you are depending on
so it's something like the dependencies
but the dependencies are there to
download the complete the dependencies
and make them available for the
classpath or majak path and within with
the module file info file you can
specify those inner inner relationships
so if i run a new the dependency plugin
and i execute the list goal you will see
that it will also expose the module
names used and that's very interesting
if you want to set up that model info
file it is really using the code of java
9 to detect of to translate the name of
the jar to a new module name so in
normal cases it is about replacing
dishes to with dots so here
we have comments logging and it's going
comments logging so let's start with the
model and you can create a new file and
it's called module info touch java and
it's now you have to give it a name and
it's a simple data model if there were
no dependencies I could execute it like
this so let's see I think I need this
one outer stone a book of course in it
it's here so let's see of course
okay so right now it is saying that it
can only execute the model info file
with you are using Java 9sd source so
okay now we have to make a choice are we
going to make this a Java nine
application or not well this is our
application so let's go for it so we're
going to change this to nine right again
a lot of dependencies it is not
recognizing so from now on and it is
saying that it's not recognizing the
Java persistence and that's a hibernate
dependency so what we have to do is we
need to add requires requires hibernate
and we acquire hibernate dot and
notations these are also here specified
in the bum file so here they are Nate
and audacious in the hibernate you see
here an exclusion and that's something
that is not possible anymore so if you
want to exclude something you cannot
exclude it from the module so here we
have a probably a discussion with the
jigsaw to himself still so first let's
see what was going to happen right now
okay so what we see is there's a package
collision and this is something about
that packages should be unique within
every gr and in this case hibernate
nhibernate annotations are both using
the same packages and jigsaw is
complaining about it gives an exception
and there's not so much you can do about
it not extra arguments or something so
you should really hope that hibernate
consult this for you well as I said this
is already a very old project so this
they changed it and if I'm correct it's
now called three dots six dot nine dots
final I think
I made a typo i think small letters
you've been using it still like this oh
also small look I don't think so
you
it should be this
f capital arise
okay looking better but now it is
complaining about right i still have
specified here in my module info file
that it was depending on hibernate and
hibernate annotations that's not right
anymore so this is gum I've made dot
core as you can see it will take some
time to switch to to implement this
module info file there's always this
question can you generate this part of
the model info file well this part
probably you can but in this case I have
to upgrade hibernate but there is much
more information in this module file and
that part cannot be generated so right
now I we have decided well there are
much more things we need to change in
maven so let's do it by hand by now and
maybe we can think about some
improvements in the future so let's see
I also have the solution of course and
here this is how it should look in the
end so here specify have net core and in
case of the model because and this also
has I've nightcore and hibernate jpa and
you have to export the package you want
to expose to other modules also
something you can learn tomorrow
um let's see so I had to add this part
to this file no to this file
okay so right now we have started with
migrating the first module to Java nine
modular jar and you have to do that for
every module you fi inside here so well
I have still have three minutes I was
aware that at that time is not enough to
do this all but this gives you an
example of how you can start migrating
to a Java nine let's see how to continue
well not all issues are related to maven
for instance the content in the module
info file there are still a lot of
discussions about it the naming we now
have open modules and we have week
motives and so on that's not very
interesting for maven in this case may
of compiler just needs to note all the
arguments being able to execute it we
will also write a several major recipes
for instance if you really want to have
a maven five of a Java five four three
or maybe older but also want to add the
module info file that's possible we have
a recipe for it on the on our website
with the mef compiler plugin that's
about it so that was a very small
introduction about all the steps you
have to take with maven perspective so
in general it just means that you can
still use may 30 just upgrade to the
latest and greatest maven plugins visit
our website and that's it thank you very
much and if there are any questions
please yes
yeah so the question is about the the
full structure so yes in the examples
given by the jigsaw team they are going
to change that but that it's not
necessary so you can still keep your
swordsman Java no problem and the reason
for it is that in case of mavin they
will it will generate only one artifact
and with the structure it could create
multiple artifacts well that's not going
to work so you just keep it Strassman
java that's all more questions yes yes
if you are talking about that's there's
an overlap between it but depends is
about resolving the correct versions and
downloading them and requires means
about they that they are available on
the module path so it's it's kind of
it's not exactly the same Magnus
different purpose than a jigsaw so but
in in the end what you should will see
is that all the direct dependencies you
specify in the pom file that should also
match the requirements that requires in
your module info file 30 seconds all
right I will live like this thank you
very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
