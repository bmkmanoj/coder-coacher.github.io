software we make java developer tools
we've been doing it for 20 years now we
started in the Apple webobjects world
but then we went full Java about 15
years ago and we have a reporting tool
that's basically a page layout program
in Java and then an engine for
generating reports and so starting about
seven years ago as a labor of love I
started writing a developer tool because
we were teaching my wife and I were
teaching a class at our local middle
school and we just couldn't find the
right tool that you know a lot of
classrooms are using eclipse for this
and it's kind of I'm stealing a line I
think from a room Gupta but it's kind of
like learning how to fly on a 747 so the
idea of snapcode was to be a lot more
approachable to students a lot simpler
to work with and then recently in the
last year our focus has been getting
those apps that you write in snap code
to run in the browser and and of course
the this used to be pretty easy 10 20
years ago but in the last few years
applets of course fallen out of favor so
we've taken this approach of compiling
the Java to JavaScript using a really
cool library out there called tvm so I'm
going to give you a demo of a kind of
introductory programming concepts and
then showing how you can you can write
them as desktop apps and then with one
line of code you can run them in the
browser and and so that makes java
relevant again the one thing our
students they would get excited by the
programming and they want to share it
they'd want to show Mom and Dad
want to show grandma and and
unfortunately at the time like that up
it was it was really locked inside of
eclipse and grandma didn't have Eclipse
running on her computer so so I guess
that's kind of the impetus for where we
are now so so snap code is available at
our website it's an easy download it's a
nice self-contained IDE so it's a 40
megabyte download and it's got all the
developer tools in there everything to
get you right to this welcome panel here
and to start coding and so i'll start by
typing in saying what a new project i'll
call this diva one and open it up and so
I have a new empty project here and so
so the first thing that we would do in
our little class is is use a tool like
scratch and there's quite a few of them
now Google made one at one point and
there's a few online but a it's the
basic puzzle piece programming thing but
our twist on on it was that we made
those puzzle pieces actually front for
java code and so the thing we found out
when we are doing our classes we could
teach them scratch and we could
introduce them to concepts of method
calls and functions but but then we kind
of take a step backwards when we try to
transition them to code but they didn't
quite understand you know how that
mapped over and so so by doing this kind
of scratch environment on top of a real
job ide we can you'll see in a moment
how we can just go back and forth so
i'll say i want to make a new snap
project out of this normal project and
so what this does is it adds our little
snap kit UI library and it creates a new
scene object which is going to hold our
our characters for our little animation
and then i'll just say simply that i
want to add a new
factor and i'll select the cat here and
click ok and so it's supposed to show up
on the screen here but we're kind of in
the middle of the little riorca texture
so this features is broken probably for
another couple weeks but in our scene we
see here that it actually added the weld
added our cat class and a cat image and
then in our scene in the constructor it
added the new cat so for the cat it's
showing here the boilerplate code for a
sprite in our in our little game but
what I'm going to do is switch it over
to snap code and so this is where the
scratch like environment comes into play
so we've got a our constructor still and
a main method and our act method and so
we can just do something really simple
here like say I want to drag in this
move by 10 so this act method gets
called once well 30 times a second once
for every frame and our animation and so
just with that one little guy in there
i'll click run and and so here's our
program with a cap running off the
screen and so then i'll add a few more
things in here there's a there's a pen
so in the constructor I might tell it to
looks that's not actually what I want to
do
here we go so I'm going to tell it to do
a pen down in the constructor and then
on each frame I wanted to change the pen
color to random and so I'll save this
and run again and so now the cat runs
across the screen and as he runs his pen
is leaving a mark and on every frame
it's changing the color and then finally
to make it a full-fledged game i'm going
to say i want to set the rotation so I
per rotation key here and i'll drag that
in and i want to set it to than what the
parameter to actually be a method as
well i'm going to have it get the angle
between the character and the mouse and
so just with those few drags there we
now have a cat chasing the mouse game so
so this is a way getting students
started doing programming a you know
without all the problems of syntax and
semicolons and and you can get them
started and almost as a game but at
every step along the way they can toggle
back and forth and say oh here's the
code this is actually real java code
that I'm creating and so that way a
stepping stone doesn't become a crutch
that prevents them from moving on to the
next level or slows down their moment to
the next level you know it's really just
an assist that's introducing them to
programming at the same time they're
learning about you know basic program
constructs so then one final thing I
want to do here is what I was talking
about earlier is getting this in the
browser so after a day of programming we
want to be able to share it with the
family so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to add another project a dependent
project to our little game here and this
is called snap key and this is what
binds to the
the tvm compiler I was mentioning it
earlier but it's a great tool written by
this guy it's remarkable it deserves a
lot more attention than it's getting but
it takes a compiled Java program and
trans files it into JavaScript and so so
so our whole environments this snap kit
is really a UI library that is it runs
on top of swing and it runs on top of
JavaFX and if there's an adapter to run
in this tvm environment which actually
uses HTML Dom so it uses a canvas object
and it draws lines in HTML so just by
adding this project here and then I'm
going to add one line of code that this
is our main method and the main method
creates a view owner for this scene and
tells it to set its window visible but
what I'm going to do right before that
is i'm not so snap key TV set and just
by doing that it's going to tell snap
code to use the compiler that will take
us to t vm instead
right
there goes
so this is a it auto detects that I've
referenced the snap t or t vm and and so
instead of running it as a desktop app
it generates the JavaScript generates a
little HTML sub file and pops open the
browser and so here's that exact same
game as you know just adding one line of
code and it's running in the browser so
that's you know kind of week 1 and 2 of
a programming course you know then after
a while we want to get them you know
comfortable with real coding they not
going to be able to get a lot of jobs
dragging around puzzle pieces so I'm
going to say I'm going to create a new
project here and i'm going to call this
gebo to and to open it up and and i'm
also going to add the snap kit to this
and while I'm at it I might as well add
snap key because we're going to go to
the browser out as well and i'm going to
say add a new java file i'm going to
type in hello world so our app here is
going to be hello world and and so I
want this to be a view owner so snap kit
uses the the most plain-spoken a model
view controller paradigm that that that
we could possibly come up with and so
the view owner is the is the controller
class and and so it basically has a
three methods in it a create you I
method and a respond or reset you I
method and a respond you I method so I'm
just going to override the create you I
method
and and I'm just going to have it return
a button that says hello world and then
write my standard main method and just
like in the other one I'm going to say
new hello world for my view owner set
window visible to true and you know so
here we have our controller is our view
owner a whole world our view is what's
created in this crate UI and and of
course this can get as complicated or
sophisticated as we want it to and then
our main method here so I'll go ahead
and run this and this will run a very
simple desktop application with our
button in it which is clickable and then
just to make it slightly more
interesting let's go ahead and make this
a local variable and give it a size 300
by 300 and then return the button and so
now when we run it we have have it in a
bigger window there and and then again I
can just say snap T that TV set I
double-click and because I've referenced
the snap key it's running the compiler
and so here's that exact same desktop
application running in a browser again
and so to show the some of the other
methods here
I've gotta reset you I method that takes
a view event and and up here let me name
my button set name to my button and I'll
just say if the event is equal to my
button then the event get view that set
text to let's see let's just say button
was pressed
let me run this as a desktop app first
yeah maybe I should be setting the let's
say button got class
well let's see let's make sure this is
getting called now it'll do that for us
automatically I'm sure I'm just doing
something silly here yeah of course i'm
using the reset method and it's respond
you I I should notice I wasn't getting
my overriding angle here nothing here so
now yeah president it says buckle is
pressed yeah so yeah so that's that's
the month two and three is teaching them
about model-view-controller programming
and and then of course modern
programmers should really learn how to
use a UI builder so now i'm going to
create a UI file and snap kit has a full
UI builder and an UI file format and so
this is the what I did is I created a UI
file that has the same name as our view
owner class and so when when we run the
program it'll look for a UI file with
the exact same name and automatically
loaded and so I'll just drag in a label
and a button and a slider and I'll
resize the slider and I'll drag and drop
in a logo here and i'll save that and
then and then i'm gonna get rid of our
manual create uija method and we'll just
let it use the default which you'll find
our
which will find our UI file and so you
know so now here's our here's our
program and then once again i will
uncomment our javascript transpiler line
of code and it'll run the same program
but it will compile it to JavaScript and
generate our HTML and in fact let's
let's reset the background of this guy
to something
yeah so we wrote a desktop app with all
those UI controls in it and then with
that one line of code we get the exact
same program running in the browser
again yeah so then let's see finally I
will another big one because because I'm
a dinosaur I guess is in our class I
felt like it was important to teach
command line programming that that to me
when you're in a school setting these
kids are going to math class all the
time and they're learning you know
Pythagorean theorem or they're learning
how to calculate the length of a
alternate side of a triangle and so
those are some very simple formulas and
so I thought it was effective and of
course it was the way a lot of us
learned but to be able to take that
knowledge and code it up very quickly
and one of the quickest best ways to do
that is just command line programming so
i'm going to call this one digo three
and open this up and so this is a new
empty project and i'm going to add snap
kit again and i'll go and add a new java
file and i'm going to call this scan
test and then i want this class to be a
subclass of something we call scan pain
and then i'm going to write a very
standard main method again
and I'll just start by assisting system
dot out dot print line enter two numbers
and i'll create a scanner and so usually
you create a scanner from some import
input source a file or an input stream
or our system dot in i actually have one
here that the scan pain has its own
system dot in that old that'll work from
a UI or from system dot in so i'm going
to say a new scanner from system dot in
and then i'll say Val 1 is equal to scan
next int vow to is equal to scan next
int and then system i want to read them
so i'm going to go with air the total
value is l1 plus l2
and so just running this as something
you'd see in any java book
and write this thing's on autopilot
yeah so here we go so I run it and and
just using standard system dot in it'll
bring up the console here and it's
written enter two numbers and i'll just
say 22 and 33 bryant why didn't that
work
take two
all right 22 33 and the total 55 all
right so yeah so this is the standard
version and then I want this to be a
Java desktop app and so a scan test is
also a view owner so i'll just say new
scan test set window visible the true
and and so now instead of system dot in
i will use the scan veins in and and so
now we've got a desktop app and and so
this is a I found it really annoying to
teach command-line programming you know
in the little console window that they
were more comfortable seeing a real
application so that that was kind of a
whole impetus of this scan pain and then
to get into the browser as well so yeah
so here's the same program as a desktop
app and then I'll go back and add our
tvm transpiler and I'll add our magic
line of code and and this is going to be
anti-climatic because I grabbed a new
version of the tvm compiler last week
and it fixed a couple of nice bugs but
for some reason I lost system dot out
dot print line but it is it is doing the
scan pain part of it is working but I'm
going to have to do some debugging to
find out what happened to my to my other
one although actually why don't we just
go to the website
yeah so this is using an older version
of of snap t and so this one is it is
about a 10 line version of that last
program where i can say add two numbers
22 and 33 is 55 where i can say multiply
22 x 33 726 and so this one actually it
takes that scan pain and it wraps it up
inside of a tab pain and in the tab pain
we have a little source for you yeah
let's see I'm not sure I can oh here we
go yeah let's see what happens I think
it's inside of it yeah there we go glad
I've got a plant in the audience knew
that would work yeah so and then there
was a there's a few fun ones there I so
even wrote a green foot is anybody
familiar with a green foot developer
environment yeah so so we wrote a green
foot emulation library that sits on top
of snap kit and so once we had the green
foot emulation library working we could
take that to to JavaScript so let's see
if I can find
yeah here's asteroids so this is green
foot asteroids running in a browser yeah
and so this is you know all the green
foot in a reset button and let's see I
think there's even the feature that if
you command click it'll duplicate the a
object that you click on and and so now
when we run it we're going to have a
much better chance of winning yeah so
then and then there was there's busybox
going let me get really brave here oh I
don't have that source here alright let
me let me go and run that one too so
this is just a lot of things in snap kit
buttons and so these are tied to our
little animation library and I can move
through here and there's even animation
for which thing you choose and sliders
have some animations on them
yes I usually I keep a copy of busy box
that job over here and I just drag it in
and I run it and it runs as a desktop
app and then I add the line or uncomment
throwing a code out and it runs in the
browser but I'm on my travel machine I
don't have that sitting here yeah so so
that was a tool in action and like I
said yeah motivated by our experiences
and trying to teach a little class and
snap kid is free and it's out there it's
I don't think a lot of people are using
it and I think it's in it's usually in a
pretty good state it's missing a few
things right now that I ran into as I
was showing you the demo but but anybody
presses me on anything we get those
fixed and that's my talk</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
