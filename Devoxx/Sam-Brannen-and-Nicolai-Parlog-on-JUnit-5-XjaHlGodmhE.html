so hi everybody we're vox Dei Zurich
2017 and Catherine put me up to
interview somebody else so I decided to
pick them round we gave a great talk
today about Jane is five so I want to
ask you a lot about technical aspects
but about the background of Jane is five
what why why is James five why is it not
change four point 13 what what happened
there and there you can take it from
there sure so arm Jennifer's been around
for a long time right always been based
on on Java five so kind of limited to
the feature set there and having a new
major release implies that you can also
build on something newer right like Java
8 whoo such good reason they're so
allowing a few things like streams and
land expressions all those kind of stuff
making you some the new features in Java
8 improving the api's etc so using it
internally and you also providing
features with subscreen slammed up their
minds right right so internally an
implementation we use streams we use
optional functional programming method
references all this kind of stuff makes
our jobs easier as developers for the
framework itself but also for the end
users you can also use land expressions
and method references for things like
I'm assertion tour assert throws or a
certain time out she's kind of stuff
also for the other groups assertions
think you've seen that with a circle so
on and more importantly things like
dynamic tests so on the fly you can now
generate like a stream or a collection
of a dynamic tests based on line of
expression stuff yeah yeah boss about
that people especially coming from other
languages like Scala then used to
writing tests spectacle Atlantis in very
very low ceremony way so with dynamic
tests you kinda you can kind of emulate
that but of course the cause of
limitations of the Java language you
can't quite get there you think like
dynamic tests for the charges towards
creating test would land us I could you
get day even more would there be a way
maybe to make it even more Lum desk or
well yeah I think you actually know the
answers about yourself I've seen some
examples you've had online so using like
the double bracken ish Eliza right with
a sub classing dynamics talk about to
fly you can even get more focused on on
land expressions of Seti writing the
actual test methods annotated with what
that test but yeah you're right so Java
doesn't really allow you to have like a
dsl like you can do with
ooh baby likes boxes um can definitely
do more with lambda expressions and
maybe maybe we find some someone out
there willing to write some test engines
right just like that or maybe a some
additional support in NJ at Jupiter
itself so Jane Cooper's the programming
model for June I've talked about test
engines and about the it was interesting
that thing the goal of the platform and
hot test engines work with us right so
I'm Jane forage probably no one big jar
right so it was all combined together so
the test discovery and execution kind of
in this runner API and with some Jane 25
we started out thinking we really want
to move away from that separate these
things so we came up with a new idea we
have the platform that anyone can build
on and we have a test engine API it's
kind of like the runner from Jane of
four but we have that so different
people can implement that four different
languages even our image ATM so not just
limited to Java there's some
implementations already out there
there's one for Cortland expect there's
another guy who's written the framework
called spec see handing supports scholar
groovy and and Java and of course we
have java based support for on the GFI
program model anjana for yeah sure so
well in the beginning to just set out to
create a universal platform or was it
more like okay we're trying to separate
each concerns and then you realized on
the way like wow this is actually
something that other people can use to
it's actually the ladder so when we
started out we had the idea of what
would be the best way to do it
architecture link and we started off
calling everything jayden lambda it was
all in the same same base package and
then after a few months we started
looking at and realized wait I think
we're onto something here this is
actually a platform where building so we
realized the core part wasn't in any way
related to the new programming model
hood and we realized we could completely
separate that and so we did and we ended
up taking those modules and renaming
them to Jane at platform yeah so part of
what we're doing with the Jane at five
initiative is actually releasing a new
project called the giant platform
version 10 and it has support for Jane
at four and I has support for the new
Jane of five program model which we call
Jane and Jupiter since the Jupiter's did
find out on the sign right okay so next
one will get better in them or we're not
adding on Jena six no no I think there
will be a genetic so what we've done now
is on with much there do we have
um we have now the opportunity to
release more frequently during recent
major numbers more frequently right so
image released we could do a Jane at six
right it might be but based on the job
and I nor javatm something like that or
by reusing the same programming model
right so that works quite nicely if we
have this program model called Jane of
Jupiter it would still make sense to
call Jay and a Jupiter version 6 right
there whereas if he had j unit 5 version
6 they will be weird yes I'm strange Jim
the engines like when I write tests no I
used to the Jupiter API to watch the
test again and then the engine is going
to execute this miss engine artifact
what does it come from because at the
moment as I ciated ship ideally chips
with the IDE right but what happens
would upgrade so with women because I d
struggle with delivering me five
different engines for 57 change which I
might be using at the same time across
different project so what works right
what's your plan I'm actually not a fan
of having the IDS include that I mean I
realize they're there are a lot of
jealous out there that I'm just want to
start the IDE and writing test nurses
and I think maybe it's okay for them to
have a version in there but to be a
really professional have you know
reproducible builds and some ways that
really ideally should be using something
like by Gradle or maven okay fancy
management and you should be specifying
the versions of the testing framework
you want as well right so if you're
using brings testing support you would
want the latest version and spring
special support and the same would be
true for for Janet right so ideally
maybe IDs will pick it up from there may
be like use the jaw that their find in
there and then the greater lack of
prescriptions okay so i said progress on
back or on I de Cide I think as far as I
know intelligence most advanced what is
their approach on this are they shipping
arm they have they try to keep up with
the latest mouse on currently I and
their ideas to have on the ga release
whatever the current which releases but
how about in in by default but if you
have a different version in the
classpath and they will take that Delano
huh so okay cool yeah thank you very
much I think we'll of slip by okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
