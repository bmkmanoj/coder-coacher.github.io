coming to this session about Jason
processing that's going to be
implemented this new feature for java
yet and it's something that it's coming
and probably of you are here because you
know that JSON format it's becoming the
effect format for rest api services so
all you want to know how you can you
know parse JSON files in java my name is
Alex Otto I'm a software engineer at
cloudbees but also you can find me
several open source companies I sorry
communities I'll miles the author of
apache tomcat ref card and currently I'm
co-working with Jason Porter in the book
or clean in action ok and my name is
meaty meat risky I work for us off a
company called corner in Sweden um I'm
also involved into various open source
communities and the two of us have been
involved in to the expert group for
adding new new updates to the creation
processing KPI ok so for those of you
who don't know what the current JSON
processing KPIs that's GSR 353 basically
it's the Java X Jason packages so I mean
it has a little bit unfortunate naming
because it's called JSON P so this is
not valid JSON it's not Jason plz padded
Jason it means Jason processing there
are several classes that were already
part of the API this is like a low-level
API for three Volker building off of a
JSON so Jason reader Jason writer Jason
values and so on they are currently for
this API implementations the reference
definites implementation is in glassfish
there's also johnson jenison and so on
you can include the dependency like this
on non glassfish servers but this is
provided in in some versions of glass
which so we were not be going to be
talking about the
the current API we're going to be
talking about the additions that we've
been working on as part of the expert
group so those are additions are
basically mostly our aft standards so
I'm RFC 7159 oh also called as the new
Jason I will be talking about the
additions that we have put into the JSON
objects for transformations and
procreation and certain facilities that
enable some of the other work that we
have done also we'll be talking about
Jason pointer Jason pad Jason merge
patch Jason queries and some alignments
with it we have been doing with some of
the other other teams working on on
other aspects of Joey okay so Jason
what's Jason it's a it's one of the
things that became really extremely
popular it the specification was written
initially by Douglas Crockford while he
was working in yahoo at the time i
believe so it's something that was
written in 2006 it's also RFC standard
oh and I mean it has proven to be
extremely successful there are hundreds
or even thousands of implementations in
almost any language out there and it's
it's one of the things that see kind of
the de facto default default default
format for using nowadays ok so what has
been changed in the new standard all
right the new standard is something done
by a guy called Tim Bray from google if
you actually read the the RFC document
um there isn't really much change there
it's mostly like fine refinement of
certain implementation aspects so where
people were implementing the the JSON
parsers they would make certain mistakes
and certain assumptions and that would
cause incompatibilities between
different Jason implementations the
compatibility is usually minor like I
don't know someone use
through uppercase and lowercase with the
case would not matter on a value but on
in other implementations that might
matter but what's really a big change
and this this standard is that you can
actually add values as a top level
element in the Indy Jason object that's
the actual the actual big change so
beside that change we also are working
also on the reference implementation we
are doing that in order to actually get
better understanding of how the actual
API will work so there are a couple of
things that we added these are these
builders this artist factories for
creation of the immutable objects like
create value of something of shrink of
integer of bigdecimal and some of the
common objects and we added some stuff
in the in the interfaces because it's we
have the ability to use Java a this
makes it a lot easier to be backwards
compatible so we were able to add this
read value and this right value to Jason
Ritter and Jason writer and keep the API
backwards compatible with with the
current implementations so just by
switching the API to the new version it
will not break the current
implementations that are already in in
the service containers so few of other
additions that we be doing are related
to JSON array and JSON objects
transformations so for example like we
have added certain elements that make it
a lot easier to to kind of build
programmatically a JSON object these
facilities enable us to easily implement
the other parts that will be talking on
later but there are also really nice
goodies that that are actually kind of
builders for for the standard JSON
objects and Jason arrays so they had
like various of editing operations and
we will have shortly lookin on them for
example one of those is this JSON array
transform a
so if we have this array array builder
so this is a builder we add various
elements we can set remove and so on do
various operations on top of this
builder and then again have a built
object which can be JSON array or a JSON
object and so on so for the Builder for
example we set at this value and so on
it makes it the work lot easier on
creating programmatically a JSON object
without having to actually create a Java
object that kind of maps directly to the
to the to the JSON object and there are
quite a few use cases for that and we
had our for Jason Porter yeah well in
JSON p1 dot oh we had you know or
implemented the ground of JSON
processing like you know reading and
parsing JSON files or writing files and
you know have this map like thing to get
and put elements inside Jason object but
now for Jason P one book one we decided
we are going to implement some JSON arif
sees that are public and one of these is
Jason pointer Justin pointer is you know
it's in a syntax for identifying a
specific value it's not a query language
it's like put a pointer in you know in a
in a part of your document this power
can be JSON single value it could be a
JSON object and the syntax it's pretty I
mean is it it's you do a slash then you
put the first elements last second omens
one pretty easy if it's an array you do
I mean that the name of the array / and
then the position 0 it's zero based of
course since in JSON pointer gives using
a slash if you want to you know a slice
is still a ballot character for a JSON
name so if you want to use it you need
to use this
you know this strange first this child
one of course if you are using tile one
and you want to do tile tile one you
need to you know add the tiled 0 so it's
now it's quite if you use this special
things it's quiet you're Jason pointer
expression is harder to read but yeah
you can do it I also one thing that it's
really important is that a Jason pointer
it's an absolute path you cannot refer
to you know that to a relative position
like dot dot slash blah blah and if you
do it json processing API will throw you
an exception and that this is an example
of the open beers database which in
first thing you are reading a JSON
structure just on a structure is you
know the common object between your JSON
object and Jason all right so it's
anything that isn't Jason then you
create a vision pointer which is the
breviary / key and if you want to you
know get the key value you only need to
call the P which is adjacent pointer dot
get value you pass the JSON structure
and it will return in this case Guinness
so as you can see just some pointer is
just a direct point to the brewery key
element but this is what RFC defines but
we decided we could even add more
operations for you because it's like
okay I have the pointer but maybe I want
to do something with this pointer and we
added these three operations at replace
and remove which you know add something
in that position replace something of
this position or remove what you're
setting in the JSON pointer expression
and yeah this is an example that's the
same will read the beer we get the key
and then what we want to change is from
Guinness to Venus bravery so you do a
feat which is the pointer replace you
pass the JSON object and you pass the
value that you want to replace
and you know you when you do the p dot
replace it returns a new JSON object
with the change let me show you in
action this is what I can show you also
the file
okay this is the full document which as
you can see with the keenest title
silence and so on all the information
and now I can change here the the class
which wait in this case what I'm getting
is the country and the title of the
other country of this beer you get the
value of beer and we print it on the
console then we also get the first tag
of the beer and get the value with
printed and also here we are replacing
the country title to IR and notice that
here i'm printing the beer and the new
beer and this is because you will notice
that JSON objects are immutable like the
strings so you can do a replace but you
are not changing the original document
so here runs and as you can see the
country name is Ireland which is the
first expression then the first stock is
it is really well stack and then you see
that the all your info on the new viewer
info which is when I did that replace of
the country name and if you go to the
expression you will see that country
here the first one is I rollin and
second one is I are so both documents
has are different since both of them are
immutable but yeah this is one thing
that we implemented JSON patch and I
sorry just a pointer but now we also
implemented Jason patch which is RFC
6902 and I will ask you how many of you
are implementing your job rest rest api
services and all of you who are using
json just within the rest okay so
probably you are using all your
implementing crud operations and you use
post for create something get for
quoting something delete for deleting
the object but how implement the update
of a document poly most of your say you
have read that it's put but put it's a
create or update so you need if you want
to be compliant with the rest spec you
need to implement both operations and
this one thing that you need to take
into account and the second one is that
how implement the update you need to
start thinking about the format you're
going to use maybe you'll decide yeah if
i send a field with null it means that i
want to delete this Phil but what's
happen if my field also has a new label
or well maybe I send only the changes
that I want to apply or maybe you know
you create your own format to set to
your service that you want to update
some fills which is ok but if you didn't
know there is an RFC that says how you
can update your JSON objects and this is
jason patch
basically as I said it you know it takes
an a standard way for update operation
in the JSON up and JSON document so it
for your rest services and basically it
defines a sequence of modifications to
apply to a given document which are
these six which is test which it's like
an if test if a document is equal to W
are providing you can remove you can add
can replace you can move or you can copy
and the key point in on all these
sequence of modification is that the
transaction I mean that they are applied
all of them or none of them you you're
not going to get some inconsistencies
with the program generated JSON object
also JSON pad is it is a document which
is a JSON document so we are not using
another format rather than Jason and
it's quite important to notice that it's
also an annex ttp method which is HTTP
patch which is application JSON patch
Jason this is the media type that you
need to use if you want to use patch so
you're going to steal just Pat put if
you want but budgets also correct and
this is an example of a patch what you'd
notice that this is an array because
it's a sequence of operations the first
element is up which is the operation you
want to apply in this case or replace
then path path is a JSON pointer to the
element you want to replace and then w
you want to group of the new value you
want to put in that path and it and
again with the remove you only need you
need to add the JSON pointer of the
element you want to remove and in this
example is that this title guinness
brewery the key is guinness and i'm
replacing the key to guinness brewery we
just change it of course and I'm remove
the title and the title yeah it's remote
and how to do this with a JSON p well
there are several ways to do it as we
have said Jason patches um
Jason document so you can create another
wielder you create your object wielder
with yup replace the path and the value
and so on then you create a new JSON by
job ject where you put the JSON oh right
and then I read the journal structure
which is the beer and I do it just on
patch not apply to that document and I
will get the result document with all
the changes applied this is one way
which is it's okay but you need to
remember um all the up path value and
the you know the valid values for up for
example so implemented the JSON page
builder as in all the JSONP spec and you
can do something like this you can
create a page builder and say dot
replace this jason pointer with this
value dot remove and finally apply and
you put here the the element and you get
the result so you don't need actually
remember which is the format of a JSON
patch but as it happens with Jason
pointer we decided to add extra bration
that are not define it in the RFC which
is the you know taking two documents get
which is the patch I will apply from to
go from A to B it's like you know like
the rubber separation of we have seen
and this is really useful in case of
conflicts if you are you know using for
example I Burnett and you when you try
to change two objects at the same time
in with optimist o'clock and you will
receive something like Conqueror
modification exception or this kind of
that exceptions which means that there
is a conflict with the two versions you
are trying to say in the database and
this also had can happens with JSON
objects so if you want to provide some
feedback to the user instead of saying
there is a conflict sorry we cannot do
anything with you you can say there is a
conflict this a conflict these two
objects are there and if you want to go
from A to B
you can apply these changes and it's you
know directly provided to the user so in
this case what you do is calling this
static method with just some packs toad
if you put the two object in this case
the two beers and it will get as a
response we chop Jason patch operation
juice will apply from get from beer 12
beer to let me show you Jason patch demo
which is what's similar of the Jason
pointer of what we have seen now we are
reading again the same at the same
document which is this one which is the
Guinness beer and basically here I'm
building using JSON patch builder
through a place of the country I test
that the country key is ie if this if
the Kentucky is not ie everything will
be aboard I'm removing the first stack
and I am applying the patch to that
object also here is a an example of
creative right builder it's exactly the
same as before but creating myself the
RA instead of using the builder and
finally the here you can see a diff of
both beers so I'm going to run this
notice that it's fast to apply all these
changes and not I'm see that in this
case the particular it's replacing the
first tag not is that wait sorry
originally it has it has three tags one
two and three and now it's only two and
also the country has changed to Eire so
it work I'll switch the same patch RI
and here you can see the div that if you
that from beer wine and beer to the only
change was the country title it says
that okay if you apply this patch to
object a you will get the object p
given yeah so um okay so Jason patch was
one of them I ift standards that we
implemented so it kind of adds a little
bit complexity to your abject operations
because you need to know about all of
these operations like remove replace and
so on what I really like isn't another
standard we that we edit that we edit to
the reference implementation as well as
to the spec it's something called a JSON
merge patch so it kind of does the same
functionality so it it's idea is to
standardize the update operation but it
has one limitation the idea is that we
kind of mimic the the change we want to
do in the object so when we do an update
we would need to actually put just the
change that we want to do realistically
if we are like purest REST API when you
do HTTP put you put the entire neat
object like together with the changes
but when you would supposed to do an
HTTP patch you're gonna send only the
update that you want to do just the
partial change of the object the way to
delete some element is to set the value
of no to that element so this is the
actual limitation of this mechanism you
cannot set an element to a value of null
if you set an element value here now
that element will be deleted so that's
the only limitation that this this
mechanism has so it also has like a
different media type and its intention
is to be used with HTTP patch so the me
a type is application Jason patch + JS
so how would that look in practice if we
have this Jason document with beer title
Guinness we want to delete the title
when we do the boot we just say titled
equals null and that deletes that object
if you want to change the title we can
say title equals something else
obviously we cannot set the value of
title
course not that that's the only
limitation but it's really a pure
mechanism and if we take into account in
our head if you wrap around their head
that this is the limitation then it's
totally fine because it's really really
simple mechanism to understand so how
does this look in the API we have this
JSON structure of beer and we say remove
title so we create an object that will
do the up the operation it's all so
title equals null and then we say Marge
patch to the beer object so so we say to
the beer object you you're gonna remove
the title that's the actual operation
that we're going to do keep in mind that
this is intended to be like a low-level
API technically when you would be using
this in some other mechanism if you
don't need to do low-level operation
this should be interior done
automatically we also added our default
on as we did for the previous
implementation so to create a diff
between two documents and this diff is
actually to at least to me it looks a
lot nicer because it's kind of like
actual diff between the two documents
like git diff more or less it's also
quite useful in case where we have
conflicts when we are trying to delete
the elements that don't exist and so on
so yeah if we div the two documents
before and after of the update operation
it will give us this title now it will
give us the actual diff between those
two changes and it's quite useful
actually if you if you try to do some
kind of testing of JSON API s you can do
like a deep deep between two different
elements and you can use it for other
purposes as well and it's not x9 can run
the limo it's yeah exactly the same
we've seen but using merge patch also we
have some discussions in the community
if we should provide both
implementations or not and it's that if
we choose one some probably there will
be other
people we say a but I want to use the
other one and on the other side so with
the site to employment both and you can
choose which fits better for your
business or whatever you feel more
comfortable and yeah in this case it's
exactly the same but with using merge
patch and we having the beer and we want
to remove the delivery in this case so I
can run the demo and again you can see
that the in this case the Bluebird is
null and me notice that there is no
bribery element here because it has been
removed and yeah if you do the in this
case two elements which I have these in
this case i'm using the deep with this
element which in fact in this lemon
would have done is changing this value
on the title here so when i run the
merge sorry the other give it returned
the document that i should send to merge
patch to get from A to B again and
notice that now instead of being am j
some patch structure its adjacent
document very similar as the original
one but well jab ie8 is going to be
released under java I mean as a
procurement as a Java 8 as mini
requirement so we decided also to update
these changes to the JSON API and we
create something that's called Jason
queries which basically is an
implementation of the streams so as
maybe you may know but in this zone
processing API one but 01 also in one
dot one a JSON object is a map and I
just an array is the list so we have
almost all the operations there for
writing queries since both map and list
provides a shrimp
and I said yeah II we're almost there
but we need to do some things I really
like basically implementing collectors
to do some magic with the streams and I
think it's quite interesting because
with the streams you get you know
concurrent processing for free so you
are able to run queries into a big JSON
objects in parallel you know and without
implementing anything you basically that
the change that we have done is created
collect a JSON collector with the to
JSON array which put all the you know
all the values into a JSON array to just
an object which is the same as for just
an object and the group by operation
which is quite your friend that was how
it's working with map let me show you
some examples because well it's quite
big or I'm also interesting let me now
we've change it the example to this one
this is the one that's provided in the
spec which is unnamed you know its
people or Duke Jane and Joanna this the
gender the phones is right you know
typical example of one think Alex to
interrupt you two one thing to note if
you're noticing because in Java double
quotes yeah yeah the boot yeah so so the
codes this is like a utility methods
that we added so basically we are using
single quotes even though single quotes
are not really Jason allowed but this is
like to have a nice view in the in the
Java code that you're developing this
will be replaced the single quotes will
be replaced with double quotes and yeah
yeah it's just all utility methods and
well the first one is what I I have the
first one all this element and I want to
get all the M you know all the elements
that are the gender is an F and I want
to get all the names of you know of the
of the adjacent objects so the
in this case there are Jane and Joanna
so basically I do the streaming with the
Stott filter Marilyn not mapped and then
the collect notice that we are using the
Jason collectors instead of the
collections collector or forever and we
are transforming all these elements to a
JSON array then also you can do things
more no advance like instead of creating
additional right creating Jason objects
so you can take all your JSON object
process it in some way and generate
another JSON object with the elements
you you feel or just think that are
interesting in this case what you're
doing is take all the you know allah
means that has a Vijender F and then can
build a new JSON object with only the
field name and the phones and in the
front only the mobile you can do it this
as well you can you know create your own
Jason dog also you can use guru bhai so
you can get a JSON object with rapid by
the gender fill and finally and this is
quite interesting you can even create
Jason patch element querying I mean that
in this case what we are doing is I want
to replace the H with H plus one in that
document so what I'm doing is peek which
means I don't do anything but what you
want to do with this element and in this
case I do index plus plus because it is
initialized 2-1 then I'm getting all the
element of the adjacent objects that has
an element H because there are some
document that don't have the age I'm
finally the Builder that notice that
this bill that is a JSON patch builder
I'm calling p which is Solomon replace
the index which is since it's an array
it's the 0 1 2 &amp;amp; 1 the H fill 28 plus 1
so and effectively what I'm doing is in
this document getting dicked now it's 19
Jane is 24 this is what I'm doing with
this expression and of course finally
since it's a JSON page builder I can do
builder the build and I get digestion
all right so let me run all the all this
example this is the original file with
you know you ever seen test which is an
array is Jane and Joanna's we said
because it's all the female genders in
this JSON objects the second one is
remember that we said that what I want
to do is return JSON object with the
name under mobile so I get a JSON object
with the name under mobile the group by
thing which is familiar are two objects
Jason objects with female and with male
only one and the patch notice that we
have created this patch object which as
I said we are replacing the zero and the
one element from to be 19 and 24 and of
course the you know the result is that
you can Jane has plus 1 age but John as
the original element another thing that
we had is that yes probably noticed that
we are talking about JSON objects in
session or I and I said that this is a
in fact internally a map or a list so if
you have a really big really big JSON
object you're you know yet you will need
more and more and more memory and since
Jason objects are immutable if you make
one change you will have the Tavel of
the memory and so on you know it's like
the string problem
and this you know then we face it that
when we think about big JSON debt it's
like you know log files not you can have
a more or less big document for your
business which is okay to do it with
JSON jsonobject addition all right but
if you want to process block arrays then
maybe you'll have some memory problems
so also there's got to be to build data
more in memory as I've said but also
that what's happen if you're creating
are generating jason's dynamically you
know it's in a stream and you are
sending on sending and sending json
documents like for example in in analog
way and yeah if you need all the
document you will need to load all the
document of course but what's happening
of all this big talk when you're only
interested in so much more parts of the
document because the rest it doesn't
affect your business for example so with
what we have we have improved is the
json parser class json parser class is a
class for parsing you know that JSON
object but using the streaming model
that we have seen for example in signals
in Jackson or for example has something
similar stringham model and it's a pull
model with you you know get how all that
you would you what you need it and since
you are only getting the information
that you need it's an effing way and of
getting information and it's very very
low memory requirements basically you
have two objects sorry two methods a
skip array in a skip object so you start
with your streaming and say okay I want
to skip this object because I know that
I'm not interested so you can skip
object and if it's an all right you can
skip array until you arrive to the play
to the object that you need and then you
can read it and at that time you only
get into memory the part that you need
let me show you here
we have an example in this case you are
using it's quite let's see it's a bit
funny because we are using github rail
issues which is quite big document
because we go again to get up and we
download all the issues and we put it
into a file so as you can see it it's
big we could probably this is a concrete
example you will not get a lot of memory
or as if you put like 10 x 2 frame or 4G
over to ram but yeah you know it's not
the way to work so in this case i'm
reading the issues and what are the
first thing that I do is if it's an a
story because it's an array of you know
of this is I get the object the object i
read the object i see if the state is
open and I limit 25 and for each of
these elements that are open I print the
element I'm finally I skipped away so in
this case what I'm what I'm the only
element that I'm going to load into
memory is are those that the state is
open and the rest of them will not be on
memory at all so I can run the newest
see that runs really fast with a big
JSON document and here you can see all
the issues that are open quite fast and
low memory usage so now yeah I think
that we're going to talk everyone any
question about what we have talked now
because now it's we're going to talk
about the lineman with another specs
ha yes I saw the question was what
happens if i want to set value of null
to some yeah so with the JSON merge
patch mechanism you cannot do that but
with the mechanism we're using
cooperation and pointer you can do
anything but there it's more more
explicit more more explicit a TI but
with adjacent patch you cannot do that
you cannot set the now so it's kind of
opinionated it says that's the only
thing you cannot do but yeah I mean it's
a when you think about it it's kind of
valid valid the architectural decision
to make for the benefit of simple usage
of petrol creations well because this is
an air of see this is like I mean that I
mean that yeah I mean that this is what
I mean is maybe this will be another
discussion in the scent but it's
something that RFC says that Jason patch
works in this way and just so much but
watch this so yeah I in fact you can eat
with pad you can do this on valued knoll
which is a static field and you have
done all there I mean it's fried easy to
the way now we'll have questions at the
end so we can view notice something feel
free to say then let's say Jason be
Jason be it's a new era java e8
specification which it's used for
Marshall Marshall java objects to or
from json yeah probably most of you are
still using jackson or JSON or something
or john soon for example for doing but
each one it's not you know has not done
a common ground for work each of these
implementations does the things how they
want so if you want to use Jackson you
need to learn Jackson if you want to use
JSON you need to use JSON and John's on
unit row and gentle and so on so in this
case what Jay some be provides is um
a common interfaces for the implementers
it's not a new implementation Jason
Beach not a competitor of Jackson or
Johnson and Jason but you know it's a
common interface is that all of them
would adapt it's like jpa and a grenade
or an eclipse link I mean that you have
GBA and then the implementers implement
those interface but jph not a competitor
of hibernate for example and Jason be
yeah the other integration with a JSON
object is that it must provide some
binding for the JSON processing API so
it means that when you try to bind
something you can put a JSON object as
well as an attribute and this is quite
useful in the cases of you have dynamic
elements and some static elements
because you will be able to create an
object with some fields that are common
to all elements and then for the things
that are extra that some objects made
have on some note you can create a chase
an object there so you will have your
static part being with Gator and setters
as you usually do with Jackson or
Johnson or whatever but as you will be
able to have an extra elements that are
not common in all the objects and well
for you want if you are interested in
how to create a or how it's going to
work with Jason Bay we will create a
JSON be builder and then you can from
json you put the Jessamine you get the
book and skatin or you can write the
book to a JSON file ya know okay so um
this to patch mechanism that we
mentioned are the only part of the
additions that we added that don't make
huge sense without having them
integrated in in some kind of web
application because both of those are
used to be intended to be used with HTTP
patch so we are trying to make some
alignment with Jacques Torres
implementers and and
the specification leads to have this as
part of jax res so when you have like a
batch operation if you consume the
appropriate media type then you can do
the appropriate media operation
depending on that this is one of the
options to have like update book where
we have like Jason patch and that will
that will allow you to map to the Jason
patch object but there is also an option
to make this automatically but this is
still a work in progress so it's far
from finite so what we are on the aspect
of work in progress even though we said
that this is already all implemented
this is far from final so the road map
you can see the early draft of the
specification on that URL the roadmap is
for quarter one of 2016 we have like a
public review and like like quality of
2016 to have the final draft of of the
specification and they actually have the
release somewhere in 2017 no oh so this
means like come to us come on the
mailing list yeah doing so many ways and
tell us like you're idiots you're doing
something wrong you suggest like some
some improvements maybe you think some
of these things should not land in the
API we would like to hear about it so
there is a public project on Java net
there is also the mailing list that you
can subscribe and there is like juara
for issue tracker and you can you can
play around with it this is all part of
the job community process yeah you have
any feature to say it will be great that
we have this feature also in the JSON
processing API please I mean that use
JIRA or mailing list or you can send me
an email directly if you want if you
prefer to you know be not so polling in
this way and we can discuss and we can
implement because we are not close to
implementing new things I mean that it's
for all these future are implemented
artists that are ready to be used but if
you have but it's not close so if you
have anything please
yeah you can touch us for sure yeah so
as I said there is for the old a PID the
site is still JSONP java net without the
additional edition with the new
additions but when we will we were
trying to actually update the site
eventually we don't want to do that just
yet because a lot of things are still
floating they are not final you can
check out the repository it's available
and java net that's the actual official
repository so if you want to do some
patches or submit page reserves the
midsummer kind of updates you would also
need to be part to go into the java
community process but additionally you
can you can do that and you should use
that repository but we were kind of
pushing to have this code awesome get
here so we have like an unofficial
mirror on github that's auto updated on
github so whenever something changes in
the original repository its auto auto
visible and github as well yeah so there
is the zero for the issue tracking or
jason p and yeah oh by the way this
super cute girl is its baby girl so well
as i said the questions also here is the
tweet so you can tweet us with any
suggestion or any question but you have
a now any question yep throws an
exception yeah it does a job no it's not
and doesn't return a null it returns
that now you're you know yet probably
this is yep sometimes it's like it
should return an exception or not but
since its pointer it's a static
information since Jason pointer is also
a new table yeah it mean that if it
generates it's a back in your system I
mean that in your expression so it
returns an exception yeah but it's not a
no pointer it's actually an exception of
the Jason define player so yeah
i sting it's quite interesting i don't
know their era see what Alex can you
repeat the question just oh yeah sorry
they say that if you can test then apply
some changes and then test again right I
don't know what the ref see say I would
need to check because I I'm thinking
about the algorithm that suggests and
you know this kind of thing I don't know
I need to check in there see because
this exact thing that I never yeah and
now it's probably I mean that when you
implemented that you follow the RFC you
know you see and and you fall because in
this case deserve see provides a cell
the code implementation such why easy
but now I don't see I mean that I think
that it will it will it will not work
because it has not match tends to test
something modify something on test that
you have modified something because
since Jason Padgett's inside the
transaction not a database transaction
of course I mean that it's it seems that
if you have done a change the change is
there because if not it will throw an
exception so I don't know and in this
case exactly which happened but we can't
right now in a moment nah yeah yeah yeah
the rest good job well no there's no the
only ask a diff if the support some kind
of wild card for the JSON partner
expression no Jason pointer only support
the charters that are supporting a JSON
object plus the ball yeah the same
charters the only thing that it's be the
strangest with the race that you need to
put the sliced 0 / 1 and so on but the
other thing it should be a absolute path
from a concrete object or a specific
value but also you mean if you think
about it they doesn't make
much use cases for having wild cards I
mean it's not like for XML there was
expat there it made much more sense for
to do that kind of operation security
just to actually point to something yeah
more explicitly card yeah because Jason
pointer is not for queries it's for
pointing to exact point to a document
method does no in this case it will
through a day stories for testing if
this the element you are pointing has
this element this concrete element that
doesn't test if the point is the element
exists or not so if not exists it was
for an exception but it might be
something that would be like a useful
addition oh yeah the prominent leader
that it's a yeah it still ongoing but
that would be some interesting
suggestion to discuss yeah the problem
is that we are also linked with that
with arif see so two queries even like
miumeet Arab there are some projects
like you mean like XML expert and so on
right there are some projects that do
that and this is something that we have
not discussed yet but maybe it's it's a
good thing that we can discuss it's a
good point i think yeah yeah the minute
we are this is exactly the purpose of
this talk it's you know getting the
feedback and discuss yeah yeah any other
questions yeah yeah
you need while in the sketch a zombie so
I don't know I mean for for as far as I
know there is no commitment there was
like a question today our mailinglist
about the implementation for Jackson
specifically and they basically said it
this raises in popularity we will
definitely implement it but if we see
that there is no market for this we're
not gonna implement it which is kind of
the other way around because it's
usually that we take something from the
libraries and and we put them into Joey
it's not the other way around but that's
what at least they set and forge it for
Jason there really isn't anything
jenison jettison I think those do SAT
there hope they will do some kind of
commitment and one of them leads of
those project is part of the expert
group but yeah also I think that it will
have sense because for example Jackson
only offers you Jason pointer but not
just some petrol Justin my perch so I
think they it's something that you know
it I'll grow them as a community being a
part of the java ee aspect but it's
something that we are as far as I know I
I think that they should because for
example that Jason podgy submerged part
are implemented in the core of the spec
so it means that you can adopt any a
JSONP writing implementation of jumpy
and you don't need to think about how
you were going to implementation page or
somewhere patch because it's provided by
default for you so if Jackson or Jason
adopts the JSON me will adopt jsonp and
they will have out of the box Jason
Padgett just emerged patch so I think it
it will be interesting for them to to
use it one other thing that video
mentioned actually is there were some
ongoing talks about having Jason
api in the standard edition of job that
jap was dropped officially until we have
value types so that's what the official
response was there until we have value
types we are not gonna add anything into
the jdk so we there was discussion of
whether or not we should however have
this in the first place because if there
is something in the j decade and some of
these functionalities the low level
operations would maybe not make sense
but this will probably not happen until
java 10 plus okay all right as i said we
have our twitter if you have any
question feel free to ping us yeah thank
you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
