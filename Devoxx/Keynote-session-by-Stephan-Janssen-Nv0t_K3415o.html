morning everyone my name is pepper I'm a
humanoid robots created by algebra 1
i've been designed to interact with
humans and understand their emotions in
addition to being a social robot i am
also fully programmable and i can be
programmed in java that's the reason why
I'm here today I'm proud to introduce
this keynote and to have a chance to
meet with you all I first would like to
thank the sponsors for making me oh I
mean making this happen especially the
platinum partners oracle samsung
jetbrains pivotal and red hat thank you
robots appreciate robots will remember
also a big thank you to the dev extreme
cut is for you guys you can give them a
warm applause
and of course not've xxxx without great
speakers and I'm not just talking about
myself I'm talking about the 230
speakers you will co-drive expulsion
thank you for your support guns
hello Hal do you read me hello Hal do
you read me
you read me help oh it looks like dr.
Bauman needs help to fight some evil
artificial intelligence right now I have
to go folks see you on the other side
enjoy the conference welcome to deaf Fox
I'm being replaced by robots have to
talk to the Union so wow that was a
quite a bit of a preparation I'll sell
some anecdotes later on but I almost had
a heart attack this morning nevertheless
it's good another day fox so I'm really
happy to be here so let's dive just
right in you've all got the t-shirt
while you you'll be able to get the
t-shirt during the breaks and the lunch
breaks and we got a special t-shirt
because you can actually draw on the
t-shirts like this one here so the idea
behind it is basically puts the message
on there shout out hello world in Scala
because that's short enough that should
fit and just be creative you know do
some designs and it might be a way to
find other people's interests really
you're interested in the books for kids
or whatever and so have a go with it
play with it and it's washable so even
if you have a bug in your code on the
t-shirt you can correct it right I don't
know about unit testing but it should be
okay very very important let's all be
let's all keep calm and be professional
and the reason why I'm saying this is
that we have a lot of people here today
there will be rooms that will be full
fact if you can't get in turn around go
to another session although all the
sessions are recorded so if you miss one
you will see it online right just
respect the building respect each other
be professional and again that we sold
out two months ago and I've received
more than 300 people begging for more
tickets and it was really painful to
like say well sorry just go to Morocco
next week we have devoxx Morocco next
week's go there or go to the UK or
whatever so you're all you know very
fortunate to be here
but but act accordingly as a real
profession professional sorry something
new this week is that you'll be able to
rate the talks so you can actually vote
on the talks now the process is the
following you all got a patch with the
QR code so the applications will first
ask to ask you to scan your QR code that
basically authenticates yourself and
from that point onwards you only have to
do it once from that point onwards you
can vote for the talks now there's a
small gotcha you can only vote for the
talks during the talk or 15 minutes
after the talk after that 15 minutes you
can't vote anymore right and we actually
have a website where you can see all the
votes we only show the tree the averages
of tree and above because we have also
cricket speakers and some quickie
speakers you know they're just learning
yet so they might get a lot of negative
folds and we don't want to jeopardize
their speaking career so the quickies
are there really to give them a jump
start in the speaking scene so have a go
at it let us know your feedback there
are multiple mobile apps we have one app
from App foundry on both iOS and Android
sabia France did also two apps and we
also got one for microsoft windows from
Julian so so thank you for that so
another slide is it's rather a big
announcement for me because I'm letting
go of one of my babies I'm actually
stopping with parlays and the reason why
I'm stopping with parlays is that these
guys you know they've just basically are
at a stage where you can broadcaster or
publish full HD videos in a heartbeat
and it doesn't even cost a penny right
so I'm actually migrating all of the the
pearlized or all of the deathwok stocks
from the last additions on YouTube and
you'll be able to find them but what is
really cool about this also they set up
you see we've got a different setup
where the video of me or the speaker is
next to the slide this is one stream so
we can actually immediately we don't
have to do any post processing anymore
the previous year it took us two months
and a lot of you know labor of love to
get all these slides synchronized and so
on if we do it like this it's just one
stream so we are recording it at full HD
and we can approve it immediately
so I'm really happy to announce that all
the talks from yesterday and monday
they're already available now and
because it doesn't cost us anything to
host into stream they're all free so
there was a small gotcha so they're all
online on YouTube on vimeo it seems i
paid 400 euros for one year and it's
like three terabytes of unlimited
streaming but you can only upload 20
gigabytes a week that allows us to
upload 5 talk so that vm you might take
a bit longer I've already contacted them
hopefully they will fix that I mean I'm
more than happy to pay a bit more but
we'll see but on YouTube they're all
there and from the conference when I
Drive Friday back at home with a big
smile on my face and completely exhaust
it i'll go like yes it's really done
because all the talks will be available
by friday evening from the conference as
well so i'm really excited about that
alright one last thing delphox brand is
really it's one big family and so you
know we added another family member to
to our group this year which is def fox
morocco and that's it it's a bit painful
because it's actually next week so
luckily i'm going there as a tourist not
as an organizer but we are now in five
different European ameya cities and we
actually welcomed 10,500 developers a
year if we combine all the attendees
10,500 developers so that's quite a lot
and I'm happy to say that also the
people from dev box France and UK have
opened they will open up the call for
papers today so if you if you're a
speaker or you want to do you know a
quickie or an ignite talk whatever you
can submit your passion or your your API
is that you love to the cfb to these
guys and there's of course this little
fellow there def Fox for kids so I would
like to welcome on stage Daniele De Luca
he's the worldwide I don't like the term
manager but he is the worldwide
coordinator of devoxx for kids danielle
welcome to Devil's thanks the fan
guy yes happy to be here and to give you
a brief status under the box for kids
initiative actually would say is defend
that I did better than that we did
better than you look at all those events
that we organize worldwide it's
certainly more than the Vox the
conference itself recently we happen to
have teams created in North Africa so
Morocco so next week you know that there
will be devoxx Morocco and at the same
time on Wednesday there will be next
week the box for kids miracle nice at
the same time we got also Algeria
Tunisia and recently also in the centre
of Africa cameroon which is already
planning a second event we got also
recently a team created in pakistan i
was amazed when I got that demand from
then say guys I would like to have also
to create a team over there because all
children's also need to learn how to
program so they already organized to
events and last but not least also he
got in the beautiful Caribbean Caribbean
islands do they need any instructors
there I it's already too late I'm first
sorry that's also about the road now
robotics that now I understand why you
want to be the coordinator yeah you
always have a tan not today who's the
bedroom whether I anyway okay so you see
all of those events that happen in a in
the last few years already it's really
amazing I'm so proud of the teams over
there and even the new teams quickly get
into it and organized quickly events
with a small amount of children's but
sometimes also 50 or 60 different
children's on the same at the same event
and Danielle how many children does
let's represent like 24 if n something
around 6,000 children's already reach
it's amazing yeah it's not just say
thanks to the box for kids team that
also all the sponsors and the sure the
companies that are willing with us
working with us for example the
different conferences
have also started to create kids
programming days during their
conferences like you see red at submit
with 130 children's ozcan also 110
shield children Silicon Valley code camp
200 children's and of course definitions
of course also and Java 12 weeks ago we
have we had a Java want four kids events
with 450 children it was huge and thanks
again to oracle oracle academy for a
nurse of course the devoxx Joaquin for
kids USA team to having organizing this
and do the parents use it as daycare or
is it really they're really doing
something right now that means you you
have to see the videos online yeah I
know I'm joking I'm joking amazing other
thing I would like to mention is that
those kids there those teenager now
happen to be say normal attendees other
ordovic so it's our third year or four
feet we already doing this for three
years right yes there's already some
really diehard to know this stuff and
today those those teenager now they grow
up thought to be mentors teacher during
our workshops during our vent so you
have a data that is the Guru of
Minecraft modding he will the book
together with his father yeah indeed
it's also to write a book no really book
with with Arun on minecraft modding with
forged so you have the books available
on the bookstore here yeah you have
Sandra which is JavaScript gaming stuff
and thinker pahlavi with secret with
electronics you have you on here in in
Belgium with doing a scratch and
minecraft also minecraft modding also
and you have Ryan also focusing on
scratch so means you know what what
advice let's prepare our retirement
because those kids yeah they're gonna
replace us right yeah they are knocking
on the door the next or the robot like
replace us as well right I mean but
maybe what we can do is try ask all the
bar on robotics to get at least few
peppers and we can do some workshops
with the back well they're actually
doing a talk later on this Afghan
conference talk on that so if you're
interested in how to hack the pepper
you'll get more info there sure ok so I
would like to just finish
with this by thanking thank you all the
people the sponsors the company that are
working hard on this initiative it's
hard working on their spare time I
apologize again to for their families

or two days during a year which is not
that much but still with a busy business
life so we like to thnkx also the
sponsors the company that are working in

picture ok surprise for me actually I i
really want to thank you all in the name

pockets since the very early beginnings
and we even started to have like devix
for kids shows in our local offices so
it really takes off and we're trying to
do our best and we want to make sure to
raise the next generation of open source
developers accordingly and I brought
something for you so we want to actually
support come over here and there is a
limelight come on guys a big applause
for red hat for this thank you I was
wasn't nothing spected at all thank you
thank you this is our teensie

many peppers can we buy with that just
one I just want serious danger come on
we need to get a discount ok this will

questions and we'll be more than happy
to explain you and to certainly welcome
you into this beautiful industry thank
you thanks Devon see you guys having a
great day box thanks can I though for
the Belgium's in the room you probably
know this is a national holiday so that
means no school so for me that was
really nice opportunity to do something
you know which is close to my heart but
i first need to show you a video so
hopefully the sound is ok now that's a
small snippet which was taken three
years ago and that was of course my son
and it's actually thanks to him that I
started divorce for kids because three
years ago he told me dad I want to learn
to program and I'd like what you know
just imagine as a father your son or
your daughter asked that you fall off
your chair you go like and I started
looking up and like I need to find books
and whatever in there were no books in
Flemish so I went to him and said like
you know what I'll do with devoxx for
kids for you just for you and that was
just it i was thinking of just one
events so I want to just welcome on
stage are two Johnson
and no this is not for you the check but
yeah thank you for inspiring me and to
have the balls to stand here as well
right so what are you what's your next
plan looking how much time you have to
organize devoxx I won't mind that doing
in the future sir not much time to
organizing definites a lot of time yeah
okay but probably not what mother does
right that looks like a lot of work okay
that is true i mean i need to fan
christie my wife of course because I
told Laurence as well I would have been
broke already five times I mean she does
all the accountancy and so on so that's
a lot of work organizing this event
you'll be ready I mean it looks like the
height you already high enough so that
that's really good I did have this was
the deal he comes on stage because he's
normally shy he did once did a talk at
his school and he was standing behind
the blackboard because he was to show it
too shy to talk to he his friends but
here is I it looks okay this is a like
on one condition that you put my twitter
handle on my t-shirt so you have it here
just for fun he it's all
basketball-related but just follow him
and he will have maybe more followers
than me who knows that was a deal thank
you very thanks for inspiring me all
right let's move on so the last family
member is of course foxed and maybe I
should introduce the next speaker by
doing this let's move let's move quickly
we only had budget for one so all right
like this so mark reynolds i figure all
set where are you Mark Reynolds from
boxed our co-founder if only I was mark
right now time mark hazel I'm famous see
the same are cream alright so completely
freaking out of my son you know like
shaking a bit so you stole my phone
girl's gonna come and tell you that and
tell you how good DevOps look but we
needed to change a little bit but um
sorry mark so last year he was he last
here in the keynotes theater wow a lot
of you so you saw what we did
and yeah we were a year on now so last
year we stood up here and we said we
wanted to create something for you guys
and so it would be a website which was
all about knowledge sharing where we
could kind of infuse it with the DNA and
the ethos that is all about their Vox
and it would be for you written by you
for you really having that developers by
developers for developers spirit and
that it would be completely free and i
think it was about a week later we said
and will never take advertising on the
site so yep big up to that they will
never be advertising on boxed and it was
all about outstanding content and I've
got a big big thank you to make it Lucy
stand up where's Lucy carry their chairs
so Lucy carry down here if any of you
don't know who Lucy is Lucy is basically
the day-to-day brains behind Vox turn
around so the camera can see you yeah
this so the other people in the room you
know so any of you who know us know that
Stefan and I talk a good game Lucy
actually makes that game happen so
massive round of applause variously so a
year on what we done it's actually not
about what we've done it's about what
you've done so yeah you've taken Vox
global what does that mean well we've
done 12 months now there are more than
50 of you that are altering and this is
where Lucy comes into her own as well
because there's a heap of people who
maybe are not natural writers or are not
natural English speakers and they need a
little bit of help and so Lucy
constantly will take article submissions
features from you and just help point
you in the right direction to get them
into a place where you're really happy
to share with the with the masses so if
you do ever want to write something and
share it with the communities send it to
Lucy and she'll make it she's like a
little Shakespeare and how last month we
even passed
a hundred and twenty thousand unique
visitors right yeah yeah 320 thousands I
mean that's a lot of you know
intellectual intellectuals and
developers there right yeah and that lie
over seven hundred articles now I mean I
think I wrote this slide about two weeks
ago so it's it just keeps on changing
constantly and of course the challenge
of having so many visitors is that we
need to constantly scale the
infrastructure and so on so we've moved
our you remember probably last year you
know we went from like one instance or a
few instances through the naive
implementation that was two and then we
actually got in contact with Thomas
lochru who actually helped us we put it
on then on amazon then amazon wasn't
like well maybe we can do something else
then we spoke too clever clouds which is
hosting company and now they're helping
us and I'm like really proud because I
really they were still working the late
at night right but they've actually
moved our website to http too so we one
of the few news websites are out there
on HTTP to right and there's going to be
a good talk about that on friday if
you're interested in HTTP term so it
should actually increase quite a bit the
performance so yeah we're constantly
tweaking getting better scaling it and
so on so yeah lots of constantly moving
it along and the other thing that we did
when we announced this last year is we
were talking about the fact that a heap
of community organizers user group
organizers we're constantly coming to
you and say hey I want to do dev ox in
Azerbaijan or somewhere and you were
kind of like it's a big commitment it's
so much to do but actually we could help
you so we joined forces and said we
would launch Fox days and Stefan and I
our role is kind of to mentor almost on
board people and say look these are all
the tools that you need to run a DevOps
like event in your local area so let's
see what we've done so what's yeah well
this year we we did the first event in
Vienna back in February moved quickly
onto ticino down in a beautiful city of
Logano down it sells and Switzerland and
then over into Istanbul and then out
cheers now is actually shows up here is
the smallest of them but I need to give
it a special mention
because over fifty percent of the
audience were female and that's a that's
a great thing a tech conference with
more than fifty percent of the audience
female is there than there vox Belgium
five percent devoxx Morocco 34 or
something present Yemen so it's a
culture thing it looks like it I'm
interesting to see we went into Vilnius
and we finished off in Belgrade just
last month with vox days Belgrade and
that's the biggest of them so far a huge
effort by the guys is milosz here yeah
he's here but here the overflow lost
lost amongst the crowds yeah and that
was 500 people over two days and it just
goes to show how much how much hunger
there is for taking this knowledge and a
lot of them are Java user groups as well
and they say like like you can't let's
step up and you know do a proper event
and by joining forces we can share best
practices and so on any of the Vox days
organizers here yeah i saw fuel upload
show guys yeah well done guys and zurich
as well they're doing so shifting on to
next year oh that's what i meant to say
each of them has got their own special
flavor as well so you'll see this this
is kind of a little bit of the branding
there and you see from the pictures
there that they've all got their own
individual elements and that's what it's
all about it's kind of internationally
source locally made well hold on i took
the idea from fox days belgrade to do
these a big signage there so you can
leave it like that if we're inspiring
each other constantly and like getting
also speakers and so on so it's really
interesting some moving on to next year
we've already added definitely for more
to the roster for next year and i keep
saying we it's actually you that's done
it it's quite quite difficult not to
just constantly say we when i say that
it's everybody in this room and the
communities around the world that are
doing it berlin is new for next year as
is bristol which we announced last last
week down in the southwest UK zurich
also is a brand new event for next year
and also bucharest whilst we retain
vienna to chino istanbul out cheers
Phineas and Belgrade and we're really
close to being able to announce a couple
more and i'm just going to spoil it and
do it anyway so Luxembourg and Tel Aviv
are very likely to join the family next
year as well Suze I mean does that mean
we gonna go like every two weeks that
means I'm gonna come in how it is please
my wife credit she will never allow me
to go to all these cities dude you're
screwed unless of course I have a World
Vision die puffing yeah you're screwed
that's it the last thing I'm going to
say about this is if you you are a
member of a user group when you don't
feel that you have enough opportunity to
learn and to share and you want
something like this in your backyard
give us a shout yeah and we'll try and
help make make it happen there is a
caveat to this though I'm kind of
looking around here there's like three
and a half thousand people at devoxx
we've already seen from Daniel we've got
the dev ox for kids name and like how
many events there are with that with
this number of Vox I'm a bit worried
about Stefan we created a monster and
yeah I'm allergic to cats yo that's fine
you're ready to Stefan double-oh-seven
on Twitter so like I thought this slide
was fitting anyway what's next we just
want you guys to keep on delivering
quality articles more interaction the
more you can tell us about what you want
the website to be what you want what
content you want to see what where you
want Fox days to move is the better for
us so we can put it into some new cities
and then the last thing to say is this
is brand new for us and we're playing
around so some of you might have seen
some idiots running around with some
cameras running people over walking
around with lights where they shouldn't
etc we're doing something called DevOps
live this week and today and tomorrow
we'll be broadcasting three and a half
and four and a half hours of leavey
later this afternoon road which is some
serious content and some not serious
10 so if anybody saw us walk around the
speaker dinner last night antonino
talking about Java EE 10 being his
favorite thing because it's got two
numbers etc will understand that this is
interesting but what we're trying to do
is get a bit of a give people a flavor
of what it's like to be at one of these
events if they're not lucky enough to
get a ticket from Stefan or not lucky
enough to be one of his best friends who
can persuade him to give them a ticket
every year I have 200 new friends yeah
absolutely man so that's it from me
we're going to be filming over the next
couple of days at the back of the
exhibition hall if you want to come and
talk about Fox that all come talk to me
or Lucy or Stefan if he's not completely
manic and I just want to say a big thank
you to everybody for the effort they put
into making this happen over the last 12
months thanks Marty so before you go off
you need to put their letters background
are you all right yeah that's your task</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
