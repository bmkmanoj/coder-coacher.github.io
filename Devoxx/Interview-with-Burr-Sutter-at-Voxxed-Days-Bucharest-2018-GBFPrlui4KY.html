I'm really pleased to be joined by
Bertha but welcome thanks for taking a
bit of time to come and talk to us I
know you just come out of a session
today talking about sto yes dear it
seems like the shiny new everything that
everyone wants to talk about so for
those people at home that maybe you're
not as familiar about it can you give us
a quick overview yeah yeah it is super
exciting even within RedHat itself so
it's kind of funny to watch redhead
engineering wrap their heads around it
and get super excited also but if you
are a shop that's interested in micro
services and it seems like most shops
are interested micro services if you're
dealing with that distributed computing
paradigm where you basically have a
service in one process calling a service
in another process calling a service in
another process you have these network
hops in between well the network could
fail you might have latency issue you
might have just literally the I can't
connect from A to B and so what you had
in the microcircuit flix OSS came out
with cloud native libraries if you will
that basically can be plugged into a
java back in and then you have these
things like history and Eureka so you
find that next service with Eureka you
can basically have a load balancer with
ribbon and you can have a circuit
breaker with histor --ax so that's where
we really got to in the microworld
super excited about history super
excited about eureka and ribbon and all
the Netflix stuff what only worked with
Java and it only worked really within
that JVM context and this Sto well being
it's a service mesh it works with
anything that runs in a container okay
so it basically it uses an envoy sidecar
so envoy comes from the lyft team so
lyft being the other uber out there in
the world right and they have donated
this to open-source and it's written in
C++ layer seven reverse proxy and
basically intercepts all network traffic
in and out of your pod if you deploy
this with kubernetes you have the pod
and it intercepts all traffic in and out
and basically allows you to manipulate
that network traffic and do you can even
do like cows engineering you can throw
errors into the mix you can do changing
a complete changing all the route rules
moving traffic from A to B to C to D you
can also do things like dart launches
meaning you can mirror traffic just
something that nut doesn't even respond
so if you're doing any kind of canary
release
kind of fast rapid rollout you're
worried about the network being a
problem in a microservices architecture
the sto has a lot of great tools for you
so who do you think couple of use cases
who's this going to be most important
for or who do you think are going to be
really early adopters because they've
got most - most again from this the
definitely the shops that were kind of
early adopters of micro-services
architecture and now feeling the pain of
all that also anybody who basically says
we want to do micro services but not
only Java nodejs Python Ruby it doesn't
matter c-sharp anything works in this
world because it just has to fit in a
container doctor Linux container and
another one that I think will be very
advantageous to people if you're looking
at micro services hopefully you're
looking at micro services for faster
deployments right you're not you're
saying okay I want a six-month
deployment I don't want a six-week
deployment I want a six-day deployment
or a six minute
yeah six hour to plan so if you're
pulling that quickly then you do want
these new concepts of like a canary
rollout as an example where you just
rollout you send just a little bit of
traffic to that component see if it
stands up or is it eating all the memory
eating all the CPU logging out a bunch
of errors and then when you have that
little component running you can know
that it's feet are good good canary or
bad canary and if it's bad kill it take
it out of the system if it's good roll
it out to the rest of the users and so
it is to you one of the things I show in
the presentation is you can actually
take just a tiny fraction of traffic
send it in to that canary roll out the
new version of the pod the new version
of the in this case a little spring boot
app for vertex app that you rolled out
just a new little piece of Java code and
then you can also um decide based on
HTTP headers who should be rounded to it
like you know you can say only iOS users
or only Android users Safari Firefox
only employees because there's anything
in HTTP I only want beta customers
getting access to the new canary rollout
as an example so a lot of people are
very interested in that concept and it
has one other thing that we've seen
customers get super excited about and
that is it gives you distributed tracing
and metrics out of the box because it
knows all the network traffic going
through the service mesh you get Yaeger
or Zipkin based tracing just for free
right and you can just you plug it in
and you basically plug in the dashboard
you have the tracing and metrics from
that so if there's anybody watching this
who wants to get involved in
just starting it have a play around
where do they go what do they do yeah so
we've actually done something that's
really nice I think it's really nice my
team worked on it really hard but if you
go to bitly sto - tutorial really you'll
find long it's just a big old readme on
github with a bunch of projects and
sample files and things like that
that'll get you started on your laptop
and then also at the top of that
document you'll see that there's also
another link to an online tutorial so
you don't have to install anything okay
you just go to learn know you ship comm
slash service mesh and then then you can
just launch the examples right there
without having to install anything so
you can try those route rule changes I
was talking about where it's just a
canary rollout or it's just Safari users
or Firefox users you can try the metrics
and things like that and get a chance to
see it run what I haven't to install
everything and so it's still relatively
amateur it's only got six right now you
know they have to march through up to
one dot oh one dodo hopefully it'll be
the summer timeframe but it is maturing
rapidly and the feature set continues to
grow and it's really amazing how much
the community is really kind of fallen
in love with it yeah I mean I'm seeing
from the different community events that
I go to and I had also stuff coming up
for instance DevOps UK and in May as
well just so much interest in there and
it seems to be a new darling of the
sector for now so I hope that it
continues to be once they as they roll
up towards 1.0 and beyond as well
yeah it'll have to we certainly are
going to see a mature but there's so
many vendors now behind it but it's
another good example of a multi vendor
open-source project as one person told
me recently the new closed source is a
single vendor open source project and so
you see let things like kubernetes is a
good example multiple vendors like
Google and Red Hat and IBM and everybody
pretty much at this point all buying
kubernetes and Sto early on had IBM and
Google behind it and now Red Hat behind
it and so you can see a lot of people on
board with that and I think that's a
very good thing and so it'll richer
rapidly you know it'll you know it's
obviously still early you know there's
lots of bugs in it right now but you're
gonna see it mature rapidly and I think
it'll add tremendous value to those
shops to are trying to do the I got to
deploy every day or deploy every week or
deploy or a minute kind of kind of
things because you can just really
advance things in it great thank you
very much for joining me thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
