hear me is this working thanks thanks
for coming here instead of lunch I know
that we'll have lunch a little later but
let me see if I can make it worth your
time I'm going to be telling you a
little bit today about preparing for JD
canine what are the common things that
we at Oracle expect will require that
you change your code or your processes
to be ready for JD canine now standard
disclaimer I'm talking about something
that has not yet been released these
represents our current plans this is not
a promise such plans are subject to
change even that we put all of the
information that we have on OpenJDK if
you want further updates all you have to
do is go and read OpenJDK nine if
anything changes that's where it will be
announced first so with that in mind the
idea today is to identify the changes in
jdk nine that are most likely to affect
most developers not everybody learn
about some early access tools that you
can use now to get ready for that change
and identify some dependencies about
myself I'm a director of product
management with Oracle in charge of the
Java standard edition part of the
product I've been with Oracle since JDK
10 I'm sorry since 2010 around the
release type of there around the release
of jdk 7 that's when i joined so i've
been the PM for jdk nine eight and nine
before that I worked at Sun Microsystems
also the Java product management team
but with a different part not the JDK
and before that I got an MBA from MIT
and a bachelor's degree in systems
engineering from University I Lima now
jdk nine
has at least at the time that it took
this snapshot 89 Jets targeted to jdk
night so there's a long list this is
just you know you're not supposed to
read all of those it's just to
illustrate there's a large number of
changes many improvements in performance
new features new capabilities or overall
we think as usual it's a worthwhile
upgrade I'm going to ignore most of
these you can always go on reading to a
lot more detail on openjdk 9 there's a
page for each one of these guys which
you can spend many fun hours reading I'm
just going to go and talk about the
things that I think are going to bite
you if you don't pay attention there's
one caveat any developer any change that
we do to the JDK is potentially a bug
for somebody right even when we fix bugs
the case in point back in jdk one there
was a bug in Java 2d on the phone
metrics and it was recognized as about
and we fixed it in Java 12 as soon as we
did an important customer comes and
tells us you know what we we agree that
was a bug and this is indeed the correct
fix however turns out that we have a lot
of versions of the program out there
that rely on this bug and we're going to
need some time to upgrade all of our
users to a new version of the program so
can you help us out please there's a
flag in jdk one dot to that really
enables the bug okay so anything could
break your code i'm going to point the
important ones here's another one you
guys heard that son was acquired by
oracle now we announced that we had the
intention of changing the bender
properties from Sun to Oracle make sense
right and who can object to that
okay they actually read the vendor
property to decide which parameters to
pass to the j BN so our answer of what
and you just start a JVM and ask for the
properties doesn't work because you know
we needed to know what it was in order
to start the JVM and therefore if you
look at it there's a text file now in
the JDK that has some values that some
people use to decide these things ahead
of time so things that we considered you
know these are not part of the product
people rely on and they you know tend to
build things around and when we change
them oh you broke my code weren't you
supposed to be backward compatible and
I'm not pointing fingers here it's even
us as at the JDK team right the Java
team we hammer these two people right
you should go to the specification not
to the implementation if the
specification says one thing and the
implementation is doing something
different guess what's going to happen
we're going to correct the
implementation to match the
specification this is an example we're
talking about the order of a map right
it does here what does it say here it
does not guarantee that the order will
remain constant over time so when using
a map there's a couple of things that
use the same key you cannot rely on the
order this is from the original
specification so we run into a bug on an
update of seven and the bug fix altered
what had previously been always the same
order you know even though we said it's
never to say you cannot rely on it being
the same it always was the same and we
change it and then we go and do our own
testing guess who we broke the JDK we
broke ourselves so you know somewhere in
there somebody in the JDK had coded and
they just tried it and they notice how
it always returns the same and they
build some programs that you know some
methods that relied on that so as I said
it says stool so not saying that you do
anything wrong it's just the way
everybody develops
we had to delay the version so we had a
7 u X where we actually fix that thing
so that it doesn't even rely on the
order and then in the seven-year next we
had the pigs for that particular problem
and you know I asked a couple of my
colleagues for examples and I got back
hundreds of examples so we that's not
the point the point is with every major
Ruiz there are some common concerns and
these are just you know they'll happen
between seven and eight and between six
and seven bug fixes we add new supported
algorithms but more importantly we don't
support some of the old ones right music
critic new security requirements we
started asking people to sign their code
code that wasn't time stopped working
things like that the important thing for
this particular release though is what
we expect the incompatibilities to be in
jdk nine okay I'm just going to go back
on this one and say here's an important
one use of internal api's take it most
everybody developers here who's a
developer who has consciously used
Sunday p I one of those API is that you
know you're good yeah come on you know
and if I ask why I'm sure there's very
valid reasons right now I did what I
wanted to do I wanted to do base64 there
was no big 64 encoder that was people
that's the common answer right by the
way how many of you think you have not
used one you have been very careful not
to use internal api's therefore you're
not affected by this right do you use
any standard library log4j you know
spring so let me give you some news you
all use internal API realistically okay
you're not supposed to use them that's
how we implement the standard API you're
supposed to use that so we were changing
them now and then and people got
surprised anybody the other one is so
this is what's going to happen in jdk
it's not like there's going to be a
couple of changes here and there was an
encapsulated all of them okay they're
not going to be visible by default and
for the first time has anybody seen the
list of deprecated API in the JDK about
how many are they anybody the idea with
you know we started deprecating in Java
12 how many api's have we removed after
duplicating them for a while yes 0
nothing yet so some people have gotten
to the idea that deprecation means yeah
now you give me a warning but it doesn't
really mean anything would you the
canine we are removing some things
finally so and by the way this is the
number one incompatibility that's going
to affect each and every person in this
room you may be very diligent in your
use of api's and you know you're not
using it is deprecated you're using a
third-party library for sure right
unless you're doing a trivial hello
world application most large third-party
providers they're revamping they overeat
now they seem the same jets they know
this is coming and they're coming up
with new versions if you look into log4j
they'll tell you you want to play with
jdk nine use version two don't grab
version one but anything right because
we were using internal api's and here's
the new reactor version so at best
you'll have to grab the new version of
that API and use that one instead and
hopefully that's all that you will have
to do now for the people that actually
write their own codes I've arbitrarily
assign them into three buckets right
first the large changes I expect many
developers to be impacted by this you're
going to have to change your code
this is the LA right Jeff 216 we're
going to encapsulate most internal API
now this is very carefully worded notice
i say encapsulate maybe they're still
there and i say most meaning not every
single one of them so when we first
drafted this jab we said all of them
right and we did what you'd expect us to
do we went and looked at the open source
projects out there you know we have
access to the same source code that
everybody does and we looked around and
we said okay let's see who's using
internal api's and winter using them
what are they trying to do with it and
any guesstimation of how many
non-trivial projects were using internal
ati's a hundred percent we couldn't find
a single non-trivial project that was
not using an eternal API trivia question
what was the most use internal API let's
save somebody anybody else and say if
it's the second one if you if you
plotted it there's one that's used about
twice as much then there's unsafe and
then everybody else there's a long tail
base64 encoder right that's another
anecdote there's a bug on the base 64
encoded in the JDK the internal one we
introduced a proper base64 encoded in
jdk 8 that's part of the official
supported api's use that one some
customer call and I mean there was a bug
because we only cared about encrypting
sand about qualifying certain some
characters and some of the characters
that we didn't check for we're not
encoding correctly a customer came and
said there's a bug on your
implementation of the new base64 here's
what the old one did here's what the new
one does when we pointed out yet the new
one is the right one the old one always
had a bug
we got another request of can you put a
flag so that the new one gives me the
error that the old monday because every
little you know so we politely declined
that one but you know that's to the
level of you know that's that's what
people expect in any case we went and we
found a bunch of api's and we said why
are they using them in some cases like
the base64 one it's convenient there's
people there's another library and
there's their party libraries there's
been around forever you could even cut
and paste our implementation put in your
gold and you know be outside of internal
api's yeah those were taken away in
other cases it was neat but it's not
really needed but there were a handful
of API that yeah there's really no
workaround for those and yeah that's a
valid use case unsafe so what we're
trying to do now is everything that was
in that category and it's only a handful
of them we're going to not encapsulate
those they're going to remain where they
are you can just continue to use them no
need to do anything now pay attention to
this one we're not we're not turning
them into standards we're actively
working right now on replacements we
came back and said oh these are all the
use cases that we need those 80 as for
there's people at Oracle working today
trying to come up with official api's to
replace those use cases we hope to get
it in perhaps 10 or 11 we don't know but
as soon as we do we're going to
deprecate those and try to get them out
of way okay but for the time being a
handful will remain so this is what I'm
saying until a major release I underline
this one unsafe can you use any 9 yes
can you be certain you'll be done in 10
no okay no surprises here we introduced
in jdk 8 a tool called j depth and it
will analyze your bytecode and i use
your loosely because it could be the
bike off from the third party library
that you use the idea is i donate the
source code I just need the bike oh and
will tell you whether or not your
classes are using internally
okay now that was introduced in jdk 8
day that's pretty nifty tool I would
recommend that you use instead the jdubs
version available in the early access of
JD canine simply because when we find an
eternal API we don't just tell you well
good luck when we can as i said we know
in some cases you should be using this
instead the tool will tell you right
you're using San miskin you know bae 64
encoder use the official one here's the
API the one in jdk nine has better
recommendations that's the only big
difference okay this is the first tool
by the way that I know of that we've
done that just proactively helps you
move to the next version everything else
was no to do about today we've also
introduced something called move to
release jars that may help you offset
some of the issues that we have is you
know people tell us I'd like to use this
new API but some of my users I'm going
to just create this jar file and some of
our users are going to run into nine
some people are going to run it on eight
I need this thing to be compatible with
both therefore I'm restricted to
whatever the oldest user is using right
Jerry canine we've introduced the option
of in this in the same jar file you can
create classes and say if you're running
JDK 8 and below use these classes ABC if
you ran in jdk 9 we please a with this
other more advanced version of a that
uses jdk 9 api in an effort to simplify
your management and that way you can
have a single jar that can be used
across releases so for anything that I'm
missing here by the way high level
overview you know search engines are
your friends just that's why I put jet
numbers i'm not that anal it's just that
it'll make your searching so much simple
search for Jeb 238 you'll learn all
about you need to know about the mall to
release guys okay the same with j 260
another one this is one of my favorite
by personal favorites a new version
string scheme
anybody every single version of Java
raised from Java 12 now if i type java
dot minus version what are the first two
characters one dot all right but aren't
we in Java 8 coming from right you can
go and read all about it about why we
kept Java 1 etcetera etcetera also which
version has more features eight update
40 or 8 Update 45 they both had this
exact same features 45 is a bug fix 40
was a new update with new features in
jdk 8 the multiples of 20 introduce new
features so 8 Update 20 and 840 and you
know multiples of five or six it's very
convoluted and that's because we're
using one number to mean many things so
we have a little secret decoder ring
that you can look in OT n and you can
think you know there is a series of
logical decisions that led to a very
convoluted string that's not going to
happen with jdk 90 k JT canine the
version string is 9 and there's it's not
actually semantic versioning but it's
much closer to it so you will have a
couple of digits that will rev
independently and they mean different
things so most people don't care trust
me when we were looking at that code
there were a lot of places where they
say let's find out the version number
read the version number truncate the
first two things compare the rest that's
not gonna work on I okay there's some
api's by the way so if you want to
compare things you don't have to just do
strings and comparing so bunch of new
API that also means by the way all the
file names for the binaries are changing
okay so don't expect to get eight you 45
so if any of you have some sort of build
system that automatically grabs versions
and computes the file name and uses that
in your testing to have to reword it and
you know the good news this is not
retroactive we
not going to rename Andrey number eight
and seven right so for a while you're
going to have to deal with aversion a
tower above below do this version 9 and
above use new version similarly the
whole point well I don't know about the
whole point but one of the important
sales phones of modularity in jigsaw
remember that monolithic RTR runtime joy
that's not there anymore so it's not
only the Arctic jar but the file
structure inside of the JDK you know if
you look at things like the registry key
all of those things have been remapped
we think it makes more sense for
hopefully most users don't care about
this but we have seen people that go and
inspect the directory and try to assume
things based on whether they find a file
there or not okay we all kind of think
the other silly but trust me there's a
lot of people out there doing that and
they're going to run into troubles with
nine and those are all the large changes
I don't expect the next ones to effect
as many people now these ones are medium
changes less likely to be used but
they're gone in nine okay so this is
everything that we're with removing or
that we're no longer shipping with there
were a bunch of garbage collection
combinations that were deprecated in jdk
8 now that means that we have not been
testing them and if you are support
customer and Tom and say I have a
support ticket and I would like to help
with these we will tell you you will
have to use something else those are
unsupported but they remained in jdk 8
right that we're still available and who
knows maybe they'll work GD k 9 they're
gone okay now there's a bunch of flat
combinations and here are all of the
ones that I as of the time of when i did
this slide I've also in case you like
pretty pictures everything that's in red
here was deprecated
kade apologies if it's not very clear
it's all centered around these guys here
and you will notice that all of the
lines that led to incremental CMS are
deprecated so if there's no way of
getting to incremental CMS guess what
else is getting removed incremental CMS
okay now as a rule of thumb if you were
trying to use one of those combinations
in jdk 8 you were getting a warning like
that okay well that's another warning in
any case you whenever you pass a command
that's one is about the permian sighs we
remove that on jdk 8 but there's a lot
of people that have in their script I'm
going to set the perm gen whenever you
said that we put a little warning the
way we operate is we will warn you in
one read and we will remove it in the
next one which means that for anybody
that's not looking at the returns oh my
god it broke online without any warning
right so give us a little credit we put
it there please read it you know and
we've already had situations like this
with things that were duplicated in
seven remove an eight people complain
about you never told me except for two
years so here's another one right as I
said those were removed here's another
one the perm generation it was giving
you warnings on eight it's just going to
tell you I don't know what you're saying
and then you know blow up on online okay
this one in particular permgen yeah
that's going to bite a bunch of people
if you fix remove that my life right how
many people think that's an easy fix by
the way how many people work in very
large companies we're changing a command
line it means you know you've got 27,000
environment replications and there is no
you know single instance yeah
there are a few api's that we couldn't
actually come up with a you know
rational modularization we created these
loops if we try to maintain them there
were some references that really didn't
belong and there was no way of creating
rational modules if we kept these guys
so these guys are gone now again I don't
expect anybody to be using them but
somebody else will so a couple of
properties login manager and util change
listener they will just have complicated
jigsaw modules you know to be an absurd
we have several tools for selecting
which Jerry to run an application with
some of them are well used this one
don't we cannot find many people that
are using it and it usually takes a lot
more than this for most people it's just
a matter of if you need to use a
particular Jerry you bundle the
application with that Jerry and you just
launch it from there I there and then
you're set right so this mechanism which
was there for a while since JDK five now
it's gone now you could use these either
via the command line or through a
manifest we're going to treat it
differently if you're giving it to me in
the command line I'm going to stop you
because I assume you have control of the
command line if you are passing it via
the manifest I'm just going to give you
you know like a warning and I'm going to
ignore it because for all I know you
have that's built into some third-party
library and you don't have the source
code anyway so maybe you cannot change
the manifest anybody use the indoor
standard override and extension
mechanisms
not a single person good we can sleep so
we're you know if you know of somebody
that's using it this creates the same
kind of problems that we're trying to
solve with jigsaw we have a better
solution click so if you need to use saw
maybe some some new standards you can
just put them in the classpath instead
of putting them here in the endorsed or
exchange x directories now here's
another nifty trick those two
directories here have a homely bigs and
have a absolute indoors they are gone if
you want to crash the JVM what we have
to do is create them again and we will
check well it's not going to crush the
vm but it's going to check and it's
going to say you're trying to use this
I'm just gonna hold you right there so
you know some people that were using
this didn't rate this oh they forgot
about it let me create the directory and
put my jars in there oh it's erroring
out this is why you know there's a
couple of packages as I said all the
internal api's and most of them you can
tell because they have son in the name
and they're not part of the Javadoc
there's a couple that don't have son in
the name but they were still meant to be
internal and those are also hidden when
I say hidden by the way it means that
you can pass a command line and expose
them again now trivia question is that a
good idea that's a good idea if you are
not in this session and these blows up
in your face and you need a month or two
to do your change then pass the command
line use that month do the change then
get rid of the command line okay that's
not a permanent solution please we've
removed some tools so we've got a bunch
of tools and API and this is pretty much
a common thread right demonstration code
somebody thought it would be useful and
it really should have always been kind
of separate but hey it's there why not
just included
it gets to be very bulky and it's not
clear when you have like how long are
you going to support the jdk we don't
support those experimental tools so
we're moving towards a trend where we're
getting those out of the JDK you know
everybody if you really like them the
source code remains available knock
yourself out we have other tools that
provide the same functionality and in
that vein of J hat right same idea
experimental unsupported out of date
when you see all of those things it's a
good candidate for removal in a future
version and we have better analyzers the
entire HTTP proxy mechanism of our mi
has been deprecated in java SE eight and
will be removed in jdk nine again if
you're using these you're getting
warnings we mean it with the warnings
this time supposed to the previous
versions sorry this one is a limb
bearing never work properly so if you
were using it what if I don't know what
you were getting there this is an
inherently unsafe method so that stopped
there's a flavor of eight that has
throwable it's been deprecated for a
long time and it will now throw an
exception there's another one let's stop
without any argument that remains it's
also inherently unsafe but remember when
I said that we go and look at to the
code and to decide which you know how
much impact one of these changes will
have they are removing that one would
have been too painful there would be too
many projects affected so don't use it
but if you're using the probable one
yeah that one is going to stop working
serialize up its functionality do I
really need to explain this one there's
a realization these athletes you know
people ask me hey can Oracle support
applets for longer yeah sure we can
doesn't mean they will work because the
bouncers won't
so you know if it makes you feel better
assume we will support them forever
they'll stop store they'll stop working
you know make sure your anyways but
non-strict jnlp parsing so if you're
using jnlp in some cases we was not
perfectly written we gave it our best
shot as to what we thought you meant and
all developers can tell you that's
probably not a good idea if you're not
being clear I should just error out and
ask you to be clear so that's what we're
going to do now okay what you use for
example to do a web start application
that little file that tells you know how
you're going to launch it and which
parameters to pass and which jars etc so
we were being we're trying to be
friendly and we realize that not usually
what you want when you're trying to
specify how you're going to do something
this one is the good in the bad right
who produced the JDK for max until jdk
six Apple what about jdk 7 and above
oracle thank you what Apple did was it
grabbed the same source code but it also
added their own api's to do things that
weren't available elsewhere so calm
Apple eew te como pode vir oh there were
to offer you know like the little bouncy
thing in the mac and stuff like that
standard for Apple not a standard
elsewhere so whatever we could think of
that was yeah there's a decent
translation for these that would match
say windows and linux we created some
new platform independent alternatives
for those in java.awt and the ones in
Apple are going away so once again if
you look into our little tools they'll
tell you yeah I don't use the apple one
right and some cases they'll tell you if
you using this one here's the new and in
reached awt one and as a side benefit
there were some things that were added
into Windows and Linux because you know
they made sense so the good on the
battle that one
there is a calm some image correct jpg
we have had these replacement available
since 2002 it's not in openjdk so
licensing and all of that good stuff
it's been deprecated in jdk 7 it's gone
online now this one I hope nobody's
bothered by this we've changed the
garbage collection login there is a new
job that you know uses a unified
framework for this so don't think it's
going to be a big deal but if you were
parsing the logs and you expected them
in a particular format you'll just have
you know the information is still there
it's just standard out for all garbage
collection okay so hopefully it'll just
be a matter of you know if you have some
partial automator thing you'll just
recall that and it work just fine there
were some garbage collection login flags
that are now removable okay so the most
common flags that we wanted to deprecate
we went and looked around and we said
yeah these are pretty common so here let
me remap them for you so you know x.x
preme GC will be mapped to XLR GC GC
details excellency blah blah there's
another list of 43 more that were not
that common and we didn't buy the
remapping those you can do that on your
own so if you're affected by those okay
that's it for the what I think are the
changes that may require it then there's
the ones that are called the annoyance
section et work around right this is not
going to be a big deal this is you know
don't call me to it if you do have a big
deal with this one but we're changing
the default garbage collector so for the
platforms that's supported that it's not
every single platform g1 is now the
default garbage collector now anybody
cares about which garbage collection
their application uses ok now of those
of you with the hand up
which one of you are assuming into the
default rather than passing it as a
parameter to use the one that you care
for your impacted right you just have to
now go and say well I want the other one
and listen right you were so if you were
right just relying on the default you
can you know toggle back and use the
previous p fault so that's why i said
not a big deal here's another one
another tool and no longer ships with
the jdk we shall be m okay it's a
profiling tool was bundled with six
seven and eight and it remains available
for downloading get up so if you were
using this tool by all means you know
well try some of the other tools but if
you like this one better there it is in
github go for it likewise java DB this
is just another name for Apache Derby
it's the exact same database it shipped
with the JDK with just jdk 7 and 8 so
it's recent edition and we realize here
you know most of you have access to the
internet right you can all search a
derby you can find it and you will get a
more current version we don't have to
then deal with what happens if they
update and we don't have an update
coming right just get it directly from
the source finally we're going to
deprecate a bunch of things in jdk 9 in
preparation to get them out in a future
version so if you're using any of these
well applets if using a blitz if you're
using some codec if using Jar Jar you
can jar the same thing twice CMS jar
signer have a policy tool a bunch of
security AP is that are no longer
current so these are the things that we
have already been broken and are
disabled by default right we're
deprecating a console on a doclet api
these will remain available in jdk 9
they will continue to work if you happen
to
yeah customer they are supported so you
can file a support ticket against them
they're just you know being marked as
deprecated with views of removing in a
future version you have questions
I'll have to go and click on the jab so
if you want to stay a little later as I
said sir changing your help I'll find it
for you in a second but it's just a
bunch of comment or maybe not all of
them just some of them
j depth that the question was is the
tool that i mentioned going to detect
all of these and no it's not going to
detect deprecated api's jaidev's looks
for the dependencies for the modules so
when you wish that there was a tool that
find deprecated api's there there's a
tool called j depper scan which is a
different tool the second tool in the
toolbox that will just help you find
stuff in the future you can use jaitapur
scan for simply yeast all of the
deprecated API you can say just tell me
the deprecated API that have been
deprecated in this version or tell me
the ones that are deprecated for removal
I didn't include it because that's an
improvement but another improvement that
we have in jdk 9 is when we deprecate
something what do we mean with
deprecation because we've used
deprecation for at least three different
reasons right we don't like this style
of these there is in an awt show and
hide for a form right and in java that's
not really what we do we use visible
true and said visible false it's the
same thing so it's a style thing right
it was deprecated because we thought you
should be using setvisible we're never
going to remove it to the point the JDK
9 that show and hide are no longer
deprecated we have unduplicated those
api's we have rotated so they were
tagged as deprecated they are no longer
deprecated right there are other
instances where we're really saying yeah
we're not working on that particular API
anymore you know have you noticed that
there's a package called new I Oh Niall
yeah there's a package kal'ai-il where
do you think our efforts are you or the
old I all right so it's mostly a yeah we
think you should be used if you're
coding something from scratch you
shouldn't be using that old API but if
you have some old product that is
working fine and you're not recoding
there's no rush to go and refactor and
get that out right and there's finally
deprecated for yeah this is
going away you should get rid of it and
if we tag them all as deprecated which
one is which so there's enhanced
deprecation in jdk nine we've added an
annotation it tells you the important
one is you can say you can look for
things that have for removal equals true
okay now it doesn't mean that we've gone
and tagged everything for removal tool
for removal falls so it's the presence
of for removal true that should bother
you for removal to means we intend to
remove this API in the next major
version again careful with the wording
if something doesn't have for removal
true it doesn't mean that it's going to
stay there forever it means that we have
no plans for removing it in the next
major version it's the possibility the
next version a major version adds a for
removal tool to something that currently
SS doesn't have a removal you had a
question that I answer it already or
yeah so the question is are these the
two tools that I'm going to use from JDK
8 to jdk 9 and the answer are the answer
is these are two of the two of the tools
that you will use as I mentioned we
already include a bunch of warnings and
messages in just when you just run Java
the command line right GD k 9 as you
know the point of these talk is will be
a little more painful by the way I'm
just going to skip to them you know
prefer for the future now that's the
usage a step i should add another line
about juice take that be right it's
going to be a little bit more painful
than other major versions and part of my
job at oracle is to go and tell other
Oracle groups about these things this
presentation you know I've been doing
this is like versions 13 there are
earlier versions that were given to
Oracle teams and from their feedback we
came up with yeah we don't just need
warnings we need little tools that will
help us do this into the future and
that's where these tools come from right
we realized that not all users come to
the box or to Java one or you know just
having it in a session and some
conference that it's not enough so if
you can think of other tools that would
be useful to help you migrate let me
know right bring them up we will try it
and the important thing is JT canine
early access have been available for a
long time now we've already reached
feature complete so if you were waiting
and holding off and saying it's still a
little shaky I don't want to try it yet
there's no new features coming in you
should try it now this is like planning
for retirement if you wait until you
have to do it you know if you're about
to retire and you start saving it's not
going to be enough time right let me
tell you what's going to happen after
all of these tools there's people that
are going to be surprised when they try
to go to jdk nine right and they're
going to find about it when they have a
deadline for oh we need to go to JT
clean i'm in three months and then it's
sure there's going to be people that are
going to wait until jdk 8 which is in
the public life and I I know we're going
to get email saying can you extend the
public life of eight for a couple of
years so that we can move to nine and
you know we didn't start early download
it now you don't have to type any URLs
just any search engine jdk nine early
access the first heat is likely to be
that one you will find you see that nine
build 120 that's fairly old where 150
something is not 60 something already
we're a bit about every it's not every
week every other week every other week
they are already out there ides in early
access mode this is the netbeans but i'm
sure you can find your favorite flavor
of IDEs with support for JT canine
features so this is NetBeans showing you
you know like a module graph for one of
your applications like us they're
waiting for your feedback if you tell us
about something that it's going to bite
you and that we could help you with if
you tell us now it's a little late that
we might be able to help you if you wait
until a month before GA will tell you
well isn't that a great idea for nine
dot one okay same for the Ides they want
your feedback by all means this is what
the Java dependency tool looks like
right a couple of caveats of course if
you're using reflection and there's some
text that calls class we will not know
about that until runtime so you know
this is as good as we can do without
magically knowing what you're doing and
there is a public weekly over here where
we show you this is where we add more of
the if you're using these you should be
using this other one instead okay so
we'll go on update I ran it against TC
updater I don't know if you've seen that
tool to update the time zone and it
found that it was using a bunch of no
classes combat Santa tools and here you
should be using Java util instead
okay if you do run these jaidev's and it
finds a bunch of stuff for most api's
this is the delay yes add export I
updated this side I think it had it for
a while there is a command line that
tells you add exports this is the module
this is the AAPI and I want to export
that the visibility that was hidden to
all unnamed modules so your classes if
they're not modularized they're
automatically collected into a module
called unnamed right if you use modules
you would put the name of your module
instead but you get the gist right for
and notice that this is slightly long
you have to do it not quite for every
API but for every class right and no
we're not going to try to make this any
easier because the whole point is that
you you know don't do this and hopefully
you haven't seen anything I scared you
too bad but yeah and that you found it
useful any questions about preparing for
JT canine that's the world chosen
adjective sure
okay so I I think everybody heard that
question right he doesn't have a
microphone i heard him fine well good oh
sure for the recording so the question
is yes he thinks he's found a case on
which were deprecating something in
favor of a new class and the new clasp
is broken who do i contact about that
now for every single one of these
classes there is a jab right there's a
jab jab and has been processed num
number in there if you haven't set up my
computer for the internet but if you
just search for Jeff and that number you
will end up in a page that explains
what's going on why do we do in it it
tells you who the lead is and more
interesting it has a discussions and it
has an alias that's the Middle East
where the people that are coming up with
these discussions are working on that
one so I would recommend don't just
right there go with the archive because
you know I don't want to sound
condescending but chances are somebody
else has spotted that before and nobody
likes to reply to an email that's
already in the archives
correct so I'm not going to be so you
know foolish has to say oh there are no
mistakes most I've certainly heard a lot
of objections that if you've gone and
look into the aliases there's a long
discussion and maybe there's not even
consensus but at least you understand
why the decision was made but if there
is a mistake we really really really
want to hear about it today okay so go
bring it up and if you do not find the
earliest you can find my name the
recession just ping me enough rather
