thank you so welcome to this talk about
being mappings with meta tracked I hope
you enjoyed the conference so far and I
know it's a lot of content so I really
appreciate you even show up during a
lunch break here that's very cool let me
tell you quickly a bit about me I work
as a software engineer at Red Hat and
the project I mostly focus on these days
is called division which is a tool for
change data capturing and if you would
like to know what this is about and what
this can do for you I did to talk about
it yesterday and the recording should be
up on YouTube very soon so you can check
this story out I'm this big lead for
bean validation 2.0 and I will do a
quickie on that one just after this one
so if you are interested in the new
features and beam radiation to the don't
just follow me to the other room and I
will do this quickly there and I'm
finally doing some projects on the site
one of them being map struct and I work
on this with say enter a community of
open-source enthusiasts and I would like
to talk a bit about this one today so
what is the problem that maps trucks is
sewing for you so it's mapping between
models and the issue quite often arises
in enterprise applications but if for
instance have a domain model which for
instance maps to your database and then
you might for instance have different
view models which might expose just a
subset of your data for specific use
cases or for specific clients and then
you need to map the data between your
internal data model to those external
models or you might be calling some
other external service you might be
calling some rest servers and again you
may you may have to map between your
internal model and then this model which
is you used to exist this rest service
and often you will find it there are
things there are concepts entities which
are essentially the same in a semantic
level so you might have a customer
object in your internal model and you
may have a customer in this view model
for instance and they represent the same
thing but they differ a little bit in
the details so the properties they may
have different names or they may have
different types there might be something
here like the name thing which is a
joint attribute on the view model but it
stood that this two separate properties
first them and last them in the source
so this is the kind of difference you
may observe and well of course people
run into this problem quite often and
well what can can we do about it so the
first thing would be you just could
implement the mappings yourself so you
can just go and implement those mappers
but you would probably agree if I say
that's very tedious code to write it's
boring you need all the tests it is not
something which is very desirable and of
course people thought about it and then
they came up with the idea hey we can
use reflection forest so we could just
iterate over all the properties and then
copy them between source and target
objects and yes this works but in my
experience there are some down sides to
this and the one is you have quite a
hard time to have insight into what's
happening so why are properties mapped
in the way they are mapped are all the
properties Maps you only weave we'll
find out about these things at runtime
if something cannot be mapped you only
we find out very late and also
reflection got faster much faster over
the years but still there is some
noticeable performance penalty usually
associated to this usage of reflection
and so I'm going to present a different
approach and this is using compile time
code generation so what maps truck is
doing it generates mapper code at
compile time and then you can use this
without any further ado at runtime so
the way it works is you define
interfaces plain Java interfaces and you
define mapping methods there which take
the source of the object to be mapped as
a parameter and then the target type as
a return type and metric will generate
an implementation of such an interface
as I will show you in a bit and you then
can configure it using some annotations
to adjust the mapping process and we
will come to that all right so I will go
to eclipse I've prepared this here and
let me first say map struck it's not
tied to any IDE so it's really plugin
for the Java compiler so the Java
compiler is extensible you can put in
plaque and Sturridge for instance
generate code is in our case but then
IDE such as eclipse or IntelliJ will
pick up those plugins and also make use
of those plugins in the IDE so I have
prepared this maven project here and I
have a customer and the customer dto
object and I will show you a bit how to
map them and the first thing I need is
in terms of depending
I need to edit this map struct
dependency which just contains the
annotations which we are using so they
won't be needed at runtime it's just
some compile time artifact there's not a
good scope in maven Sam could use
provided but yeah that's the way I could
do it but other more interesting thing
is is this processor jar here and that's
not a regular dependency but instead
it's added to the annotation process or
path so they may even compile a plugin
in recent versions it has this new
option annotation processor path and
this is where I can put these compiler
plugins and then they will be invoked by
the compiler for me all right so I have
those custom objects here on the source
side I use properties and then getters
and setters and and on the target side
and ADT oh I just use public field so
it's just the DTO I don't care about
this just some fields so that's the
stuff I'm going to use so in the first
thing I'm gonna do is I create a new
interface I call it customer mapper and
I add the at mapper annotation to it
which makes it a mapper in terms of
abstract and if I save it automatically
the code generation kicks in for me and
if I go here now to the folder with my
generated sources I see this customer
mapper implement is generated for me so
nothing is in there yet but the code
generation already is kicking in so let
me add a method to it so I would like to
map into a customer DT oh that's my
output object called customer to DT oh
and if I hit safe again this should fix
the import of course and if I'd safe
again then D generates implementation
will contain an implementation of this
method and now it already Maps all the
properties which it came from is of
which have the same name they will be
mapped automatically for me there are
some conversions going on so for
instance this credit score of property
it has different types and source and
target so in the source it's a big
decimal on the target site it's a double
here for just for the case of for the
sake of the example a metric knows about
many of those type conversions and can
generate the code automatically for me
to take care of such
version and first I mean last name for
instance they are just propagated so let
me go to the contract again and I hope
you can see it it's marked with the
warning marker so it's the yellow
underline and this is saying to me
there's an unmapped target property and
this is because the ID property I chose
a different name in this DTO then in the
source object and of course this tool
cannot know ok customer ID it's the same
as ID on the source side so I need to
have a bit with this and I'm using this
quick fix here and by the way so as I
said this black compiler plugin it's
independent of the ID but I'm still
there is an eclipse plugin for map
struct which for instance provided me
with this quick fix here so that there's
just some assistance for me when I'm
altering such a mapping contract and now
I just say ok this should be met from
idea by the way I have should have Auto
completion here let me try it again oh
that's not working perfectly anyways
there should be Auto completion lots of
white is not working right now but now
this warning marker goes away and if I
go to the generated implementation again
now the ID property is mapped to
customer ID so that's pretty much what I
wanted
the next thing to show is this date
format so this is a string in the target
object but it's a local date on the
source side and I'm just using a default
date format here and I would like to
customize this limit so I can again go
there and adjust this format of it
saying the target is date of birth and
now I can specify a date format just
choosing something simple something like
that and again if I take a look at the
generated code now this date format will
be used here okay um that's pretty good
so now I'm going to do again and let me
add some more properties to it so for
instance I have this title property here
and this is a string here but I'm now
getting an error I added a new property
to this DTO and I'm getting an error
here and this one
is telling me okay there's this title
property and on the target site it's a
string but on the source side it's a
title object and now Maastricht doesn't
know about us it's something which I
just have here in this project so that's
something I need to convert myself so
I'm doing this and for it I'm adding a
new met method here which I implement
myself now and I'm just using a Java
eight default method for that and all
I'm doing is I just return the title do
where you in there and now it what's
that oh yeah thank you so much return
types missing right and now for the
title property it calls this method for
me so based on the type of the property
source and target prep which is to be
mapped this other method is chosen for
me so now each customer let's say also
has an address object an address which
is referenced so there's an address
detail on the target side and an address
object in the source ID if I add this it
automatically generates this address to
address DTO method for me and makes use
of this in the customer mapping method
but it might be I would like to have
some more control over this address
mapping so maybe again some names of
different and so on and for that I
already have prepared another memory
address mapper and I would like to plug
this one in so all I need to do for that
is I just added as a used mapper here
and now this one will be used
automatically by this generative method
so it creates now an instance of this
address mapper and makes use of this
method and again the method is chosen by
means of the property types which are to
be mapped here and the last thing I want
to show is this full name thing so let's
say we have this additional property on
the target site which presents first
name plus last name in one single string
and I don't have a full name property on
the source side and so I need to take
care of that myself and something which
is quite useful for this is what we call
expressions so I can say
the full name it should be an expression
in this literally it's just some Java
snippet which I can use his own
obviously I would just make use of this
for some short stuff but it can be a
useful thing to solve this kind of issue
so this one then copy this one it's just
literally copied into the generated
class so it's some kind of extension
mechanism for me if I don't want to
implement it a separate proper method of
course I also need to get hold of that
term mapper and this is very component
models come in so I'm I could say this
customer mapper it should use the CDI
component model and this will course
then degenerated implementation to have
this application scoped annotation at
the definition this allows me then to
just inject this class of this instance
into a code which needs this kind of
mapper they also support for spring and
as a fallback there's some kind of
factory which we provide if you don't
happen to work with any sort of
component one okay that's pretty much
what I wanted to show so let me go back
to the slides um what what are the
advantages in my opinion of this
approach of generating code for once
it's type safe so you work with those
types interfaces it cannot happen that
you map a customer let's say into an
auto DT open cos you've work with this
typed interfaces you get very quick
feedback as you have seen so if
something in my mapping is wrong as the
title property which couldn't be mapped
I learn about it right in my IDE or when
I build the project or if my mappings
are incomplete I have more properties on
a target site which I don't map and
usually that's some sort of bad
indication that the property isn't
populated I will also get a warning or
even an error depending on the
configuration and compiled it as or
compare that to a reflection based
approach but you only would find out
about this kind of stuff at runtime and
it would take much longer to react to
this it's quite easy to debug so you see
to generate code you can take it you can
take a look at it and the worst case
let's say that would be a back in map
struct in a generated code would just be
wrong for whatever reason so you could
even take the copy decode and copy it
into your project and maintain yourself
from there on of course that's not what
it's intended but you could
not not tied into a corner here and
finally it's it's fast so there's just
plain method calls or just plain field
calls so no reflection involved and it
works as we have seen in the IDE and on
maven and whatever cradle there's much
more which I can show there is support
for collection map method so I could
have a method which takes a list of
customers and Maps it into a set of
customer details as update method
methods which is very useful if I need
to map back from and ETO into my entity
for instance which then is attached and
much more go to the reference guide
which describes all the features and
great lengths and the biggest new thing
I would like to mention is there's this
IntelliJ plugin so here I'm showing
eclipse but one person from the
community was very active on
contributing tape track and so it just
can go to the internet a marketplace and
get this plug-in there and then you also
have auto completion you can even have
refactoring support so if a property
changes in your model the mapping
annotations will be adapted accordingly
and with that I'm done there are some
resources go to mash up the talk if you
would like to learn more follow us on
Twitter and with it I think there's one
minute left for questions thank you so
much yeah sure does it support immutable
objects yes by means of mapping into
builders that's the answer I can give
right now and one of the next steps fast
will be to support proper parameterize
constructors on the target site so
currently it just calls the the
parameter less default constructor but
it will be in the next release probably
support for proper constructors which
can allow you to have an immutable
object yeah so it it still pays right
now this version I've shown here 1.2 it
works was Java sex at a six sorry six
and later but this repeatable annotation
feature I've chosen here just giving
those mapping actives matter times this
would only work with Java 8 but
otherwise you still can use it on 6 but
we will move to gyrate soon yeah
all right does it support other
annotation process the number we have
worked just recently very closely
together with Lumbergh this had been an
issue for a long time but now the two
things work nicely together time's up
and if you got other questions just come
to me and thank you so much again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
