really big screen my name is Martin I
eyes I'm that whereas developer at bull
dot-com bullet calm is one of the
biggest online retail firms in the
Netherlands and Belgium and I'm going to
talk to you about how do we manage
growth at balcombe would like to tell
you something how do we keep our
business intelligence scalable and
hopefully I can give you a quick peek at
our some of our in-house projects it's a
bit ambitious for 15 minutes but let's
see how far we get first let's start
with some figures about bullet com we
have about six million customers we have
almost 1 million shop visits per day and
we sell more than 10 million different
products and we have tiled 1,000
employees at the moment and we're doing
incredibly well can't show you the
actual figures but I think you can see
which way it's heading this also causes
a bit of a problem poses a bit of a
problem for volcom because with such
growth figures you're not working in a
very stable IT environment everything
you think of and create here becomes
absolutely useless when you get here so
the big question we have is actually how
can we manage this growth and you gotta
think how can we keep our organization
manageable how can we keep our software
maintainable how can we keep our
hardware from exploding
and finally how can we keep our bi
architecture scalable and available for
our business users ok to answer that
let's go back in time about 15 years ago
according to legend bullet come started
in a mobile office not unlike this one
and you can say a lot about this kind of
accommodation but internal communication
within such a unit it's perfect
everybody knows each other and they know
what you're doing your IT infrastructure
is very simple probably you have a
server hiding under your desk and if you
got a business intelligence question you
just log in to the source system and you
get the answer you need copy it to excel
and you can do your thing so this is
actually quite an efficient way of
working so if you start growing as a
company you would like to keep this you
would like to multiply this perfect unit
instead of growing into a big monolithic
organization and looking for us the last
few years there are quite a lot of
solutions and techniques and tools have
become available to help us with this
philosophy for instance for our
organization for a development
organization we introduce scrum already
several years ago and it gave us a lot
of small flexible development teams
we're currently replacing our really big
unmanageable applications with a smaller
microservices for a heart where we use a
dupe as a storage system so we can buy
lots of cheap hardware instead of having
to invest in a few big expensive
machines
but for our bi architecture we had to
think up something for ourselves it's
the thing we call belek interfaces and
going to talk to you about that a little
bit now this is our current data
warehouse it's very traditional we copy
all data from the different sources to
the database we do lots of
transformations and calculations on it
and finally we load the data into a
structure which can be easily queried by
our users and you gotta this very happy
data where our steam maintaining this
operation this is very textbook stuff so
what's wrong with it well on top of this
slide you see our applications our
services below you see our business
users bit sketchy and in between we got
our data warehouse which takes care of
all business intelligence questions we
have well you can see where the
bottleneck is when i started at bullitt
com five years ago there was a data
warehouse team which consisted of four
engineers currently we have a bi fleet
of more than five teams and personally I
don't think our service level has gone
up so what can we do about it how can we
keep how can we keep our bi scalable
what we fold up it was why not giving
those services those applications their
own bi responsibility if you want
something from the order service let's
ask this disorder service directly and
not go through the data warehouse so the
surface has got their own responsibility
but also our business
users they also have a bi responsibility
now because if they want to combine data
for instance they want to know which
products are sold well they will have to
combine this data themselves from data
from the order service and from the
product service and they can't go to the
data whereas anymore for those that kind
of information okay we call it we call
this bulk interfaces each service each
application as a bulk interface which
can be queried for bi purposes and
between the services and our business
users we got a small reporting layer
which make it easy for our business
users to query the data from all those
different sources as you can see there's
still that where else but it's no longer
the center of our bi len skype and it
doesn't have to grow as much as it did
before and the funny thing is we've been
working with this about a year or so and
our business users are really really
happy with this they're actually hiring
their own bi people to get more out of
this new architecture on the other end
our engineers they're less than happy
suddenly they have extra work which they
didn't have before and they have to do
stuff they have never done before and to
me I think this is a good thing because
okay we make our business people happy
and that's what we're all here for and
at the same time we're distributing our
growing pains across the entire
development landscape so this is
actually quite cool am this is more like
the technical architectural picture of
this
on the top left you see the service in
the middle you see our business users
where you should be and our book
interfaces are actually HBase tables on
top of the Hadoop platform the surface
has to provide data passing it to the
bulk interfaces in HBase we got our
reporting layer here and we also still
have our traditional data warehouse
which also gets data from a dupe from
these bulk interfaces to make this work
we had to create several tools ourselves
I'm going to talk to you about those
tools next most of them are simple Java
tools used for monitoring and
connectivity things which are Hadoop
itself is not particularly good at so
let me show you in the time I've got
left some of the projects we have at
boulder come first as Eddie Eddie is a
tool to get data into the Hadoop file
system what it does the applications the
services they send data to a message
queue Eddie picks it up translates the
message into an HBase insert statement
passes it to the to the Hadoop file
system to the edge base table sniff
sniff is also a really simple thing what
it does it well it actually sniffs
through the big Hadoop file looking for
key words like error or count or the
names of particular pig or scoop scripts
and it passes it to a table or a file
and you can create simple reports on it
as long as everything is green
everything's fine if you see something
red you have to do something about it
what more Kyoto that equality is quite a
thing when you do in lots of ETL
processing you want to know that the
data in your sources is the same is
essentially the same data as you show in
your report finally after all the
processing has been done and Kyoto does
that you can actually compare the
contents of a dupe file with the
contents of a database table which is
really really helpful hco a loader
another tool what it does well you can
move data from an age-based able to an R
DBMS system and what h2o louder does it
automates all the necessary steps in
between like for instance creating a big
scrape scooping the data to the Oracle
table actually creating the Oracle table
and all you have to do is to fill out a
simple configuration and it does all
that for you bulk starts amazingly
simple it loops through all HBase bilk
interfaces gets around row count and
sends it to a table and you can well you
can see how those bilk interfaces are
doing if there are certain peaks in
there you have to do something about it
and otherwise well everything's fine
finally HBase skin well HBase comes
equipped with with its a rest interface
it turned out so we build a simple
visualization tool on top of that so we
can see the data within the HBase table
and yeah very easy to eat way it's
actually better than ue what what we got
here and all these projects what is the
current status well we got sniff we got
Eddie and books that's currently in
production and Bolcom Kyoto and the h2o
louder are in the final testing stages
HBase skin we already use it but there
is no official production version
available at beaulieu come and that's
actually it that's what I wanted to talk
about this afternoon well it was only 15
minutes so I don't think there's much
time for questions but if you do have
questions please contact me at at this
email address m9 has at ball calm and i
think i'll also be at the bullet calm
booth for the next hour or so so thank
you very much for for your attention and
have nice conference</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
