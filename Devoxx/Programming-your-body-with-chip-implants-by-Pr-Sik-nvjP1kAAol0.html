welcome and thank you so much for having
me
I haven't been to London for a very long
time and I've totally missed everything
that's different between London and
Sweden where I come from
so when I came up from the subway system
a few hours ago I realized you driving
on the other side of the road which
really terrifies me because I'm really
good at jaywalking but I have to I'm not
going to do that for a while when I was
a kid I was maybe five or six years old
my mom used to say that I was special
and I quickly realized that I wasn't
special at all I was just especially to
her a few years later I went to high
school in later college and that teaches
you to say that I was special I wasn't
special at all I was just an average
obnoxious teenager running around and
hallway make me cheat but at the age of
40 I came to I came for the first time
in my life say that I'm not that I'm
special and what makes me special is
this chip implant that I had in my hand
it's tiny it's about 12 millimeters
maybe you in the front row can see it's
12 millimeters long and 2 millimeters
wide and it's a glass capsule that
contains an NFC chip and I can even move
it around little bit
and if you're interested you can come up
afterwards and you can you can scan your
phone if you like and read it or you can
touch it to just move it around a little
bit when I had it
implanted it was in the crevice between
the thumb and index finger but it's a so
I don't really feel it but I have a
habit of actually like by touching it
it's it's quite comfortable and that's
probably why it's been misplaced
so it's I've been wearing it for about
how a year and a half and it slowly
slowly slowly moved up here but I think
it's stabilizing I hope so maybe six
months ago I could even move it three
centimeters which is which is quite
terrible but come up afterwards and have
a look and have a feel so how did this
end up in my hand you might ask and 18
months ago I was at another conference
where biohacking as it's called within
the limelight and they offered workshops
and sessions on biohacking and they even
offered free chip implants on the
exhibition floor and being on the
forefront of Technology I I was I know I
was going to do this I was so excited
and I what I knew I was going to do it I
was even so eager that I ended up first
in line there were many people during
the encounter day but ended up first in
line and the Swedish television was
there covering the story so on the left
side screenshot from the from the news
just before the procedure so that's my
hand on the left on the right side is an
x-ray of his it's a guy called a
monograph star he's the founder of the
the bar hacking community and that's his
hand so I need disclaimer I find this
extremely exciting I'm absolutely sure
that this is going to be the future but
I'm also sure that this is the first way
of hitting us like any other technology
so this is probably gonna
fade away and then it's going to come
again and again so this is just the
first wave hopefully I will live long
enough to to see this happening but I'm
also a bit terrified because this is
just an extension of IOT so this is just
another device in my body that can
collect data what in the future this
could public collect data so that's just
an extension of IIT and if you've been
reading up on IIT you might have heard
about the security issues so that's the
terrifying privacy also a huge problem
you could probably if you come up
afterwards and you have a phone that can
read and write NFC you could you could
write anything you wanted on my hand and
then you can lock it
you can lock the chip implant so I won't
be able to rewrite it but please don't
do that so I think this is exciting and
I think it's terrifying but at the
conference I knew that I was going to do
this but I still had this thought in
back of my head like if it's a good
thing so I spent several hours reading
up on it making sure that this is really
safe for me that this is something I
want to do so I was convinced that this
was a good thing but I still want to
make sure that it was really okay so I
called my wife and I said hey I'm at
this conference
were they offering three chip implants
and my wife in she's in the
pharmaceutical business and she's like
what her response was this
and I want to put this in perspective
like the stupidest study could mean a
lot of things but put this in
perspective you should know that I've
actually bicycles five kilometres on a
busy german highway by accident so you
know if this is the stupidest today you
get point my point with this is that I
think we're both white I think from her
perspective she's working with the
government and FDA this is just crazy
but from my point of view being it just
a simple swing developer it makes sense
but I guess if you want to do this you
will have to read up on it make sure
that you really want to do it and make
the call see what happens here is a
picture of the 64 people accepting the
shipping plan that very day and it
happens to be 64 people not because it's
a good number for developer conference
but it's the amount of impacts you can
do during a day and the conference was
going on for three days but the guy
doing the implants had to leave for a
cyborg conference in Germany so he could
only save one day so 64 people get the
chip implant I know many of these and
had a lot of friends with the chip
implant and only one of them had chosen
to remove the chip and the reason he
removed it was it was that he's doing a
lot of heavy lifting he's out in the
woods student things I don't know and
when he bends his hand it scratches the
bone and that's a little bit
uncomfortable I don't have to tell you
that but if it doesn't feel very nice so
so far I haven't heard of any accidents
or anything it's it's just a glass
capsule in my hand then it's seen but I
have a few use cases I'm going to show
you and we're not talking about NFC chip
implants I'm going to show you some real
things that people have implanted in
their hands and in their heads and the
bodies that's really not proved by that
by the government but it's quite fun so
I'm feeling very safe using this one so
just quickly what is biohacking
and there are two subgroups the first
one is do to serve biology that's where
you do experiments with plants for
example it's been around forever and
I don't know anything about it I'm not
very interesting with that the second
group is what we called grinders and
that's the movement that's that's been
growing the last years and grinders are
usually usually say biohackers you mean
grinders but that's the two subgroups
and grinders insert everything in the
bodies as you would see a few weeks ago
I was I was on my way to another
conference to speak of biohacking and my
mom texted me asking what are you doing
it she didn't know that I was going to
conference and I said while I'm going to
this conference to speak um biohacking
and I didn't expect her to know anything
about it she's getting old but better
she answered me in a text saying that I
listened to a way to show for an hour
last last night on biohacking
so she's been catching up she knew
everything or by hacking mouse' whoa
impressive
and she texted me again saying I mean I
totally understand that this is the
future this is this is going to be
magical
I understand what you can do with it and
then she texted again and I can't
believe that all you have to do is
insert the clip and I'm like a clip
really so she's been listening to radio
show for an hour and has you've been
hearing a clip instead of chip so you
know it's it's not a clip we're not
gonna insert Clips you know you know hex
that was I didn't tell her about it
sliding corrector so the next time she's
having dinner with a friend they're
going to discuss the kit if you're
interested in getting a chip like this
there are two ways you can do it in
Sweden we have a in Sweden we have a
growing community biohacking in Sweden
is really huge and there is even have
something that are called chip implant
parties so they announce the party you
go there they will give you a session on
biohacking and then they will offer you
implants the cost is usually around 100
Z 200 euros I'm not sure if that's
possible around here the other way is go
do dangerous things calm and buy one of
these implant packs it contains
everything you need
contains the syringe plastic gloves
everything you need except someone doing
it and I wouldn't suggest that that to
do it yourself because it's if you've
been donating blood
you know the needle is quite it's quite
big so you should you should go to
someone else
and when I say someone else I don't mean
a doctor you can go to doctor that will
probably refuse you because they have
something called the ethical code and
you can try a vet as well but I have the
same code so you should probably go to a
piercer bottom of modification artist
they will do so two ways the cost are
both one of these packages and I think
it's around a 100 250 euros there are
two types of chip you can insert today
it's RFID that's been around for a long
time and it's usually what you do what
you use when you have entrance systems
see if you want to get access to your
office you can insert an RFID tag you
can just swap your hand open the door
and then there's NFC that I'm wearing
and is usually used for smart cards like
when you go to the cube go to the gym
that's usually NFC it's close range
so you have to come up you have to be
really close to read it it could be
problem reading my chip together if you
have a phone you would have to stay here
for a while we're really testing it at
the conference there was one guy who
couldn't decide so if it won't chip in
each ant that's also possibility it's
passive there is no battery there's no
Wi-Fi
it's just NFC in a glass capsule but
that's going to change I will show you
that I use the tool called NFC tools Pro
we can download it it's available and
all I'm not sure about iris and you can
write me whatever you want to do
whatever you want to the chip I've
chosen to leave my right my my business
card so if you swipe your phone
afterwards you will get my business card
so that's the basics of biohacking it's
NFC it's in your hand and it's it's it's
really not that interesting yes
so I'm going to show you other things
that you can do with it and we're going
to start by discussing the things people
are doing today and then we're going to
go into the future and discuss what
could be possible so we started today
and the winner is tomorrow that might be
50 years 100 years I don't know
so the first of all you can just open
your phone that's pretty easy Android
has something called smart lock and you
can pair your phone with advice so you
can see that I have a Volvo I have a Kia
car and have something called my hand
that is a trusted device that's obvious
in my hand so I can just swipe my hand
to unlock my phone I'm not sure if
that's useful but it's pretty funny this
is my friend Hanna's Ferb Lord he's one
of the leading bio hackers in Sweden is
part of the movement and this is him
getting to selfies he's quite happy
so if you get a chip you will be happy
so that's probably the most common use
case for the chicken glance just opening
doors and it's critical then there is
NFC enabled locks on the right side you
see just a lock that you can use for
your bike or a locker room or whatever
on the left side it's a little bit more
advanced lock that you can put in your
home so you can actually throw throw
away your keys and just use your hands
to open the door here's another Swedish
biohacker and there's and he's been
collaborating with SAS a line company
and the mission was to get on board an
airplane without showing his boarding
cart once so every time the ask was born
card he could just swipe his hand and he
was on the plane they have a if you're a
gold member they have a this gold card
that is NFC enabled and you can just use
your hand instead he told me to tell you
that this is not available
you can you know the next time taking a
sales flight you can't just ask them to
like hold your hand it's just for him
it's the proof of concept but it shows
the possibilities of NFC in your hand
they've been doing the same kind of
collaboration with the subway system in
Stockholm so they're going to gain
access to the super system just right in
their hand it's the same thing it's just
NFC you just need to ask the subway
owner to to prove your ID that you
stored on your chip a little interesting
perhaps it's friend of mine Patrick so
they've been doing some custom software
and custom hardware and then they went
on the web and that purchase something
and the page using Bitcoin and authorize
the payment by swiping his hand again so
it's all about identification so that's
the basics the basic thing we can do
today it's a it's real about
identification you identify yourself as
someone like you swipe your cards so now
we're leaving the comfort zone so for
every use case I'm going to show you it
will be depending on what you think it
will be better or worse
or more terrifying so here's another
biohacker
his name is well he said he want to
achieve night vision so I dripped the
kind of a cellulose substance into his
eyeballs and eyeballs then he waited for
me I think it was twenty minutes until
it was absorbed by the eyeball and the
when I then went outside in the night
and it was asked to pick out fifty
people hiding in the surrounding and it
picked out every one of them compared to
test group that didn't do this and I
could only pick out twenty people out of
fifty so successfully achieved night
vision I should also tell you that I
read the report and twenty days
afterwards he was back to normal so no
injuries they're doing the inserting
magnetic implants in the fingertips I'm
not really sure why you would do this
but I've read on I've read to use cases
where it might be useful the first one
was someone walking around in York City
and suddenly they felt this tingling
sensation in their fingertips and they
did some research and I currently they
it appeared that they've been walking
across some kind of electrical junction
of subway system underneath so they
could pick that up if you need to know
that the other use case is someone doing
it was a some kind of geology student
and they were in Tanzania doing some
kind of a job there and he could
actually pick out the mat the amount of
iron in the soil but you're swiping his
hands and see how much stuck to his hand
and he told you in the report that he's
been walking around just doing this fun
and they were actually able to find
places where they wouldn't think of
looking it wasn't for him but again I'm
not sure I wouldn't do it I'm pretty
satisfied with this one the next case is
echolocation so that's the sound system
the bats and dolphins use to navigate so
they send out some kind of ultrasonic
sound that is reflected on the objects
around them and when it gets back they
can see where the objects are where
they're moving and the size of
so this is a weekly and he want to
recreate that and the reason is that
he's going blind so he needs some kind
of and a way to navigate so you can
recreate education and if you look at
the image on the right side so what it
is
he bought this ultrasonic rangefinder
and it put it on on his stomach and then
it plugs in the three-and-a-half
millimeter Jack so all the sound
information will be transported to the
transmitter where it's amplified by the
battery and then we go into the coil
that he's wearing around his neck and
what happens when you have electricity
going back and forth in a coil like that
well it will emit an electromagnetic
field and if you look closely on the
left side that's his air obviously you
can see a protrusion right there that's
another magnet that is implanted very
close to his inner ear so the magnet
will respond to the electromagnetic
field going in and out just like sound
would so you can go around being blind
hearing things with this device that's
pretty cool a question why would you do
this you could just as well have used
earphones and it guesses
huh yeah that's one reason the other
reason is that being a biohacker how
much fun would it be I mean this is
obviously more fun so I'm not sure I
haven't read any news on him
so I don't think he will have a crystal
clear like sound image of everything but
hopefully we'll be able to detect some
of the obstacles around him here's
another guy it's always a guy and he's
really tired of these earphones that
were using the Bluetooth earphones they
are getting smaller but I still pretty
clumsy and they don't look good
so he is thinking why can't we just
impact the same thing next to air so
he's having a so what he did is he had
bought the smallest earpiece he can find
and then he removed the cover so what
you what you're looking at there is just
the necessary parts and then he bought
there is a battery and also added an a
bomb conductor she can actually hear as
well and then it's going to coat this in
some fire safe cover and insert it next
to this air so that means that what he
fig is that it the skin is light enough
that the sound will actually go through
right there so he can just speak and it
will be picked up and the bone conductor
will just do the rest so you can
actually set an alarm at 6 o'clock in
the morning and no one will hear it
except himself he can also walk around
in middle of the city just speaking with
someone but you won't see anything it
will just be him I'm not sure if that's
a good thing
do you see anything on the image that
looks suspicious except the coin that's
not going to be included obviously the
coin is just for measurement but do you
see anything that it might be suspicious
what the battery um I'm not sure if you
read about the Samsung incident so I'm
I'm really not sure this is a good idea
and the last thing I read on his blog
and it was actually the last thing is
don't do don't do these I'm going to be
the test person to this and then there
were no updates but I'm but I'm sure it
was good
another thing that it's I'm not sure how
he's going to solve it but you have to
charge this and it's it's like the
induction you some kind of induction to
charge the battery but have you charged
a toothbrush how long does that take
forever
yes so he would have to walk around with
the charges his head or maybe he will
have one in his pillow or something I
don't know but this is not a perfect
case yeah yeah so in the future it's
going to be possible to have battery for
a long time yes just a quick question
how many of you would have a chip
implant I'm not going to force you just
a it's just a question so few of you how
many of you would use is mm maybe a
couple in the back how many of you we
did this it's actually an arm and what
you're seeing is I'm going to explain
this is but it's the size of the tackle
cards and it was implanted in a again a
cyborg conference in Germany I'm pretty
sure that the two was there before so
this is this is the Chikara and it's a
device that was made only for him so
there's a company doing this it's really
not approved by the government but
they've been working on this one for a
very long time and it's capable of
picking up temperature and I think blood
pressure as well
but the temperature is the key here so
it can pick up the temperature and
transmit it to mobile phone and is using
the two things the first one is his
temperature is is is transmitted to the
mobile phone that is then connected to
his home so he will depending on which
room he is and his body temperature the
the temperature will be adjusted in his
room which is pretty cool but that's not
the reason why we like this the the
second use case is this device is
actually capable of doing some simple
processing and when it thinks when he
thinks that he's about to get a fever
it was send an alert so if the
temperature is slowly rising he would be
notified before actually knowing this
and the reason I really like this I
think about it what if we could have
implants that were just a millimeter
they were capable of doing this you can
actually get information of when you're
about to get sick and just this is
temperature think about all the other
things we can do with this he it was
designed to stay in his own for 108 days
and it was battery constrained he took
it out after 90 days and there were two
reasons batteries he ran out of battery
and he was also getting a excited
attacks which makes sense one thing
that's been bothering me again I had a
question for you this is an American guy
genius in a cyber conference in Germany
how that how the heck did he get home I
haven't been able to find the answer to
the questions I've been in space wearing
this and going through security life
it's a no-brainer this is just glass in
some NFC but that one I had no idea so
but I'm gonna
I might have to email him and ask maybe
good luck in Germany well he they had it
remove his home program
here's another guy is suffering from
chronic cluster headaches which is
terrible and is implanted this a neuro
stimulator in his brain
and it's remote control so whenever he's
hit by one of these cluster headaches he
can just turn it on and they won't
stimulate his brain which is pretty cool
he had it removed because he was also
suffering from panic attacks but I think
the reason you get panic attacks from
wearing these things is knowing that
you're alone is real only you doing it
but if everyone was wearing a thing like
this then maybe would be okay and
especially if we know that it was
authorized to roll approved by the by
the government or wearing things like
this is like it's a bit scary I guess so
now it gets more interesting so this is
a LA based company called kernel and if
you're out running or bicycling and
you're in an accident then you hit your
head there is a chance that you would
have a hard time remembering things and
it has some kind of degenerative disease
like Alzheimer's you will it will start
to forget things and I'm not an expert
but very simple it's a you have a part
of the brain that is responsible for
short-term memory and then you have a
partner is responsible for the long term
memory and in between is stable campus
and when you hit your brain the
hippocampus might be being broken in
some way
so that's figured why can't we just try
to map the patterns being sent from
short-term memory to long-term memory
and if we can do that maybe we can you
can recreate the process we can just
insert some kind of computer instead of
the compass to help us remember now you
might think that this is crazy how many
of you think it's crazy
more than five don't be shy this is
really during the brain inserting at
some kind of computer in your brain but
the thing is this is a day under FDA and
trial so the FDA is about to prove this
and once they prove it it will be
available to doctors to insert it's
considered safe which is extremely
interesting
my only concern here is will we be able
to say okay so we're going to help
people with injuries or some kind of
disease are we going to stop there but
we know from history that if there's a
possibility we're going to take it so
why won't we implant this in every human
so in the future might not be able to
forget that's that's terrifying there
are things in my life that I want forget
like the bike analogy a highway but it
is coming so this might be in the future
a few years from now
Bionic guys there are two companies
working with this so they have actually
the second successfully hijacked optical
nerve and supplying people people who
could see in the beginning so the brain
knows how to process images so you have
to see you have to be able to see in the
future you were born but then you've
gone blind you can actually put a camera
instead of the eye and you can send
images to the optical nerve so you can
see some kind of grayscale this is not
the 4k display this is like very
grayscale but again it's it's it's
interesting what if we can have this
what about I mean night vision optical
zoom and we can see all the the entire
color spectrum and again this might
sound like okay this is just crazy but
there are two companies doing this and
they are also under FDA investigation or
trial and once they succeed this might
be something we can use it's probably
going to take
sometime but it's around the corner this
is professor Warwick I think it's based
somewhere in the UK and his he's been
doing this kind of biohacking for ages
and he's really really good at this so
what you're seeing here is his hand and
he's inserted like a measure
interceptors they intercepted everything
is gone that's going back and forth in
his hand and then on the left side you
see a mechanical hand and he's been able
to link them by a computer so when he's
doing this movement and the category arm
will do the same so so it's mimic
they're doing exact same things they're
able to understand what's happening in
or the the signals going back and forth
if I was him I would be very happy doing
that just that but he he wanted more so
he went home and asked his wife to do
the same procedure and then then they
were trying to link the two hands
together and he said that he couldn't
control his wife on wives arm which is
good I guess but they could have a
hearing he had this again this stinging
sensation whenever she was moving her
hand so the signal went through but he
couldn't control the hand so that's a
we're getting there so acute challenges
a few things we'll have to solve to make
this happen in the future
the first one is batteries we don't want
to have batteries we need some kind of
energy harvesting your technology and
the first consume comes to mind is just
body temperature
maybe we can reuse that so we don't need
batteries we need something else than
NFC we need can't be passive
we need tiny computers that's another
thing we have to solve
we need connectivity not Wi-Fi something
else
Lukas is really it's really not good
enough
I'm thinking long range so if you go
into a store to buy something
it could pick this up that's the kind of
range of thinking we also make sure that
this is a stationary
I don't want thousand of thousands of
these moving around in my bodies it has
to be stationary and it has to be
extremely small likely mirrors not even
that but we're getting there and maybe
10 15 20 years now we're going to have
the technology to make this happen
so what if we had all that or could we
do and I have this is we're going to
tomorrow and I have a use case that I
think that we would see so so I have a
kid I'm thinking when he's having a kid
or he's having it his kid is having kids
so 50 years from now perhaps imagine
okay so imagine my son or one of your
kids
the second they becoming parents
themselves so they at the hospital they
just gave birth they're happy
the doctor will probably pick up the kid
and do the usual check you know ten toes
nine fingers
10 to 10 fingers and then they're going
to go back to the parent and then going
to ask do you want the standard upgrade
and they're going to say yes obviously
and then the doctor will insert against
thousands of these microchips in the
body everywhere this is going to be in
the lungs might be in the heart might be
in the brain everywhere and then we'll
go fast forward maybe 30 years and
something happens in the body maybe
there is something happening with you
know in a specific part say there's a
abnormal amount of cells being created
so we're talking about cancer we could
pick that up and since we have the
connectivity we can just transmit that
message to a doctor that will respond
and the response might even be like fix
this you don't even have to know about
it if it's in the future I know but it's
it's it might happen and I wouldn't mind
doing that I think that's the reason I
do this because I really think that
could happen and there would be a huge
benefit again I'm not this Tao
the problems we have to have to solve
like security and privacy but I think
this is going to happen this makes me
really happy so we're talking about long
and happy lives we can actually live
longer and you know that they think
they're guessing that the average age of
children today is going to be hundred
years and the first kid is going to be
200 years is already born and I'm not
sure if that's a good thing maybe we
maybe we were not destined to be 300
years old or we have to we have to see
what it means how many of you who have
heard of neural is it's been in use it's
how many of you have heard of Ellen
muskie he's behind this and the problem
here is that whenever he says this can
do something actually succeeds so Newell
ace is he's concerned about AI that's
the problem is trying to solve because
AI is going to be it's going to be
superior so we're going to be like text
to AI in the future and he's really
concerned about that and his solution is
the neural ace and it's basically just a
measure and deceptive around a brain
picking up every signal going in and out
and he's proposing that we could just
expose an API from a brain that we can
connect to the computer so we would have
direct access to everything the AI knows
so we would be part of the air or the AI
would be part of us a bit scary and that
I think it started a company around this
and he's working on it I think it has
other he has other things to do as well
but uh but this is one of the things is
working on so as soon as is put Gabriel
marks
this is business next thing so I think
it's a I think it's a bright future and
scary both questions
maybe have on their fourth of the things
today is overpowering weak back that
means that moment of England is very
dear to me
yes so how do we upgrade I've absolutely
no idea I don't know how to do that
that's going to be an obvious problem
yes so I'm not sure what I'm going to do
with this there's actually a new type
coming that it's this there's a new type
of chip coming that is javacard enabled
and javacard is we'll be using in the
credit cards so I'm thinking about
upgrading but I would mean that I would
take this out and put in a new one I'm
not super front of that throat butter
so yeah upgrades can be a big problem
yes
yeah yeah sure so exactly the guy
embarking on the aircraft exactly so you
can just read his kit and then go on the
airplane so we have serial security yeah
that's what we're working on right now
in the back how again so problem with
the the insurance medical insurance I
haven't tested it yet um I'm not sure I
guess it depends I think that in Sweden
you're pretty safe doesn't matter what
to do because you're covered but I know
that you know other places won't be as
like accepting and I know the biohacking
is forbidden in certain states in the
United States for example so and I'm not
sure what happens if you actually go get
a cheaper than hurt yourself
and again what happens if I'm in a car
accident and my hand is injured and the
glass capsule is broken what would that
mean with them there with the care of it
but it would be the consequences would
be terrible yes
so again it's a privacy and security and
so in a in a not so bad future this
could actually be used to control people
you mean if we implant thousand of these
and and the government gets control of
them that might be from
yeah
so again it's a bit about privacy and
other governments that are not like
Sweden that's going to be huge problem
and I think you don't have to look at
other countries if you look at Sweden
if implants like the Jakarta that was
measuring temperature what if this the
insurance company got hold of that
information they can actually raise the
cost of insurance if they see that you
have some kind of a temperature issue so
and what if everyone want to get your
data it's about privacy and you have to
protect your data so yes there is a
future that is not so bright as well so
we shouldn't be like we should not do
this we should actually think about it
and again I think this is the first wave
and yeah so some things are too
dangerous absolutely but I think if you
look at history we're really bad at not
doing bad things so if there's an
opportunity that might ending cares will
actually I take it I mean that's the
that's how we are as humans
unfortunately so I think that this is I
think the best way forward is to
actually investigate and then maybe say
no that's also not turned it but it is
really hard yes
yes yeah I think so yeah I think we're
going to be able to replace most of our
bodies in the future yes
yes so there are other problems so what
happens if you use a bug it's not the
same thing Eddings is using the
bargaining in a swing application it's a
little bit more severe and again it's
you know it's not enough testing it a
little bit longer we have to have
something else in place to actually make
sure that it works again again I can
hear ya
so you can't upgrade so you will have
the bug forever now that will be
terrible so we need to we need a way to
so if you have all these sensors they
must be able to communicate so there
would be some kind of exit point that we
have the way where you have that like
the Wi-Fi and they would be able to
communicate so there shouldn't be a part
of the mesh that is unreachable but
again I it's I don't know how to do that
it's really tricky yes
is there a
nope this is a this is done in the
basement so there's really nothing going
on there and I don't think that any
government will approve it today because
it's really just starting out so now
ethics know people are just it's like a
heart people are really oh this is so
cool see we can do with it and I think
that that's an area with making or have
to think about ethics as well and this
might lead to keeping people in Sweden
for example that can afford this will be
technologically technologically advanced
compared to other countries that that
doesn't make sense it should be for
everyone we have more questions okay
just just articles so it's not open
source or anything no weird one in the
back somewhere yeah
like wearables on the outside yes people
are looking at that as well so it's kind
of it's part of the biohacking community
no no and it makes sense to do it I mean
if you can avoid putting things in our
bodies that would be so much better so
that is absolutely yes payments I think
it was a new chip coming that is gel car
enabled it's just a matter of replacing
every ATM ATM in the world I mean we
could we could actually do it because
the Java card contains security and
encryption so it's it's it's the same as
going with your so if we don't it won't
used ATM but you actually just swipe
your hands in one of the car waiters you
could probably do that but I'm not sure
if anyone would actually write the data
to your hand that's the problem so none
of the proprietary systems will allow
you to use your hand but but it would be
possible yeah so Java ConAgra chip is
supposed to be R in 2017 I spoke with
them and they said beginning of 2017 I
haven't heard anything so but it's
around the corner yes
yes or no I think people interesting
both but people doing the biohacking are
just inserting cybernetic devices but
it's there is an overlap absolutely
and maybe nanotechnology is actually a
better way to go it might be the case
but it still it still it still so new
and it's just tiny group doing this like
it's a couple of hundred in Sweden so
it's really just get started
one more question okay thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
