going to talk about the invalidation -
but before that a little bit about bean
validation one who uses Ben validation
one already
okay I'll might show you some features
you you know don't know about yet so you
know I just wanted to do a quick a quick
you know getting started bit before so
yes I was saying we're gonna do a bit
bit of a refresh on being validation and
then we're gonna discuss what's coming
in bean validation to who's there is
already an early draft with an actual
implementation and the TCK and the spec
and this is supposed to go final for
July something like that and I'm gonna
let you know enough time to discuss and
so that you can give me feedback on what
I've described and I'll pass along the
feedback to the to the expert group so
my name is Emmanuel Barnard I'm
essentially an open source guy since I
don't know 2001 or something like that
so pretty much everything I I card is
actually done in open source I've done a
lot of work in the hibernate project so
not only the object relational mapper
but also validate or which is the what
we're going to describe here in some
fashion and I used to be the spec lead
of bean validation but I passed along
the baton to someone else but I still a
you know an active expert group member
member and one of the big feature we're
going to describe is actually you know
I've been heavily involved in it and I'm
a freshly minted Java Thompson so I'm
using the title for the first time and
when I'm not coding fully in the
open-source communities acting as
platform architect for what we call the
data platform at reddit which involves
several products so the persistence of
the application server but also a
distributed that agreed and a few of the
things so if you have questions about
that we can also expand
so what is being validation well instead
of actually you know explaining that on
slides I'll actually do a demo and you
know use it and show it live one thing I
will not show live is the integration
with the UI side of things so there is a
nice integration with JSF from quite a
while ago but also lots of the web
frameworks you know wicked spring MVC
etc etc interestingly there is also
integration with fully client-side web
framework like angular and they actually
go and look at the constraints we
expressed and they actually apply them
on the client side so you know just girl
bean validation and angular and you'll
find that and in the demo there is a
branch were going to push in the
repository that will show exactly that
oops getting ahead of myself
okay let's let's have a look at the demo
but first how does it look like so this
one this one this is a hiking
application that actually describe hikes
so I want to go from this place to that
place and there are similar sections
because I might not be able to do
everything in one day and for a given
hike there is actually trip
recommendation that I can subscribe to
so this one is organized by me
partly well did organized there is a
sitting price and then I can say hey I'm
interesting in joining that that hike
and I'm placing an order and then you
see that order on the on the system so
relatively simple here if we look at the
application that's that's a Java EE
application that uses not only hibernate
or M for the ordering side of things so
the order and the customer has to CD to
it and so on is actually stored in a
relational database but just to make it
fun some of the other properties like
hike and sections and the trip are
actually stored in in a MongoDB database
using I Burnett OGM so we
Jaypee API but we stole that I know no
SQL database the Mongo is actually run
here inside the docker container and
I've got my wildfly app server also
running that was demoing the the app so
what's interesting here is that I've got
my ike entity which happens to have a
native query that is actually a MongoDB
query by the way but the rest is pretty
generic but what we wanted to add is
make sure that the start and the
destination is never known so I put not
null annotation here an annotation which
is described by the invalidation spec
itself if we go into an another object
here I've got customer and I want to
make sure the email is not just a random
string but an actual email so I'll use
the add email annotation in this case
it's not spot not of the bean validation
spec but that's an extension that the
hibernate validator reference
implementation provides so here I'm
saying hey that's not a regular email
it's string it's an actual email and
what I'm saving is an order object so
how do I validate the customer why when
I validate the order object I use the
add valid annotation here which says ok
when you find and validate an order
object please go and validate the
Associated customer and in this case the
add email annotation here okay so that
that's interesting already there is like
default annotations and then specific
extensions by hibernate validator but
that would be pretty limiting limited
unless you could actually write your own
an annotation and constraint so here
I've already pre written d and the
constraint it's called order number and
it will enforce the fact that the order
number is not a random string but an
actual structure string if I look at the
annotation here it's got three
properties attributes sorry the message
which can be internationalized by the
way so here our message will sorry our
order number will be a UUID essentially
a list of groups so which lets us select
split constraint into
groups so you can validate a subgroup or
another or two groups and so on it lets
you be much more flexible and then a
payload which we won't describe here
I've also created another annotation
which is essentially essentially an
array of the order number under the
annotation and it's to be able to put
more than one order number on a given
property and what's important here is we
need to look at the target to be able to
put the property on the order here if
this is a field it could have been a
getter so I need to be able to target
the method and the field target from her
from a Java point of view we also target
a notation type because we can compose
constraint into a more complex
constraints and hynny read some of the
actual validation of simpler constraints
constructor might be a bit more
interesting so what you can do actually
with constructor and parameter is
literally go and validate the parameters
of a method being cold or constructor
being cold and then the return value in
this case the new object by the
constructor or the return value of the
method can also be covilhã dated and you
can put constraints on them we will have
an example of all of that using the
jax-rs integration for example type C is
actually a new thing in in Java 8 that
we're going to explore in bean
validation too so I'm getting a little
bit ahead of myself here but that's just
a regular annotation so what makes this
annotation an actual constraint you
I know take the annotation with
constraint and you say ok the actual
implementation that will make sure that
an object is is valid is this one so I'm
going to point to our number of
validator
which is here in this case it's a nested
class but you can put it everywhere as
just for convenience here and what's
important is you need to implement the
constraint validate or contract which
has two methods it says I can initialize
myself based on the annotation so for
example if you have
and marks you've got a mean value and a
max value so that's why you would store
that kind of information
in our case the order number doesn't
have any specific property so you will
probably ignore that one and the second
one is actually receiving the value and
saying yes it's valid and no it's not
valid or no it's not valid so if if we
go back here to the actual
implementation where is it it's here we
need to write the is valid constraint
and what we look at when we look at
constraint validator it says accepting
order number as an annotation as a
constraint and IMAX accepting the type
string if I want it to also accept a
type number or an integer I could
actually have several implementation
validate or implementation and had them
here as an array of classes okay so I
could actually use a reg X to try and
validate this UID but I'll do it the
old-fashioned way so the first thing you
need to do is if the value is null then
we need to say that it's valid why do we
do that
it's because it's actually clearer and
makes more sense to actually put a at
not null annotation here saying okay
it's an order number and it should never
be null and if I want an order number
that might be nola just use the order
number annotation okay may remove it go
back to order number so and then I need
to say say it's true here and then I
need to put my constraint to say okay if
something goes wrong here it might not
be valid valid so if the value length is
not what I expect
so the length should be 8 plus the dash
plus 4 plus the dash plus 4 plus the
dash plus 4 plus the dash plus 12 I
guess I could have factored it a bit
more I'll return force using the context
API here I could actually go deeper and
provide a custom error saying of
for that reason I will fail but I won't
go into that that detail here it's a
very powerful API by the way you can
explore if you are writing your own
custom constraints and maybe I also
would want to check that the character
at 8 is if it's different than a - then
I probably should also return force and
so on and so on ok so we've got a
constraint the actual validation logic
of the constraints we put that
constraint on an object the next step
for us is to actually go and call
explicitly the validation API to be fair
so I don't know for people that use bean
validation I don't know if you actually
use explicitly the bean validation API
or if you let other system call it but
by default we've got very nice
integration at key lifecycle events with
other specifications and other projects
so when you're about to validate an
entity in JPA we go on korban validation
where JSF is about to store new
properties into an object we also make
sure it's valid and so on same for
spring MVC and whatnot so in many ways
all of the validation happens thanks to
the integration with other frameworks
but you can of course explicitly called
the validator API so let me stop
whitefly for a second here because I'm
gonna run a unit test in this case I
used the quillion integration tests
which will literally started wildfly
from scratch deploy this stuff and that
that's described here essentially and
then call this test and this test is
essentially a beam like a CDI beam so
I'm injecting the validator and I could
inject the validator directly in a CDI
bin I could actually write I mean create
a validator and boot it from scratch
we'll have an example later but in Java
EE it's already there and ready for me
so if we look at the example here the
order has an order number that is
invalid and then the customer is
actually has an incorrect email right so
we should get to error
when trying to validate the order so we
do validate all that validate pass the
order object and whoops assuming I put
it come at the right places and I'm
essentially done that's how you validate
things and what you get out of it is a
set of constraint violations that might
be knurl or might not be known and from
those violations I can do a few things I
can get a constraint descriptor which
explains to me what kind of constraint
was being validated so in the case of
order number I would get the order
number annotation attributes like the
message payload and whatnot the group's
I could get the actual invalid value I
could get the actual message being
displayed and so on and so on so there's
a lot of interesting property I can get
out of it right now maybe we aren't only
interested in displaying them so system
or print with that Java 8 by the way ok
so I'm always playing with it because I
you know I tend to forget those new
syntax it's um you know playing with it
at the moment the other thing we're
going to do is make sure that our
assertion is correct so we should have
two violations in to that set right so
the size should be two so let me run the
test which will literally start while
fly and validate the information here
okay so we see so it's a probably a bit
too small for here no that's not the
right one sorry two two two two so it's
starting we see the two errors that I
was displaying so that's the
system.out.println that I was doing
system.out.println sorry it's is the
constraint violation object I you know
the email is not well formed and the
UUID is not you know properly applied
and the test is passing successfully so
I'm good to go so that's using
explicitly the API but it would be
interesting when I'm actually using
entering the system via in this case
jax-rs to actually go and validate the
other number when I try to create an
order before I do that let me restart
while flying and let me call the actual
order original so it's a it's a Jack's
arrest entry so no hold on I'm not
getting the right one okay I should be
better there you go so this is a
resource at slash orders and then I can
post JSON representation of on my order
and then the order will be actually
created using JP and whatnot okay so
before I do anything if I try to
validate this object if I try to pass an
order that is invalid I will go through
the system some here I'm calling the
using HTTP HTTP client call I'm calling
the actual API that we were describing
and I'm trying to create a new order
with an invalid email okay and what I
get as a result is an HTTP 200 ok so
that's not good and the order is
actually created in the system what do I
need to do to actually make sure that
these other objects that I receive here
is actually validated because although
are some constraints applied on it
it's very simple just just you the ad
valid so it means what K when I'm
calling that method
please propagate the validation
verification to each of to this
parameter and calling order please
validate the order number and then a
customer email to it and that's it
it should work let's give it a try
I need to deploy the new version of the
application it's really ployed and if I
run again my script here I've got a
different I've got a bad request which
makes sense because I was calling jax-rs
with an improper order to be created so
it caused comes back to me and say I'm
sorry you've got some problem with your
request and the in the body you actually
get the interesting you know violation
information this is not a well-formed
email address the value that I was
providing and also the path so I'm
calling method create order and on the
parameter order
I'm validating customer email right so
you got the pass exactly to the error so
you could have a link between your
client side this error display display
and the actual server side error that is
coming from from it okay that's all I
wanted to show you as far as the the
bean validation one so let's move on to
bean validation to essentially we did
bean validation to because of Java 8
they were we were happy with the set of
features of bean validation 1.1 you can
always add stuff but you know you've got
to see the trade-off but Java 8 came
with interesting new features that we
are making use of the first one is
repeatable annotations if we go back to
our code example here if you remember
order number I had a list sub nested
annotation that essentially let me put
more than one order number on the on a
given property because you by default in
priority Java edge you couldn't put more
than one
a no annotation of the same type in an
untreated the workaround was to create a
list annotation that was essentially an
array of order number so here you would
say order number and then maybe have a
different group I don't know procedure
eight I'm cheating a bit yeah I don't
have any specific group created there
you go you can make that much nicer in
Java eight just by using the add
repeatable annotation and you literally
point to the list annotation so please
point to the container that is
containing a list of order numbers and
from now on in order I can simplify this
code by just saying that order number
and then group I okay so it's much nicer
much more readable well in this case
doesn't really make sense but you get
the gist so that was a simple add-on
easy that requires us to move to a v2
because we are only compatible with Java
8 and later not to Java 7
the other big that's probably the the
biggest feature of bean validation 2 is
validating collections so what do you
have when you have a collections like
that a property that is a collection of
string in a in an object what can you do
as far as validation well you can make
sure that the collection is limited in
size and precise number so in this case
the I can only have as much as 10 names
and then there is an error if I go
beyond but what if I want to put some
constraint on the actual each of the
lemon of the element of this collection
well remember the type use target that
was described on order number if I go
back there type use here it essentially
means you can put and this annotation
inside the pointy brackets so in inside
the type parameters
so here what we're saying is not only is
the least limited to ten elements but
each element of the list must be of
maximum of size 50 and then it must pass
the specific ragged pattern in this case
only alphabetical characters so it's
much more natural to you know put the
constraint here and we resisted for to
provide some kind of workaround prior to
Java eight because it really felt
awkward and the annotation system wasn't
supporting it super well in this case it
becomes natural so we enabled that
feature
remember cascading so you can say ok
when you validate this object also
validate all of the entries inside list
for example inside this collection so in
this example please validate every
single address in the list but knowing
that we can put stuff inside the pointy
bracket it actually makes more sense to
say please validate each element address
of that list and that's really the new
preferred syntax we will keep support
for the old one for backward compatible
fashion but the new syntax and the
previous syntax is the second one and
it's not only a preference that actually
enables some interesting things if we
look at map map has a key and has a
value and we had to make a choice in the
bean validation 1.1 and we said ok when
you put a constraint or when you put a
add cascade add valid on a map we will
go and validate each of the values we
couldn't say also validate the key so we
made a bit of a world best default
default choice with the new approach we
can actually let you either validate the
key or cascade validation on the key or
cascade validation on the value or both
or you know it's really up to you and
you really have the choice in this case
I'm cascading validation on the key
which is the common object and I'm also
validating with actual values the actual
constraint the value which is an integer
okay
so collections work like that so it's
actually any terrible plus the map but
there is also this new object which is
called optional in Java 8 and you can
also put a constraint on it so we called
those kind of object containers in bean
validation too so you've got collections
which contains more than one object
you've got map which contains two types
of objects and then optionally which
actually contains a single object and
you can put the constraint in there it
also works for Java effects I don't know
if you guys use Java effects but you can
use the property of type string for
example and put constraint in there or
any of the sub type like string property
forgot integer property and whatnot so
that's interesting because you've got
support for iterable i've got support
for map we've got support for optional
what about other types of containers
well in good bean validation fashion we
decided to make it a generic system and
that's what that's what took us so long
to actually get that feature in a proper
shape because we really wanted to be
able to for libraries to be able to
actually express custom containers and
let extract the information and put
constraint on them so probably the one
you will most likely use is Google guava
which not only has subclass of
collections of Java collection but also
has some specific type that are not
really collections but even beyond the
actual Java language you Scala's its own
collection models selling as its own
collection models so we also want that
API to be supported by by book in the
example here we've got a guava table
which is essentially a spreadsheet if
you think about it it's got a row column
and actual value so here the row is of
type year the column is of type string
and then I'm putting a constraint on the
value but it's the blob as far as being
validation is concerned so we need a
logic that knows about this table and be
able to extract this integer and so that
we can validate them and if we got an
error on this in
we should have something like that
revenue per year and category for the
value at the key 2017 of the and food
and then you know display the arrow and
so on so let's see how you can implement
that if we start from this object which
has the the table as a property and we
want to validate the row we want to
validate the column we put some
constraints on them
and we also want to validate the values
so let's start with the value and I've
added a companion class which is called
self key which will represent the
combination of a given row and a given
column so 2017 a was was an example of
food sorry was an example it's a simple
stuff that gets the Rakhi the column key
and also as a special to string that
displays the Rakhi and column key with
parties around them okay let's implement
what is called an extractor for to the
row 14 validation so table row extractor
make it bigger and then I need to
implement something called a value X
Factor and the value extractor except a
given type in this case it's a guava
table had it there you go
and guava table as three january types
and we need to tell bin validation which
elements where we want to validate in
this case we want to actually in let's
not extract the row but extract the
value if i can rename this refactor or
rename
okay so the value is the third element
here and I'm going to add the extracted
value so that's going to point to the
type that is being extracted from the
object so this implementation should
extract the value out of that table
container and then of course I need to
implement a specific method which is
extract value so I get the table passed
as a parameter and I need to return all
of the values inside inside that table
so I'm going to do original so original
value let's keep playing with new Java 8
stuff so I get each of the cell which is
the role column and then value and then
for each of them I'm going to have a
cell and I'm going to do something about
it
what should I do so I'm going to code
the receiver and I'm said okay I've got
an entry based on a key and I'm going to
give you the key information to access
that entry so it's a kid value here's
the table I guess that's the logical
name of the node the key will be the row
and column but that's why I created the
key the new cell key that to represent
this actual cell Roky and cell column
key as a single object so that's that's
a node name that's the key entry and
then the last one I need to return is
the actual value so that's the cell gate
value
okay and I've got literally the
extraction so for each entry for each
cell in the system I'll say here is the
value bean validation please go and
validate that so that's what the guava
guys are going to implement if they want
to support bean validation and being
able to be extracted so that's how to
extract the value if you want to extract
the column for example already
implemented it so here the big
difference is well the name is different
and then the extracted value points to
the actual column type and then I'm
going to say for each entry here I'm
going to pass the actual column key
value to you and order and give it by
key the invalidation will call that for
that object retrieve the information and
validate make sure all of the
constraints that are described on that
type parameter if you go back to hear
that type parameter here and go and
validate it and return the arrows
according to that so this is the actual
code but I showed it live what else do
we have
we have Java time support this one says
Java time is a new API that is provided
by Java 8 and had new interesting type
year instant local date year month all
of those you can now add the past and
shoot your constraints on it and by the
way on past and future we've added all
present equals true which says ok for a
year either I'm in the year or it's a
year before that so that means 2017 or
before if it was or present equals force
which is the default it would have been
2016 and before would match properly the
constraint ok another very interesting
thing that I like in in the Java time
support is that they have this notion of
clock to abstract the actual world time
information that the system provides the
to the JDK you can abstract that
information in invalidate in bean
validation as well so by the way this is
how you bootstrap bean validation from
Java I see you say hey I get a provider
in this case the default and I want to
configure it optionally in this case I
want to provide a fixed clock provider
that will set the time the whole time to
do this in a specific zone ID so there
are two use cases for that who has
written a you know a test where you put
stuff in the future and then five years
later the future becomes the past and
boom it fails right so that is here to
prevent that kind of
problem you explicitly set a world time
and then you've got your test running
against that and they will always be
safe the other use case is force a web
framework like Joseph or you know
whatever to say hey the user is in this
time zone so please do the validation
according to that time zone and not just
the system time zone that might be very
different that's about it
other genre goodies different method for
constraint validator if we go back to
all the number here and if we go back to
this one remember constraint validator
had an initialized method that I was
useful for annotation that had
additional properties like Max mean and
stuff like that
I mean information but for all the
number which doesn't provide any of
these additional information there is no
need for to provide an implementation
and most of the time that implementation
was empty so we just added a default
implementation which is the empty one on
the interface itself which means that I
don't have to provide it here so it's a
little bit nicer just a tiny touch of
you know to make it better the other
thing that you've seen without knowing
it is that we know support the Java
eight parameter names for method
constraint validation if I go back to
this call here remember I had the method
name and then the parameter name woops
parameter name where does that come from
Rio to Java H you had R 0 R 1 R 2 named
information but with Java H you can
actually compile with a specific
information related to parameter names
zoom a little bit so here I've used the
maven compiler and I'm saying okay I'm
targeting Java 1.8 and I'm adding the
dash parameter information when I'm
doing the compilation which means that
instead of retrieving all X 0 here I got
the actual parameter name which is a bit
more readable few more things we
initially in bin validation we
restricted the list of constraint to the
fundamental set of constraints like no
not no time related constraints
constraints on numbers constraints on
string like a reg X but anything that
could be build on top of that or one was
more business centric we decided to
leave it out of the specification so
here we need a survey with the community
and maybe you you need to reply to that
survey and we said which are the
constraints that you are really missing
from the standard we also went to github
and do a bit of a magic query to look at
what we are the most common constraint
used and these three here were at the
top like not empty not blank and at
email so we are adding them to the
actual bean validation specifications so
instead of these being an actual hug
relate validate or specific extension
there would be part of the spec we met
validate or factory auto close because
it got a you create the factory and then
you called close at the end so that's a
small touch if you are in Java EE you
don't even have to care about that
because you just inject the right
validator on you're good to go so what's
our status we are in early draft one
it's been something like close to a
month not only do we have the early
draft one so the spec document but also
the reference implementation so
hibernate our validator alpha one is
actually implementing that specification
so what I've been showing to you is
actually running hibernate validator
alpha one so I literally start wildfly
deploy the new bean validation and got
it running and we're planned to follow
the Java EE train so the releases is
going to happen in July well probably
you are going to do a second release
with an improvement of on that and
hiding some new features like within a
couple of weeks and then we'll keep
iterating until July essentially
so everything is done in the open so
please come and give us feedback or
actually you know go and do some pull
requests so github.com /bin validation
and from there you've got the api the
TCK and the specification file
asciidoctor file all in apache license
and same the reference implementation is
on hibernate large hibernate validator
on github and to contribute just go to
bean validation org there is a blog to
the news where you can get the latest
information and what we provide but also
contribute page to let you know how to
you know interact with us it's more
information about hibernate validator
some specifics i won't go into all of
the features that hibernate validator
has that the bean validation spec
doesn't but essentially - validator is
the lab of the specification way when we
do something in bean validation we want
it to be really useful and safe and and
so on so we experiment in the awry
before moving it into the spec so there
are additional features that you have so
one of them is the support for Java code
money there's a bit of a licensing
weirdness so we cannot really
automatically integrate it but you can
go and depend on Java code money and had
the right component in from hibernate
validator and you can validate monetary
amount so not only min/max on the value
but also the currency you say okay it's
only euro and US Dollars and yen and
whatnot the other interesting features
is the programmatic API so I've shown
you how you use annotation to declare
constraints on an object the second
option described in the spec is to use
XML but then in hibernate validator
we've got a third option which is the
programmatic API which is a type safe
way to express to constrain the
annotations but not on the and on the
object itself so not via annotations and
here we played with lambdas so we try to
use lambdas
elsewhere and being in the bean
validation API but frankly there was no
real massive use for it so we're just a
bit disappointed not being able to use
that tool the one use case we found that
makes sense here it is essentially
saying okay this annotation here I want
to attach a constraint validator so just
like we did if we go back to order
number again just like we did the add
constraint other number of the auto
number of validator here we say for the
constraint file exists just like Auto
number I'm going to validate the type
file or I'm going to validate the type
string in case of auto number and the
actual implementation of the is valid so
this this bit actually goes in a lambda
here so it can go for a very compact way
to express the annotation so we're going
to keep exploring that in a high valid
validator and hopefully one day
introduced this whole programmatic API
concept into bean validation if things
go well I hope we'll do it in a 2.1 or
2.2 depending on your feedback that's
what I had today if you have you know
feedback comments on what I've shown you
questions or anything no it's the time
we've got good 5 minutes through oh no
actually 10 minutes to do it
why can I actually keep thinking about
your questions I'll try and show you the
demo based on with the integration with
the with the angular angular JS you
reset it check out the demo I guess I
need to Diplo to stop this guy first
that's the first donating from the mavin
repo live why not to do initially oops
value extractor on utilities guys
where is it next right - I noticed
okay let's try again
so here I'm deploying a different
version and if things go well what I'm
seeing here and if I'm creating a new
hike with no information and putting
this and it's not quite working okay
well I tried I was definitely like thing
actually you do get the error message
but it's not properly propagated I'll
figure it out
at some point we'll push everything in
in github so you go to github Keep Calm
/ hibernate and there is a hibernate
demos and if you go so that's a bit
weird but if you go to OGM because
remember the we use the MongoDB and so
that's been that's an OG n based demo
but you've got the hiking demo and we
are going to push the bean validation
code that I've shown you in vegetation
to code that I've shown you in there
it's ready on my private repo or not
private but Gosnell repo if you go there
there is a branch which should be Billy
to demo and that's what I've been
showing you any questions that you have
thought about before we close
very interesting questions so the
question is is it available as part of
the micro profile so initially the micro
for file really wanted to be as small as
possible so we did discuss integrating
bean validation and we decided to go on
the safe side of things and wait for
like the next version or something to
make a choice I think we probably should
reconsider and see if because it's so
well integrating with integrated with
CDI and jax-rs totally makes sense to
add that kind of spec to it and know
that it's moved into a proper community
moved to eclipse and so on I think we
should get that one going okay so there
is you said there is above tomorrow at
9:00 p.m. so yeah for people coming from
Europe to try and stay awake drink a lot
of coffee and go to the buff any other
question so you're using micro profiler
you're exploring it okay exploring
interesting okay well thank you for you
know assisting to my session and I'll be
around for the whole week so you can
come and ask a question about anything
hibernate or JBoss or you know well
anything and then I can tell you I don't
know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
