so good afternoon everyone thanks for
being with us this afternoon so we hope
that you are enjoying the very first at
devoxx us and you add a lot of fun with
all the sessions that you attend during
those first two days during this session
we are going to speak about eclipse chip
so flow Hall and myself Steven are going
to introduce chip we will do a live demo
and we will speak a little bit about the
workspace portability which is one of
the core value of Eclipse chair so if we
if we have to think a little bit about
the way we are working today we are all
facing problems with the configuration
of a developer environment we are facing
problems because we are working on
multiple projects so we have various
technologies and we have to switch from
one context with a certain set of
dependencies to another context with
another set of dependencies so sometimes
it's having some confliction we are also
working in teams so it's all good
we stay we are all different but it's
all good and we have all different
tasties so some of us prefer to speak
here to to to use keyboard shortcuts in
the editor and some some of us prefer to
click on buttons some of us also prefer
to go into the terminal as well so it
really it really depends so we are
spending a lot of time to configure our
workspace and in general when we want to
unbound new developers to our project we
write some documentation
of some scripts but all of this is
really manual it's error prone and we
are losing a lot of time some time it is
just hours but in general and if you
take that from an enterprise point of
view it's days or weeks so there is a
problem and why can't we have anyone at
any time being able to contribute to a
project without having to install
anything on his on his machine so if we
think about what is needed to make a
contribution you have on one side the
IDE the project's sources and the
runtime and by a long time I mean all
the dependencies that you need in order
to to build to code to test and to run
your project and today the workspaces
are including only projects and
configuration and you have the IDE on
another side and you have the runtime
dependencies that you are you are
installing on your local machine in
order to be able to work with che we are
redefining the concept of a workspace
and a chip of space will provide its own
IDE it will be a browser IDE we will
provide the project's files and we will
also have a inside of the workspace the
runtimes
dependencies so you will have everything
that you need in order to be able to
build to code to test and to run your
projects how we do that so inside of
jail spaces we are bringing docker
containers and inside of those docker
containers you will have all the
dependencies that you need there will be
pre-configured for you for the project
so it can be a single machine for the
workspace or it can be also multi
machines so you can have inside of your
space multiple containers ones that you
will use to code
well which will have the database for
example when that you will use for
executing in your project and other
containers which you can use for
different part of your workflow so the
project's they're directly mounted into
the workspace one time the whole eye on
the docker container that you define for
the workspace and inside of the wall
space you will define a set of commands
and document there are scripts that are
execute as processes inside of the
workspace on time so if you want a
command to build your project you will
define and mvn clean install for example
and it will be inject inside of the
workspace on time directly so as I said
just before the workspace are providing
the own browser ide so this way we are
sure that anyone will not need to
install any IDE it will be provided with
with the workspace but you can still use
you can still use any IDs that you want
so you can use IntelliJ or you can use
eclipse if you want you will connect to
the workspace over SSH so this is how
our browser ID is looking and you can
use this one but you can also use zeros
or ones you want
so the workspaces are hosted in a server
and a server is doing the orchestration
of of all the workspaces in all the
containers that you are using inside of
your workspaces so that was a quick
introduction now I will give the ends to
flow which will introduce chair life
with with a small demo Thank You Steven
so for the demo I already have an
equipped share running and my local
computer as you can see in my dashboard
I have no workspace so the first step I
will create a new workspace and import
my project inside this workspace I will
zoom in for you
so I Stephen said is the first time you
have to select your run time because you
need to select all the tools that you
need for your project for this you have
the choice you can pick up predefined
selected stack so for example if you
want to start with Java you can click on
Java if you do that Nazi please Pierce
Andrade and I go if you want to define
your own stack you can go in stack
authoring and here you can enter you on
your own docker file or docker compose
file and it will define all your runtime
so it's actually very easy to get a
workspace if you already need the
karai's your project in my case pick up
Java workspace and then I start so
workplace
so what it will do that it will create
and the node in this case the Ubuntu
image so it may take some times and it
will do not always at the current time
that I need to for my example so yeah
the docker image is donating on my
computer and then it start now the
workspace agent and with the workspace
agent I'm able to communicate from my
browser to the docker container it take
some time and I'm ready
so here we can see that we have a
terminal and in this terminal I can
enter any command and we can see you
know we are on Linux but my computer is
a Mac so we are connected inside the
docker container my next step is to
import a project
I will import Java spring application so
it is cleaning my application from
github importing it here you can see
that we have our Java file like in any
ID so you have all that you have in any
IDE you can do code completion it's an
ID but it's in my order and as event
said we have comments so here we have a
command used to run Tomcat and deploy my
web application but we you can define as
many commands as you want when I start
in my command yeah
ok I will stop it
we can see here that we have previewer
so it means that when my application
will be
Grint it will deploy my application to
the Tomcat running inside my docker
container and then I need to connect to
the Tomcat inside my docker container
the preview girl is providing the URL to
connect from my computer to the docker
container so here the application is
starting and if I connect to this app I
can use my application of course you may
have the refracting as well
the idea now is that we are web-based
cloud ID and JD's can I do some debug
stuff so I will add a breakpoint it's
great and I will connect now Mike
debugger so it's running and the a
teapot now I'm connecting to the
debugger the back point is no longer a
grey it's blue it means that the
breakpoint is any bar so now I come back
to my application and I will enter even
again but I don't have the output
because I'm in my debugger and I can
change the value
and I resumed and you know we can shine
we can see the new value so we can see
that with the web as cloud ID we are
able to debug a simple Java program
but we can debug in fact any Java
program very quickly and very easily
are also providing a debugger for gdb
and not GS as well and PHP - kere
debugger has been built by Zend team so
it's a sudden debugger that you will
find inside the firm of chip yeah
so what we have seen we can pick up any
runtime that we want because we are
darker based so if you want some
specific tools you just have to install
these tools inside your docket on us
it's collaborative for example if I take
my workspace I have on my browser or
link if I give this link to another
people the other people we get the same
workspace with a Semoran time and the
same comments so it pretty easy to
collaborate on a program it's programmer
paga member because you can find and you
have some REST API to create a workspace
so you can create workspace by current
commands if you want it's version AB and
externship you can have many plugins
that you plug inside a chip chip so for
example here is the best of all the
plugins everybody inside a cube chip but
the list is growing so for example
currently we have with the right team
doing some work and up and chief
connector so to be able to deploy all
your workspaces with open shift and not
anymore with docker and we have tools
and plug-ins for the JavaScript stuff so
PHP stuff etc another part interesting
in a cube J is the language server
protocol so this protocol allow you to
connect language server protocol
implementation to eclipse and this
server provides you from the pursue code
completion for any age spots any
language so for example we have some
language Java protocol for PHP c-sharp
our xx but you can define your own
language Java protocol implementation
plug this implementation inside a cube
shape and yet then you will have the
code completion for you for your
language
and for this we are working with
Microsoft and reddit so I will let ya
thank you Thank You Phil so you saw that
the wall spaces are really different
from the ones that you are used to to
work with for now they embed a buzzer
IDE which allow to work to to be used at
any place where you will have a buzzer
you will have also home times
dependencies which will be there as well
so now ready
it makes the workspace is really easy to
to be portable and if we think about one
of the benefits and one of the value
that we that are provided by the che
workspaces it's really about simplifying
the onboarding experience of new
developers inside of our workspace so we
want to make your developer ready to go
without having to do all those setup and
configuration steps that we are used to
do and to do that we have a future which
is called cheriya it's a it's a fruit to
provide the developer workspace in few
seconds it start from woojae file the Qi
file is a recipe which have all the
instructions and all the configuration
parameters that allow J to rebuild a
developer web space and it reprise the
bada IDE configure it it will also
provide the home times it will configure
the runtimes as well and it will have
the project's inside so the only things
that you have to do if you are a
developer is that you do a git clone of
the repository and you do a docker run
Eclipse j.j up and it will spin up
eclipse chafe and it will boot a new
workspace which will be ready to work
and the sources will be sync with your
local clone so when you do some changes
within a clipper chair you will see the
changes on your local machine and it
will be completely sink so if you are
doing some other changes with another
tool it will be also visible inside of
chip so this feature is called Cydia and
the che file some tax which is used at
the very beginning is very simple so it
has the workspace configuration that you
can see at the very top we define the
one time that you can you can use
actually if you already have a docker
file for your project it will use that
docker file as the workspace one time
and you will be able to predefined some
commands which will be available for
other developers so that's cool that's
running on your local machine
but how easier it could be if it was
just clicking on a link because it's
it's a web-based tool we we can have
this ability to instantiate a develop a
developer workspace on demand just by
calling a URL which will then have all
the instructions that are needed in
order to rebuild the developer workspace
so here it's what we did so we put
behind behind this image we put a link
and this link if I click on it it is
starting a new workspace which is
running remotely so it will start the
workspace one time it will inject zero
space agents for all the developer
services that we need inside of the raw
space
you can so you can use SSH if you want
to connect directly inside of the doctor
container or you can have I think
mechanism otherwise connect on your
local machine but you can also don't
know you can actually hit when you are
here you have the access to everything
that is inside of a vault is a file
system of your workplace one time so
yeah I just click on a button and I get
my workspace so I'm ready to to to work
I have my project which is here and I
have the commands and I'm able to build
my project and to see it running so if
you are a little bit like us you see a
lot of projects on github and you don't
really have the time to try all of them
so you start them or you put them into
your browser favorites but you never try
them because you don't have the time so
here it's really convenient because it's
allowing you to to test the projects
without having to install anything on
your machine so it will not break any of
the dependencies that you already
installed on your local machine and it
will be completely isolating so the
workspace will be create on demand for
for that use case so the factory so this
capability is called the factory
it works with a remote chair it works
also with a on OpenShift so the red team
as a as a front side is working on
making chair running on open shiftin
using open shift containers as well oh
it works with codenvy
con envy is the enterprise version of
Eclipse search a it adds user management
scalability and security tool to
to equip teacher so this concept of
factory allowed to badge
some open source projects so if you if
you are an open source project you can
provide to the contributors ready to go
and ready to use complete develop our
workspace and has it is just a URL it is
very simple to integrate it with any of
the tools that you can use so you can
actually integrate it with with GEHA
tulo pre-commit code reviews for example
oh you can have that integrate inside of
Jenkins and when you have a build
failure with Jenkins it will generate a
specific workspace configuration which
will which will have the information
about which what was the failure and
which fail files are having some errors
so when we will open the workspace we
will directly open the files where we
have arrows so this way it's easy to to
fix so that's the introduction for
Eclipse J you can find the resources of
the project on github slash Eclipse / J
we have an IRC channel a dev list as
well and of course on our website you
will find also getting started guides to
the way to download and hold the
documentation as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
