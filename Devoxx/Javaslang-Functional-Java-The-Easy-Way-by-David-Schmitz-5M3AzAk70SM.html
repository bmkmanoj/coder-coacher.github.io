Jarvis Leung seems to be a thing so many
people who was at the university session
about Chavez lon
oh my god so if I make a fool of myself
forgive me Who am I I'm David Schmitz as
you can tell by my accent I'm from
Germany I'm not an evil guy but my
accent is that way sorry for that I work
for a consultancy in Germany the
narcotic allergies and we do stuff for
the financial industry and I'm a
programmer basically and that's me
coding Scala when you redo the stack
traces so I can't relax when she takes
photos what's it for you functional
programming is hip now you can tell you
everything about it I can't but I want
to tell you why I think it's useful and
I will tell you how Java slang helped us
we are not greenfield developers we are
working as a consultancy so there's
stuff there's existing code and I will
tell you how Java slang helped us
improving that code and last but not
least there will be code on these slides
so if you're not comfortable with that I
guess this is the wrong code and the one
wrong talk that said this is not a
computer science talk this is not a math
talk I won't try to explain monads
because that's so easy that's the reason
why there are 2000 internet sites
explaining monads and that's not needed
for my talk code that it's easier to
reason about this is the goal this is a
sentence you see on every paper about
functional programming by a functional
programming matters to us why we think
that's good but actually what does this
mean this just means that if you look at
a piece of code a couple of lines it
must be easy to reason about how the
input gets transformed to an output and
there are a couple of things
that are useful for code that is easy to
reason about and this is not one of
those things side effects are evil you
might have expected some assignment like
in Java
everything is mutable you know you get
us and setters and stuff but exception
handling is a side effect it affects the
way we reason about our code and if you
have this division by zero here your
code jumps to another place so it's
difficult to tell what happens if you
just look at I equals one divided by
zero sorry the second aspect that leads
to better code is referential
transparency random is not referential
transparent that means you can't replace
the call to random with its evaluation
let's say you call random and you get
0.5 if you replaced the call to random
and all your code by 0.5
I guess the semantics of your code would
change obviously that's not so random on
the other hand if you have something
like the max of two integers this will
always use the same values so you can
replace the call just by the value and
this is a good function because you can
just look at it and you know how it will
evaluate this is called a pure function
the last thing and the thing that I
think most of us should take to their
heart is thinking in values are there
are closure programmers in this room
awesome you know what I mean right so if
your code and your your objects are
immutable you don't have to worry about
them you can share them with your
friends you can pass them around threats
you do not need to clone them or protect
them anyway you can just pass them
around and nothing will happen it even
improves your performance just think
about if we have a class with a list
and there's a guitar usually what you
will do is you will clone the list or
create a new list and copy all the
elements around this is not really
performant so if you just rely on values
and everything is immutable can you
won't run into runtime problems with
your state change did anyone in this
room ever program swing applications
oh god so you know this concurrent
modification exception I guess when you
pass around some collections and things
start to break because another worker
just removed some elements from your
collection that said that's also worthy
but in a nutshell functional programming
at least from my perspective allows us
to reason about and to write descriptive
code we do not care about what to code
but rather how to code other way around
we care about what code just think about
if you would implement a loop with a
while you need an index and stuff like
that on the other hand you have the map
operator which makes things so much
easier and Along Came Java eight who
uses Java 8 who does not I pity you guys
so Java it came along and lambdas
I know functional programming is not all
about lambdas but lambdas was the thing
in Java it and it's a nice concise
syntax and it's an awesome job and I was
excited I used lambdas every time I
programmed and then this awesome stream
abstraction where you can lift a
collection to a stream and you can do
all those cool things we know from other
libraries like filtering like mapping
and excitement fireworks cake for
everybody and then I try to implement
something like this something easy we
just have a collection of users and we
try to filter the invalid ones that's
easier so we lift the collection users
as a list of collection with this we
left the to a stream and we filter it
feeling good nice and then this
exception mess and then I need to
collect something with a collector I
feel like the Borg who try to collect
people and that's me on the train
feeling disappointed and Along Came Java
slow I know there are some other
projects like Java snow I guess the Juke
guys did an amazing job what Java slung
is the comprehensive approach thing so
Java slang came along and tried to fix
what's broken or missing in Java that's
not to say that the Java eight designers
did a bad job they're just things
missing and the idea is the Java strong
is just a library so you can import it
into your project on a piece by piece
approach that means you do not have to
change you the way you code you just use
it where it makes sense and there are a
couple of things that we discover and
this this talk I can't show you
everything obviously just 53 minutes
left so collections some functional
sugar and pattern matching always with
code from our actual projects anonymized
to protect the innocent but nevertheless
actual code but before I get to the
details let's fix this ugly mess to give
you an idea how Java slung will actually
look that's the original code we stream
across the list we filter odd by using
this user validate method and of course
what you should do is you should fix
that ugly user validate method by the
way but we couldn't do this in that case
so this is Java slang we just take a
Java collection we say list of all and
presto we have our Java string
collection so it's really easy to bridge
between JDK and Java slow and then we
can just apply filter so there's no need
to lift that collection to a stream they
could break the compatibility with JDK
because it's a side project
and as we don't have a stream we need no
collectors so we can remove this all
nonsense at the bottom less code less
box and then there's this exception mess
just replaced by a try off don't worry I
will explain later this is just to give
you an idea how your code will actually
look with Java slang and if you compare
the original version with this I think
we will all agree that this is far more
readable if you compare what we wanted
to do try filtering all invalid users
lalala - the code the code tells you the
exact story so collections by the way I
just discovered this morning collecting
rubber duckies is a thing I was
completely surprised I thought this is
only for hotels with that they give away
what there are people that buy docks
mutable collections in Java are broken
why is that the case well the case is
just this method clear there are other
methods like remove or add and they all
break basically the encapsulation of
your class and the collection and
whatever now after a couple of years of
development whenever I see a method that
returns void I'm always cautious but
because returning void must indicate a
little side effect otherwise this method
would make no sense but we haven't an
easy solution for that in Java who uses
collections on modify the list yes yeah
yeah that's not a good thing I know this
is the only means you have any when you
are just using basic Java but it's not
visible from the outside you do return a
list to me and I can't see from the
interface that this is supposed to be
immutable and I'm like this yeah well
get the collection and bam it explodes
in my face
Java slang collections are completely
immutable nothing can change once
instantiated so we just create the
of the single-string f95 which is my
hometown soccer team and the idea is
just this programmers might know this
list of consoles forget that directly
it's garbage just think of a couple of
buckets where you put your strings in
two so in this case we have two buckets
one with the string and the slash should
indicate the end of list nothing fancy
there and then I try to prepend
another string to that list now we would
expect that T has the other string in
front of it but not so with Java slung
in Java slang a new collection gets
created but there is an item missing
obviously and as you can see there is no
end of list terminator there there's
just this nice symbol is the circle
which points to the original collection
that's called a functional data
structure a persistent collection that
never changes that allows us to reuse
the whole part of the memory just think
about a tree of of users we have a
catalog with a tree map and you just
change a single leaf in Java what we
would do is you would copy the whole
tree around and lose performance and
memory and stuff like that and Java
slang what they do is they just replace
the tiny bit
that's modified and use some pointer
magic to fix your original tree they can
do that because everything is immutable
and you can reuse the whole set that's
similar to for those guys who do closure
like very close or treats its data
structures that also means when you look
at the actual implementation of add and
remove a prepend in java slang
it's far more complicated their
individual operations but on the whole
for you as the user you won't see
anything you won't notice anything just
work just works going to streams
anybody here actually uses stream off
yeah cool so then you can answer my
question you I have the stream of just
two strings and then I map to uppercase
note I do not collect so actually
nothing happens well okay it's safe I
can pass it around send it to a spark
and then I map it again but still I do
not collect what happens
any idea yeah no yeah - but it crashes
before I didn't do anything and that's a
result
that's not concise that's not consistent
that not that's not easy to understand
you look we didn't do anything and bam
we get this exception because of some
reference pipeline magic stuff stateless
up this is not good Java stunk streams
on the other hand fixed that you can
instantiate the stream and you can call
to uppercase and to lower case and in
this case I actually take the items from
the stream and this works as expected
you might not notice this but this
consistency in the API is really really
important to me because it reduces the
amount of of random behavior and this is
a common theme in Java song we will see
so all in all functional data structures
this is a really big topic and function
programming but just for us basically
they improve your performance and they
reduce the chance of unexpected behavior
at runtime so just by looking at the
code you know what is going to happen I
hope so
depends on the code so now I will talk
the next 30 minutes about what these
math diagrams actually mean so this is
going to be hard on you know I have
actually no idea I just looked up monads
and I found this this picture my
university phone
long ago so function sugar what do I
mean by that if you look at the function
interface and JDK 8 it's cool it's nice
thank you very much by consumer it's
nice but if you have coded in Haskell or
in an elixir or any other language their
stuff missing you can't lift functions
you can't carry function functions you
can't actually do anything with them so
there are stuff that Java slang gives us
to fix this once again in an example
let's find a user and if that user has
an address we just returned the street
this is what I call the cascading pile
of shame
once again actual code from from one of
our projects so we have a repo in that
case it was a I guess it's a Mongo repo
huh no idea doesn't matter so we try to
find the user and that user might be not
obviously because if the ID doesn't
match up so we don't get anything and
then we get that user's address if the
user exists and then we have to check
the address and if that address exists
we can return the street yes really cool
and we know how to fix this yeah in Java
optional we just wrapped the user with
this optional of not able and we check
if optional is present and then we can
actually access the code right no that's
what we do in our projects from now on
developers who code with optional is
present they have to do the walk of
shame if you don't remember anything
from this talk just take this please
stop using optional as present option
it's not meant for this stuff it's not
meant for for for checking if it's
present an option is like a gift box
think of it like this a nice present
it's really
important and if you are a good
developer and come to devoxx each year
and you practice your coding kata you
might even get something a sock for
example who doesn't like it's Christmas
I'm a father of three children so I will
get socks that's that's clear yeah
and now the other hand if you're a bad
programmer or if you give me socks for
Christmas you won't get nothing
okay just get an empty box that's cool
and if you want to handle the box you
only use map map of flat map these are
your friends nothing else so let's say
socks so many socks by the way delphox
should actually skip this this t-shirt
nonsense and provide us some socks and
let's say I hate my sock and I want a
football because footballs are really
cool so I have this box with a sock in
it and I have this function I only apply
map because map is cool map knows how to
get things done it opens the box and
takes out the sock and then it applies
the function you provided to that sock
and transforms it to of a soccer ball to
a football and puts it back once again
into a box that's what called that's
what's called it it keeps the structure
of whatever you pass into the map
operator so if you have an optional and
you use map map checks if there is
something in the box and if there is
nothing if there's something it will
apply the function and nothing from
nothing it's easy that's the way things
work if you have nothing and you apply
map to it that won't apply the function
so it's completely safe that's the way
you should use optional not with us
present now you might have seen that I
switched between optional and option
when when talking that's because I use
option Java slang implemented its own
option why because the optional in Java
is
how to put it nicely it's interesting
because it represents the absence of in
value by using a null that's because you
have seen this of nullable I had to use
to actually create the optional and if
you look at the API of optional it's
nice it's better than nothing but of
twenty methods we can't do better so
let's see it what what option does
option in Java strong is just an
interface and two classes implemented
interface some and none so the absence
of value is represented by none like in
Scala and the cool thing is that option
is a value and also an iterable so you
can treat an option like a collection as
is visible by its API and that's just a
couple of methods there are many many
many other things I really appreciate
the fact that you can filter on an
option because that leads to nice code
if you really want things like that but
the killer argument let me ask you this
has anyone of you ever tried to
serialize an optional yeah this is
serializable this is awesome we try to
send a a list of optional to to spark
and we couldn't do this because optional
is not serializable but you can do this
with with Java slang it's serializable
it's meant to be stored as a field if
you want to store it as a field you can
pass it around it's not just the the
representation of a null in your code
it's far more so let's fix this part of
shame first of all we fix this repo and
the repo returns a user or null so it's
easy just returns an option and then we
can just use our good friend is present
no what do we do
yes nearly no sticker for you we have to
use flatmap why why do we need to flat
nerve because gate address might also be
absent cat address of user returns also
an option of address so we have to
flatmap that and then if we have to
address we can just get the street so
just compare the sentence now find a
user if an address is available fetch to
use the street to the actual
implementation
that's exactly what is specified above
the box there's no discrepancy with some
Iliff and the mountain of shame we saw
before it's just fine get the address
get the street else interpret it as an
empty string so you can remove all this
nested code of your codebase and just
use map map map map and everything will
be fine you will be a better person for
it this picture by the way is from
classical prog programming classics I
think it's a website it's awesome and
there are original title of that that
painting was developer gets moved to a
legacy rails application for maintenance
I think it's so fitting okay let's look
at nice validation code let's suppose
this is code logistical you can't change
it because somebody else wrote it and
doesn't belong to your project or
whatever reason so what we do is is
Yvonne Yvonne is known you know Yvonne
is an international bank account number
it doesn't matter actually so we just
want to check this Yvonne and if our
validation magic says yeah
eben is nice we return the Yvonne
awesome in other cases we get this nice
exception honestly who has not written
code like that if I look back in the
past last week or so I might find code
like this for myself this is what we
call in function programming a partial
function this is a function that is not
defined for the set of invalid a bonds
basically and the problem is not really
that that function it's it's the problem
but when you try to use it this is WTF
code if I ever seen something you have
to instantiate you have to declare an e
bond and you can check the ebon and if
the exception pops up we set it to an
empty string just follow for the fun of
it and that case we have lived in java
slang lift takes and a function a
partial function and transforms it to a
total function sounds great yeah awesome
what it really does is really really
easy
it just interprets exceptions as option
non nothing else so lift
transforms the inner function and if it
succeeds you get a something with the
result in it the ebon and if an
exception pops up you just get none so
instead of this whole try catch nonsense
before we just have this lift apply and
get away
it's just what we wanted check the the
te bond and if it succeeds give us the
result otherwise just the empty string I
know this apply is not really nice to
look at but that's Java for you know it
has no way around it right now there's
another way we can do this with
Jerusalem let's say we have this this
method stuff to do does amazing things
it creates a new schedule for devoxx
2017 with lots of eg b2 talks and stuff
like this and that throws exceptions
then we can just wrap this with try the
try of operator just built a container
around the method so you can call this
method in a safe manner and what what
you get from it is either a success with
the result or failure containing the
exception clear I guess so
so basically just this this try catch
block we saw before it's just basically
handled by this try off and if we apply
this to our check function we can just
say try checking the ebon it's exactly
what we want try checking this ebon we
know it's either a success or a failure
and if you succeed give us the result
otherwise give us the empty string
so we replace the whole six or ten lines
of try-catch blocks and all this mutable
state just by this clear expression of
course try it has so many other methods
you can recover from exceptions for
example let's say you have an exception
you want to react to so you can say try
off and then recover but from my
experience for our projects we do not
tend to use that so often why is that I
don't know maybe we don't throw so many
exceptions around but we didn't find
that too useful or too readable so this
is the case we use more most often so
just by using lift and try we can reduce
all this exception handling clutter and
the associate side-effects we don't have
to declare some some fields just for
this try catch nonsense
who knows structure decomposition why
are you here actually I think you know I
ask something you raise your hand so I
guess you know everything maybe you
should switch places no honestly
structural decomposition is just another
name for pattern matching if you have
ever programmed in Scala or in an elixir
or and other functional programming
languages you might know this even
JavaScript has some kind of structured
decomposition on a very low level I will
explain it by using an example this is
actually not so bad
let's code we just have a obviously some
some HTTP requests we fired off and we
get the status code and we compare -
okay and it's okay we return the body
whatever that is and if it's not okay we
return the empty list it's okay to code
actually so what's pattern matching
I found this just last week that's seems
to be a valid pattern for email address
I have no idea if that works right you
just follow the internet Stack Overflow
so it can't be wrong
the idea is the same you have this this
expression and you apply expression to
your actual object that's why it's
called structural decomposition we
decompose the object and Java slang has
a awesome API for that don't be fooled
match is obviously not a class it's a
method but it's not a case so the Java
developers are totally confused what
shall we do with that so we match on an
expression against a couple of cases
nothing else and each case is basically
a pattern and if that pattern matches we
call the function also really easy some
example patterns I know the syntax might
not be your typical Java syntax and the
dollar sign first of all the guys I
showed this to Y are using jQuery in
your Java code
I thought Jaykar was evil no these are
typical examples there are many many
more for example we have this wildcard
pattern which basically matches
everything we have an equals pattern
where you can match against a certain
value or this is in where you can see if
the expression is within this this set
of values there are many more you can
check for the instance of the instance
class matches you can check for success
or failure so I will show you in a
minute
and you can even code your own patterns
you can create your own patterns by
using this on apply annotation I won't
show you this because right now with the
Java syntax we have I wouldn't recommend
it I hope the guys from Java slang won't
kill me but I wouldn't recommend it
right now it's nice to play around but
on your project it needs to really not
very maintainable code so let's fix this
HTTP handling we match the status code
that's really easy you know we match
status code and we know this can only be
ok or we don't care
and that's exactly what we are going to
write if it's okay we get the body and
if it's anything else return the empty
list it doesn't get any clearer than
that
so that's a complete example however by
us beware you see the little footnote
can you read what's what's written there
I left out a whole bunch of Java type
generic laa-laa information because Java
but the current time doesn't know what
this dollar parenthesis actually is you
have to prove yeah no no that's that's I
have no idea how they do it but if you
have if you go back to the to the
pattern explanation here if you only
have a single value like like this
dollar foo you can omit the parentheses
so that'sthat's function f series value
I have no idea how they coded that I am
NOT able to actually understand the code
says a lot about me but you can write
your it's the same you're completely
right if I put the parentheses around
this same code so it's no it's just
syntactic sugar great question by the
way but we can also match on a try we
have an a function fat from URL that
returns to try you know try a couple of
slides ago I explained it to you so this
fact from URL execute some AGP stuff and
my break you know when instantiating URL
you get exceptions the way it should be
and we know this try might be either a
success or a failure
know what we know so in general what we
now would do we would try if it's
instance of something and then react to
it but what we can do with Java so now
we just can say in case it's a success
just return whatever was contained in
the success
in case it's a failure return the empty
list
this is readable code this you can read
this from left to right so this is the
complete example we match on the result
and we have the couple of cases that
interpret it of course there are so many
ways to actually react to the try this
is just one way to do it
I would not overuse it when we introduce
this to to a product a couple of months
ago everybody matched everything and I
think there is a place for matches and
there is still a place for a new
statement so you're not a bad program if
you don't use much I think sorry a
default sorry yeah of course there there
you can you can combine predicates you
can combine expressions you can say you
can even add watches here if I go back a
couple of slides now I really regret the
animation for example I said if it's
okay yeah and what I can do is if it's
okay and then execute a guard statement
on that expression you can say if it's
okay and some other value also fits into
that conditioner so it's really powerful
we do not tend to use that because with
the Java syntax that we have this really
leads to messy code so at least from our
perspective your mileage may be
different but you can do this it's
really powerful there are so many
conditionals and with the next version
they will even expand to conditionals
you can use and if something is missing
you can always code your own so that's
that for you so by using this this match
expression we can just remove all this
clutter of pattern off of complex
if-then-else statements and we have
clear expressions so no side effects
just a clean table of if that happens
that happens that leads really to a code
base you can read from top to bottom do
not overuse it as I told you this is not
a silver bullet gets so much more for
example the collection framework
there are so many collection types in
Java and have no idea what they actually
do because we actually use maps and
lists and that's that's that and maybe a
tree but if you just look at this hash
map with this nice syntactic sugar where
you can actually create these key value
pairs
does anybody here in this room like the
way you have to instantiate the hash map
in Java
I see those static blocks variable
creates add and add and put and put
awful this is just syntactic sugar for
instantiating basically the Foo key with
the bar value and the cooks key with the
bat's value and then you can buy map
that means you can apply functions at
the same time through the key and to the
value this is really powerful from a
programming standpoint and we tend to
use it actually very much and the other
collections are basically the same that
means that that the API of all the
collection types is really consistent
there are trees there are sequences
there are backdoors usable vectors not
Java util vector and we have tuples yeah
of course
and no it won't be typesafe but you mean
that that the value to the the value of
the of this instantiation can be of a
different type each time
I have no I don't understand your
question maybe you come to me after the
talk and we can look at the code
directly okay but if I did the question
was if the type safety is guaranteed if
I map across the the key and the value
by changing the types and I have to look
into the code base can't answer it
directly
Topol we have tuples in java slang I
don't know why we still don't have any
tuples in in Java because we create
classes for everything I guess but if I
look at the code base we have in our
code base we have a class called pair we
have a class called even my topple and
stuff like this all for just containing
a couple of values I wouldn't go
overboard with it but if you just have a
couple of two values and you want to
operate with that that's a fine
implementation and once again topple and
Java slang is an iterable it's the value
so everything all the syntactic sugar
you know from optional is available
there there are many other value
enhancements like for example either you
can say that this method returns either
left or right we don't know if it
returns either the one or the other
thing and many other things that we do
not tend to use that much but we use
tuples tuples my friend I like my tapas
and they don't have just to be of
cardinality of two so you can do total
of eight if you want and there's so much
more there all these side projects that
means Java song is just the core with
the collections the functional sugar and
stuff like this there's also this test
framework for property checking anybody
seem to talk about property checking so
you know how useful that is we haven't
introduced that yet into our project we
are looking into it because it looks
interesting we don't know how stable
letters
I guess it's stable but we are not quite
convinced yet then there's the circuit
breaker which I consider don't want to
to to sound judgmental I consider a
demonstration of the power of java slang
what they
they implemented low-key hysterics
just using java slang where you
implement a circuit breaker pattern and
there's jackson which is cool because
you can use java some data types in your
rest api and it will get transformed to
jackson properly and and the way back
and this java slang match last but not
least allows you to basically implement
your own patterns like for example if
you want to match on some user class if
the fields actually match
i did not consider it until now in the
future maybe if we have more syntactic
sugar for that so one might ask if this
is so amazing
if this is this the mother of all free
lunches and surprisingly not this is
actually code from from java slung it's
generated okay so the guys are smart
there but i i don't want to comment on
the in the quality of the code that's
not my place
yeah but whenever i see code like this
i'm asking myself is java the right tool
for what i'm trying to do if i see
something like a function 16 we have
millions of type parameters and stuff
like this
I tend to think maybe closure or Scala
or scanner or JavaScript no not
JavaScript but think about your problem
if you are working in a micro service
environment maybe you can introduce the
language that it's appropriate for your
actual business needs and if you need to
program in a function matter real
functional programming maybe consider a
different programming language it
doesn't have to be Java all the time
then a second drawback is that right now
as a community finally I'm so happy we
have more collection libraries than
logging libraries this is quite if
you've been around in a Java community
for as long as I have yeah we have log4j
and ten blocks there and whatever and
now with guava collections you have
Eclipse collections you have all the
other functional collections like goog
no Java slung and comments collections I
don't know if there are news anymore
that's might be sensible to just pause
for a minute look at your codebase and
think about does it really help me ever
introduce another collection same holds
for for option if I open one of our code
bases and I look for option I get ten
implementations of option and I have to
see the pattern of the the package name
and find the right option and this is
it's a mess so think about that
there are ways around it obviously but
think about that you can introduce Java
slung on a component level and keep your
API clear just using Java types and use
Java slung internally and then this I'm
not sure if that's the drawback this is
something when you try to introduce
programmers that are not used to that
style of coding with map map map flatmap
map filter they always say it's not
written as readable as my if statements
now I think that's not true it's just a
matter of you're not used to it I think
once they see that the code base
actually gets reduced gets compressed to
just a couple of lines I think I will
see the advantage but you should be
aware that when you try to move in that
direction things will look like this
train of dots in your code but this is
not a drawback I think that's just
getting used to it so I would argue try
it out play around with it and after a
couple of weeks this will really be
natural to you so wrapping up java slang
is stable
it's performant we use it in every new
project we introduced it in a couple of
legacy projects where it makes sense and
from my perspective the main selling
point of java slang it is very slick
very well-designed API the guys did an
awesome job that everything feels
natural it's like back in the days
anybody here remember JDBC template from
from spring yeah and that's really cool
because once you know how to apply a
template from from spring button back in
the days
you basically knew how all the other
template implementations worked and the
same is here once you know how the
option works with its API you know
basically how the sequence will work
with this API you know how the tree will
work with this API you know how
everything works with its API and this
is really dear to my heart a consistent
API it doesn't mean to introduce object
functional programming to your hometown
let's say you're on a project you use
Java and you see all those cool Scala
guys that doing this object functional
awesomeness and you don't see them
crying at night because of the stack
traces they get but that's a different
story but did you see they say are you
Java guys you use inheritance and
nothing else and you can say well maybe
I can introduce some of the benefits of
object-oriented programming into my code
base where it makes sense you don't have
to move to Scala just to get the
benefits obviously the syntax is more
verbose and javelin in Scarlets Java we
know Java we we like to write so this is
really a cool thing if you want to
introduce this on a component level base
I have to admit that at the point when
you have to debug some of this code I
think you will be in hell unless you're
as smart as Java stand guys I am not as
smart as those guys so when you go into
the code and you try to debug whatever
pattern 16 does good luck version 3 is
coming in 2017 the roadmap is not clear
right now
they will rewrite parts of the internal
they will break things and that's the
major version so they can break change
that thinks but I have to say this is
one of the most frantic communities I
have ever seen
you can ask questions it's not like some
certain other community Scala where if
you ask a question you don't understand
what that means they tell you you are
too stupid young man go back to
university try to learn functional
programming come back no actually there
was a question by option allows null
that you can create a sum of
this is not like Java optional works and
in such instead of saying it's Mona blah
blah blah actually Daniel the the
Project Lead wrote a blog post on it
explaining it in detail which is really
really good
the guys it's totally amazing and super
friendly so if you want to know more you
can ask me after this talk come here
I've got the stickers by the way
stickers really important and go to the
homepage of Java's flung the
documentation is really good there's a
good introduction we get a feeling of
all the basic use cases and if you have
questions sent them to to those guys
they're on github they accept bug
reports or documentation reports if you
find a bug in the documentation file the
report fix it yourself great community
so that's from our side questions yeah
the question was is this completely
unusable in Java 7 yes sorry I feel for
you but yeah it's complete usability oh
no
okay then let me rephrase I have did the
point was from how your yeah now he's
rolling back the answer was of course
you might be able to do that by
replacing stuff so I have no idea I
would how to do it and sorry for you
migrate to Java 8 already it's 2016 yeah
yeah no the question was with with the
dollar the dollar match only on the
cases if there is some some magic going
on behind that you need an ID pluck and
stuff like this no it's basically Java
code and the compiler is able to work
with that but be aware that in some
cases you have to provide the additional
type information for Java to work result
so that's the Java compiler for you
the question was if I think that we
should expose these custom api's like
like Java slangs lists on the outer
bounds of our components or microservice
or whatever interfaces basically and
exactly that's what we are doing I said
at the beginning maybe just a side side
sentence it's really easy to bridge from
java to java slang and back and that's
that's the hit we are we are willing to
take so we when we have our component in
internally we'd use java slam when we go
on the outside
we tend if it's really a component of s
we we tend to go back to Java interfaces
right now because we are not sure where
this is going if for example if we are
that's for logistic project if we are on
greenfield and we are doing our
micro-services all alone
then we are not so so shy to actually
use java slung directly on interfaces
because microsoft's is small if
something comes up we throw them away
basically okay so we are in the same
field there I wouldn't expose it so no
further questions thank you very much I
hope this was ok for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
