smarter we can probably start it's all
about time and I'm the guy between you
and lunch sometimes with intellij of
course so if you have questions about
those products you can ask me sometimes
on Twitter I have my Twitter handle that
right there and but but I used to work
for a company that was developing a
solution for Java class reloading you
probably know about that it's called
shareable and that is why I'm talking
about this topic today like normally and
I've got this idea for this talk from a
stack overflow question where people
actually ask what is the difference
between different solutions and there
are two different like two types of
differences the first type is like is
the two forcing you to change how you
develop the program like they'll have to
your tub somehow your architecture to
make classes reloadable right and the
other point of view is that they differ
in a technical way how they implement
class reloading or how they implement
the the experience because class
reloading is just the experience it
doesn't matter if it reloads in the JVM
or it reloads in your framework right
and why people are interested in that is
obviously the time all right because
this is the problem what we want to
solve when we are developing the java
application well if it starts slowly we
probably want to optimize somehow and
not you know test every single change
that we make in the code and then we you
know bash them up and then we did if
something fails we don't really know
what actually fails so this kind of
contradicts to the idea of you know
small tests and quick tests and so on
and there are different solutions
and while we were also researching how
big is the problem conducting different
surveys asking questions from people and
this is like the old graph actually if
you see the link it's from 2000 alone
but they can assure you it hasn't
changed much even if we have all kind of
new fancy frameworks new in fancy ways
of developing things it's still almost
the same graph and you can see that most
of the people are around one or two
minutes very start for the application
so if you do it like frequently it adds
up and the average is that you spent
about the fifth of your time actually
restarting the application waiting it to
restart and it's not only the restart
that matters it's also the state that
matters you have to restart the
application wait for it to initialize
wait for the caches to initialize login
into the application navigate several
screens fill in the form submit them
then see the result that you just made
right not really convenient not really
productive so what are we going to talk
about today we are going to talk about
different technical solutions to the
problem the first one is hot swap right
this is like an obvious thing but it has
its own interesting things there then
the second solution is used to use class
loaders because like it's an obvious and
probably the most used technical
solution in Java world to reload classes
or a reuleaux module sir you know like
different frameworks use that different
module system systems use that obviously
it's our agents in instrumentation API
this is something really true Civ to
your application imposing some overhead
as well and does magic with the bytecode
but it can do it can enable you do to do
really interesting things with class
reloading so hot-swap it actually
existed like for ages since Java one for
everybody knows what it is right you you
run your application in debug mode you
can change some statements and you'll
see
the results so how does it work in the
ID we have a class a very simple order
that is just in the loop calling a
method and printing it hello so we run
it we see some results of this
application running there and if we have
a statement right we can recompile the
code the re will ask if we want to
actually update the running application
because it sees that there only on the
disk on the file system there is a new
class with the new timestamp so it has
new points and can push it into JVM and
it does it by integrating with debugger
through debugger protocol actually if we
say yes we want to replace it it will
say ok I did good job right I'm a good
IDE and this is where people start
thinking that the ID is doing the
reloading because it misleads with the
message
hey I reloaded the class now it's not so
let's see what what will happen next so
yeah we see we see the updated result if
we proceed further like if you want to
do more changes let's say do some kind
of small refactoring and extract the
method and do all the same steps as we
did before the ID will say hey the the
VM actually failed so if it succeeds it
checks the pride and if it fails it says
hell it's not my problem so don't get
fooled by that it's not the teacher of
the ID it's a feature of the runtime
hot-swap is a feature of the runtime and
we can prove that by trying the debugger
have you ever tried using jdb yourself
nobody ok let's let's do a test actual
demo so what do I have here I have
basically the same program as before
right a class that is you know just
loops and invokes a method of this
messenger class which prints some
statement and it has a state right this
is important here like we have a state
basically counter that will be
incrementing so now if we compile it we
have the classes on the disk we can
start the application in debug mode we
have to enable the wire protocol open
the port so we have the application
running now if I hit enter I can see the
counter incrementing so this is our
state there and our goal with class
reloading always is to preserve state as
much as possible so if you go and try
gdb where is that okay okay we attach to
the port that was open I probably have
to make this font bigger slightly right
for everybody and so the application is
still running it's still counting oh I
forget to check to make a change
actually so let succeeds VI a messenger
class Java we make a small change in the
statement so we just change the string
right here right oops and we re compile
it again so that we have the new bytes
we have the change on the disk already
now if we attach with the debugger again
we can actually do the following we can
do all the normal debugging steps like
we do usually like set breakpoints step
over the application but one thing we
can also do is for command called
redefine
so the class name and tell where the
bytes are it's the messenger class file
right so it does it silently doesn't
produce any messages anywhere so the
program just strong but we all see the
result right here and what is
interesting for us in this case is that
the counter is continuing the counting
right it didn't drop it to zero so the
instance of the object is the same we
just change the behavior a little bit
and it's the only limitation that we
have that we can only change the
constants and change the the internals
of a single method we cannot add new
methods change signatures and anything
like that so then it will fail so here's
the proof you don't need the ID each you
actually do class reloading all right
let's go and proceed further by the way
if you have any questions you know raise
the hand if it's a quick question
probably we can you know incorporate
that into the flow so a little bit of
theory how it works in the background
inside the JVM the diagram is adopted
from the original paper on on hot-swap
so but today it's slightly changed but
the main idea is kind of the same
they're probably a little bit more
structures so when you load a class or
actually when Jamie unloads a class into
memory it has its own mapping memory
mapping up for that class so this is the
representation of a class in memory in
JVM the main structure is called
instance class right and it has its own
structures but we mention those a little
bit explain those a little bit later it
has a constant pool which is the you
know all the strings all the names of
the methods all the variables that
you've declared in your class they are
collected in one single table where they
have like a name of the constant and
some kind of index for that as well but
if you want to call a method in a class
somewhere in your code as actually it
consists of two constants the name of
the class or the name of the variable
and and the name of the method that you
are trying to go sir is two constants so
for each invocation it would it would
have to combine two constants for for
interpreter it's actually a big overhead
so it has to locate two two constants
combine them together find the index and
then invoke the method it's kind of a
troublesome and therefore there is a
cache which is populated on the first
use so that it you know directly takes
the the constant from the cache and can
invoke the method but for that it
actually has to rewrite the methods with
the indexes from the cache so the
methods that you have declared in a
class they are stored in those method
objects and the bytecode is rewritten
there to point to the cache not into the
constant pool so and after the program
runs for some time just-in-time
compiling kicks in and you get more
structures like the native
representation of the method in in a
simpler code and it's all interconnected
right so the last piece there that I
mentioned before there are like tables
inside the method inside the main
instance class so all the virtual
methods have its own table and all the
interface methods have its own table and
then all the static methods have or
members have its own table and there are
all embedded into the main instance so
if you try to change something by let's
say adding a new field it means that you
have to extend the table meaning that
you have to extend the layout of the
object in memory meaning that you have
to reallocate all the
memory pointers somehow in memory as
well
during the runtime and then patch the
existing instances as well to point to
the new structure so that's what normal
thoughts what doesn't do but if if you
change a constant which I just did in my
code in a previous example rent when I
just change the string it means that it
has to drop the constable cache it has
to repopulate the constant poo itself it
has to drop the implementation of the
method obviously it has to drop the
compiled structure as well and method
table for that one and then repopulate
them again only for that small change
when I just added a character right so
if we think about adding more stuff it
gets more complicated of course so what
it means more complicated there was a
research project called dynamic code
evolution VM it still exists you can
still download it it was originally
developed developed for j16 it was
ported to j17 it was partially ported to
gel on 8 it doesn't exist for j1i as far
as as far as I know so what it does
first of all it does this statement you
know changes which we just discussed
with hot-swap that's the simplest one
and that is the base for everything else
then it can add methods of course that
is a more complicated change in a way
that it's not only you have to resize
the table since in the inside that
structure but you also have to make sure
that all the deriving classes will
recognize that method in the original
table as well so if you have class a
extends B and you change that B then the
virtual method change should reflect in
a in Class A as well because it has to
be visible the next one is like
fields until now just changing the
statements and changing the methods it's
only changing the behavior of the class
but if you start changing the fields it
means you have to change the layout of
the class as well like even more than
just with the embedded tables and it
means it has the impact to garbage
collection so this prototype actually
works only with serial garbage collector
which means it's not really feasible to
run in production
unless performance is not an issue for
you next one is the hierarchy changes if
you change the superclass it means all
the previous changes have to take effect
as well because if you change the
superclass there might be new methods
that are now relevant to that class that
you are changing or new fields it should
be visible and so on so lay out
everything so it's like restructuring
all the memory layout of of the existing
class and pointers as well and there are
different types of changes there are
some of them are binary compatible if
you are adding something that's a binary
compatible change so if you add new
method nothing should it really break if
you're removing something right if you
remove the method that is being used by
some other class then probably it will
just crash because there is no method so
the when you when you apply the changes
you have to make sure that they are
atomic thirdly if you change two classes
you just compile them you have to make
sure that they're going in the same
batch let's say all right but
it's only the platform it only makes the
changes of the code right it's not
enough because in Java development you
are using spring how many of you use
spring and then Java EE and then other
wave web frameworks so I pretty much
covered 90% at least here and all those
frameworks use kind of--kind of
configurations annotations how many
levels of annotations do you have two
three four five you know the website
annotation many know that there is like
a half of the page like or if you use
JPA for instance right so the
annotations inside the code they are
code but they are also the configuration
they are the hints for the framework to
handle somehow the classes right so if
we change annotation values it means
that we have to somehow tell to the
framework that hey there is like a new
structure you have to handle it
differently and then just support by the
runtime just like even if we have like a
full hot-swap of it it wouldn't help us
so people turn to the class loaders so
that you can okay if you design your
program in components somehow right we
can drop the component because we would
we could have a class loader per
component and and then reload it again
and have all the changes all the meta
information again so we could run the
initialization phase on a small piece of
it not on the full application again
that's why this picture is right here
because our applications are full of
annotations so let's talk about class
loaders a little bit just basics to be
on the same page
before we proceed to the demo so imagine
we have a class with one field and we
can load it from different class loaders
right so this is the isolation where we
can isolate somehow the same the class
with the same name but it will have
different they identity within this same
application
right the dope is the same name to have
different last loader and if we change
something for one of them we all see
that it only changed for one of them not
for the second one even if we have a
static field right so remember that joke
about si singleton right we were like be
aware about Singleton's but remember
about different class loaders no no okay
all right if we proceed further from
that simple example imagine we have this
user with some behavior right a user
hasn't all been placed by basketball for
some reason and then this Patel said oh
god it means that we could have a life
cycle where we load this class again and
have a different instance and then we
can use it like you know completely pure
new instance if we had like init method
or a constructor somewhere we basically
initialize the structure the user class
the way we want with the changes that we
just made you the configuration or to
any annotation of it so if you take it
even further imagine if we want to
reload regions of the application right
we we could logically combine our
classes or our with services within the
applications you know somehow into the
groups say that okay the group is a
context and we can initialize that
context and the context may have
different like many services and then
have a class loader parent or live
instance of the context right so if
something changes on the disk world I
have a point in time when I want to
reload the application and reload this
component I would trigger loading it
again and we shall eyes and it would
have the new behavior somehow oh let's
keep this one somehow it reminds me of
the application servers right because
you have a class loader pair application
you may have class loaders within the
application but in very simple case it
resembles the Tomcat Malo
and a lot of you you spring right I
think the example is relevant here
if you spring dude there is a tool
called dev tools have you used it anyway
perfect for big applications
no not for small ones no ok but if you
haven't used it let's see how it works
and what's the idea I need so in
politics mo I could define this dev
tools dependency right this is the only
thing I need to do and if I have it
configured if I start the application
see by the way that's IntelliJ IDEA if
you don't know why it looks like this
you can ask me before after after we
talk ok so it started in 6 seconds
right ok cool so what what happened now
if I have this feature configured in
pound of XML when the application starts
up spring boot detects that there is
this feature configured and it will load
the classes that are coming from the
disk not from the jar files through a
dedicated class loader for a custom one
and all the dependencies that I have
defined in my project here all the jars
are going to do through the different
class loader so I have two main class
loaders there the application once I
make a change to any of the classes that
were loaded from the disk not from the
jar the class loader will detect that
and drop the class drop itself basically
and create a new instance of it to
actually trigger the initialization of
the spring context again right and if
you have we are using any other
frameworks like hibernate probably to
you know have to create a new session
again and
everything but we can make a little test
here so we have the application running
find owners form so here's the URL right
you can you can probably see it
so it's localhost 8080 owners find and
this mapping is configured in owner
controller right here right so if I
reload the page again I and I have
modified it a little bit to show you the
state drop as well so we have this
system out print land with a counter so
where is the console so one time we can
we can see the counter right here right
okay so if we make a change for this one
let's let's decide to change the mapping
because it's fun to change annotations
search it shouldn't be fine it should be
search and recompile this one and we
will see at the dashboard after the
counters that is actually closing the
context right dropping the class loader
closing everything restarts the
application displays cats and basically
restarts the application but it should
be faster should be slightly faster all
right it's two seconds instead of six
because it didn't restart the JVM it
didn't spend time on class path scanning
it didn't have to load all the
dependencies again and so on the
drawback here is that it lost the state
and had to reinitialize the full
application meaning that if you have a
big application this is the reason why I
asked before
well the restart might take some time
and might not be like a very beneficial
to use this tool but if you have small
reasonably small application it to
actually be convenient could be
convenient that it restarts
automatically
Plus since you lost the session I'll let
me demonstrate that okay we don't have
this anymore search if we reload the
page again a few times we can see that
it started counting from the beginning
right so it was the state if it was the
state and you have a complex application
you have should log in again navigate
and so on right it also takes some time
to check if your change was a valid one
okay so if you go to the official
documentation of spring but there is a
like restart versus reload thing in
there and let you read it out if you
find that restarts aren't quick enough
meaning that you have a big application
right or you encounter class loading
issues because you might have plus
ordering issues class loaders are
involved there you could consider
reloading technologies such as
Cherryville from zero turnaround or
spring loaded which is a like
unsupported to zooming right okay and
there were plus loading issues mentioned
there like they are dynamic basically
they come and go you didn't know when
when it appears because they don't know
what kind of frameworks or what kind of
libraries you will be using in the
applications they're being fixed so you
can see all those are closed but you
never know what happens next
okay let this brings us to Java agents
how many of you know about your agents
okay some of yous are also very ancient
technology exists since j15 has been
improved in j16 a little bit the main
idea is that you would have a class
which by convention has a method which
can execute on you know when the
application starts and you can add your
own transformers that can transform the
bytecode that is being loaded into the
class loader
then it kind of happens transparency to
the JVM and your application gets a new
behavior this way some monitoring agents
are using it mostly monitoring agents
terrible is is not a monitoring agent
it's close reloading agent and there are
a few more so here big dragons it means
that we are going to transform some byte
code there but I'm not going to buy code
transformations today so this class has
to be packaged that's a like major
inconvenience in this technology is that
the agent has to be packaged before it
can actually start working with a proper
manifest which tells us that okay this
agent class is actually the agent class
and presumably it has a pre main method
so it can execute when the application
starts and when we start the application
it has like you have to configure it
with - Java agent and point point to
that jar so when the application starts
when the main class is loading it will
actually first get into that pre main
into the class class file transformer
and we can do something with it okay
let's let me show like demonstrate how
it works in the code stop the
application now and class reloading
agent so it's a simple agent that makes
use of this instrumentation API
technology and oh it has like the most
interesting part here is that it
monitors the files in pointers the
timestamp of the file so if you
recompile it you have a new timestamp
it's a signal for this tool that hey we
can reload something right now if the
file is modified we can get the bytes so
close bytes it's the total class which
is on the disk right and called the
rectifying class method
and all it needs to do is to call this
redefine class method on the
instrumentation interface which is
provided by the JVM so you don't you
don't implement it yourself and you pass
the bytes basically the class definition
which consists of the class name and
class bytes into that redefined method
and it will hot-swap it's basically the
the hot-swap that will work there so you
can think of it as a programmatic you
know way to use hot-swap it will only
work with statement single statements to
not be able to add new methods or
anything like that
unless you are using this evm which
supports right so it's the the mechanics
should be supported by the runtime and
then the api just you know invokes that
hey i have new bytes for you can you do
something with it now what we can do we
can actually play with it a little bit
in a way that remember that our our
fancy application right here right so
let's start that in not an a debug mode
like this so we have Java me so it will
be running like this it's not an EPT bug
mode we still have that those braces and
in the code so let's let's fix that
we compile it again so we have device
right what we have to do actually have
compiled a little bit early and now we
have the agent we started without the
agent right what should we do we can use
the attached API to attach to the
process load the agent and make it to
the job so I wrote a little agent loader
right here what it does is that well it
finds the process the relevant process
in the system that is called main
because this is the main class that is
just started from the comment line right
so it finds the process ID and this is
what we need to attach to the running
process then what it needs to do is to
use virtual machine class from from your
or tools that you are I think to attach
to that process and then we can call
load agent and give it the agent and
with the parameters that we what
depending on the logic of the agent we
can pass the parameters in as well and
then detach from the process so if I run
the application this this little
application here it will attach to our
running main process main application
and load the classes but they have to
recompile the dewclaws again right to
change the timestamp so it will remove
those constants and redefine the classes
so what happened now is that I had the
application running I loaded the agent
the agent will now money toward the file
system if something changes on the file
system in that directory that I pointed
to it will pick up the bytes call
redefine class on this changed class in
the running process and it will have the
new behavior that's also an interesting
feature so this way you can implement
monitoring agents that can attach to the
running Java process
and you know redefine something in
inserts and monitoring points and start
pumping data out into some elastic
search for instance David are you happy
no all right where we are so the last
part for a presentation here is that
okay we have this foundation that we can
somehow attached to the JVM or start
with the JVM transform classes as we
want but it's not enough we have we need
we need to have this ability to actually
somehow create the new behavior if we
add new new method for instance right so
we cannot use this redefine classes to
actually just change the statements
that's not enough for us and we don't
have integration yet with with the echo
system at this point so terrible was the
tool that was designed to solve this
problem by and and the main idea here
was that it creates a layer of like
indirection between your classes every
no problem in computer science can be
solved by that and so durable idea is
that it takes original class on the left
on the diagram transforms it into two by
separating the state and the behavior
into two classes and creates an
invocation logic that would be able to
redirect to the new behavior if it
appears right so if we have a change if
we add a new method then we can
retransform this class again loaded
again load a new version of this class
and then proxy methods would be able to
redirect its goals to you to the new
version so it's kind of proxy pattern
but not like Java dynamic proxy like you
think of it normally and this way it
creates the impression
that we have a fool husband and
basically it has to mimic the hot-swap
behavior as it was implemented in the
JVM but it's not right and this way we
can implement the smart logic for method
invocations for the new method
indications for the fields for basically
it was updated to you to do everything
and after that since all the control is
in the agents hands when it sees the
change it can actually trigger the
integrations or it can trigger the hooks
into the frameworks to reload specific
parts of the lifecycle of a framework
utilized for the new configuration so if
you change let's say an annotation value
it would restart some small piece of the
framework so how does it work let me
show you like a small example right here
we start with a simple application which
again loops no not this one
this one
so again it basically what it does from
the main methods it calls method in one
class which in turn calls a method in
another class and so on right and we
will see what kind of changes we can
make here so I start with the agent I
have a plug-in installed in my ID here
when it starts first step what it does
it will actually returns form the
classes to create this indirection layer
and now I have it configured in a way
that I have automatic save and I have
automatic emulation so whatever I make a
change in a few seconds you will see the
result let's let's start playing with
the code and you'll see what what
happens okay first of all I will break
the code here so that doesn't compile
and make make a change that I extract
the methods whoo and just to see that it
actually is a different result I will
change the statement here so remove the
dots and in a second you will see that
you have the new result but what
happened here is that the agent again
monitored the new bytes in the disk when
it detected that there are new bytes it
loaded the new version of the class
transformed it eating into two and
loaded the new version of the behavioral
class with the new method after that it
actually rewrote method B since we
changed the internals we added like a
new statement to invoke the new method
and the direction layer pointed to that
new method as well now what kind of
changes we can do more like for instance
I add Class C and I change the
superclass of this one so nothing
changes yet because we override
but if we can comment out this method we
will get the behavior from Class C let's
take a look at that one so Class C what
it does it has a state and it has a
counter right and brings out something
let's see how it changes if we add a new
and you feel so we if you add a new
field we have a stay there right we want
to preserve that one but we want to
initialize the new field again and we
cannot call the constructor because we
if we call the constructor for both of
them we kind of drop the initial State
so kind of a small dilemma right here so
if we add a new field that will be D and
I will just fix the compilation in a
second so it fixes it and you can see
the first counter is still continuing
from the place where it was and the new
one was initialized with with the
initial value which is not zero right
that's the whole magic of it and and
this is what actually enables you to
state the flow when you're developing in
the application where is in the middle
of the workflow somewhere reload the
class and continue from the same place
instead of reloading like the whole
cycle of you know logging into the into
the application and navigating there
again all right but what about
annotations in this and this example I
didn't have it but let's let's return to
that spring application is it's still
running it's still it's not running
anymore that's cool what we need to do
is to disable dev tools because it will
contradict they will conflict between
each other one will try to reload the
class is another one who try to restart
the application doesn't make sense so
let's let's start the application with
the agent
so the the startup of the application
will get a little slower because the
agent has to do some transformations in
the beginning can build in the hooks
into the spring framework so seven
seconds instead of six let's clear that
one and check our application so
remember we made a change that
annotation so this form is not working
right now this link is not working we
can fix it now let's go and fix it
controller where was it okay search find
so remember if we made a change with dev
tools it actually had to restart the
context so it took two seconds right
clear this up compile go back to the
application actually it already reloaded
the class so it reloaded only the single
class but it didn't drop the class
loader which means that we don't have to
reinitialize the application context
anymore
it's already reloaded but it's not
enough it has to refresh the mappings
inside the framework and once we access
the application we can see it's fixed
now the form exists it will actually
refresh the mappings for that specific
controller for that single controller or
not before all the controllers in the
application and it takes like none it
takes zero from the user experience
point of view okay and probably another
example let's say hibernate mappings so
in this form here we have validation for
the input and we can see that two fields
are not validated right now so we if we
want to fix that we have an older class
which you know uses those annotations to
to add validation recompose that that
single class again and we can see in the
I'm sorry so there's two lines right
here reloading the class owner but owner
is a hibernate mapping right it's it's
an entity so it has a proxy so the proxy
has to be initialized as well and that
is something that is not possible just
with pure hot swap anymore we need to
have the integration with the specific
framework to tell it that hey there's a
thing that we need to reinitialize right
and if you go back you can see that the
new behavior is added instantly feels
like PHP already right okay so that was
the last demo and I'm almost in time so
what we learned today about hot swap was
there something new about hot spot that
you didn't know and you learned today
yes my my job here is done class loaders
probably not trilling you but you can
think of the frameworks that implement
those kind of things
Davis tree play whatever else like there
are many of them rails Joe agents and
the instrumentation it's actually a
broad topic how to do those
transformations and bytecode
manipulation but at least you know about
the entry point now there is agents
there's the the instrumentation API and
well you can apply a kind of bytecode
magic to implement your own logic for
for you know manipulating and reloading
classes so if you have any questions for
me oh I have a little old
- tak sorry it should be boxed yeah so
if you have any questions for me shoot
me the tweet or you can catch me here as
well and thank you for listening</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
