start so I'm very happy to be here with
you today it's my first time in
Singapore I'm very hungry to be to have
been chosen to take part in this first
box days in the airport cannot this
keynotes going to be light and fun
hopefully and I want to tell you about
what I call the IT holy wars so you know
things like VI versus Emacs tabs versus
spaces etc so a leo disclaimer sungeum
naväge I'm known for leading the patchy
groovy programming language project that
I've been involved with for the past 13
years or so I'm also a developer
advocate for a Google cloud platform and
I'll actually speak this afternoon about
machine learning so I invite you to join
my table but the little disclaimer I
wanted to make was that here I'm not
going to speak about groovy or I'm not
going to speak about Google cloud in
this keynote I may be mentioning groovy
at some point but it's not going to be
the main purpose so the thing is somehow
in IT we are working in circles they are
trends we go back and forth in circles
or perhaps like a pendulum one example I
have in mind is thin clients versus fat
clients for example we we had this you
know theme terminal clients connecting
to mainframes then we went to clients
client-server approaches and this past
decade much more work was done on the
backend side of things with light web
front-ends or mobile mobile apps then on
to having JavaScript heavy web front-end
you know single page apps and everything
and today for efficiency purpose we're
also trying to render stuff on the
backend because you know it can be
pretty expensive on the front end to to
render everything so it's interesting to
see those circles we're going back and
forth that my personal opinion needs
more about spirals in the sense that
rather than circling around we're
spiraling we are learning along the way
and we're improving and refining our
tools and practices and also an
additional an additional point I'd like
to make is that you're also coming to
conferences like these to actually learn
and improve your craft etc so thanks to
the Vox days Singapore organizers once
again but even if there's a positive
trend of improvements developers are
still somehow polarized so when you
polarize you tend to see everything as
black or white you're taking sides you
are expressing strong opinions and
you're staying firm on your you know
personal decisions and often you're not
necessarily open to others positions
opinions etc but I think in in the world
even in our you know IT universe is more
complex than that and it's more about
shades of grey but well anyway so let's
have a look at some of these topics that
are actually polarizing developers so is
it a question of vocabulary is the
question of languages is it question of
tools or plots of platform or of time so
let's have a look first of all
vocabulary okay so is there difference
between what developers say on what they
actually mean so let's have a look at a
few example do you know the difference
between a horrible hack versus the
temporary work around the horrible hack
was coded by someone else but the
temporary workaround is something that
you could eat yourself
what about the difference between you
know it's broken or oh it has a few
issues again same thing it depends on
who wrote that code if it has a few
issues that's yo code if it's totally
broken that's others good right one more
example
Doug versus something that's out of
scope so you know what about is that is
the absence of a feature I like well out
so you need to fix it really what out of
scope is the absence of a feature I
don't like or clean solutions versus we
must rewrite it so if in solution that's
when something works and you understand
why but you must rewrite it when
something works but you actually don't
understand it so it's also called legacy
code right so you have to rewrite it or
bad structure versus complex structure
come to that structure that's someone
else code which is badly organized that
we're complex structures obviously yo
code it's just it's complex but it's
well badly organized feel or obscure
versus self-documenting so the
difference for me obscure is code that
without comments and that was
implemented by someone else well self
documented it's because that show code
that you just didn't write the comments
right and certainly the the screenshot
the screenshot behind that's part of the
the first pull request I made on an open
source project like when was that 14
years ago my first contribution to an
open source project and I was so
stressed I was going to be you know
judged by my peers or peers that I
respected and I was so frightened that
my code would be rejected that I spent a
lot of time writing very good comments
jokes etc and this is a I mean I think
there was probably more comments
there were more comments than actual
lines of code and anyway this code is
also it's part of the the groovy code
base but it has also been integrated
elsewhere for example in the JetBrains
IntelliJ IDEA ID and it's been adopted
in different places so I thought I stole
some of these jokes from this website so
I really wanted to mention it
smart jokes the road programmers and the
say vs. what they mean so I invite you
to have a look at this website which is
a kind of coined and it's got some other
interesting examples all right so
perhaps it's not a question of
vocabulary is the power polarization
because of knowledge so that's where I
might be mentioning group so this
project polarization in terms of
languages when I say languages I mean
programming languages obviously so do
you prefer dynamically or statically
typed languages there are languages
which are kind of hybrids and groovy is
one so you can do dynamic typing or
labor age static compilation so you can
have both actually same thing functional
style versus imperative style again some
languages like groovy allow different
styles to bed update so depending on
what you're trying to solve we might be
using one style or all the other so how
does also things like you know how your
language treats memory
do you use language which is garbage
collected or do you use language where
you have to manually handle memory you
know I see or something like this by the
way are we mostly Java developers here
yeah Java let's say a Python okay or C
C++
yeah it's essentially Java okay and
groovy now I'm almost the only one right
just a few hands okay another thing
linden little-endian or versus
big-endian oh no sorry endian so it's
not the best joke I get so you know it
could be about Labor ii cpu architecture
how the bytes are
are aligned or not or a long wait so
this one is not really cramming language
but for example things like the Oxford
comma period where do you put the the
comma do you put a come up before the
end or not or things like where you
actually put the the closing quotes the
closing quotes are after the period or
before or things like when you separate
two sentences sometimes it can put one
or two spaces people used to put two
spaces because of how typesetting worked
in the bath with what curly braces curly
and braces have okay so how do you align
your curly braces so who puts the curly
brace at the end of the line mm-hmm and
who puts two lines curly braces okay
less yeah so that's the first one seems
to be a more more popular indentation if
you're unhappy with curly braces based
on wages you can use languages like
Python where you know it's all about
indentation or there's also a question
about tablets and spaces but I'll come
back to to that also the the problem
with indentation and white space is that
so did you hear about the Apple FSL goto
fail
bug and when this code was refactored
somehow they must have duplicated the
goto fail online but because of the
indentation since it should have been
put you know are the same Saturn
vertical alignment as the if instead of
being indented the the go to the second
goto fail was actually bypassing all the
older if checks that were following so
that's why well there was a bug there
because you could hack in your way into
that code and bypassing some of some of
the checks because of the the changes
that had been made to to that cut
because of a bad indentation that didn't
get noticed so tabs and spaces which is
quite classical one so do you use tabs
or spaces for your indentation use for
spaces you use spaces yeah
some are using tabs oh yeah
the thing with tabs for example the bill
programming language the Monday to use
his temps and also there's a talk this
afternoon by my colleague Felipe Hoffa
who's going to analyze code etc and
using a bigquery by the way and he will
tell you what's actually more popular
tabs versus spaces done some analysis
off of that so that's a very interesting
talk I invited travelers alright not a
question of language perhaps a question
of tools so what kind of tools do you
use so are you for your bill for example
you use maven or Gradle maven Gradle
oh yeah okay so maybe I'm you still the
front-runner but you know Gradle is
catching up or worse someone using and
make be careful in terms of ID I've been
a and IntelliJ IDEA users for I don't
know like 15 years or something like
that I use a pretty early version of
IntelliJ like when it was IntelliJ 2 or
something like this who's using Eclipse
IntelliJ it splits interesting in your
IDE you use dark or light background
very important question I actually tend
to use light background more our VI
versus Emacs I'm a VI user so you'll not
Allah is not allowed to raise your hand
when I'm going to ask the questions who
use VI who uses VI yeah Emacs hahaha to
wrap up guys ok then well sometimes so
is it because you didn't figure out how
to quit the eye
I don't know if you know about coming
Street it's a really nice really nice
series and just I think there was last
week that they released that one so
you've got a coders who are kind of
stuck somewhere and we don't really know
who they where they are and then there's
a one of their colleagues that falls in
and all sorry guys I wanted to you know
save you help you and he was the the
last hope for these developers to
actually exist via it so they they all
fell into the trap with VI and they were
stuck with VI because you know you
cannot escape the IP don't know how to
quit the AIA so it's a comedy strip if
you want to have a look they're awesome
guys so is it a question of platforms
you know I've been using max for example
for um yeah 10 years or something like
this so we saw that you're more Java
developers are out there some dotnet
developers if you okay and if you said
Java earlier you use spring or Java EE
spring Java EE okay spring is quite
popular here nice and do use dependency
dependency injection by the dejection in
French it's what's on the picture the
dependency injection of dejection do you
are in terms of platforms or for mobile
would you use so I've been it's funny
because I'm kind of a Mac person for
computers but for for my phone I've
always been using you know Android
phones that's a Google pixel by the way
so who's on Android Apple
okay it's quite splits interesting and
also so there's the the mobile aspect on
the web side of things do you use
angular or react angular react or even
you know vanilla JavaScript or something
else yeah okay and there are other
things as well in the JavaScript space
like the tools for building and your
dependencies and so on there's an NPM
and now there's the new kid on the block
with the yarn also for taking care of
your assets like a wetback and all the
tools so it's quite quite rich ecosystem
all right
last aspect the question of style how
many columns for in your style guide for
your code
I think the 80 columns limit was
actually coming from the old days of
trench cards or also later on with also
matrix printers you could only print
like 80 columns or nowadays I guess it's
you know thinner to to use bigger a
bigger number and running 20 seems to be
like a I mean you know we've got big
screens and we're not actually printing
code any anymore so eight columns that's
probably too too small in terms of
things like you know variable naming how
do you name your your your classes
variables etc do you use camel case or
snake case it often depends actually on
the long way to use so if you're using
Java it's more camel case but if you're
using let's say Python or perhaps go I'm
not sure it's probably more snake case
so again a question of time but but at
least be consistent right so if you
don't mix the case in style and all but
just stick to one that's some advice I
can give you a ski versus Unicode I mean
I guess it's probably only the you know
Americans British people who actually
stick to ask you because they don't care
all that much about giant critical marks
and things like this but you know in
Asia we
is a Ito ground etcetera I mean you you
have no choice but to use unique I mean
it's or or if you want to put Smiley's
in your code you know the better use
Unicode as well and also finally one of
the first contributions I made when I
joined the gooery project 13 yeah 13
years ago was to actually fix some bugs
related to anchoring because the the
original two founders were when was
British the other one was American and
they would never test things like
diacritical marks and I was range I've
got the accents and things like that on
my layers so I noticed that there were
some some bugs in this area or date date
formats so is it the 4th of May
you know may the 4th be with you or is
it the fifth of April so I tend to
prefer you know using an ISO ISO date
format because it's suddenly more
readable and there's no ambiguity
Minette when you're using that that's
internationally did you drink tea or
coffee this morning
I had tea I'm trying to get used to
coffee but I'm probably more tea person
I guess and at at work at Google in my
office in Paris I've got a modular desk
so I can stand or I can sit and we even
have a work desk so if I want to work
for an hour while working programming
and emailing that's that's pretty cool
and it's good for you know your back
then standards etc but yeah the work
desk you need some concentration
initially because and what strange when
you get out of the get off the the work
desk it's like you're flying somehow
that's a weird feeling you get used to
touch pad or Mouse oh well so
and is the question of language style
etc but you'll teammate Lee who cares
right you know what's important get the
job done here's the right tool for the
job and agree to disagree because I mean
people will have different opinions but
keep learning and just have fun so well
enjoy the show and see you later in my
talk of course thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
