people coming just for me it's
increasingly amazing big room biggest
one for me till now so Who am I I'm
Michael I work for noq we are small to
medium-sized consultancy based in
Germany and Switzerland and today I'm
here to introduce you to closure so
let's start who of you has already read
some closure code whoa
there are many hands about 1/2 of you
and who've already written some closure
code ok a little bit less and who is
deployed and applications running an
application in closure today
ok we need to talk so what's closure
closures basically a lisp dialect on the
JVM most of the people I talk to no list
from university but have never seen it
applied into a real system in the real
world with Lisp comes it's a functional
language that means there's first-class
support for higher order functions like
the Java 8 staff is packed in to closure
from the beginning in its dynamically
typed which on the first look may scare
you away like it did to me but when
working with closure you don't miss
statically typing at least I don't and I
like static typing outside of closure I
very much the next thing I always forget
to say this is why I put it on the
slides that closure in the core has only
immutable data structures so
there's no way for you to modify a list
directly every time you modify something
like a list or map or vector you create
basically a new one and have to use this
return value like string does in jail in
Java and normally if saying this the
first hands go up and says oh what's
about performance what's about memory
basically closure doesn't create a new
list if you add an element so you don't
have two lists afterwards one with one
element and one with two elements the
lists are modeled as basically as a tree
and you just got a new reference which
with a new item which references the old
items back and every part that knows the
old list has a reference point out
through this old list so basically it's
really cheap to have immutable data
structures in closure and the last part
is not as normally not the best to show
in an introductory talk but I have to
because we need some of these later on
so a macros macros are basically some
meta typing method stuff programming
where you can change your code but you
will see if any question arises just try
to interrupt me I can't see you very
well because it's very shiny here but I
try so as an introduction Airy let's go
into a show let's see where I got it
I think it's hidden here I hope so for
this large enough
a little bit slow it runs on the JVM so
medically there was a rapper and we can
just start exploring closure a little
bit so start let's start with the data
structures so we have four examples
numbers one or two or three we have as
well floats so a float and what's cool
is we have real numbers with dividers so
we have to ring 2/3 and it's represented
at s 2/3 and if we calculate with with
it we can see though afterwards it stays
like this
so next stuff we have
what do we have more strings we have
crack eggs
okay I don't remember the syntax but
basically this is room let's switch to
the slide then I don't think it's that
so numbers strings characters as well as
what double quotes of course reg X
basically function names or variable
names so reference names we have
keywords keywords I don't know who of
you knows Ruby basically these are the
same as Ruby so everywhere I type double
column first it's the same like in Java
you know we have lists lists have these
round brackets normal packets and
multiple items are separated by space
but if it fits you more you can put a
comma there just to make it more
appealing like a real list and because
it's dynamically typed you can see you
can mix and match you can mix different
types of course then we have vectors
vectors are basically like lists but not
exactly because they differ where you
put the next element so on a list is
added to the front and on the vector is
added on the tail basically we have sets
like a normal set we have maps basically
as is known a key value you can put the
comma to separate multiple entries but
you can omit it and then it expects
tuples of course and last but not least
we have billions true and false and the
famous nil
Nils not
and because I mentioned billions
basically everything enclosure as true
except false and nil so you can use
needle to detect the false branch in an
if for example so syntax you've just
seen it so this slide contains
everything okay to fast this slide
contains every syntax you see in a
normal closure program so basically
because it's a lisp
it's just handles lists so you see many
parent eases but if you're interested I
can show you that of that these are not
more apparent teasers than in a normal
Java program they just are in another
place and this looks very strange for
our eye so Ritchie ghee which is
inventor of closure normally says syntax
you've just seen it though you don't
have to reserve more of your mind to
think about syntax because it's so
simple
so the next thing a functions and I can
go to the wrapper here again so
basically what's the function a function
is something that's defined for example
plus and then you can give multiple
arguments to it and it calculates it I
hope that's right and now you see how
syntax and data structures are the same
I'm just using a list and by default
closure interpret every list it sees the
first item as a function reference and
every item afterwards is an argument to
this function this is why I can't define
a list like
fool bar okay it's segment okay
that example I can explain this later or
I will fool so basically is tries to
execute some function which it doesn't
know exists because the string is not
spring foo is not a function so you have
to quote lisps lists so now I have a
list that's a little bit tricky to grasp
on the first first time so next example
if I have a map for example corn flew
whose ba borrowers
foo I can look up the value of a key by
just using the keyword as a function so
besides being the same in every place
keywords can be used for lookup in maps
and I forgot to say there is no concept
of classes or something like that in
closure so basically what you hand
around in your program are always
closure data structures so where you
would create a class person for example
in Java you just use a mapping closure
so this feature comes in very handy you
can look up other type of keys like
numbers of strings it's possible as well
but this is the most common case and
then let's define a vector V with one
two three and now we can for example
call map Inc we and this usage of higher
order functions
I assume every one of you know how this
works
because you use in the other eight who
does not okay so basically just to
explain it map takes a function and the
vector or a list and applies this
function to every element of the list
and returns up the result and I said
collections are immutable so if we print
we here it doesn't it hasn't changed so
basically if I wanted to remember this I
have to define it in another variable
for example okay so the next step would
be to define your own function and for
this there's an keyword and reference
function or let's maybe skip this part
or let's go to slides so we've seen this
I hope nothing unexpected next part is
about how do we define functions and
here therefore we use a reference FN
which creates a function and at the
first argument it expects in vector
which just states all your variables
your input arguments and as in second
argument you give the function body so
now we've created our own head function
but unfortunately without a name so that
would be the Neffs next step so what we
can do because functions are first class
citizen we can just assign a function to
variable so now our function has the
name at and can be used everywhere and
because this is so common and you see it
everywhere in the closure world there's
of course a shortcut which is another
symbol Devon and then basically just
take the function name at the first
meant and then the input parameters and
the body so that's the shortest closure
introductory at least I can give if
you're interested there are a lot of
resources a closure access side of the
projects will air of the project then
cognate Act which is a US company who
only works with closure provides the
state of closure a 2015 survey I'm not
sure of thousand 2016 edition yet
yucks is another company who uses
closure in the wild which has rudders
like the salt box one I if I imagine
correct and closure toolbox is basically
like Ruby toolbox if you have a problem
and searching for a library you can just
type text formatting and it shows you a
list of libraries you can use for it so
closure explained now to the funny thing
web applications and if we think of a
web application it's basically like this
there's an HTTP request some magic and
finally a response which comes back and
this is just a function basically edge
of a function with one input argument
and which produces an output and this is
why it perfectly fits to closure because
it's a function language it's very easy
to express these functions so if you
imagine and you've seen the syntax how
could such a fence function be defined
oh basically it has a name it takes one
argument request and it produces some
HTTP response and if you imagine that
could be some HTTP response we have
state status code we have
some headers and we have a body done and
ethically that's what the closure web
libraries frameworks are all about and
the most common one who is which is
library and the specification at the
same time is a ring and what's cool
about ringers they provided the
specification of what a web application
means to closure and everyone else in
the closure Universal agreed so
basically every closure library which
has something to do with web uses the
ring specification so you can change
them you can plug them together and
basically every time you do it it works
so what is ring ring says oh I don't
have to invent this part there are lots
of J of Java HTTP servers like Tomcat or
jetty so basically we start up there we
don't want to go to the to the wire
below or on the top in this case so what
we define is what a dozen a server
adapter has to provide so that in web
app can be plugged in and they have five
concepts so the first one is they define
what isn't request so what's the input
parameter of my function and they just
says the suspect says it has an URI
which is for example slash Creed it may
have a query string if you have if the
user submitted one with the question
mark of course it has a method get post
put delete options head I think I got
them all and you get headers as well the
client sends and there's a body as well
which is emitted on this slide so
basically that's in request so if you
haven't request we need to know how
response looks like and it basically is
the same as I showed before hand so you
said set the status code you can set
headers and you can respond with the
body and then the next part which in the
java word you know it on the from the
name controller is a handler so ring
says a handler a thumb thing that takes
and request as an input argument and
returns a response which fulfills the
specification given nothing new next
part the adapter if you remember the
picture the first picture of this this
chapter and the the task of an adapter
is just to translate a proprietary HTTP
response and to HTTP request object to
these maps so basically they are
multiple out there jetty and tomcat of
course then there's a generic servlet
adapter which you can plug where you can
deploy your closure web application to
any application so out of there and then
there are a few other implementations I
gave for white fly there should be one
or under tau to be exact and HTTP kids
is a closure based implementation so you
can choose basically what adapter you
want to use the next part is middleware
in the normal Java EE
specification this is called filters
basically a middleware gets in handler
as an argument and wrap something around
this Handler and returns a new function
so basically this is a handler like I
showed the screed controller and we
return a new function which also has the
signature of a
of a handler so it takes in requests and
produces a response and in this case I
just print the request in the begin then
I call through to the handler but I
don't have to I could stop here and do
some random stuff I print the response
and finally I return the response so
basically a logging filter could look
like this and there are multiple
libraries which provide you with common
filters for example to convert a closure
map to a JSON object or for security
reasons or for logging offer anything
else okay these are the most common one
ring defaults and twin Jason so
basically our app afterwards looks like
like this we have an Java HTTP server we
have the server adapter the request goes
through multiple layers of middleware
goes through your app your handler and
bubbles up again so the next question
normally is wow we have a handler which
handles one request and produces one
response now we can fulfill a single
page application but what about if you
need to deliver two endpoints or three
or four or five you get the case and
ring has no answer to it ring stop there
and the next layer which needs to be
introduced some kind of routing layer
and here you have multiple choices
because every one of these adheres to
the ring specification and I've picked
composure because composure is nice to
be shown but I will tell you the
alternatives afterwards so what does
composure basically do composure gives
us DSL lie
language enclosure which then produces a
handler which takes requests and
produces a response but internally
dispatches to another handler which you
can register under given URI or for a
specific HTTP method so it looks like
this we define a handler and says this
handler is for the method get on the URI
hello we see later why this vector there
and then you produce your result and
there I can omit this status stuff
because composure itself knows you are
returning an HTTP response and so if you
don't specify your own status code it
says it's just to 200 and if I call this
handler so basically these are testable
if because it's only in closure function
I can call it in my closure code if I
could give it such requests it produces
a body of course and if I change the
request method and use the wrong one it
just says there so I couldn't handle it
so this get hello it seems like it isn't
just in function call but it's in macro
so we have to do a little excursion into
macros it won't hurt you I promise
basically composure a closure uses two
steps to translate or to to process your
threaten source code the first one is
text so in my rep low in my file I just
have characters and text which is
closure code and then the first thing if
it passes through reading
who takes this text and produces closure
data structures so out of this big
string now it's a list and the second
step is the closure closure takes these
data structures and path of them through
an evaluator and this produces another
data structure so basically this example
is I thought it would be a good example
to show how case could be a macro then I
looked up if it's in macro but
unfortunately internally they call to
Java because of performance reasons so
this is a little bit made-up but
basically we can imagine if you have a
case case takes an argument and then
some tuples basically to see if it
matches and if this matches it returns
this if this matches it returns this and
as a default it returns the last element
and we could write in macro which
transforms this to this and basically
that's all and they see its closure is
is there are the closure data structures
are everywhere even the macros are
closure code so you're writing closure
code which reads closure code and
transform it to other closure codes so
that's the way the closure closure Ian's
work but vector composure so basically
this looks like this in the end so a
function which takes in requests and
then it checks if the URI of the request
matches hello and if the request method
matches get and if it does it returns
hello world so it would be the case if
we unroll this macro in the real world
it's a little bit more complicated but
not much so I promise
to tell where the vectors form and
basically it's for extracting past
variables out of the URI so we all want
to have nice URIs of course and you can
provide this this variables which then
gets stuffed here and you can use it
basically and because you don't want
just one root as I said in the beginning
you want multiple roots there's a routes
function or macro as well which takes
multiple routes and basically even
request comes in it tries the first
route if this produces something it's
done if it produces needle it uses the
next one until nothing matched and
because this is so you need to write
this as often there's a shortcut as well
dev routes so as I said it's a
competitor so basically now our web app
exists consists of all these steps so
below the middle way above a routing
function and some web apps and it would
be possible to even plug some middleware
between these two layers as well if you
need some middleware only for a few
routes as I said there are alternatives
there's a beedi beedi has advantaged
that it does reverse routing as well so
the first problem is to route a request
to the matching handler and the second
problem is if you want to generate a
link you need the reverse routing if you
don't want to hard-code your URI strings
somewhere so BD solve this and liberato
is another approach which is basically a
web machine a long clone anyone knows
web machine here okay so basically web
machine
is an implementation an HTTP
implementation which is which uses HTTP
LC specifications and follows them step
for step so it checks if the URI is too
long and if it's too long you get an
coil back with where you can do some
stuff very interesting
you should look it up afterwards a
little bit exotic but very nice so the
last part before I show some code in the
wrapper as well as now we have all this
infrastructure to handle HTTP requests
and the next step would be to provide
some HTML to the user and one library
therefore a hiccup and hiccup is
basically a DSL written enclosure which
takes closure codes to generate HTML so
I specify this vector with some elements
and if I give it to hiccup it produces
this HTML so if you like closure code
this is very nice because now you can
even write your HTML templates in
closure code if your designer you will
hate it because you are so used to HTML
I get with it later too
and because closure Ariane's
think this is too verbose even there are
some shortcuts so basically you can
write some CSS selectors M by D stay and
you could even use this mechanism to
provide links and stuff but to write and
link it's it's too too noisy so there
are some heavy functions like link to
which just provides
this structure which provides this hmm
of course and the same applies to forms
so there are multiple helper functions
to construct your own forms so you save
from to which method with URI and then
some text fields password field submit
button and so on and as I said now
you're writing closure code for your
HTML templates and your designer might
not know closure probably you can use
some of these alternatives Clah Bango I
don't remember it exactly
I know closure time leave of course uses
time leaf which is very popular in
Spring Framework world and clora
alibongo and in life basically is the
pison PI's in rails clone template
language I don't know the name currently
jungle things and I think zelma uses
another approach basically it passes
your HTML input and your writing closure
transformations which replaces elements
with some stuff so it's a little bit
like a post CSS transformation steps so
before we do the wrap-up we can do some
demoing so I will close my wrapper here
and we provide
we just stop that writing an app so
every closure file start with a
namespace devoxx app and we need a main
so for example you can print a wrong
word I never run this
we see hello world so basically that's
the closure hello world and if we count
the parent cheese's they are one two
three four five six seven eight and if
you imagine a Java program basically you
have public class foo one public static
void main - I have already said - amount
one string args I don't count
these but we are three four five so
correct six seven eight same number from
Jesus yeah but I always tell this joke
because if talking to people they say Oh
clothes are all these parent cheese's oh
it's so annoying but it isn't basically
they are no more purchases but what is
true about it these parenthesis here
tends to grow so it's not uncommon to
have like five or six closing parent
teases after another so this looks a
little bit weird - that to our eyes so
we have a hello world what you do next
so maybe we write some domain logic
devoxx domain so let's say we want to
have function which returns some - deuce
so basically the vector with some
objects text summary go to
another one we get dinner so just a
function so if we go back we need to
import it require the Vox domain and I
call it the mania so you basically can
rename your imports to something more
familiar in in your case and now we can
say print them okay friend learn domain
get to deuce
nothing fancy next step just getting to
Deus is a little bit boring so we want
to add William to dues as well so we can
say it to do and I use an exclamation
mark to show that this function will
have a side effect so normally you try
to be as pure as possible but to say we
have no state in our program is a joke
there's that's all in almost any case
they are state somewhere normally in the
database of course but we are using just
our memory so it's just in convention
and it's not required to add this
exclamation mark here so with a edge to
do summary go to their box and we add
another one more to do okay so there's
no magic we have to define our own
function at to do and it gets them to
the writer so now what are we supposed
to write key and for this we will use an
variable so def to deuce for example
isn't vector and this would be the first
thing that comes to mind to do it that
way but it's not very idiomatic because
you can change the two deuce
if you add an item but if it's done
multi-threaded it will crash so there
are some concepts called atoms which
just provides some synchronization
around changing a variable so we use an
atom which is initialized with an empty
vector and now what we want to do is if
we add an item we want to swap out this
atom with another M atom so we want to
swap to dues
and as a function we want to conjoin our
item which basically just says add our
item to this collection and it's in the
responsibility of the collection where
it adds this item so this may be
different if you use a vector or use a
list or set and we want to conjoin this
item so now we can add to Deus and to
print them to return them we have to
unwrap the value of the atom and the
list they're done by it
so at reduce if I've done nothing wrong
unable are okay I need to prefix it with
our namespace of course
hmm okay let me cheat a little bit
so off to do conjoined I - ah I did this
life demo once before and it worked but
of course now it doesn't work just give
me one more trying to die every save
everything ok yeah I know it so this
because I've wrapped this at reduce in
parent cheese's it tries to execute this
and we don't need it so we have to
delete it so now yeah so now we can even
modify our to Deus and at the third
function let's say we need some get to
do okay yeah um let's save this for
later so now we have our main now let's
wrap it in a web application so web
closure namespace devoxx web
and we define some index method which
got all to do and return status 200 and
at the body that reduce so and in our
app we need to require app as well
and we are
and as you can see here it's it's um
it's easy a.m. it seems a little bit
like magic but these stuff so just
moving purchases around so common that
there are multiple editor plugins which
basically prevents you from deleting
parent cheese's by hand and you can just
say move this parent cheese's to the
outer scope or the inner scope and I use
this stuff the first day you use it you
will be very upset but afterwards you
will get used to it and we use jetty
adapter and here we don't import it on
another name we just refer to specific
functions basically we import just this
one function and we won't run jetty so
these need to be deleted so now we can
say just run jetty and we want as a
handler our web index and we can pass
some options like the port through this
Roland so now if we run this started
and now we got an unrecognized body okay
yeah I'm not okay of course we can't
just call index with our two deuce so we
have to do we have to require the works
domain domain and say domain get I could
use a rapper but it's a little bit
easier to restart okay we are in front
okay
let's fix this we need a request which
we will not use
okay now it doesn't need to know how to
transfer this body to HTML but we will
get to this so we can for example we
could use a cup here so we need to
require I will copy it from here
okay so basically maybe it's easier to
show just this big enough yeah so
basically the same example just in one
file and I also generated an ID for each
each item so there's a next ID function
which just increases a counter and if
adding to do it not just conjunct the
item to the vector it assigns a new item
as well and I've added and get item
function as well which returns an item
for a given ID and because I'm not using
a map I'm using a vector of course I use
some filter stuff here and there are
some more syntactic sugar of closure so
basically this construct is an anonymous
function without a name so instead of
writing something like function item
like ID ID item you can just write it
shorter with this and the person with
the first and single argument and you
can say person 1 2 3 if you have more
than that and our index could then look
like this so basically we are using
hiccough to produce some HTML 5 this
just adds the route HTML element and now
I say this HTML element consists of a
head with a title then there's a body
with an h1 and an unordered list and to
produce one list item for every for
every to-do item I have
I just use some closure code so
basically I'm calling map on are my
items and for every item I produce a
link to some detail page and other text
I will use the summary text and this is
le as you can see and below of that we
just put a power a formula form to add
new troduce what's not there is deleting
or marking traduce as done because that
never gets I never get till that I just
add to my to-do lists and then beside
the index point we have in save point
which just extracts the summary which is
the input the text field you can see
here and adds another item to my list
and after adding I redirect to the to
the front page and the third end point I
have a show and show just shows the the
item on a single page and because it's
only the summary I can only print the
summary here as well and I only of
course render this page if you've given
an ID which exists and then as shown you
can use composer to compose these roots
so we have got slash which just renders
the index with every with with all items
on post on flash it invokes a save
action and on get with these with this
red X or with this extraction parameter
ID
it shows the page and what's nice to see
here integer slash path end is just a
Java function so it uses the built in
Java integer function so it's very easy
and convenient to call from closure into
Java into existing Java code
by just using the slash for for static
methods and if you have some some
instance methods it's a little bit like
this dot to string on so basically you
are just calling the function on the
left side and set on on the string and
pass as a first argument the object on
which this method gets called so this
very easy and this is a reason why
closure support such an huge ecosystem
already because most of the work is
already done and the only thing many
closure libraries do is wrapping a Java
library to produce a nicer to write a
nicer to read clue more closure like
style yeah and but don't try to quote
closure code from Java this is very ugly
but this way works and the last thing is
we define our app and this is a little
bit more syntactic sugar because
normally you would write it like this
wrap parens and in there wrap keyword
programs and in this route so you nest
very deeply and you can see already
three branches is closing and therefore
they went invented the threading macro
basically this now you can write your
code below so it takes routes path is as
the last arguments to wrap keyword
params and this construct gets passed as
the last argument to wrap parents and
there's even this form no this form
which uses I think this is the last and
this is the first parameter so just more
convenience
and finally you assemble it and have
your urine jetty which take this app and
if I changed this to F and close one of
these and source their work to do two
songs de box and let's clean oh yeah I
should use is me Emacs as a lisp user
but I'm used to them line run
so now we have these mailing to do it we
have foo bar you can go into it and you
can add stuff and those worth of this
exception is chrome by 4 looks 4/5 icon
ICO and it couldn't can can't be passed
an integer so with about 66 lines of
closure code you've already written this
more or less complete app so to rev it
up at the function language closure
nicely fits to the stateless HTTP cycle
of just transforming basically an HTTP
request to an HTTP response closer usage
increases so half of you at least a read
some closure code some of you written
already have written something there are
many huge companies who use closure and
talk about it for example Walmart uses
many closure in many places in the
European continent it's not that much
companies that I know who uses closure
so it's a little bit more complicated
clora favors libraries over frameworks
which is nice because you can it's a
little bit easier to understand watch
each stuff done I once Dee bucked some
security stuff and I use the library and
I debug it and I go to the next level
into next library and the last library
just provided one function which
basically did a string equals in
constant time to not be exposed to some
timing attacks and it was very easy to
find out this chain for two weeks now
I'm debugging spring security and it's
not that easy and the community is
healthy and welcome so they are about
five to ten mailbox entries every day if
have questions you get help and with
cockney tact who has some employees who
work on closure I think it's ready for
the future so there are many more
libraries I can't show lining is
basically the default built tool for
closure which uses closure code to
describe your build of course that use
closure but you can use maven as well
and Ryan meant environ helps with
environment variables good one is for
routing and reverse routing for composer
I didn't show it your sequel is a nice
extension on JDBC and closure time I
told it as basically a wrapper around
your time to make you that I'm feeling
more closure like and I said they prefer
libraries of our frameworks there are
some frameworks basically these are just
templates and best practices how to
connect multiple libraries when
developing an HTTP HTML application for
there's duct and luminous or Tesla micro
service which is from auto or was a
German retail company which uses closure
as well and if you just need an API for
your single page application composure
API helps as well so basically that's
all I have
I have two minutes two and a half
minutes any questions yeah
okay the question is about the modern
way of doing rest whatever that means
and using a chloro script I personally
have never done closure script but the
idea behind closure script is you write
closure code and basically transpire to
Java JavaScript so you can write closure
code which can be used on the server and
on the client side as well and I guess
there's a way to connect both but I've
never used it I know some small build a
company in Berlin who use closure script
as well so I'm around here to Friday so
if you want to talk more about closure
or prove me wrong or have some feedback
uh it would be nice if you come to me
and speak to me so thanks for listening</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
