my talk let's talk about Internet of
Things this afternoon the title of my
presentation home sweet home in fact
came from another presentation that I
made a few months ago at another
conference but I like this title because
more and more in home in houses we have
more and more connected devices and what
I would like to demonstrate to you is
that there are a lot of threads assigned
to these devices as you can see we have
for example Nestor mode that we have a
travel quite very hard 22 it's very very
very my more dangerous so a few world
about myself it's quite difficult today
because usually I'm so I'm an infosec
guy and usually i'm speaking to infosec
guys and today I've in front of me a lot
of developers almost only developers so
I will try to convince you that we can
work together better and to improve the
security of all those devices so my name
is Davion Martin's i'm a freelance
security consultant I've my own company
that's my day job and on my day job I'm
a hacker I have a security block and I'm
also involved in lot of projects in the
Brooklyn security conference in Belgium
I've I'm an icy sense handler my blog so
I've quite very busy about my profile so
I like your data mainly I I like to find
data to analyze them to find how to get
some data so juicy data and to how to to
to find them and to prove you that you
have to secure all the stuff and to do
this i'm playing active defense by
active defense i mean that to bail to
better known to henna me of a company i
need to understand how the enemy are
working so i'm applying the same
techniques and as you can see i prefer
black t-shirt so that entice and have a
lot of gadgets at home you can see this
picture for example it's a small project
that I did on my drum because I I'll I
drones and I connected a wireless access
point behind the drone and by flying
cross houses buildings i'm able to
capture a lot of nice Wi-Fi data it's
very funny this is the usual slide
disclaimer so classic stuff because it's
only my own view about the the situation
and i already tried to talk to
developers ones it was really very
difficult for me so the last time so i
only made one presentation for
developers it was in a company to a
private presentation and just after pen
test where I find a lot of
vulnerabilities the next step in the
project was to review the pen test
report with with the developers and to
explain them how to better develop how
to fix all the vulnerabilities and it's
why it's it was quite difficult for me
not difficult because it was not on the
difficult technical point but it was
difficult because we are speaking other
languages and we're we will see later we
are we are in different words that's
that's a pain so a little fun you know
developers so every I this is a very
classic pictures when you start a
project from the top left corner hold it
customer explain it and at the end the
bottom right what customer receive so I
like this picture because it's it's so
true but I'm will play fair and it's
exactly the same in information security
so that's my friends thing I do what my
mounting I do I don't fix computer for
sure I break them what's Oct think I do
because I'm seen as a bad guy what might
both think I do a lot of technical stuff
what I think I do I'm mastering the
world and in fact I'm from time to time
I'm doing a very boring job and the
modem jump so about the agenda today a
revolution entered her home still today
and for for a few years and instead of
speaking about internet of things I like
to speak about Internet of terror
because it's helpful what we can find
and my goal today is to review a lot of
issue to explain you how we came to the
Internet of Things what has issue and of
course on me
gations to be positive so let's start in
the galaxy not so far away from modern
world it started with something like
this I like this picture because I'm a
big fan of this whole computer a biga I
had plenty of them it was early in the
90s and what was interesting with this
computer it was single user it was not
connected so you can develop as you want
you can write program you don't have to
take care about security about the data
because it was your own computer running
locally nothing special at the same time
or friends in France they started to
communicate using the Minitel so they
had online services was very slow it was
her glyphs as you see in the picture and
they have viable to find some phone
numbers to buy some stuff online also
the transmitting a minute l holds the
first sexual services to adult services
and then I connected to my hobby yeah my
first model this one is quite a nice one
because my first modem was very very
slow I think it was a 1200 baud
something like that and I started to
communicate it's not high p addresses
that you see on the screen it just she
donated dresses and new CD addresses so
we didn't talk about tcp/ip at this
moment it was just basic of
communications like based on PBS so very
simple protocols and then the internet
involved this is nice map of the unit i
dunno if you can see it's the date is 99
1999 so it was evolving very very
quickly and finally today almost I
suppose that you also have this kind of
devices at home this is not my private
data center but mine is almost the same
so I've same table same cables and we
have plenty of stuff running in her
homes switches go to receive a big
virtual server for my labs so everybody
is connected and that's the problem
today the first issue is that everybody
wants to connect all the stuff all the
things that they have online if today if
a device is not connected if you cannot
have an application to interact with
your mobile it's no
funny so that's the the motto of Maine
companies and main developers main
manufacturers and that's why we have
some kind of funny tweets I just copy
doodles because they have very very
interesting and reflect what will happen
or what's happening today when watching
hackers 20 years ago I took sprinkles
connected to the phone never will happen
and then the IOT came is the same folder
some furnaces club messages that we will
maybe see soon our toilet tanks missing
blah blah blah missing waters noticed
dog water bowl waters below this level
and we will we have for show some kind
of messages more and more so it's quite
yes strange and I think that we have a
big problem we are facing a very big
problem today really because this is the
key point of my presentation what is
difference between this it's also very
nice quite all computer I also played
with with those devices before mahamaya
but what's different between this one
and this up do you and anybody has an
idea about this divine what is it nobody
it's a computer it's called a USB harm
or a it's a USB stick pocket-sized
computer and it's running an ir m
processor it's running your linux you
can run a debian on it any kind of
distribution you just bring it on your
computer and you have a host running
inside your computer it says it's a
computer with input output CPU memory
storage and so on but we can also
compare the computer to this this is a
nice fridge this is a nice scale a few
word about the scale the picture that i
took is a real one so it was in a lab
for customer was busy to do a pen test
it's not in a shop but this kind of
scale is available in hundreds of shop
in belgium and in fact it's just also
internet of things connected the display
which normally did show you promotion
prices
pictures in fact it's linux embedded
running a basic apache server of course
misconfigured and you can upload your
pictures as you want so if you have
access to the device you can upload
pictures it's quite simple and of course
accessing the device is so so very easy
because the device is connected in
wireless what else it's running telnet
so you can just turn it with a dumb
password on it and below through to
scale system so when you put the stuff
it's also an embedded Linux and this one
has a database because all the scale are
synchronized and in the database you can
find the prices all the good so if you
have access to the system instead of
buying five euros for something you can
pay five cent if you have right and you
can access the database and you can
change the prices so it's quite scary so
the picture that you can see there is no
computer here is today really a fail
because we have computers in every
system if you have something connected
it's a computer you have an operating
system you have a Fame where you have it
has system to boot you have input output
storage CPU and so on and so on so keep
in mind that it's always computers in
the security world I like to present
this kind of principles a very big
principle it solves all the problems we
understand quite easily that's the
triangle of security you have three
points ease of use features and security
and you have a black point inside the
triangle when you move the point to a
specific word you will increase this one
and you will automatically decrease the
two others so if I'm moving the right
though the black dot to the security I
will increase the security of my
application security of my device
automatically I will decrease the ease
of use and then we decrease the features
why to increase security I need to put
two factor auth occasion to use tokens
to use encryption
to do a lot of extra controls so it will
be more difficult for the end user to
use the application and also you will
restrict the features because if you
move the dot to the features you will
increase the number of features you will
have nice nice nice options into the
application but you will make the
application more difficult to use and of
course you will also decrease the
security and this model was valid until
it may be a few years ago and today I
prefer to switch to a square and to add
a new corner the business it's exactly
the same if you move the business if you
if the business needs something you move
the dots to the business side you will
decrease the ease of use the features in
the security i will give you very good
example let's assume in belgium you have
two companies which are active on the
same market company a company be the
first company start a brand new website
with plenty of nice features so
customers can holder stuff online they
can check their bills that can do nice
stuff really very nice company be the
competitor will say whoa have a look the
competitor that just started to brand
new service so it means we meet maybe
lose customers we will lose market so we
need to do as soon as possible and
upgrade and to provide the same services
but it's urgent because the competitor
are already online so you will get a lot
of pressure from the business to as soon
as possible develop new features put in
production and you don't have to test we
don't have time to test you don't have
time to do to work on on with with sdlc
development and so on so the business
will be quite happy but you will
favorability face a lot of risk later so
this one is quite important business
that's and the business sometimes have
also this reaction so resistance is
futile for me and you have to be sure
that they understand and also it's your
role to say no please let's take some
time to do something clean prop
and to be sure that we will not face
secret issue later so I'm speaking about
security for a while but for a few
minutes but today the mark the marketing
guys they like to put some smartos to
prefix mod to give the smart prefix to a
lot of devices you have a device a
fridge but today we have also smart
fridge you have televisions you have
smarted vision but smart is not cool
from a marketing point of view they say
let's put a new API let's let's develop
an app we will be able to exchange
messages between the mobile phone and
the device it will be in terms of
staying it will be nice we will send we
will sell plenty of the devices and we
will get a lot of money from a marketing
point of view that's nice but it's
completely different it's not because
you just add some component and network
connectivity to device but it will be
safer and it's all right it should be it
will be worse because you will open
doors to more you will increase the
attack surface some example that I would
like to review in 2014 target is a very
well-known shop in the United State they
were completely bridge by name in bridge
so the point of sales contained credit
card numbers credit card number when
stolen and son and when they
investigated why what was the reason of
the bridge in fact the bridge was made
via the cooling system because the
cooling system of the company in a shop
was online was connected because the
manufacturers say for remote for remote
support for maintenance we need to be we
need an access on the HVAC system the
Korean system it was been protected so
the bad guy android we had hvac system
and we're able to access the wall
network and to compromise the point of
sale big issue in this point is don't
ask me why the hvac system was connected
on the same network as the point of sale
I don't know it was it's a big mistake
but
that was the reason and they were
completely breached another one smart TV
samsung in beginning of this year they
say that you have a microphone recording
the commands the voice command and you
can say to your television today go to
this channel increase the volume
decrease the volume and some but it was
found by a security researcher that the
television was recording almost all the
time and what you said in the room were
see the television was sent to third
party companies for analysis and the
goal of course was to provide you more
advertisement on the television but
maybe something else but the microphone
was listening all the time come on she's
not realistic another one a lot of
people are raining today Fitbit so
wristband two trackers health trackers
and a few weeks ago in a canoe in
Luxembourg a friend of mine Excel made a
nice presentation because she reversed
the the code of the Fitbit tracker and
she found that it was possible to inject
some malicious code into the Fitbit
tracker and once the tracker was in
discovery mode it was it's able to
connect to another to the victim laptop
and to send malicious code it's crazy of
course the proof of concept the
malicious code is what's only I don't
remember exactly it was 14 of 17 bites
it's not a lot but if you remember maybe
in 2004 when the new pentium cpu from
Intel was released there was a bug and
it was possible to crush a cpu with only
four bytes so 70 bite is quite enough to
crush a computer if the same issue
happens in the future so feed beta it
can also be dangerous another one which
also was summoned in the press it's a
incident bombs medical devices from a
security point of view i already also
worked for several of petals and made
some investigations and some some tests
it's hopeful i think that hospitals are
the worst case when you can find or you
can find plenty of security devices
unsecured devices why because medical
devices usually are high level systems
which cost a lot of money and the people
from the hospital cannot change anything
in the configuration of the devices so
you have devices running quite all
computers connected to the to the system
running were still windows XP today and
batch system do antivirus and sun and so
it's quite easy to compromise those
devices but insulin pumps are also
dangerous because in this case we can
play with the with the life of some some
people because it was proven that the
attacker can reconfigure and say to the
insulin pump send more drugs into the
body than expected so you can maybe kill
somebody that's crazy it was in 2011
already this one is really amazing do
you know what it is no ID it's a sex toy
could you tell me why a sex toy was
developed to be remotely controlled so
Mac top cell is a well-known guy in
France is writing books erotic books
doing movies and son is also a shop
online where you can buy adult toys sex
sex toys and this gadget in fact you
have the remote controller and you give
to a sex toy to your wife and remotely
you can activate the activated activity
activated but when you see the the
screen capture below the senior the
signal stall sent to the sex toy is
always the same so if you capture it you
can replay it and you can from a
specific device you can play with the
sex story of someone else in the frozen
your your neighbors somebody in at
school I know that the face but I don't
understand why sex toys can be connected
it's in incredible and finally cars also
cars have a lot of
features a lot of software if I pay if
I'm I support everybody's aware about
Volkswagen even in engines we have
softwares so also it has been proven
that cars can be hacked and with some
hackers were able to take control of
cars to break to activate the lights to
activate the audio system and some
brilliant i I don't know exactly how we
we we called all we pronounce this breed
but halo breed you know but anybody is
aware of this as already heard the name
yeah was he one hand in fact it's of
it's some kind of framework developed by
google again Google or best friend it's
based on a modified version of Android
and the goal of Google is to provide you
developers a framework and a set of
libraries tools to develop Internet of
Things devices that's nice so we will
have already will be included we will
have plenty of api's documentation tools
it will be so easy to develop but for me
the biggest issue is big browser will be
watching you even more because it's
google don't forget that Google is
collecting your data today Google is
reading your emails know where you are
located via mobile devices but just
imagine that you have a fridge using
this video frame work Google will be
able to know how many times per day you
open and close the door of your fridge
if you open your fridge at night in the
morning and so on so they will collect
connect connect even raw data so for me
it's also a big issue I had to put this
this screenshot because it's a Java
conference so three billion devices
running java computers printers Reuters
cell phone blah blah whatever her I've
nothing against Java when I'm not the
developer I never wrote a line of Java
code but for me the biggest issue with
Java is that it's a very nice target
because it's very popular
if you check so the statistic here i
extracted from cv details calm so when
you have a vulnerability in a software a
cv a command venarr BTW exposure it's a
specific number assigned to this
vulnerability is created and you can see
that starting from 2011 we saw a big
peak of vulnerability Spurrier and the
top was in 2013 with her 180
vulnerabilities only for Java execution
called denial services bypass something
over 4 and so on so again nothing
against Java but it's an eye socket and
in many companies there was a sauce
sauce sauce is 0 and the security team
decided to remove Java from computers
because it's to denver's to use it and
still today when I need to do to perform
a pen test and to do some social
engineering gains against our users the
best way is to create a rogue Java
applet and even unsigned your applet I
send them to the guy it pop ups a window
it's unsigned but they don't understand
then click yes and the Java start m2m
able to to do execute code on the
computer it's so easy to yet popularity
is also critical but because from the
security point of view what are the
goals we have to protect data we have to
prevent unauthorized access we must be
sure that the people reading the data
present the device are the right guy or
the right people of course we have to
prevent unauthorized modification
depending on divide but often if you
have access to the data it means you can
read them but you cannot modify them and
also present loss of data so security
also is very is relative when we are
doing some assessments on tests and
because the security is direct first
hysterically related to the business and
the needs we will not implement the same
secret security controls in a military
application on a restricted network
compared to a sex toy for example
so if their crib related and of course
when we assess the security of the
system it's always on the tee or the
time T so what does it mean maybe at
time T plus one tip is to the security
can be better because you fix the vin
abilities that we found but you can also
introduce new vulnerabilities because
you upgraded from Java x2 Java epsilon
and so on so it's it's a recurring job
and very important and that's why the
internet of thing is coming and in the
in the field security level is directly
related to the weakest point if you
introduce Internet of Things devices in
companies in homes and those companies
are i juiced device are not properly
protected you introduce issue and of
course the attacker we always use the
weakest point and of course the security
must be always reviewed adapted and some
and some and about the weakest point
it's quite easy to order to understand
some of my customers already told me but
I don't have any specific dangerous data
to predict I'm I'm Joseph data so I'm
why should I be the the target of a
hacker of a bad guy a practical example
that I found a few months ago it was in
France I did some research and I was
looking for a flower shop and I found
the flower shop and this workshop was a
very small shop in the city I don't
remember exactly when France and the the
guy in the photo shop was very proud of
his customers and he put a nice page on
the website with a reference to all the
customers he had and one of those
customers was a very big for company in
consultancy can you imagine this guy
provide flowers to a company he provide
for your exam he has a contract every
week it can go on site and put some
flowers at the reception in meeting
rooms and so on so if you attack this
guy you get some contact you get some
badges and then you go to the final
target big for with your flowers you
enter building hey good morning I'm just
dropping the weekly
flowers you enter without control and
you can drop stuff in meeting rooms you
can put rogue devices and so too you
will always you have the risk to always
be the target from somebody not because
you are the target because you have some
rest and some relationship with other
companies which are already interesting
for for the attacker so and in in in in
for security it's got it to private so
we attack some somebody we attack a
computer and then we can pivot
internally and we can go one step
further infancy gaseous developers so
they were pro think of ways to make
things i spy hope so but for security
I'm already thinking how to break stuff
so provide me an application if you ask
me to give a number between one or ten i
will put 11 for sure why we put minus
one i will put hundred i will put a
letter i will put i will always try to
break to to to to break some stuff and
we don't have that's why we don't have
the same vision for the infosec guys
whoa so how the developers see the info
see guy how do you see me i'm
implementing boring controls because you
need to use multiple password you need
to use a VPN you cannot access directly
discovery need to check via remote
desktop via jumpers and so on so
basically i make your daily life very
difficult I'm paranoiac so I always
check I always change I'm checking on
which wireless network i'm connected I
close this do network angle I'm only
using 3g so it's it's part of myself and
maybe that's true I don't know the
business because I'm really focusing on
my job I try to securing stuff and from
time to time I modest i forgot to
understand the business you remember the
new corner that we saw a few minutes ago
but i also some exceptions about you for
you you are developers you are just
writing line of code you just writing
those all the day you don't have a clue
about security i'm pretty sure that I'm
right what is fun of course you have
short deadlines ready to manufacture as
I say the business you keep all you have
lot of pressure coming from the business
so the business when will you reach this
code because we need to put a new
version in production as soon as
possible and some and maybe the worst
you reuse a lot of piece of code that
you can find on the internet and of
course if you incorporate piece of code
into your code you will maybe also
incorporate associated bugs or maybe
back doors we will see this letter some
statistics so to prove you the Internet
of Things is at ho doors more we will
have more and more hose connected on on
the internet and you seem like blue you
have things devices so the number of
tablets mobile phone will stay almost
the same but we will have a huge peak in
connected devices and connected devices
will be available in every domain so no
not only in a home when we have lot of
gadgets but more and more we have also
machine-to-machine devices of
machine-to-machine communication so
devices in in companies will be
connected today for example if you have
a nice solder distributor from coca-cola
this device has a gsm mobile with a sim
card and it will notify coca-cola when
it's almost empty so that's the core so
the dispenser to device a ok I'm quite
empty please refill me and so coca-cola
is able to organize today and say ok
today we need to refill the machine in
this cinema in this city this companions
on some soup do you have always
communication so if you intercept those
communication you can see up coca-cola
don't make the machine located in this
big company is waiting for a refill what
I will do I will bring some bottles
coca-cola good morning I'm just coming
to refill the machine and at the same
time I recollect row devices also i will
do some nest stuff because i'm inside
the company so the different type that's
almost the same slide but in in table so
we have personal electronics consumer
appliance Omo physical nation HTS
II I've solo paso lo pan else at home
and of course I have a module with a 3g
connectivity to send statistic to my
provider so I know him I'm afraid but I
don't have any alternative I need to do
to to accept this security monitoring I
don't speak about the multiple web
becomes that we can find online and the
platforms so basically what are the
different no more focus on different
vulnerabilities that we can find intent
intent of things i'm a lazy guy so this
definition is coming from wikipedia copy
paste I guy to to do copy paste but I
found for interesting words in this
slide Internet of Things is based on
software sensors connectivity and data
and based on this we can generate and we
can build some list of freeing abilities
the first kind we have sensor so in in a
Fitbit tracker we will detect movement
we will detect pressure temperature will
detect speed will detect a lot of stuff
if a simple contact oh is it open or
close the doors open close and we can
try to abuse this sensors so if we can
prove we can send a bad signal to the
device for example once again my example
the sex toy if I play exactly the right
freaking I will start the sex toy will
stop it so I can abuse the sensor of
course software you are also for
developers so you know that we can abuse
software we can interview we can find
vulnerabilities you can write exploit
for those vulnerabilities and so on not
in you it's exactly the same
connectivity small device the device
have to communicate with a cloud service
with mobile device computer and we can
apply the same techniques like regular
computer we can try to play men in the
middle so when you implement
communication between an Internet of
Things device and the core service are
you sure that nobody changed in the data
nobody's sending bro is just listening
to your data sending robbed
sonso came in the middle and finally big
data you collect a lot of information
think about the Fitbit tracker they
collect a lot of data and it has maybe
an impact on your privacy so it's not a
technical issue but it's really a more
and more issue and i'm pretty sure in
the coming years the diagram data
privacy will be more and more in front
of stage so we have again it's a like a
computer so we have multiple kind of
liabilities another source of
information sort of coming from cap
jhemini and so she did the top security
trades Passarella tags identify spoofing
attacks that a modification attacks
classical stuff so we are facing exactly
the same now let's review some issue the
first one yes internal things it's small
device but it's a computer so i suppose
i hope that most of you know the OS
project so open web application security
project and of course as an Internet of
Things is also a web device they in the
head they try to analyze some some stuff
and they came with a list of ten bullet
points so what is dangerous find an
interesting device and you can see that
it's exactly the same as a normal
computer in secure web interface
insecure Claude interface mobile
interface poor physical security this
one is maybe more important because
don't forget that when you put an
interesting devices in the wild so might
buy in the wild and mean that the user
have physical access on it you have to
consider it Aspen see you because I like
to play with stuff and I like to open
boxes so send me a Reuters and me
something I will open it and if I will
open it I will maybe found some serial
port I will maybe be able to extract
some component to read the firmware to
dump the few maps so if it's the keep in
mind if it's physically available to the
end-user you have
to consider it as and save another one
so in the while first those devices they
are working in a real life so it's not a
computer located in that in the data
center people have to start a VPN to
access your application running into
closed at the center the appearance
ringing in the wine so we have running
in homes in companies we can also make
normal you use them in in industrial
controls like electricity gas waters we
can have smart meters so consider it a
spawn because people will be able to
open it and even if it costs a lot of
money it's not a valid reason to not
open it people will always have enough
money to buy the stuff to break it to
even if you break the warranty that will
open it and you will check what's inside
the box the next one and this one is
very critical I think all those devices
have limited resources slow cpu basic
interface don't forget to GUI restricted
memory storage rest api calls how many
framework implement bad tcp/ip stack
which doesn't follow all the RFC so it
means that if you send standard packets
to the to the tcp/ip stack it will work
but if you start to first and two cents
on garbage you are sure that you will
treasure TCP stack restrict features and
of course battery usage which is
directly related to the slow cpu so by
having limited resources today you will
not be able to write your application to
devo code us on a regular computer when
i start my another good example when i
start my study it was a long time ago
the the message that we received from
the professor so i started i I learned
development I never developed as a
professional in my career but I learned
the programming and so on Kobol photo
quite all languages and the professor's
always told
you have to limit the access of
resources if you it's also a good
example if you allocate 10 bytes of
memory free the memory after usage you
do a malach you do free you restrict the
number of competition restricting the
number of disk i/o operations and/or
files and over access on find and so on
and when I see today people running
development you have big framework you
have big api's is it running or not I
don't know f5 oh I have an arrow on line
three correct a five execution up on
line 10 and you fixed and you don't I
lied that's my opinion developers today
they don't have a clue about the
resources and you will have to face this
limited resources if you develop
interruptions devices so keep this in
mind is very very critical and a photo
crypto you have to encrypt everything
communication between the devices but
also on the devices and then we have an
issue first see the the previous slide
resources cryptography use a lot of CPU
cycles because in to encrypt everything
but you have limited resources so if you
have to choose the right balance between
encryption and resources and also please
use good cryptography a lot of people
still to the thing that day 64 / hash
algorithm defy jawan is encryption it's
not n use correct crypto libraries and
don't try to burn and to write your own
crypto algorithm because we fail it's
extremely difficult to write a good
cryptocoryne so don't try yourself use
something already bulletproof and which
is clearly defined and so on so
self-made crypto is bad crypto x9
resources wyd also from the developer's
point of view why do I have to reinvent
the wheel I need to implement we saw
this in the presentation just before I
need to implement a nice gooey we
the feature to take a picture from my
laptop camera so i will check on the
internet is there a library available
some kind of code oh I found a nice
routine nice algorithm copy paste and I
will save a lot of time because I don't
have to write myself and really if we
use this the problem is that external
resource can be buggy so you will
introduce bags into your home code but
they may also contain backdoors an
example which is not directly related to
developments but I suppose that a lot of
you are using the amazon cloud services
because it's quite easy to start a vm to
check quickly so an application and so
on and you have on amazon plenty of
ready-to-use images so you need a lamp
environment you need you need a new boon
to version X this specific application
you just select an already available
image you boot it edit zone you can play
with it but security researcher made
some plan did some research and in fact
you have a lot of ready-to-use images
which have back doors so you boot it you
install your code you start to play with
it at the same time somebody is at first
the vm will phone home to say oh I was
booted this is my progress I was used
and by this guy and then you can do the
body i will open visual back door and we
connect on the host and if you put
sensitive data on it it can be stored so
I don't take I don't think that it's bad
to check for code on the internet but
please have the reflex to do a quick
check is there a back door is there
something wrong and so on and if you use
a library please upgrade them because
you will maybe download the library to
the a version 1.1 tomorrow a blue
chicory tissue will be found the
developers of this library will upgrade
to 12 and you will still rely the code
you're caught on one dot one so please
upgrade upgrade upgrade and follow the
development what what they are doing a
new features
the next issue of valuable data why so
so much data on internal sings device my
point of view is once you collect it in
the device using your sensor using the
the input from the user you collect them
you send them somewhere in your clothes
repository later but don't keep the data
on the device the best way to handle
data for me is to use data
classification so that a classification
means that on every data so you define a
matrix and you define different types of
data you can start with a very basic
classification open restricted
confidential and based on those three
type of classification you define what
you can do or what you can't do with
your data if the data is open you can
leave it on the device it can be read by
anybody if you lose it who cares it's
not a big issue but for example the
order the last example if it's critical
it can be only read by X X person cannot
be changed must be encrypted and so on
and when you define this matrix and out
some kind of access matrix with all the
classification when you have new data
200 you'll in your application you just
put a label on the data and you know
that this data is critical and
immediately you know what are the
controls to put in place to protect
those data data privacy again think
about it because if you collect data for
example again the Fitbit tracker you can
have data about the people health you
can have her beat you can have plenty of
stuff which are very valuable for
insurance company for example so if you
collect data be sure that you will
respect the law and you will follow
especially in Belgium because I created
receive so follow the requirements the
next issue back to the roots the
Internet of Things will be deployed more
and more by old-school industries smart
meters and a lot of smart beliefs is a
nice example because electricity
companies that rely on your their own
application they are doing the business
for a
long long time and today they are facing
a big revolution because they will also
connect a lot of stuff they will then
will they will play with packets I will
play with big data and so on and so know
their business and be ready to adapt and
to be able to write the application to
develop the internal things in the right
direction to fulfill all the
requirements which are definitely
definitely not the same as a home user
so some things to keep in mind in terms
of sync are there today and so I might
put will but they already advanced or
home and companies very important thing
that interval think our computers they
have exactly the same issue it's not
because it's a pocket-sized device that
you can connect on your table it's not a
computer it is a computer smart doesn't
mean safe a smart TV is not safe a smart
meter is not safe it's not because you
smart in front of other device that it
will be safe to use there are a lot of
tools so tools / libraries which already
exist but assess them if you use it I
have a quick look I don't don't do a
full code review but check if the
product is still maintained if it's not
only one or two guy maintaining the
project openssl for example it open the
cell is used in almost every device over
the world and when they faced big
security shoot was last year I think
openssl one I if I'm right openssl was
maintained by three guys three guys and
all the TLS ssl communication over the
world where processed by the code road
by three guys it's quite scary ask
yourself do I need it so if it's more
it's not for the developers but do i do
you need a smart TV that's the question
yeah that's now you can have internet on
the smart TV you can have
channel you can browse but you really
need to Smart TV because the TV is do
this to watch television nothing else
and maybe the most important apply
critical security control in fact there
is a link so I it ma'am it's not
readable sons that or critical security
controls so sons developed a list of 20
critical security controls if you
implement those security controls inside
your code inside your company you
infrastructure you will already solve a
lot of security issue and there are
quite simple to twim' to implement its
its basic rules think about again that
our privacy do I need to store devices
in my data in my devices what will
happen if my data are stolen Fitbit
personal data about my users can have a
huge impact on the company and of course
security must be integrated from the
design of the product so I will not
explain you what is software development
lifecycle developer but implement
security as soon as possible because the
message is always the same I'm pretty
sure that you already heard it but it
will cost you less money to implement
security from the beginning of a project
then the finding big runner bit is at
the end when the product is close to be
released the application where we will
do a lot of you will need to do a lot of
changes so implement security from the
beginning that's all so are there some
questions
it was not really oriented to
development I didn't give development in
for me because I'm not capable to this
I'm not a developer but my goal was
ready to open your eyes about the the
big issue that you will me maybe face in
the near future thank you very much I'm
sorry ah yeah I don't even like first we
are just we are humans so it means that
I hope not but for example I can take my
car and drive back to home have an
accident and I'm gone so it means that
you will lose thirty three percent of
your team that's the first point then
just imagine that one of the guy has
that it's it's it's also a no program
one of the guys as a money issue so he
has lost a lot of money and so people
really come to to him and say oh by the
way if you introduce the back door in
the code maybe i will tell you five
thousand euros you i will take care of
all your your financial issue and you
implement and so you will you have some
kind of corruption if you have only
three guys it's more difficult to have
proper control zone I don't buy thing
tree guy it doesn't mean that the code
is written it's badly written but it's
it's more dangerous just because we are
just human that's more the human aspect
which is important in this case I don't
speak about the quality of the code and
the quality of but three guys that so it
means that maybe you have one guy
writing the core features one guy doing
some more project management and only
one guy doing code review so you have
only one guy checking the job of the two
others is it okay thank you
I don't think there are other ends
because that no more question no thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
