12 factor app best practices for Java
deployment before we get started I have
a slight warning it's not a health
warning but this talk may upset you you
may not like some of the things that I'm
going to say and the reason for this is
that the ideas I'm going to talk about
are not to overstate things but a little
revolutionary but they're they're
different they're a departure from what
I would call traditional Java deployment
what I'm going to talk about is what I
call modern Java deployment and it's
characterized by a departure from this
you take your code you package it up
into a war file and you drop it into a
running container Tomcat jetty JBoss
something like that and this is how
we've deployed our java applications for
since about 1999 there's some problems
with this architecture though it
predates the cloud it predates
virtualization it really wasn't designed
for a web native cloud native era so a
modern java deployment looks more like
this you take your code you package it
up into an executable executable jar
file or maybe a set of jar files and
then you can deploy that jar file
anywhere anywhere that there is a JVM
this jar file can run because it doesn't
have any external dependencies it can
run in the cloud it can run on another
developers machine it can run on a
Raspberry Pi so what we get is true
portability now finally get to embrace
that that promise of the JVM so what I'm
really saying is make jar not war Josh
Long likes to use this phrase too but he
stole it from me and I stole it from
someone else so we've agreed to both use
it this shift from more files to jar
files is not the only thing that
characterizes modern Java deployment
though over the last five or ten years
we're seeing a shift a way from
application servers and towards micro
services so instead of running many
applications in the same process or in
the same container we're splitting our
applications up decomposing them into
smaller more cohesive components
we're also seeing a shift away from hot
deployment hot deployment was this idea
that we could redeploy our applications
into the same JVM keep it running a
persistent JVM but due to firm gem
memory leaks system updates system
crashes there's always a need to restart
that process for whatever reason and by
optimizing for hot deployment we paid
the price of having long restart cycles
instead today the emphasis is on
continuous deployment so the idea that
you're going to deploy your application
maybe as much as multiple times a day
and the goal should be to reduce the
turnaround cycle on each of those
deployments and then finally 10 years
ago I was deploying the applications I
was working on to a piece of hardware
that was in the physical building I was
working in but today most of us are
deploying to some kind of cloud platform
whether it's Roku or Amazon if you're
deploying in-house you're still probably
deploying on some kind of virtualization
layer or even in-house cloud so Heroku
is where I work my name is Joe Kutner I
go by code finger on all the internet
places Heroku is a platform as-a-service
for running your applications in the
cloud without managing any
infrastructure even virtual
infrastructure we host more than 5
million applications and we handle more
than 8 billion requests a day and we've
learned a thing or two about scalability
in that process so I am responsible for
all the JVM applications that run on
Heroku making sure that they work and
that our customers have a pleasant
experience so I've been able to work
with a lot of different kinds of apps
and we've seen what works what doesn't
work when there are problems what are
those solutions and from that we've
derived this methodology this manifesto
that we call the 12 factor app it is a
set of principles a set of best
practices that we have found lead to
more scalable maintainable and portable
applications so it is portable this is
what we've derived from our experiences
on Heroku but it's by no means specific
to Heroku it really applies to any kind
of deployment the mechanisms through
which it achieves these characteristics
are immutability immutable
infrastructures ephemerality
the idea that your applications are not
persistent they will be disposed of or
restarted at some time declarative
setups declarative configurations and
then automating as much as possible so
as I talked about the 12 factor app
today I'm going to be talking
specifically how it pertains to the Java
ecosystem and through that I'll be
talking about how to implement these
mechanisms in a java application is
anybody angry at all right nobody's
walked out and discuss that's a good
thing but maybe I have more work to do
alright so without further ado here are
the 12 factors soak them up I'm not
going to quiz you at the end but you
will need to memorize them the first one
is code base so this is a factor of
principle that states you should use
version control now I know what you're
thinking and I promise you're going to
learn some new things today but I have
to save these sort of elementary
principles because there are people that
need to hear them but even if you are
already using version control you should
be using it in the proper way and that
is one repository per application and
then you deploy that application to
multiple environments you should of
course not manually fork the repository
for different environments that would
undermine the version control system but
and this is more common you should
refrain from having multiple
applications in the same repository this
becomes a problem because the history
for these applications becomes entangled
and it becomes difficult to isolate them
to do isolated rollbacks if you have a
problem with one application you may not
be able to separate the commit history
of each of them you love commits that
apply to both and in general it just
reduces your ability to decouple them
they should be independent applications
now the reason that we see this happen
very often is that it's convenient to
have multiple applications sometimes as
maven sub modules or some other similar
mechanism and we do this so that we can
automate processes or share dependencies
and those are good things
so if you're going to use maven sub
modules or something like this you
should also make those get sub modules
or whatever mechanism applies to your
your version control system that is
making sure that they retain their own
commit history even if they're sitting
in the same physical directory
as I said the most common or one of the
most common reasons for doing that
combining projects is to share
dependencies and that brings us to the
next factor dependencies and the 12
factor app should be explicitly declared
and isolated and you should never rely
on the implicit existence of system-wide
packages so one of the things that that
implies is don't check jar files in to
get now you probably know you're not
supposed to do that but we probably all
done it it's just easy to do sometimes
and it's just easier than setting up a
maven repository and hosting this thing
that has to you know coordinate with
other other build processes but that is
a that's a problem that's been around
for a long time but it's actually
getting quite better there's a great
website you probably heard of bent
Raycom makes it very easy to host your
your maven and Java artifacts in the
cloud so I recommend that you check that
out create an account now the most
common kind of jar file that I see
checked in to get repositories is our
agent jar files so these are jar files
that aren't necessarily a dependent
dependency of your application your
application may run just fine without
them but you need them at runtime so
even this kind of jar file can be
managed so this is an example of
including the New Relic jar file or
agent jar file into your project by
manually configuring the mavens
dependency plugin similar mechanism can
be done in in Gradle this is an example
of incorporating the jetty runner which
is a standalone jetty server that you
can use to run a war file in a 12 factor
app way and then just copy this into
your project so it's available at
runtime
now dependencies are a type of
configuration but they're not the kind
of configuration that the 12 factor app
talks about so before we talk about this
principle we need to define what we mean
by configuration and configuration in
the context of the 12 factor app is
anything that changes between deployment
environments so this includes things
like resource handles to databases
memcached any kind of backing service
credentials to external services like
Amazon and Twitter and then per
deployment values such as hostname
that kind of thing anything that changes
so this does not include dependencies
those should stay the same throughout
your environments or things like your
configuration routes if your particular
web framework has such a thing those are
the types of things that stay the same
the type of configuration the changes
should be strictly separated from your
code it should not be a part of your
code base so in other words don't check
passwords in to get now I know you
wouldn't check your own password into
kit I think but you've probably checked
in some Amazon tokens a database
password but let me tell you something
github even private repositories are
stored in clear text plaintext on a
server somewhere probably in California
so if you're checking your your
passwords into github or something like
that you are inherently insecure so this
is a problem for security checking
passwords and things in but it's also a
problem for portability because when you
include passwords credentials things
like that as part of your application it
means that if you need to stand up a new
environment whether it's a test
environment or a new production
environment you're going to have to make
a commit to your codebase in order to to
change those variables so this kind of
configuration needs to go somewhere if
it's not in our app it needs to go in
the environment and specifically as
environment variables now the mechanism
for this if you're using Roku is managed
for you many platforms as a service will
do that if you're not there are things
like spring cloud config server a server
that provides configuration as a service
but in some fashion you're going to need
to have a safe box and it's really up to
you to decide what that is but once you
have those environment variables you
should be able to extract them most
standard configuration file formats or
web framework configurations have a
mechanism for pulling these environment
variables out and into your your apps
properties so this is an example of a
spring configuration that is not an XML
file
all right so here's a good litmus test
for this principle if you can make your
application open-source at any moment
without compromising any credentials to
your systems then you very likely
satisfy this principle or you're at
least well on your way all right so that
brings us to the next factor which is
backing services backing services are
any kind of service datastore that backs
up your system so things like Postgres
Reedus memcache these types of backing
services and the twelve factor app
should be treated as attachable
resources and they should be attachable
via via a single URL and that URL should
be stored as a an environment variable
so that it can be changed between
environments certainly you'll probably
have a different database between
environments and also so that you can
swap it out if you need to do backups
and restores of that of that service or
datastore you can do that without again
making a change to your codebase all
right the last factor before I take step
back and do a demo is a build release
and run this is a principle that states
your deployment process should be
executed in three discrete steps ideally
these are all automated into a single
step but under the covers there should
be these discrete operations nonetheless
build in which you compile your code
generates some kind of build artifact
probably a jar file release in which you
combine those build artifacts with the
configuration for a particular
environment because that configuration
should be separated from your code and
you prepare a release image that image
represents everything your application
needs to run and then finally you run
that application from the release image
so to demonstrate this the build step
depends on the the build tool you're
using it could be a maven install a
Gradle build whatever you're using the
release phase really depends on the
platform you're deploying to and if your
point to Heroku it's a Heroku deployed
jar or a maven Broker deploy if you're
playing with docker it might be a docker
push but regardless of the system that
you're deploying to the key thing here
is it's a single step a single command
and it prepares that release image and
then finally running your application
again depends on the type of application
you're executing if it's an executable
jar or an executable or it's just a Java
command many frameworks will actually
generate a launcher script for you
that's fine too the key thing here is
that it is a single command that
launches a foreground process we are not
starting up a service in the background
and copying a war file into it we're
also not using maven to run our
applications in production maven is a
build tool it's like the parent getting
the kid ready for college and then
sending it off into the world it doesn't
need to go along with it I just use it
for build time and of course if you get
possible combine all these three steps
into a single step and when you deploy
to Heroku most of our customers are
running git push Roku master alright so
let's take a look at how all these first
few steps play out together I have the
spring CLI installed here a slightly
older version but I'm going to create a
new spring boot application and a spring
boot very much embraces these twelve
factor principles so it's a great
example of how they execute so I'm gonna
create a new spring boot web application
called demo it creates the basic
scaffolding of a spring boot application
for me including this demo application
dot Java I'll open that up just make it
a controller and then give it a single
route HelloWorld route but I'll actually
print the value of the home environment
variable that'll let me see what actual
platform I'm running on and then I'll
run maven clean install locally that's
going to download my dependencies
compile my code and ultimately generate
a single jar file and this jar file
contains everything my application needs
to run in production it contains it the
dependencies the static configuration
and I can run it with a single Java dash
jar command and when I do that spring
will start up it'll start the embedded
Tomcat container I'm not launching a
separate container and then I can vary
quickly view it in the browser and there
you see it's running on my machine so
it's users J Kutner now I can deploy
this application because it embraces
these principles because it only
generates this executable jar file it's
very easy for me to deploy this to a
platform as-a-service so I'm going to
set this up as a Heroku app I'll create
my git ignore file and I'm gonna create
a proc file now this proc file is what
Heroku uses to determine that run step
so in this proc file I'll put my web
command just a Java dash jar command I
am going to set one system property
though and that's the port that I'm
going to bind to this is a value that
changes between environments so I it
will be stored as a environment variable
and this is just an example of how many
of those things can be pulled in alright
so then I'll initialize a git repository
so I can use Haruka's get deployment
when I run Heroku create using the
Heroku toolbelt this will provision a
new Heroku application for me but it'll
also provision a git repository on the
Heroku servers and it will add that
repository as a remote target for my
local git repository so I can simply
push to that which will send all of my
application code my pom.xml all that
stuff up to Heroku it will detect that
it's java application a maven
application and it will compile the code
it'll run the same maven process that I
just ran locally on the brokerage
servers
generate that same jar file and then
it's going to package that jar file into
a release image so that's what it's
doing in those last steps there and
because I have that release image I can
very easily launch processes off of it
so I can use Heroku PS to see the status
of that process and there you see that
Java - jokerman getting started on one
instance and I can view the logs for
this process with Heroku logs and there
you see this essentially the same thing
that we saw locally happening on Heroku
and finally her CRO open to a view the
application or browser and as you see
it's running from the app directory on
the Roku platform instead of my local
machine just a few more commands and
I'll show how this is done from the web
so Heroku releases shows me a history of
my deployment so each time I deploy I'm
getting a new release
image and I can version those release
images so that if I deploy changes that
are breaking or cause problems I can
quickly roll back to a previous image
without redeploying my application and
launch those processes again so I don't
experience much downtime and then I can
debug that problematic release offline
finally I can start one off processes as
well so if I execute Heroku Oh first I'm
going to scale my application up so by
running the PS scale I can create new
instances of my application so if I run
Roku PS again I'll see I have that
original web one instance still running
and for new ones starting up and in just
a few seconds they'll be ready to go and
I can scale back down just as easily so
very quickly moving to meet demand and
then returning those resources back so I
don't have to pay for them here's the
Heroku run bash command which is going
to start a one-off process on the Roku
servers with my from my release image so
I'll have the context of my application
available to me to execute commands my
jar file will be there most often this
is used to run one-off tasks like
migrations things like that and so all
of these commands I'm doing at the
command line can also be done from the
web there's a great spring boot example
app on github it has this button you can
click which will essentially do the same
thing as the git push Roku master just
without the command line
when you click deploy it'll run the same
maven process that we saw locally and
then on the Roku servers earlier it'll
generate that same release image and
then launch a new application process so
I can click view to see it this is a
slightly more involved example
application I can manage the app here I
can view metrics deployment history I
can view an activity of who's been if
other people have access to it who's
been deploying who's been changing
variables things like that I can also
change my payment plan or scale up so
just as I ran the Heroku PS scale I can
just move this slider so same basic
principle all right and so all of that
is possible be
because because of these 12 factors
because spring boot embraces these
principles it allows me to rapidly scale
up and to easily manage my application
anybody anybody happy ok all right so
those first set of principles apply to
sort of that your deployment process
your build process but these next set of
principles that were going to talk about
are more about your applications
architecture how you design your
application how you build your
application
the first one is processes and the 12
factor app processes should be stateless
so if you have an application process
that crashes for whatever reason it
should not take anything important with
it for the most part this means sticky
sessions are bad so sticky sessions are
this mechanism where once the user
creates a session their request will
always be routed to the same application
process but they should be able to be
sent to any process as needed however
things like eh cache which are keeping
things in memory keeping state but are
still distributing them across multiple
processes these are these are still okay
all right the next one is a fairly
important to Java port binding the 12
factor app should be completely
self-contained which means a web app
should export HTTP as a service by
binding to a port it should not depend
on any external piece of infrastructure
to do this for it so what that means is
that traditional deployment violates
this principle in traditional deployment
we depend on that external container to
bind to the port and curry request to
our application but in modern Javad
appointment our application is
completely self-contained it knows how
to do the binding it knows how to handle
requests and it doesn't rely on that
that external infrastructure and of
course this is what we're seeing from
all of the modern JVM web frameworks we
saw spring boots just a moment ago Rat
Pack finagle play wildfly swarm drop
wizard all of the major modern JVM web
frameworks are embracing this
stand-alone approach all right the next
principle is concurrency and you're
probably thinking racks you got this
right the JVM has some of the best
currency libraries available and that's
great for scaling up you can throw
resources at JVM all day long and it'll
do great but you also need to be able to
scale out and one way in which you scale
out is by diversifying workload so
decomposing your application into
individual applications that do separate
jobs well that allows you to scale the
part of your application that handles
web requests without scaling up the part
of your application that does background
jobs or scheduled jobs now this could be
seen as me advocating for micro services
and if that's the way you interpret it
that's fine
that's not really what I'm saying but I
do believe that there are principles
associated with a micro services
architecture that are just generally
good and there's something that we
should all embrace and learn from and
this need to diversify workload is
certainly one of them some other
principles relate to the next factor
disposability so this is a principle
that states your application should be
quick to start up graceful to shutdown
and resilient to failure so quick to
start up means ideally under one minute
to start an application graceful to
shutdown means when it receives a term
signal it should within ten seconds
release any resources clean up any
connections and shut down gracefully
without any residue and then resilience
to failure in many ways falls out from
these other two characteristics if you
can shut down a process and restart it
very quickly it is from for the most
part resilient so the reason this this
principle is important is that for a
long time we've treated our servers as
pets they were special to us we wanted
to keep them healthy if they were sick
we took them to the vet you know they
they were a part of our lives they were
in the same building as us for goodness
sake
but servers are not pets servers are
cattle when you need more servers you go
to the market and you buy them if a
server is sick you kill it if you need
if you have too many servers you return
them back to the clouds that you don't
have to pay the overhead of keeping them
around servers are a commodity now with
the cloud with the cheapness of
resources we don't have to treat them as
our special little pets so back to the
Java ecosystem application servers are
pets they are not disposable they are
these big heavy components that we
I always have to take care of but
microservices are more like cattle they
are disposable they're cheap we can
restart them we can scale them up so
again am i advocating for micro services
maybe but what I'm really advocating for
are these principles micro services are
easy to replace easy to modify and
they're decoupled from external
infrastructure and certainly we're
hearing many great stories from a lot of
major players how this has worked for
them all right the next factor is my
favorite I think this might be the most
important factor and you'll see why dev
prod parity is a principle that states
your development environment should be
identical to your production environment
and every environment in between the
most common place this is violated is at
the database layer so if you are using
Postgres in production you should be
using Postgres and development I also
see this violated the container layer
and of course the easiest way to ensure
that using the same jetty or Tomcat
throughout all environments is to
package it into your application remove
it as an external dependency keep it
managed by creating a standalone
application that doesn't depend on
anything else now this is an important
factor because it prevents you from
introducing bugs that you would have
otherwise detected sooner that's true
but it's also important because parity
leads to other principles parity leads
to reproducibility so if you can mimic
your production environment on any other
platform you can quickly stand up a new
developers machine you can quickly stand
up new test environments you can quickly
scale up your production environment and
as soon as you have reproducibility you
are on the way to disposability because
your application if it can crash and
then easily be replaced or flat matter
be destroyed and easily recreated then
it is disposable
so parity is really the first step along
the way to disposability
and that's why I think it's so important
all right the next factor is logs which
is relatively interesting but very
orthogonal to all the other factors so
I'm actually going to skip it and go to
admin processes so admin processes tasks
like background one-off jobs database
migrations these
of admin tasks should be run as isolated
processes so essentially don't log into
a production server that is currently
handling requests and try to run a
database migration or someone off job at
the least you'll steal resources from
the other process and at the worst
you'll crash it for whatever reason I
speak from experience so when I ran that
Heroku run bash command what I was
getting was a new container a new
isolated process in which I can run
commands in the environment of my
application without affecting the other
processes in fact it's almost identical
to the Heroku PS scale command
so as I'm scaling up new web instances
I'm actually doing the same thing
creating new containers the only
difference with that admin instance is
that it doesn't start up the web process
so again we have parity between each of
these processes they are essentially the
same thing but they're isolated from
each other all right so let's recap code
base you should use version control but
you should strive to use one version
control repository per application your
dependencies should be explicitly
managed don't check jar files and to get
configuration should be strictly
separated from quote from the code and
it should be stored in your environment
not in your application backing services
things like Postgres and memcache
should be treated as attachable
resources attached via a URL build
release and run should be the three
discrete steps you use to deploy your
application your processes should be
stateless port bindings should be done
by your application not by an external
piece of infrastructure concurrency you
should be able to scale up as well as
scaling out and you scale out by
diversifying workload disposability your
application should be quick to start up
graceful to shutdown and resilient to
failure treat your servers as cattle dev
prod parity the equivalence between all
environments dev production test stage
and then admin processes should be run
in these isolated one-off containers you
can learn more about the 12 factor app
at 12 factor net this is where we have a
sort of manifesto for the 12 factor
principles it is a language agnostic
methodology so it's not specific to Java
or any other language so what you read
there is very general in some sense on
my blog Jay Kutner on github do I very
often write about how these principles
relate to the JVM and to various jvm
languages so if you're looking for more
information that's a good place to go so
what's next you now know the 12 factor
app congratulations what do you do about
it so I'm gonna give you four action
items that I'd like you to execute at
some time after leaving here the first
is create a Ben Tre account even if you
don't plan to use it just go create the
account check it out I think you'll be
pleased the second is set an environment
variable for your database you probably
have a database I'm safe to assume if
you don't you know pick something else
just set that environment variable even
if you're not going to use it just set
it and then you can start to figure out
how you might switch over to that it's
the first step along the way to
separating from your code the third is
measure your apps boot time so get a
stopwatch take it out on your phone
start your app and see exactly how long
it takes between starting it and it
binding to a port and being ready to
handle requests if it's more than a
minute start looking at what you can
extract from the application what you
can separate out what maybe doesn't have
to be done at startup time all in the
effort to reduce your boot time and then
finally try clicking a Roku button I get
to plug a Roku that sample app that you
saw me demonstrate is on github
hopefully you can see the URL there it's
a great little spring boot if you're
looking to get familiar with spring boot
this is a another great way to do that
and should be very easy to pull out in
Roku all right thank you very much these
slides are on the web and I guess we'll
do questions
I guess yeah sure yeah I mean it's very
interesting the question is about the
logs that it really boils down to logs
should be treated as events not as files
so you know at some point you may be
writing to a file but you should be
draining that file or we actually
encourage just logging to standard out
and then capturing standard out and
that's what happens on roku but by
treating them as events it allows you to
collect from different processes whether
it's your database your multiple
application processes and workers is
they can all funnel into the same
channel which you can then search on and
that allows you to more easily identify
problems rather than having to scour
multiple servers for you know a log file
that's in a particular place that's the
gist of it yeah all right well um I'll
be hanging out at the Heroku booth
downstairs so if were to ask questions
in person just come on down and we'll
chat Thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
