coming here to the session it's really
great to have you here I love sudoc I
tried to came very often I have seen
many Italian people with his rights I'm
i live in munich right now which as you
know is the North societ aliens hitting
in the world we have a lot of peeps
areas and an Italian food over there and
I'm am well my name is Enrique lopez and
I'm gonna talk today about the android
high-performance yes forgive track here
how many people were with Android or
mobile technologies okay that's right so
I i guess you because they think of
performance now seems to be something
very trained everybody there are a lot
of dogs and books and articles that i
hope you can learn something today here
and just very shortly i'm an IT
consultant part of the google developer
expert crew and this is my tweeters here
i will have loaded presentation later
and if you have any questions i try to
be very interactive here so well how did
we start for me this introduction into
high performance at some point almost
two years ago back publishing wrote me
and asked me if I could be interesting
if an in writing a book on android
high-performance I try and lie fall into
sages and then try to solve the problem
which works pretty badly but I think
that way you can also start making
things happen inside old and yeah of
course I'm interested and then many
problems to start coming in like I'm not
having a lot of time and so but it was a
great experience I think also writing a
book is one of those things that we
start testing a lot of your assumptions
I I used to work I've been working for
android for since 2008 so it's nine
years now and I thought I knew about
Android high performance until you start
you know checking exactly like a
compiling code the compiling code trying
to get deeper into networking and
different strategies and then you
realize that there was so many things to
learn that if you want to get really
deep it's something really hard so it
takes you ninety percent that to reach
ninety percent of the knowledge ECC I
seem to get that ten percent a crowd or
that's nine percent exercise really hard
that's what you have to put a lot of
years
so what's performance performance by
definition its how well a person a
machine etc performs a piece of work
what an activity that's a gum breach
definition but when it gains to mobile
development what does it mean what we
thought when we talk about Android high
performance or about high performance in
general it's about the strategies to
create software that is efficient that
means energy and battery especially when
it came to mobile phones because I we're
in our batteries we might be the
energies we might get it can get wrong
when we are performing a lot of
calculations performing a lot of network
in etcetera and that can lead into bad
user of bad reputations or angry users
it's about programming pattern so we
want to make software that extends in
time in the case of fundraising we don't
want to have a master activity that has
everything we want applies an MVP and
BBM applying different libraries that
will make the sober last in time because
if we need to you know rewrite and
refactor continuously and because the
architecture has not been properly known
that's a lot of course and an efficiency
leg outing when we present you is we
need to create a bright hit our team so
that mean like putting everything there
we have a few things in Android such as
marriage sledge outs that anybody knows
the marriage stuff in in android okay
that's one of the things you learn for
example or include or we have you
started said to them it's about security
we want to secure our data we want we
don't want just to store everything
without any kind of implication but
think Rick tation can be decrypted Elsa
so there are a few tricks and contra
trees and how do we a table for example
one of the things for example I how many
people use here pro word nobody or any
tool to obfuscate code ok so that's
that's one of the things when you're
developing an app there are a few links
i can send you later that i can put
later if you have an app and you want
one compile it believe me takes two
minutes and then you can access to all
the code you can access the strings
you're using their two passwords two
tokens and it's one of the things that
is not that we needed to protect
multi-threading when we have an
application we have several threads
generally talk
with each other and we won appropriate
strategy not just using services all the
time or threats all the time because
that will not work and of course
debugging techniques there are a few
techniques we can apply for debugging
with you Ed SDK from you it also one of
my impressions is that that's a
developer we use five percent of the
Android SDK there are many tools there
and maybe actually very nice tools that
we can use for performance evaluating
and everything that we do not open
generally and it's it's something that
can develop our game a lot so why it's
important there are a few aspects here
so it's about user engagement so the
user will will keep using our
application is about cost when i'm a
developer myself now I'm a freelancer
and when I'm working with companies I
sometimes you say this is not efficient
this can take more time it said that I
think if you mention the word cost this
is going to be more expensive or this is
going to be costly it's much easier for
managers to understand so you don't have
to say it this is difficult to do or
this is not perform and you say these
will cost money SI viene will post man
in the long term and it's a very good
way to engage the management people
instead of mundane and when the code
needs to be maintained long time we need
the Weeknd structure it from the
beginning very properly it will be less
expensive more cheaper so that's always
whether to to be able to be with clients
to mention this aspect and it's about
quality so we want to present not
software that works without crossing we
want that the quality is high and
engaging for the users there are a
financial losses that we can actually
face and again we need to present this
in terms of course from Los businesses
we are having software and our users
assen or our clients or users do not get
engaged because they don't hire us
because he's failing it's crossing or we
have any problems we were losing money
their customer reparations there is
always this case of sannin they said
some some trouble it says every few
years a hacker it steals all the
passwords and then they enter into the
email and and then you need to pay
reparations to those those customers
which is also donated with loss from
lawsuits because then they will go to
court and say I lost money from my play
network and recycled I go to hackers so
then
have to pay them and pay the lawyers and
its retina and that goes into brand
equity for the organization if I see
that this is happening why I will hire
your service maybe microservices so I'm
not supporting one here but just to give
you an example on how things move from
one side to the other when it gains to
responsiveness there are three important
limits in software one is 0.1 seconds
that's if everything happens until under
this amount of time the user will not
see that there is any delay the user
will keeping engaged so we need to keep
everything underneath it open point one
second when it's under one second the
user perceives the delay but stays
engaging that's typically the case when
we need to bring said something from the
server storing the application or deal
with it information implicitly and then
the limit of 10 seconds is the limit
when the user goes outside from the app
or flow goes another a screen and stop
using our software this is actually a
very interesting study by those guys is
a little bit all but the reed is really
nice at this time as you can imagine
there were no even mobile devices but
they talk in general about you sir
perception and an interaction and they
have an entire paper with a lot of
examples on how people that stop being
engaged with us over because of these
reasons what this means in android a an
error what means a in earth can anybody
say no its application non-responding
that happens when we get this screen
here saying that the application doesn't
work anymore and gives us the option to
close it this can happen for two reasons
one reason is when there has been after
an operation no input event in five
seconds so we click to fetch data from
the internet we do it on the main on the
main thread on the you x-rayed and in
five seconds doesn't happen anything
that's why one of the reasons why long
operations is always go in the bathroom
because they block the UI we get this a
screen and then the user can't close the
application and the other one is when we
have a broadcastreceiver executing after
10 seconds that's anybody or do people
here know what's a broadcastreceiver
and it comes up okay that's cool how to
avoid it there are a few technique we
can we can use to avoid it so of course
for background operations we need to
sell feedback it can be this is a
standard mechanism for Android the
progress bar we have the linear one we
also have the product the city cooler
one there are companies that experiment
and maybe they make it something on the
axiom bar while this is happening with
these key is that the operation should
be on the background when something is
going to take a lot of time don't do it
on the UX the UX in general is something
very dummy is something that receive
data doesn't process anything at all
just just presented in containers also
splatter screen this has been for a long
time the evil swinging of Android if you
know Cyril m'dear is another guy from
the google expert program and he has
been working for many years in a French
company he wrote an article geminis in
those this flat screens and at that time
it made sense because everybody made a
terrible splatter screen just something
is standard that the states for a long
time there and then you know the juicer
could not do anything but they're
actually ways and solving this for
example think of these beautiful
splatter screen you see here you have an
animation the animation keeps happening
while the data is being loaded you
ensure that there is not a lot of logic
that needs to be initially loaded from a
back end and thats actually works out if
I series on my application I am I could
be glad of you seen it you have the same
case in over for example and in a few
applications more if you are doing
calculations in general do a worker
thread so you can use threads you can
use services there are many ways of
sending the information into the
background and well to trace it we have
the SIS trays and trays view those are
two tools from Android that allow us to
see where the the the the threat serving
execute how many memory are they taking
what are they doing it set them and this
the games all with the native tools from
Android which brings us into DBMS dbms
does anybody know what that means any
can tap did you know you guys okay I
always forget it's a diving the math
monitor server anyway because it's here
but generally have to check it out it's
like the draws a thread recently in a
Twitter of people that like really
talented developers and they were saying
hey my name is David and I don't know
how to reverse on a whiteboard bubble
sort of or even it's 42 you know
calculate a daytime Joe's I just go to
stack overflow copy the first thing and
wrap it up it will be well this is how
dbms work I guess is anybody here that
doesn't know dbms okay so you're a lot
aware of it then that's cool as you as
you see and as you know i can except
actually a vivir más open but if you
know it i think we can very fast go here
so we have this screen here to see the
the files we have you know when we're
working with the emulator we actually
have access to the internal memory of
the device that means that we can access
to the inside databases of all the
applications we can you see these those
are private folders which normally you
can attack the zone on normal devices
and easier route this is actually
something very cool to try security
because if you have your application and
is stirring something in the internal
memory and you want to know how
securities you just can insulin an
emulator and give it to yourself another
developer and try to him up five
things up from here you can try to grab
the database if they're encrypted or not
encrypted because in a device that has
been rude we can do all those things is
exactly as an emulator we have a few
more things that we can do apps if you
see we have the section for allocation
tracker and hip so from data screen it
gets a little bit more complex that
we're in principle we can track if there
is any memory leak so that means memory
that we're not using anymore but you
still in the application and cannot get
collected if we have a proper network
website so we can track how many kilos
kilobytes per second per whatever we
don't live in etc so it's it's one of
the tools to master if you're not fully
comfortable with this what i recommend
you is taking one day or one evening off
opening everything and trying to
download tutorials or try tracing memory
leaks fixing memory leaks and getting
very comfortable with you this is one of
the things that makes your your android
game really put its really up one of the
cool things we can do as well when it
came to networking is to tack straight
so we can know generally we will have if
you're juicing even if you're using
different
frameworks that says ok HTTP or will
whatever its TDP client is it we will
have different parts of the application
maybe one is one thread is unloading use
an information on the background the
other one is paying attention to the
push notification to fit something else
by using this technique by tagging them
with colors and with VD ms we can make
sense image cool Aziz this is
particularly only one thread but if
there could be data on the other one I
actually did this with one of my
applications that this thread was not
updating but we would see all the
different packages that are being sent
and received on this train so we could
see ok I have a problem with memory
concerned with a network consumption
where does this came from that's a very
easy thing to start so if you are
developing an app in general my
architecture for my app support the same
i can tas all the different networks
rates with this kind of paradigm so then
later if i have a problem i remember in
one of the companies i was working for
the you know huge huge application
really huge and there was a thread
updating on the background and it was
really hard to track because nobody
really knew the application it was one
of those fire situations entire thing
was fire the the other house left and
there was like a new teen cars and
nobody knew anything so I I started
doing that on absolutely all the
requests and it got easier to fix at the
beginning was like we don't know what's
happening which thread is actually
fetching information or not well when it
comes to lay out there are a lot of
things that can that will be learned
here actually you know here in Europe we
have this the television is we're using
the PAL system which is 25 frames per
second mpsc the one you see in the using
the United States is 24 when we have the
nuke encoders that can record a slow
motion there at least 48 the normally go
Matt Matt upper and Gloria still can
occur in I'm televisions and this kind
of cameras that when it came to apps is
60 frames per second on mobile phones a
phone cuts are we phrase right of sick
difference per second that means every
16 milliseconds new content is presented
to the screen that's a lot if you think
about that is more than televisions or
cameras it's something that we really
need to take care of this because if
we're performing an operation and it
gets retarded it's a feeling that the
user is going to have so we need to
learn techniques to paint the content on
the screen really fresh and really fast
about it nested here it is and there are
a few tricks particular tricks that I
would like to pretend you here this is
how a layout looks like in android so we
start with a node we start that in here
it's at the final one sew a button an
image that on there is a relatively a
that is costing them and so forth until
we go to the initial one can anybody of
you think of a very easy optimization
here no yes well I've even know about
this until I actually started writing
the book because I was reading a little
bit more and going deep into the into
the Google documentation and apparently
that is this view that we see here
totally up you see there that's the view
that Google's Android applications have
just by default so when you're having
everything that is this default
container that holds everything but do
we need it generally not because we have
our linear layout our relative layout
the piece at the top of this and we have
a background there with a color and this
layer over there is never displayed is
just a holder but still it needs to be
rendered in absolutely all the layers
and that takes a few milliseconds so
it's actually called the core view if
you want to google about it so one of
the things we can do and this brings you
it takes you 10 seconds to copy and
paste and bring the automatically
performance for your application is
including this thing into research file
which means my window background is
going to be no I don't want to paint it
I will have another one at the top of
that that will have a background and we
have views over debt and that's the one
I'm going to be rendering
so you know hundred is an old system and
there are many things that it happens a
little bit like with evolution we needed
the appendix right many years ago but
now we don't need it and we still have
it there so I see that the curve you at
something like that six years ago it
made sense because Android devices work
in a different way and there were no
material guidelines and nothing like
thats applications were totally
different but now it's something that
maybe at some point will be changed that
we have is very nice it's actually if
you put all these times and application
is execute its really a few hours a
bunch of hours every year what about
layups we have this leg up here and this
is something very basic we have an image
view on a textview sometimes we need to
have a footer or a que there are these
kinds of layouts and applications and we
can actually reuse them I mentioned
before the include laid out that's
anybody or the midst legend that anybody
knows the include one on top I said you
know it okay well include is very
straightforward as you see there it's
Sir the second task is just an XML tags
to say I want to take this layout from
here and put it here so when you're
making headers or footers or these kind
of things that need to be reduce this
study is your friend you don't need to
copy base all the time which is actually
a problem right because then imagine
that your future is going to change some
dimension and it's not always properly
into the dimension file or colors or
whatever by doing that you ensure that
is going to be much more extendable same
with mayor's here we have the merge
layout merch is very similar to to
include but what marriage does if there
is any redundant so that means there are
like an extra year here lucky that we
don't need because we have a linear
layout and then we are making include in
another linear layered and we have an
extra element Marissa smarts and is able
to merge all those layouts and it's a
little bit more fitting we have used
stuff Gustavus is another either than or
I hear about these less actually when it
was released that I was like I don't
really know when it can be used or when
it can be with
it can be actually inflated and well the
magic about this view stuff is that is
nothing is drawn this is a holder and
everything that is inside the bills that
will never be drawn unless you specify
that sometimes we have a complex views
then first we need to load some some
data hours to treat some data to process
it and then later we decide okay now
initialize my graph for example after
everything has been processed on what we
do is something like make the visibility
invisible or gone but you know that
still needs to be first created into the
juror key and then you take the
visibility like invisible or gone but
the view is still there is it was render
and will you stop it doesn't get rained
on those you specified it can be
actually done on a two-way so with these
views stabbed inflate but also with the
set visibility but still used on perform
one of those operators it doesn't get
actually inflated with for complex views
when you're using complex you this is a
very nice trick to make your application
it smoother and you could make something
like this from here so this is the you
just have your fine bidu stuff that that
actually prolly can be even improved do
you guys know butter knife how many
people know that our knife ok if you
don't know butter knife is something
right instead of inflating and you know
having disgusting into video stuff you
just can do that programmatically so it
so it makes your code a little bit
better and get rid of all the
boilerplate code and the hair keep you
where I think in general is a good idea
when also when you have problems with
performance imbues to get use and get
comfortable with this hierarchy viewer
here we can we can open it we can go and
see exactly how many different layers we
saw if there is any dependencies
sometimes you can even have like crazy
circular dependencies if you have been
inclusion and everything up front here
you have like a Ledge AB you where you
can see how cutscenes are painting on is
very comfortable awesome especially when
you are think about recycler views right
recyclerview only getting sensative when
you
first you have to fetch the contact in
an adapter but it to the recyclerview
and then is when you render the content
is hard to do it to do it actually on
the debugger so by this way you can see
ok I'm painting these rows and I can
have different roles for example and I
can see what's the problem in this one
I'm I'm Brendan a lot of elements and
should be on a different way in the
device if you go to the I think I have
an open an emulator but you can actually
see how fast trains are getting rendered
so if you go to the developer options
who doesn't know the developer options
in Android or cousins use them yes ok
that's good then there are a lot of
things also that we can use here for the
with the GPU rendering we actually have
a color code you see like a few bars and
that means like per frame that is being
drawn that's the time the blue color is
the time you need to draw the purple is
a time you need to prepare their red is
the time you need to process and the
orange is a dungeon e to execute which
is also very convenient sometimes the
application doesn't go that is smooth
right something is happening there can
be that a problem with how the frames
are being actually drawn can be that be
a pro language aware where preparation
later let's say how we take the models
from the database because maybe it's not
that you asked maybe it's just that the
database is not being very performant
etc so by using those tools and we have
a bunch of them it's easy to track a
little bit better where our problems are
so this is actually see what you said
about that ok now shortly let's going to
talk a little bit more about memory so
memory is the ability to remember
information experiences and people which
is another campus definition also when
it pains to machines now with all this
tensorflow and all these artificial
intelligence is a little bit scary that
we can think is the same memory as we
have well anyway a noon are they good or
bad
what do you think good well things are
good okay good things they're bad okay
it's a complex answer they can be it
depends on how ageism that's something
because I don't want to get a now so
this is a typical innum we have a safe
and this a can be a rectangle a triangle
a square when a spherical and here we
have something that could be equivalent
right we have a class that have static
final integers so we have a rectangle is
a0 a1 and soon a string which one is
more expensive from a memory perspective
okay the answer to this question is
twofold it Anna for me to figure that
out because I was thinking maybe there
are implications on the machinery sense
women you have like a few articles and
some passion about it on the internet so
what I did was actually compiling a
massive class with a ins and a massive
class with with with a class with the
static in variables i'm going to compile
it and so exactly the size and the
number of methods and we're on the deck
cell so in this example the problem is
that when we are compiling the noon with
actually saving on one side the the name
of the noon and then on the other side
the value it represents with other name
which is two values when we do it with
the class everything is stored at one so
these classes is lightning better
performance is lively that means you are
not gonna end in a problem because you
will not use three million a new
messenger application but still it can
be a problem if you decide to make since
programmatically etc and there are a few
couple of things we can apply here
because the true thing is that a none
sir barry for humans they are readable
right beside with this thing it's like a
structure and if i came here as a human
i tend to reject this a little bit more
even if i'm a programmer right this is
like why it's so complicated so we have
let's think of these tomatoes we have a
calculate surface which receives the
enumeration as a safe it's also very
very easy to read right
we see the weekend based on the on the
case we have we can calculate the
surface in a different way and the safer
theme for using the integral the class
with integrals we just need to pass an
integral which is maybe already not that
the convenient ride is good son into it
what if i pacify for what if i pass i
see if you will compile well then again
it will be in the default case and then
it will not do anything well android has
an in-depth annotation which gains to
more or less unify the performance of
the integers and the rate of a meeting
of you knows so we could do something
like this we could have a class that we
define with a with an annotation in
depth we specified in the names we want
to have and then we will give it a name
as an interface in this case it will be
saved and we will just see that follows
here so we will be able to pass here as
an abstract set saber get shape with the
annotation safe and that way we're able
to to keep the naming convention again
this is not not something that will
destroy your application but personally
I think it's a good idea to start doing
things right from the beginning because
you can always do them but if you get
bored but you never know how much things
are going to grow you never know how
much how complex is over is going to get
so there is a line different a tight
line between our engineering and I'm
being practical but if I in perfect
conditions i try i think it's a good
approach always soon to try to do this
and so in general for enumerations they
create some unnecessary locations is
very review about to use them and is
whether if you can use this in-depth
annotation and well also for memory
constants also i guess that's something
we most of us do in the concepts ago
will be a static to take advantage of
the memory savings you know static
variables will take less space when they
are initialized but I guess everybody
does it well the strings which one here
it's a is more performance
which one to sing guys like this which
one will require more memory cooking the
second one it will actually be the
second one when we were using the second
one we create this object and assign it
to a string when we are using the upper
one we create the a string and then we
call the constructor so we are creating
two two spaces in memory again is it
something that is gonna kill my
application not this one but if you have
a you know thread that using this
continuously and then storing things it
might be a different so also we can also
do even try to do it a little bit better
with a string buffer so I stream buffer
works on a character that right so if we
can do see the stream buffer greater
than the other options it will be
slightly more performant also so it
works in a lower level and also one of
the things with the spring buffers is
that they their vote they start with a
16 characters so if we and it gets
always duplicated so it's 16 then 32 and
64 then hundred twenty-eight so it can
be that you know huge database with a
image is a story in basics before for
example that can be like a like huge
Title II at some point if you're you
know storing like high-definition images
and then we decide to go for this
implementation and I it will double at
some point so it can be a huge
difference if we know where we can pre
calculator we have some limitation and
know how big our screens are going to be
we can start with a string buffer
initial itís like this we can specify
the how big it needs to be and then we
can start appending the strings and then
it will automatically get doubled if if
that needs to happen but we can control
this from the beginning the memory leaks
a memory leaks is a type of resource
that occurs when a computer program
incorrectly
these memory allocations in a way that
memory is no longer needed which is no
longer needed is not released that's
like Wikipedia because Cambridge didn't
cover the Keynesian from memory leak so
static fields here we have a static view
you think this is a good practice or a
bad practice good but who thinks is good
okay not good very well so that's one of
the problems just see how these how've
you said you know how user started right
we have like a constructor for them and
in the constructor within the context
when they are initialized and this is
what happens the context gets we call to
the sapper and the contents get get all
the time refer so that can be terrible
how if you know how the Java Virtual
Machine Works when something is not
reference i by any variable then the
java garbage collected at something we
have an internal clock and an internal
mechanism but at some point they collect
these variables when they're they're
garbage can be garbage collected if we
have a static variable one view one life
can be still active that is referred by
the view and the view still active and
we can enter in a memory which is that
going to stay there for even a never and
will never be collective and it's it's
actually a problem Aoife if you want
today when you go home and have some
free time take the applications you work
with and start with the DDMS and see the
memory allocator allocator play with
them and see how even if you go to the
main screen afterwards very likely you
will have a ghost it happens to
everybody you will see that there are
few memory leaves that you have in
control properly known as a beginner
classes that's something that well we
see here and a symptoms now there are
not many a scene test because we're in
2017 but at some point everybody chooses
the center's now we lack in we have
another things that can be better or
worse for background networking and the
class the clattering classes we have
reactive Java which can be good if used
properly one of the problems with this
instan is that when we started cintas
from the oncreate be a scientist will
have a reference
to the main class and the main class
have a life cycle doesn't mean that is
going to be kill all the time but then
they think that kindness will be running
and we want to kill the activity but we
have an Essene test and then we start
again in a memory leak and nothing gets
collected on an Essene test can do
things that says done downloading an
image in memory imagine that we are done
loading the mem the image with story but
then we cannot close or we cannot
collect the BS in touch that's that can
be a few mega a few kilobytes in memory
that we were having them and is still
there and we'll make a good application
verismo memory leaks is one of those
things that can definitely kill your app
because you you can end up with mega
bytes in memory so there is one thing
that I think it takes some time until
you get to know them and get to use them
properly but when you feel comfortable
with these with the weak references it's
also one of the things that will make
your code match better so weak reference
is pretty much it's something that you
can how many people have used here the
weak references okay if you just I use
for example in alice i think it was in
the old objective-c it was a little bit
more pressing because you could have
something like that weak and strong and
so and in job and generally something
that was not very not very useful things
but well the thing is that with these
with these weak reference when something
is not is not being used the reference
is weak that means that the garbage
collector can also take it this leads
into another problems but for the
situations when we want about memory
leaks it can also help us soon to
properly finish them I has a lot of pros
and Contras there are weak references
there are some references are references
and phantom references so it's not
something that is easy to understand it
prolly tase you some time to understand
all the categories and use them but
getting the recipes by them i can i can
definitely tell you that will help you a
lot soon to develop in java on 400
thriving so evan is the methods of hair
removal originating in asia that was a
Wikipedia definition that is not our
definition
so spreading is the smallest sequence of
programmed instructions that can be
managed independently by a scheduler I
wikipedian there are a few a lot of
things in and we have a things that we
have loaders we have threads I thing
here what you need is to know your were
the word you're fighting do I need to
download a lot of data do we need to do
things on whatever threads etcetera so I
will because I think that's one of the
things that you probably have deal with
masters and so the BS in task is it has
been always a traditional as i said i
don't see many people use them some
examples in the google documentation
they basically communicate a worker
thread with the UI so we use it for
performing background operation as a
general rule do you need you do not need
to communicate with the UI you do not
need to communicate to the user some
similar to notify then use only than a
same task and also it be a sin taxes all
the parameters void i work as a
consultant and i see a lot of code and i
see many times that people have a center
that our boy boy boy in the three
parameters then you don't need an
asymptote because you're not notifying
anything the same path loader is it
similar to the feature has the same
features as a hint of the sinter so
pretty much we do see to fed straight
and notify but it has is independent
from the activity lifecycle you know and
i think that case depending on the
activity lifecycle this one is totally
independent and has some data caching
mechanism so we can catch something and
not have been not serving obligated to
somebody's all the time this is how we
start on a syntax loader so very easy we
just sent from a team that loader with
passing the result as a parameter then
services services are not thread so
service is listening to defining the
manifest they are executed the UI thread
by default you need to specify i don't
want to expect executive under on the UI
then should never used to start the long
run in operation only a background
operation which is a not long term and
they have their own life cycle as well
then we have intent services which is
the particular implementation of a
service and they execute sequential
operations in background
and for the case of the intent services
we do not need to handle the life cycle
so now going a little bit fast on this
last part we have also network in
networking is the process of
communicating between different terminal
nodes to exchange data that's my
definition because in Wikipedia there
was a lot of references to networking
latency gouging I'm going to present you
hit a few practices that I've not widely
used I think they're very very practical
and can also help you a lot on your on
your development Latin chegou gene is
when we do something like this there is
a lot of code just to explain it shortly
when we are connected with a phone we
can call different type of networks we
can be connected to the Wi-Fi or it's a
mobile network and even on a mobile
network we can be connected on LP or
GPRS what can we do with this well if we
need to unload things that have more
more there they have a bigger waiter
they have more priority or whatever we
can decide ok do this only when you're
on Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi or do this only when
you're on LTE is your on GPRS yes don't
have four exams don't do for example
background updates because that's
something that is going to separate the
user which means bad reviews and I don't
like this app whatever so it's something
that can help you is by default not
implemented in many on the on the
library's something you have to make by
yourself I have for example with a retro
Satana okay CDP my Amber's and what I i
can always specify what to doing which
of those scenarios bad connections that
would traditionally systems like Google
Analytics today they batch all the
connections they went wait until they
have a few of them collect them and send
them that way you know to initialize I
cannot initialize a connection take some
time because you need to initialize send
everything and then close the connection
if you need to do that continuously
you're going to spend more than fifty
percent in just its starting for sending
something that is very small so why not
send everything at once if it's google
analytics I don't care if I receive them
every minute or every two minutes is
whether probably to send them on a big
fat prefetching that's something else so
that means that unloading as much
information as possible when the
connection is season this can be
connected with a larger
the technique I mentioned at the
beginning if we are on Wi-Fi and the
phone is not performing a lot of
operations why not downloading now
information we might need in the future
like the if we have a let's say an
application with a feed of news I come
for example it starts at this moment on
loading the next news so then the user
when clicks on them on one of them is
prepared to read all the content queuing
connections as well if we have a bunch
of requests instead of trying to send
all of them we can create our around
queue with a Q model and then I start
sending them and this way we can also
have a very structure if something fails
for example I can't resend it or keep a
track of the connections i'm having etc
catching responses that's a manual cash
in but if you use for example okay HTTP
i think almost every framework provides
a case in occasion mechanism to one
extent but back in the time there was it
that was not so common so we need to
implement it by ourselves in general I
think Athena said something great
because I can't think of a lot of data
that doesn't need to be updated all the
time then best practices last modified
when something has been modified a
cotton be modified we can cut this cable
on the server that phase eight this
there is no modifications here and try
to download it again that's when it
needs some interaction with the server
but it's also very easy to implement and
then the exponential back-off that's
that something just works in a very easy
assumption if I'm trying to communicate
with the server and I get a 500 and then
I try again and I get another 500 and so
forth it's very smart but so I assume
that server is down and it's not going
to work in the immediate future so why
keep on trying it's much better just to
adopt its technique which means i will
something fails i will try two seconds
then four then eight i start growing the
time exponentially because then i can
save time on my device battery on my
device this is not only about memory and
bandwidth it's also about battery when
you're performing network operations
they consume a lot of battery so like
having an officiant
networking architecture you will
definitely save a lot of other yonder
for your juicer well that comes in
everything I would like to have your
feedback positive negatives as long as
everything is critic if you go to this
website over here and you leave me your
honest feedback and what do you think
would you like more or less i would
super highly appreciated for everybody
that sends it i will send you a copy of
one book i wrote some time alone which
is hundred questions and answers to help
you land your your dream android job i
use it when I was interviewing as a
company to find people and when I was
living this company to work by myself so
for me was very useful that's it I would
really appreciate your your feedback a
lot if you are able to give it so thank
you very much if you guys have any
question something you want to discuss
can be now can be also later when i'm
finishing
hello you said that the high-performance
programming or paying attention to high
performance is important for maintenance
and I didn't get quite catch you catch
that because usually you think of it as
a trade of high performance code usually
is not very readable it's more complex
and it's not as maintainable as not high
performance curve so how do you mean
that it is beneficial to maintenance
this high performance stuff when it came
to high performance in maintaining that
samson is that I want to have a clean
architecture that's also part of high
performance when I'm developing new
features and I'm not adopting a right
architecture I might you know happenings
like presenters with controllers with
views mix of different architectures
which makes this low to develop features
instead of two weeks I need for is
harder to the night all the code when it
complex I need to rewrite components
because they don't serve for the future
needs there are people in the same thing
working with different styles so that
our conflict and that generally brings
more bags as well because components
cannot do with components they have been
using a different exposure of the data
the idea of maintainability is that in
the in the future so very cap can be
developed on the right space for
everybody in the company so you don't
need to rewrite hire more people or be
solving maxbox more than the than the
amount of time you should be doing that
so when it gains to that for me high
performance in when it came to
maintenance is the adoption of technique
such as using a proper MVP or mvvm or no
in another solution like a bin baaz
driven programming for example or using
reactive in the code also being able to
to operate between legacy code and new
codes by using a proper interface and so
if I have something that is very old how
can I make the new code to interact with
this bar without rewriting everything
cuz sometimes is just not possible he
doesn't have the resources so it's
learning those those techniques on okay
now we will bind some kind of interface
pattern or facade pattern to expose the
data while we r I the new the new
features so that all things can be alive
and we can save costs
our question okay there are no more
questions feel free guys to sue came is
you have any question later and grabbing
any time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
