coming I'm Patrick Curran I'm chair of
the java community process organization
and welcome I'm going to talk briefly
about what we're up to in the JCP what's
what's coming next but just in case you
may not know the JCP is the way in which
the organization through which Java is
evolved things don't come down from on
high like Moses from the mountain with
the Ten Commandments instead Java is
developed collectively this is not
windows with Windows what you get is
what Microsoft decides you're going to
get with Java what we get is what all of
us collectively create through the java
community process organization we
develop standards we call them j srs
java specification requests and these
are formal specifications for particular
java technologies and we do these
collectively as a collaborative effort
it's not just Oracle that articles big
competitors such as IBM and red hats
members of the open source community
such as Eclipse individual developers
big corporation small corporations we
all work together to develop and to
evolve Java and I'm going to talk about
some changes that we've been making over
the last few years and are continuing to
make to make the process more open more
collaborative and to make it easier for
people like yourselves to join in and to
participate as I said it's a formal
documented development process I won't
go into the details if you're interested
you can look it up online search for the
process document on JCP org but
basically there's a formal submission a
proposal to do a particular revision or
a new technology there are votes taken
by the executive committee of the JCP
that's like the board of directors there
are formal reviews
publications we publish it on JCP log
and eventually after it's gone through
the entire process that a formal
approval at the end of the process and
the technology is released and then is
available for people to to implement I'm
not going to talk about that I am going
to talk about how the JCP itself is
organized we have a couple of documents
that till it together I call our
Constitution the first of them is called
the Java specification participation
agreement complicated name it's
basically a legal contract between
people who join the JCP and oracle and
its purpose is to address intellectual
property grants and the terms under
which the output of the process that is
not just the specification but also to
other things everybody every group
expert group that develops a JSR must
deliver not only the spec but also a
complete implementation of the spec that
we call a reference implementation the
purpose of that is to prove that the
spec is implementable and to flesh out
problems in the spec as you actually
develop it to make sure that the spec is
accurate and unambiguous and so on and
also a test suite that we call a TCK
technology compatibility kit other
people would call it a conformance test
we'd and this is a set of tests that can
be used to verify that implementations
of the spec actually conform so these
are the three things that must be
developed as we push a JSR through the
process and as I said the jsb a
addresses legal is legal matters the
process document which I referred to
earlier is the document that defines in
detail all of this process and that
talks about the governance of the
organization the way we're structured
voting and so on the processes that are
used to submit and to develop the the
GSR s and the obligation to produce the
reference implementation the tck so
these two documents together constitute
the effectively the constitution of the
organization and the way we modify them
and change the way we operate is
to behave as if these weren't a
specification for the organization
itself we file a GSR to say we're going
to modify one or other of these
documents we form an expert group as we
do for other jsr s i act as the chair of
that expert group and the executive
committee of the JCP acts as the members
of the expert group and otherwise this
this whole process it follows the same
process as if we were developing a
technical chaser for a formal Java
technology for the past few years we've
been working on a series of for jrs to
to modify the way the JCP works
collectively we call them JCP done next
the first of them was jsr 348 and before
we ran that jsr people used to think
that this was the way that expert groups
operated a bunch of guys typically guys
in a room behind closed doors not
letting people know what they're up to
and basically at the end of the entire
process a spec would pop out but you
would have no idea why decisions were
made what discussions have been taking
place and so on so this juice are said
no more of that normal smoke-filled
rooms everything must be done in the
open we want public issue tracker public
mailing lists we want you to publish all
your documents we must respond to
members of the public when they log
issues and so on we finished this Jess
are pretty quickly it was very
successful and we had a lot more
involvement from members of the
developer community and in particular
from Java user groups who found it the
adopter jsr program directly as a result
of this initiative the second I'll skip
over the second JCP da NEX GSR because
that basically just changed the way the
executive committee was formed that was
an easy one the third one is a big and
complicated scary one jsr 358 we started
this years ago we're still working on it
this is the one that's going to modify
the JSP a the
legal agreement this hasn't been
modified since 2002 when it was written
the world was very different the
assumption was basically the sun
microsystems would do all the work of
some consultation with others and they
would license their stuff to other
people who would port it and modify to
create their own implementations these
days that's not the way people expect to
operate we want collaboration we want to
open source licensing so we need to
modify this document but we got to be
careful it's an old document it's like
maintaining legacy code if you're not
careful you're going to break something
so we must be very careful plus because
it's a legal document all the lawyers
for all of the JCP executive committee
members are involved and whenever you
get more than one lawyer in the room it
takes a long time to reach decisions
this is important because it addresses
intellectual property rights making sure
that the terms under which people make
contributions to the process that we
have the rights that we need and
therefore we can make sure that when we
incorporate stuff into GS RS and release
them as implementations of ja that
people will know that they can use them
without somebody popping up out of left
field saying I own intellectual property
and there I'm going to charge you
royalties for patents or whatever our
goals with this are to continue to
maintain our strong compatibility
requirements to embrace open-source
licensing and development processes to
make sure the developers have access to
the test Suites to simplify the IP flow
and in general just to increase as to
the extent that we can ensure we have
even more openness and transparency so
strong compatibility as today GS RS will
have a specification license that says
all implementations must conform to the
spec and must past the tck we want to
make sure that all reference
implementations are developed
collaboratively through open-source
development processes and that they're
released under open-source licenses we
want to make sure the developers who
participate in those open source
projects have access to the test suite
so that they can verify their changes
and to the extent that we can we want to
simplify the IP flow the way that
intellectual property contributions flow
from those who make them to the spec
leads this is still ongoing that GSR but
we realized it was going to take us a
long time to finish so we spun off some
simpler changes into yet another jsr
called jsr 364 which addresses basically
membership we want to make sure that
it's even easier for individuals to join
the JCP today if you want to join you
have to sign that full GSB a which is a
12-page legal document if you don't get
a lawyer to read it you probably ought
to and of course you don't have lawyers
and you have to ask your employer's
permission to join we're going to create
a new membership class we call associate
member this will have a much simpler
membership agreement I wanted it to be
one page but the lawyers wouldn't let me
but the essence of it is just one page
and you should be able to understand it
you don't have to ask permission from
your employer and the principal benefit
that you would get from joining as an
associate is the possibility of formal
recognition for contributions that you
make to a JSR today the only way that
you can get formally recognized as a
contributor is to be a member of the
expert group and that's a big time
commitment requires significant
technical expertise and most individuals
don't have the just it's not feasible
people do participate through adopted us
our and similar programs and after we
introduce this new membership class
people who have contributed in that way
we'll be able to get their names listed
on the GSR page on JCP dog as a formal
contributor to a particular jsr and as
you can imagine that would be a
significant help in your career imagine
two people going for an interview both
of the no technology x they're both good
at it but one of them can say not only
do I understand this technology I hope
to create it and if you go to JCP dog
and look at the jsr page you'll see my
name that that's the person is going to
get that job we're also eliminating fees
for member for
corporations we're fixing a bug in the
process which is that today you have a
user group sign the JSP a as members but
most of them aren't legal entities so in
fact that that's a meaningless thing for
them to sign so we're going to create a
new membership agreement for Java user
groups that will more easily fit with
with their role as collaborators and
partners with Oracle on with the JCP in
promoting Java this jsr is in progress
at the moment and I'm hoping that we'll
get it done within the next few weeks I
have in fact immediately after this talk
I'm going to go and cents a mail to
finalize the approval process inside
Oracle for these new membership
agreement so I'm hoping this will get
finished very quickly so all of this
works being done in the open of course
if you go to java.net you can look us up
and see what we're up to so the result
of all this is basically to make sure
that the java java community process
really is a community process GSR 348
made it easier for people to observe and
to participate 358 will embrace
open-source licensing and development
processes and Jace are 364 will make it
even easier for people to join the JCP
so if there were barriers to
participation in the past what we're
doing is eliminating them as to the
greatest extent that we can so that
anybody wants to help can help so you
know our pictures that we want people to
get involved the best way to do it is as
a member of a Java user group so if
you're not a member of a joke I suggest
that you join one or form one we have
more than 50 Java user groups as members
at the moment from all over the world
every time I do this slide redo it I
have to change the font size and make it
smaller to fit the the new members so
lots of Java user groups that's the best
way to get involved through the Java
user groups you can participate in the
adopted us our program which is a way
for you to express an interest in a
particular jsr a particular technology
and to offer to help out and you can do
big stuff and small stuff you don't have
to be a super expert to be able to do
something useful
a large number of user groups have
already participated in this program
here are the logos for some of them and
there are two other ways that you can
participate if you're more interested in
the implementation rather than those
specifications you can join openjdk and
actually work on the reference
implementation of java SE or you can
join project classification to the same
thing for Java EE both of these are open
source projects that developed the
actual implementations of the platforms
so Java is going to be around for a long
long time how Java looks in the future
is as much up to you as it is to anybody
else I encourage you to participate and
in the process of doing so you can work
on all sorts of nifty stuff like this
Java powered hifi kitchen equipment or
whatever comes to your mind so please
join us thank you for listening that's
it from me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
