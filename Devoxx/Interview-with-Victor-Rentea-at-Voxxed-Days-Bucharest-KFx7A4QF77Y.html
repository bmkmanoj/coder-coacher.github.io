home to the largest building in Europe
and the second largest in the world in
the house of people yes
with Romanian Speaker Victor he's
talking about clean lambdas and stream
what you mean by a clean London stream
well when the lumber features got added
to the Java 8 language everybody was
very excited oh let's use these features
let's write them tomorrow in our
production code but soon after it came
the moment of the code review and the
other guy would just join the team and
had to understand that lambda and we
were being very geeky and we were we
wrote all those very complicated lambda
very obfuscated code and this other guy
called and asked us well what the heck
was there what this car was doing and
start scratching their head and then I
realized that basically
overusing lambdas in your production
code isn't the best idea at least in
enterprise in intrepid applications when
your first concern should be clean code
should be maintainable readable
beautiful code so basically my talk is
it's mostly a workshop that I'll have
the participants work together with me
at one understand what it means to write
to use lambda with care focusing on
cleaning the code and not being geeky or
being look what can what you want like
what I can do so just a very pragmatic
and responsible approach for using the
Java it featured in the enterprise
application first part of the workshop
it will be mostly walk to the pictures
just to get just to make sure that
everyone knows how to apply London's
feature correctly I mean extreme API
also and the second part basically or
interval interweave live with that then
I will have a couple of slides which
will point the main ideas I say I'm
someone who really appreciate that
because when I first on under these
things I just thought what is that I
don't I kind of appreciate everything on
the line
line basis so I can read it like a book
but I accept that it's time to move on
yeah the first feeling you have when
you're working on by the way why do I
have to live a new land because it's a
new language in effect so yes you get
over it and then you stop thinking how
can I use lumbers to simplify to make
the code more readable and that's what I
what I'm most passionate about actually
my main passion it's clean coding itself
and they are talking about how to apply
clean code in Java people use because
rather than I mean the feature that were
added to to a stream API in lambdas
himself aren't exhaustive I mean there
are quite other functional programming
features which aren't yet in Java there
are quite a lot of our libraries like
slag or jewel that enhance further the
API so I don't think that there are
useless feature they're the only thing
that feature that are they're very often
misused as many times people do just
feel I mean when you just want to check
if there is some item some kind of some
predicate something they don't use
directly any match or maybe some titles
filter or no other things that basically
they don't know yet fully they don't
fully understand what can they do with
the wit lambda so no wonder this feature
but more using the features of the other
in clumsy and not responsible way mostly
hurry up this the same the same problem
people are just fair enough to finish
the world then don't care about
readability of the code what are the
clean creating principles apply the nice
I have a theory that I have the core
principles of clean functions from the
Uncle Bob's book and then I try to move
them to the stream and in lambdas and
basically in a nutshell I wouldn't be
able to tell everything now but just me
not so keep your understand short as
possible online notes basically I don't
have any lumber in my project that they
spend multiple roles
no if you have such a lumber extract it
in a separate method with a nice name
and restaurant have method using four
dots notation these
four dots my nice method may do that in
order to for the co2 remain readable to
put a name to the bitten functionality
because you can stuff a lot of logic in
a function now using Java it features a
lot more than you could previously so if
you just speak to the old clean code
principles and you will be able to write
in five lines of code a hell of a
mountain tonight that's not the point
there just don't stick just with those
principle think for yourself imagine
realize that the ultimate goal is to
make your code readable in green for the
following for the maintainer to
understand so at one point then again
don't use checked exception they will
work off with lambda even you can use
some different frameworks to wrap them
don't have more than three parameters on
functions the same principle
there aren't any functional interfaces
in the standard the GDK for more than
two I will have a hard time with that
also and also the most important point
actually is how do you handle predicates
that's the artistic bit of lambda
basically oh well so this predicate you
know testing that an object passes a
certain tests in the bool and tests you
can write them in many places one if you
can write them as blue line getters in
the entities or in the objects that you
manipulate in the items then you can
write as the Buland method in the same
class which takes for that item as a
parameter or you can even go further and
write higher-order function that we I
mean static functions that return
predicate that the most interesting work
because you are working with functions
you are returning a function and that'll
be the closing idea of the presentation
how much can you go and there are
advantages and disadvantages and you
must set up balance and yeah it's more
