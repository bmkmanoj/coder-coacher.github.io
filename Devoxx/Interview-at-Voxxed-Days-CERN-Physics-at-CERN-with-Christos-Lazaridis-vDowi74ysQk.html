where the physicist Krista just going to
call you the physicist apparently there
are more than one of you that's what
they're almost failure how many 50 *
exam oh that would be the car to
calculate right now a turn there are
about 10,000 what we call users which
are researcher coming from labs
universities that collaborate with churn
and they come here to do their research
shall we say on the order of 10,000 any
work at CMS which is one of the
detectives yes now in software
development to CMS you might think
central management system or concurrent
marking sweet so when you say CMS what
does it stand for so CMS as you said
correctly is one of the experiments one
of the detectors flying on the
circumference of the large hadron
collider and my work is to write the
control software for some electronic
components for that are responsible for
the data taking a TMS and what is the MS
standpoint CMS stands for compact muon
solenoid okay Sonia is one of the
fundamental particles is that correct
each one over yes one of the fundamental
particles tell Epsom as we call it it's
like a cousin of the electrons actually
okay and so what we're looking at here
in large hydrogen Collider is
accelerating protons to you is it nice
and I you quote 999 999 999 1 okay the
speed of light effects and on this so in
a serious so there are several kind of
like smaller accelerators are men so you
get to like nice nine percent and gets a
bit more than nine times and eventually
the proton is going to large hadron
collider when I reach the speed with no
sir I remember the number of knives on
you know a lot of water food I've been
paying attention today and and then you
collide the protons so so the every
software developer we might forget our
second day school subjects or our
university because it I haven't done
university physics but
so we have protons and electrons in a
national is it right you start with an
inert gas and you strip out the election
electrons in order to get proton yeah
actually we start with hydrogen which
just one proton with one electron around
it so we just separate positive from the
negative protons being a positive we
just this is how we built our role model
achieve our seven points and then we
hired person empty a smaller effect
accelerator and the deputy so the
acceleration chain so first we have a
linear accelerator which give the first
booster to the particles and then they
go through a series of circular
accelerators that's in each step they
increase the energy of the beam so what
is the CMS in particular look folks you
have for detecting so CMS along with
Atlas are what we call the two
general-purpose detectors of the logical
collider they have the widest steelix
which so essentially they will be able
to try to find answers to all the
questions that we have right now or most
of the questions that we have right now
I got the cabin no exploits of Lex
actually yes on so we're trying to look
for answers to as many problems as we
can on particle physics whereas the
other two detectors Alice and LHCb have
a more specific physics teachers program
so L hcv for example is looking into the
matter/antimatter asymmetry so according
to what the Furies tell us after the Big
Bang we have equal quantities of matter
antimatter created right now everything
around us is a truly matter so we'll try
to figure out why this antimatter
disappeared what made it go away and the
Alice experiment is actually not using
proto collisions but it's using let die
on collision so let nuclei and it's
trying to study a property of matter
called quote quark-gluon plasma which is
a state of matter that existed only
fractions of the seconds right after the
Big Bang is I think English quite cool
and now when you're in your day-to-day
work you work very closely would be with
the software developers
you are here yeah so yes my job is to
write software to control the
electronics and this actually means
interfacing with people also for the
with the engineers for example that are
actually building the electronics and
also people that will be using those
electronics to gather the requirements
and so on so forth so it's a pretty wide
let's say there's a wide range of things
to talk about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
