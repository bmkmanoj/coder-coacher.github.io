the wrong computer come on number three
number three number three number three
no no it's good
start over restart you so nothing start
medicine complicated excellent ladies
and gentlemen today we're gonna see an
epic faceoff of voice UI between Google
Chrome and Amazon Alexa so my name is
Alexa life and I come from the company
called zero turnaround our speakers
asked me to moderate this battle and I'm
gonna do that so you can find me on
social networks because they didn't just
give me a slide with all that excellent
and very important information out of
the way let's does this work should work
one big button yeah yeah technical
challenges already doesn't work because
we are not in the yeah not in focus now
it will work
yeah so the face off I'm not sure if
you've seen those face of or battles
before but it will work this way we have
two technologies Google home and Amazon
Alexa we're gonna have people present
the cases for going this technology why
they're amazing why did they think this
particular technology should win you
guys again a vote we're gonna use some
mechanisms like clapping or something
voicing to decide what's best and we're
gonna vote for the winner at the very
end without further ado let's welcome
our participants in the left chair we're
gonna have Beryl black hat black beard
sidarsky dodo dodo dodo dodo now the
music should come but that's okay well
that's our Victor he is more important
excellent in the right chair we're gonna
have
Victor red pants gamma from confluence
it doesn't work it Fork okay
yeah and it was a Leroy
so guys introduce yourself until a
couple words why should we believe you
okay so a mezzo Oleg mention my name is
borrow Han developer advocate with Jeff
rod and you can find me at J bar on
Twitter I'm a very interesting guy so
you should definitely follow me effort
worthwhile and I'm going to present
Google home today and you will see how
much in this case there should be ladies
that brings is like a Google home to
dududududu no no all right no all right
so there would be no ladies but there
would be here imma gonna be he's gonna
be a champion because a hero you've won
previous battles I am being contestant
and contender and my name is Victor I'm
also interesting person you need to
follow me and today I'm gonna be working
with the Amazon see I have I brought two
devices so maybe with two devices I will
be like it today so I will bring the
heavy guns and I guess we will see who
will win during this presentation let's
see if you would know how to vote let's
clap all together for the start is like
a java typical test that we're using who
using Java six Java 6 now you should
play ok who use just Java 7 who use Java
8 9 Java dine ok the idea right this is
how you want yeah okay the louder a clap
the more you win sorry is important that
was important turtle so additional
information about how it's gonna work
yeah before that and we prepared a
special page for you called the show
notes it's on general that comes to the
show notes you'll find a page dedicated
to this talk in which you'll find the
slides there they are
the video probably sooner than tomorrow
it's all on YouTube so I will link it
there I guess distributed right now yes
not but not there a source code of the
code that you will see very important a
bunch of links of how to get start and
all the resources that we will mention
and not mention today and the raffle
which will be Amazon echo dot yes for
being here and not another awesome talks
basically hello YouTube livestream
okay yeah hey mom anyway so what are you
gonna see today you're gonna see a lot
of amazing things we're gonna do a very
simple example of a simple action or a
skill depending on the terminology which
which device you you cheer for this is
the simplest thing that you can ask from
the voice you I we can I see a more
complex example called pagination this
is if and when the device will ask you
follow-up questions so we have like a
chain of questions maybe asking for
parameters we're gonna see proper
conversation with with this mechanical
friend that you got and this is what
you're gonna see what you're not gonna
see is what you see in this picture
which is a lot of home automation stuff
that is yeah that's not because we don't
want to show this stuff but because
there are zero coding in it it just
works out of the box or in this example
of my thing out of many boxes yes modern
home automation is pretty
straightforward
yeah yourself things are pretty pretty
awesome so this why the baroque start
doing this thing and after that they
think it becomes contagious I also have
a similar picture of my boxes so it's
not about coding it's about a lot of
tools so it's not a particular focus of
this to excellent and this conference
obviously we want to seek the code we
want to see the hardcore action we're
gonna see those things in in right so
let's let's talk a little bit about how
it works and it actually works the same
for for all of the for all of the
platforms you know we need to all it for
one more slide absolutely so it's all
star to is using with user providing
some input and actually saying something
starting with the words let me mute
those guys for a second
Alexa or okay Google
and and then the Alexa or Google in
their cloud translate this speech to a
text right what what people actually
said then election Google calls you
called your URL or in my case cold it
will be eventually it goes to a service
that can be invoked directly or through
an API right and and you implement the
business logic so you will see how we do
that and it could be calling third-party
resources or do some kind of calculation
database access whatever makes sense for
us return the results to this color
which in our case will be
Alexa or Google Cloud and then they kind
of do their thing shows the UI in the on
the screen if there is a screen it will
be Google assistant or echo or Alexa up
Alex it up or there's a new thing with
so they cease and they show something on
a screen yeah and of course synthesized
speech so we won't touch the screen part
today because it's told you to turn it
off we won't touch the screen part today
because it's kind of we know how to all
right continue okay it's continued and
synthesizes the text in case of speech
which is exactly our our use case a
couple of concepts that we are going to
mention a today both of us so you will
know what we are talking about intent
intent is the unit of action that is
performed when I ask a question
my assistant I perform some intent and
then it goes to the back end in it
returns all the flow that I showed you
previously is an intent sample
utterances are the sample phrases by
which Google and Amazon know what
actually should be processed and they're
called sample because the
visual intelligence on those two
platforms actually understand much more
than what we provide as samples so my
sample could be yes and then terms of
synonyms for yes will be automatically
processed for this request together with
the simple yes that I provided and Saha
mm-hmm and other things
yep so today is also working right so of
course the more sample I give the more
real utterances will be recognized so
that's another thing that we will show
you fulfillment is just a fancy name for
our back-end the code that runs as a
result of this trigger from a Amazon or
Google and SSM L stands for structured
speech markup language thank you very
much stunned that was a point right M
which is a markup language for M those
machines to know how to speak correctly
so for example acronyms
should we read them as rest or are est
stuff like poses stuff like organ offs
etc and other other things we will we
will show a little example of s s ml a
during and during our so how about like
we stop talking and let them speak by
themselves
I think someone has to present what we
are going to do excellent excellent
let's be let's be very quick without
this you all know the concept of the
daily stand up hoping and the daily
stand up anyone every super giant
keyboard so you do that so how about we
produce a little helper for the
stand-ups it will report our project
status it's gonna integrate with JIRA
because why not it's gonna list the bugs
that are on a particular person's name
it has to have a easy way to mark
bugs or other tasks as critical as
blockers because that's what he did on a
stand up right and come up besides
coming up with his excuses so this
example and
now we're gonna start in a second in a
spirit of the true ramble let's say Baro
his heads and oh my god you're doing
that okay okay
that was terrible but let's see that is
heads sober and Google Chrome of course
and this is my screen so you might think
that it was scripted that I start but
the mic is back on ok Google how are you
stop okay so let's start with kind of
the basics how do you even start
implementing your own let me enlarge
that a little bit how do you even start
implementing your own action on Google
so for that you have a page which is a
conveniently called action on Google and
here you can first of all create your
new project but also see a lot of useful
documentation etc so M for action on
Google you have two options of
implementing in action first you can
work with Google api's which is kind of
a low-level bolts and nuts that you can
deal with or you can use something that
is called a data flow a data flow had
last week a much better name it was
called ap III and dialogue flow and we
will keep using there III name because
it's so cool I will call it III but yeah
that'll flow is a start-up or AP III
startup that Google both some time ago
for this purpose for implementing
interactions with Google home and I
would definitely recommend you going
that way and what it means to implement
an action on Google in this simplest
simplest way default welcome event is
what will happen when I ask Google to
invoke some action it has a special type
Google system
welcome and it has bunch of welcomes
right Google home and everybody okay so
let's I want you to take a look on this
one for example real quick here we go
Google home is here hi everybody and
just Alexa hello I want to know I just
wanted to show there s SML so what do
you see here this speed tag is actually
this SS ml in action and I have this a
special tag which is break and in giving
time of one second and it will post for
one second for Alexa to a to proceed
okay so and this is how its implemented
and let's see if I can do that okay
okay Google
speak to stand up helper alright here's
the test version of stand up helper well
let's see if this demo works praying to
the demo gods echo fails Google works
now this is all you have your own action
implemented on Google right of course we
will get no defect oh you have your own
action implemented on Google is a
catastrophic oh my god no it won't help
stomp is muted you continue you can
continue and after that you can return
the mics back on stop stop okay I guess
she stopped okay so this is like the
bare minimum you return a phrase and of
course we will get to more complicated
stuff later all right now you want to
see my screen so you in Amazon you
starting with something similar so let
me do this mic is muted alright to this
guy Alexa start stand up helper
hello devoxx people i am your humble
stand-up helper
so basically pretty much the same thing
that baruk just demonstrated with google
you can do it with Amazon Cloud Amazon
Web Services console they have this in
the developer portal there is Alexa a
place and I can create a new skill
captain captain waiting so she is she
was waiting for command because when I
start programming this thing there's
have like more sophisticated thing she
introduced herself and after that she
was waiting for command so she was
starting a dialogue from the very
beginning so now she was waiting for it
command and she's replying that she's
waiting now so on this console I can
create new skill and in this particular
case I already have this skill it's
called stand up helper so we have above
stand up helpers in in this case and
this is how the console from perspective
of development looks like and so as a
result of calling this skill this skill
will interact with Amazon lambda service
which in my case implemented in in Java
and because we're in the Java
conferences it's I guess quite suitable
and my Java code is just a typical thing
that we do in Java we have a plenty of
mid lets in past now after that we have
a servlet and now have a speech lab and
the favorite of all time applets applets
exactly so so what does this let means
is it someone controls the lifecycle for
you this is what let stands for yes so
in this case this is special type of
class and the lifecycle of speech lab
has bunch of method methods that I need
to implement so on session started on
launch on intent we're going to be
talking about own intent method a lot
and when the session like conversational
session was ended so in my in my in my
application I implemented
so even though for you know for for
demonstrating abilities of job JVM as a
polyglot platform I implementing my
stuff in groovy but it successfully runs
in guys any groovy guys here yeah groovy
not so excited Kwok Lin even less okay
so in this case it's just simply
compiles into Java bytecode and the
result looks like a zip file so after
that a zip file can be stored on s3
deployed on s3 or any other like
develops tools can be used to to upload
this into aw so and in my lambda this is
how it looks like so there is my lambda
function
I already specified which class starts
lifecycle of this speech lab and after
that I can do pretty much everything in
code because it's Java right right this
is what he did okay I'm done yeah okay
so just to summarize before before we
looked for each section we're gonna have
the 20 20 seconds health minutes of
summary and state please what the
audience should vote for so guys as you
so it's very very easy to start with
implementing actions you don't need to
call anything not speech let not control
life cycles not groovy not Kotlin not
anything you can actually provide simple
stuff like what she said without going
to our back-end at all it saves the
performance of course is better because
it's one less step to go and it's
generally simple
I mean 70 years old can start playing
with implementing stuff with with Google
home so and in my case I want you guys
recall your 10-15 years of experience in
Java and what would be even like simpler
that writing the Java apps that someone
controls your lifecycle come on like you
did this
four years in the service Midlands and
applets right so Java rules even in
clouds and in lambdas like servers let
architectures so that's it yeah so my
approach is Java code first
so either either simplicity and web UI
for the seven-year-old or the power and
flexibility of servlets back to us so
good speech let's my my apologies so who
thinks this round and the round goal is
the simplicity of configuration and
understand ability how to get started
with that so who thinks this round
should go to Google home excellent this
is just the first step not bad who
thinks the that Amazon Alexa should win
this round margin I think Google Chrome
takes this round so as somebody said it
doesn't matter by how much you win is it
a millisecond we're a full mile winning
is winning point is a point let's let's
get started with round two and that
would be the more complex example and
doing yeah we need the mic okay so what
am I going to show now is more of a
conversation for pagination okay Google
start stand up helper sure let's get the
test version of stand up cupboard hi
humans Google's here to win how is Joker
going so far
what is the defects for victory the top
three defects for victor are WTF 76 WTF
36 WTF 79 are there more there are 62
more defects for victor
birthday victor is it stop so let's see
how it's done
obviously there really is a backhand
here because we need to go to JIRA and
find this seventy-nine defects for a for
a poor Victor here and that means that
we have another intent but this intent
now does something else because we're
not just returning text so top user
defects is the intent that we are
working it and first we ask for top bugs
for in our case this is a variable of a
certain type we can provide types which
will be hints for our system of what -
here Airport if I pronounce the airport
name not clear enough it will look for a
closest airport name right etc etc so
user name means everything because user
name can be anything but I can use first
name here and then it will use some kind
of database of first names from
throughout the world to try and guess
what I meant
so this is my variable and those are the
synonyms those are the sample utterances
that Google will multiply using their
artificial intelligence what are the top
defects for John and here I map a
username to something that need to be
heard and if nothing is heard Google
will reap romped me until I actually
populated and it will ask all those
questions until it has a proper a
username from me now once the input is
complete with the beginning of the
sentence and all the properties that I
need to fill in to fill next there will
be fulfillment and I don't return
anything standard because I need to go
to the back end and look at it so I will
use a web hook and the web hook is my
fulfillment use web hook for slot
feeling can go to another source for
those properties but that's okay I just
enter them myself
and here is my fulfillment
and it can be any URL it can use
authentication it can use sample hitters
and this is a hitter for example and or
if we want to make it even simpler and
we spoke about a very simple beginning
if you are a fan of JavaScript
I said simpler and JavaScript in the
same sentence sorry about that you can
actually write your fulfillment in
JavaScript right here in Apia I love
this name without going anywhere in our
case we want Java so we will go to a
Google cloud platform and I use Google
cloud platform just because I represent
Google home but it can be anything right
any resource and I'm going to it
whatever and in case and in my case I'm
using groove let but it really can be
whatever you like now this is the code
that is going to be called I do some
setup here obviously we won't go to gr
here it's I want to keep code as short
as possible so we'll do just some
randoms here instead and then here is my
control switch if the start ups if the
top user default is started then you
know go to JIRA find the top three and
return them now also I have I have
something here which is the parameter
and this is the parameter that was
passed to me as a property from a from
my request but also I do something else
I send a parameter out and this
parameter out will actually go to
another intent which is the follow-up
and then more user defects more user
different returns a parameter in and
then we have all those auto-generated
including Pokemon Arthur more I have no
idea why for the sake of pagination and
here I can use this parameter and if the
parameter is not there doing something
else for a follow-up intent that of
course will end up in my code as well
and here is the second part of it what
did I do
not what I wanted to do what I wanted to
do is sorry about that more user defects
and more user defects get the parameter
again my service is completely stateless
I have to pass the parameter back and
forth and then I go to JIRA and ask for
more defects so I guess that will be all
and now back to Victor and I think we
lost your sim oh by the way buddy should
be fine
I hope it's fine black screen okay you
lost it doesn't mirror yeah I'll try to
to reset this no I'm good just no I'll
switch to me and then back to you okay
he'll let me talk to my girl
all right so Alexa launched and I'll
help her
you confuse the next yeah we have it we
have it done thank you
okay so stop stop talking now Alexa
launch stand up helper
okay she's dead I won so maybe it's
Wi-Fi by the way no no stop stop okay
start showing the code and you will try
you will give it an anti later all right
so the echo dot now so the same thing
available in Alexa console so I'm
building it is e intense Ian in a model
modeler so they have this this you nice
UI that allows you to build intent and
in in case you've seen gives in this
idea right so I asked her what's our
current status so in this case I she has
this intent called stand up status so
basically if I ask her like what's the
stand up status I will no no is that get
out of the internet please thank you we
need this so now in in this case the
what happens with the when the Alex a
service will record night oh yeah
so when that Alexa recognizes these one
of the insurance is that I provided here
she will invoke one of the handlers in
my speech lat
so in this particular case on intent
this is the method that we will spend
most of the time and a based on the
certain certain conditions in this you
know huge switch switch case type of
thing it will execute particular
handlers so in this particular case if
we're talking about the stand up status
based on the uterine seize it will
record night this is particular intent
it will call the method yet update
stages so in this case it will generate
a speech let response which can change
two parts in this particular case speech
light response
yes yes you're showing another use case
top defect well which open top defects
yeah no I think you start we'd also talk
about status no no so it's okay all
right cool who is keep it and let me get
four four top defects actually it's also
very very nice and how it works so in
this case I can parameterize my uterus
with the particular parameter and Alex
the service will be able to recognize
the part of these utterances with actual
actual variable that I want to use in my
code so in this particular case it can
be in the end of sentence or it can be
in the middle of the sentence and Alexis
sir is smart enough to recognize where
is it now it will call it will call my
top users defects as you saw here and it
will go yet here now with this with the
intent request this is a part of the
request similar like your servlet
request there's some of the information
that also can be passed here so in this
case I do have this intent that
populates it with the user information
so in this particular case I get in s
slot Sloan a slot is a variable that you
use in your in your intent in your
returns to a new sample insurance to
define the variable and after that I can
use you know it's a left for J nuovo
lawyer it's very nice and after that I
can do call JIRA or I just do some
random I have a question for you please
so as you remember in Google you could
ask the user for an input for a missing
property until it actually populates it
it will ask what is the user name and on
other options a by itself I didn't have
to write any code for to guarantee that
how it is implemented in for Alexa yeah
so in this case I need to also implement
this or in the in the console I need to
specify that my particular and that much
of a slot needs to be fulfilled so in
this case I need to provide a this is
requirement required and in this case
there's simple phrases that Alexa will
ask you until you provide the right user
to request this thing so it
looks the same but it actually requires
some code on the back end yes it
requires some coder began to retrieve
this data and use it in somewhere you
know I also to check if it's not filled
yep
oh no of course it's a you know window
it will love the check-in nulls and the
oldest stuff so see I have a previous
developer was kind enough to put null
checks in in my code as well so this
populate requests fields will go and
execute every time until all the fields
are populated there is specific type of
object called dialogue intent that will
will be you know taking place into
account here and after that I use a Java
and all my all my stuff to populate
populate this context so if the
properties are missing a request will
get to your code you will
programmatically discover that the
properties are missing and will send
back for another round of questioning
until all the properties are properly
correct yes I have a full control of the
life cycle I can do many many things
with this I just just wanted to make
sure what is emphasized are we good
should we summarize Alexa Lodge
allowance in dog handler helper okay it
was hollow Inga's yes so it was hello
amigos where we are loop and gets
internet still still like you you know
so much travel back and forth to the to
the backend that it brought the whole
internet of yes
can I ask you a similar question since
we have we have a minute so how would
you implement in the Google home version
if you have five premieres and you just
need any combination of three of those
yeah so this is done in this way yeah
this is
thank you and it is done in this API API
UI in which you specify which parameters
are mandatory and that's enough so
looking back on this top user defects in
10 that we looked for
so this John is a required parameter and
I mark it as a required and then I
provide prompts that Google will reap
rom the user until it populates
everything that needed if some of them
are not required I don't have to check
this this checkbox and if the user
didn't use this parameter in his input I
will just get now in my in my code so
let's try that for a second I meant okay
Google start stand up what are the table
defects so I don't mean to myself so as
you show it will reap prompt to populate
the the required properties and my
entrant works
yes I think we can do something yeah in
this case if I want to have this like a
conversational type of thing it does not
en works now I can have in this case
when we're talking about
top top defect we - and after that it
creates a session for and puts the user
information into the session so the
current user is in session so next time
when I want to use it in where's my more
the facts I can retrieve it from session
with the : to get attribute and after
that
continue to do what generation so in
this case its it has a little bit more
state on the server side
similar to other things that we do with
like servers for example like session
HCP session that we do during the serve
with them excellent
so maybe you can summarize maybe fifteen
seconds and the goal for this round
would be something a little bit
different so it's not the simplicity but
it's the context the handling of
mandatory and optional parameters the
follow-ups and reprints how to ask user
for more input so with Google it is as
you expect it to be you have context
that you can get out of Google home to
your service and then get in back with
the same information or additional
information all the defaults are
pre-populated for you and mandatory
parameters will be asked until you
populated everything and and you work
with this context in your code by
pulling properties from it and then a
pooling properties into it and sending
it out so in my case it has less magic
we have a full control again with of the
code and it has a similar concept that
you have over you know years of
experience with the HTTP session and
other building the stateful protocols on
top of the stateless protocols like HTTP
excellent
so let's vote who thinks that Amazon
Alexa should win this round didn't work
who thinks Google Chrome takes it home
now I think it's a second step to the
wind for Google Chrome and let's go into
round three and you have six minutes
each and like just surprise us with
whatever one thing you can do okay so
there is one thing that I wanted to show
you it's kind of related to a previous
one but even more improvement on the
model that I already showed hi Google
opens stand-up helper
now it is the internet yeah do you think
so here's a summary from the website
Disneyworld disney.com thank you very
much Dobbs our network from Google roll
able divider
stop ok Google open stand up helper all
right getting the test version of stand
up helper this is Google and I am
nothing but a humble AI agent here to
serve the developers how bad is WTF 42
oh no defect WTF 42 is a catastrophic
one someone needs to do something block
it defect WTF 42 is a blocker now go fix
it stop okay so what do you heard here
is kind of a similar conversation that
we showed previously and by the way my
backup plan if the internet didn't work
was using couple of tools that I can
type in the request not going through
the speech recognition and everything so
I can do it here
how bad is WTF 42 and I will obviously
get the same result I can do it from III
or I can do it from actions on Google on
which I can actually have the full
experience of Google assistant in the
simulator including the full flow of
talk to stand up helper and going from
there it will show me all the
interaction all the JSON files that come
in and go out in order for me to debug
it and actually parse this a JSON in my
code and that's exactly a what what I'm
doing so since it did work I didn't show
you that but going back for to API AI
yes so how bad is WTF 42 GG f 42 is a
different ID which is of type any again
because it's just bunch of of characters
and then I put this defect ID into my
context
and that's exactly what we did in
previous thing the interesting point is
muted the innocent part here is that
when I go to my code and take care of
defect severity look at how I don't need
to put anything back to context anymore
and stop with this stupid back-and-forth
I take something from the context and I
put it back for the next iteration
because I marked this context as living
for a lifespan of two interactions so
now I can use this context every time I
have an interaction coming back to my
back end but I don't need to pass it
anymore and in a follow-up event of
civility 4-digit which is a blog current
defect I can easily use this current
defect idea without the need of getting
it on my back-end processing it and
putting it back to the outside context
it will survive the number of iterations
that I selected here in my intent in our
case is two so this is another twist
that that I wanted to show you okay so
let me try to do the same thing if it
won't work I can show you some tools
Alexa lunch
stand up helper this is my Alexa lounge
stand up helper we are how about this
WTF 28 o WTF 28 is a catastrophic one
someone needs to do something
please block it defect WTF 28 is it
blocker now go fix it good bye bye
alright so also works so but the seal
will show you some debugging tool so on
the Amazon console I can use a voice
simulator that will allow you to take
some of the text so for example in my
greetings to you
my great audience I do have a bunch of
sentences that I want to randomly
where's your own lunch so randomly
generate so in this case use you heard
something like live long and prosper
that works people but what about
something like this
I hope how can I use the my click quick
where's my I'll use this and I will show
you how you can test the responses this
going to the hello amigo was because of
the high pitch yes so so what happens
here is that my my output uses this
structured speech markup language to
modify default behavior of the speech of
Alexa so in this case I using higher
pitch for for this whole hola and also
I'm providing this special like a
phonetic pronunciation of this word like
because it's a Spanish they not
pronounce H and it's all amigo and after
that I can do also break in some cases I
can do like emphasis so you're elegantly
escape the debate about the usage of
parameters and start showing this dart
SS ml features a all like asked me to
show something and I can show you also
like something in this case the
parameters again yeah that's okay that's
fine
so in this case as you can see here the
I can use more emphasis providing like
stronger emphasis will kind of make it
sound a little bit longer and I can
provide a more loud sound of it so you
can test this one also you can send a
request to to actual skill instead of
doing this by voice you can ask
something
what status something like this it
provides me textual response and also
there is a sound response also it
supports it shows it and this is how the
UI will look as we mentioned it sent
something to the UI yep so in terms of
testing with the device eternal was my
another option that I was thinking to do
you can actually interact with the Alex
if you don't have a laksa because you
didn't go in other website of show notes
and didn't participate in ruffle so you
can use your browser to talk to Alexa
you need to do you know register with
your developer account with Amazon and
you can check the things to your to your
computer
lunch stand up helper done lounge stand
up helper so internet browsers so yep so
here we go it works works works nicely
and also can supports all the other
features and how much I have one minute
no yeah yeah yeah one minute do you want
you follow up with something yeah yeah
so in in the case of like a follow up in
in my in my this particular situation
with my code I'm saying with the same
tools that I use for my Java developers
a development so I use Gretel anyone up
for Gretel joke how many you maven
people Gretel people all right I like
the people who don't make poor life
decisions so this why we're using Gretel
so with this anyway so I I like I like
your meanness is up but I'm building
stuff I'm uploading to s3 and another
cool thing is that I can see some logs I
can see some slf for g SL f 4g stuff
which is with java developers love to
deal with the multiple logs
configuration with logs how you can
configure this
and this is something that you will see
like all operations there's a info this
warning I can see the information about
states of things like service
announcement SS ml works in Google home
and we don't need any special treatment
for deployment or logs because we can
use any back-end and deploy to any way
you like
including maven and we love me them okay
so what you use for building Gradle it
doesn't mean that I don't like maven I
have tons of Alexis at home it doesn't
mean that that Google home want one now
and it's like yes excellent so this is
probably the where we stop showing you
the code and we can show you something
else perhaps but the round tree is the
final round so we've seen everything
that the guys wanted us to show now we
will be voting and this is the the whole
and general overall voting we're not
voting about the programming model Java
speechless versus the generic JSON
request to the server the ease of
configuration the follow ups and
parameters handling and everything that
you would suggest to if you have a
preference if you are more excited about
one of those two you should vote to that
so who is more excited about go with
home wait for it
who's more excited about Amazon Alexa
but when they will start using they will
remember their fingers remember Java
more than just clicking around the
screen nice nice some people are excited
for both of those this is excellent now
we have one minutes left and we have one
last thing that yeah and and this one
last thing just real quick and as usual
will be an intent for okay google talk
to stand up helper alright here's the
test version of stand up helper hi
humans Google's here to win how is Joker
going so far
one last thing one last thing don't
forget to visit www.gfi.com/webmonitor
slash show notes for the presentation
slides the video the links and the
raffle you can win an amazing Amazon
echo dot with my friend Alexa inside how
cool is that huh No thank you for your
time you were awesome audience we have a
30 seconds but we still will be around
no the 30 seconds are to say that you
need to vote for us because there are
some people of course if you using this
you're using devoxx
app and avoid for our talk worth for
Alexa would for Google home this is
gonna sound Twitter this is Jay bark on
Twitter thank you very much and this is
election this is all again he's more
than awesome virtual jug
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
