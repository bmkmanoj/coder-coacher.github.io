very much for inviting me and I have to
say this is the very first conference
I've been invited to have been to where
the conference is proving they own beer
so I'm blown away so this is this is
great this is a fantastic fantastic stag
on thank you very much for inviting me
I'm very very much honored to be here
I'm going to tell you something about
how we go about constructing a a quantum
computer now before I actually do that
let me start by doing the most important
thing and that is to acknowledge the
work of my group at the University of
Sussex who who actually really doing all
the work and while I'm here this lovely
conference day actually in a laboratory
during the work in national village the
agencies who are funding our research
and companies some very lucky to be able
to do this work right so quantum physics
what is quantum physics so you probably
that haven't heard that much about
quantum physics the quantum physics is
very strange it's weird quantum physics
means that you can be at two different
places at the same time yes if you're
right so this is fantastic very very
useful so in quantum physics an object
can be at two different places at the
same time you can even move forward and
backward simultaneously so imagine
you're sitting in the account rying to
get out of the car parking space and you
actually hit the car in front of you and
the car behind you at the same time so
in quantum physics that exactly can
happen and very very strange things
happen in quantum physics so you can
tunnel through solid walls and there's
entanglements and think I mean this is
famously refer to spooky action at a
distance by by Einstein so what quantum
computers are eyes is is is our machines
where we trying to tame these quantum
effects so the quantum computing is
nothing to do really with conventional
computing it's an entirely new type of
technology and the development of
quantum computers will follow possibly a
very similar trajectory as as
conventional computers so let me let me
let me let's start by asking what can
quantum computers actually do so it
kernel computers can solve certain
problems we're in the fastest
supercomputer in the world may take
billions of years to calculate so it
changes in the ex of scaling how how how
long it takes to solve a certain problem
supports only the the scaling with a
number of bits so for a certain number
you want to compute things like that
that what makes a quantum computer so
powerful because it actually changes
scaling how long an algorithm takes so
if you're interested in what quantum
algorithms are available today there is
a nice database and on the only on the
websites the NIST quantum algorithms ooh
and so there's algorithms for search
factoring optimizations machine learning
and so on and vectors hundreds of
algorithms on there but one thing which
is a very important which I should
mention and I'm going to use this
particularly in in front of this
audience classical algorithms and
quantum algorithms are not the same
thing you cannot use algorithm which you
run on a conventional computer on our
acronym computer right not as I think
five people in the UK writing algorithms
and I'm looking around here and all you
guys are unbelievably doing awesome
things in conventional computing so if
you're interested and to become more
active in development of quantum
algorithms this is certainly something
which will become very important another
reason why quantum computers are so
interesting is that they're allow us to
simulate our physical systems quantum
physics is the underlying theory which
governs everything it governs why this
tree is black governs the connectivity
of material it's it it explains
everything around as explained as world
around us conventional computers to a
terrible drop in simulating come on in
physics because they're just a powerful
enough and so you have to do a lot of
approximations quantum computers
actually can simulate dynamics of these
systems except at exactly and that's why
this is a very very powerful thing so
let's start with some basic basic
quantum physics so what is the quantum
physical state it's a quantum
physical state describes an object for
examine me so so I'm going to call zero
of me standing in the left we're going
to call one me standing on the right so
that corresponds to a corner a physical
state and as I said before in quantum
physics I can be at the left and the
right at the same time so etem is on the
left or on atomism and on the right I
think on these funny funny little
brackets around the zero and the one
that implies that it's a quantum state
so let's do an experiment with two coins
so so if I were to hand out two to ten P
comments and so so first summer would is
one to you and once you have been told
not to interact much with the audience I
won't stop I'm going to describe this
right now then if you have to throw this
coin you get random results supposedly
if I give you an unbiased nan og coin
and you'd also get a random string of
random results if these two coins would
be entangled then both of you would get
the same result
every time you throw it but individually
it would be an entirely random 0 series
of of coin froze so this is one way how
to think of entanglement so it's it's a
t action at a distance even for each
coin is absolutely rarely you can do any
experiment you want to show that it's a
random and it will always deliver the
same result so how do we actually go
about building a quantum computer so
first of all let's start a classical bit
is either 0 or 1 so if I have a memory
stick I programmed into that memory into
the memory a sequence of zeros and ones
the match thing about quantum physics is
now a quantum bit can actually be 0 and
1 at the same time now what does it mean
so let's let's start with a very bad
memory stick with just two bits I can
choose to program to write to two bits
of information on to the memory stick so
for example 0 1 if I have a quantum
memory stick I can in and I have 2
quantum bits I can write 0 0 0 1 1 0 &amp;amp; 1
on all simultaneously in these two
quantum bits that it doesn't sound like
much so let's move over to a hundred
bits if I have a hundred bit memory that
I can write exactly one number into my
into my quantum memory if I have a
hundred quantum bit memory stick I can
write this number onto my memory stick
now I cannot actually say that number so
if somebody it's better media that a
very very large number of numbers they
can write into my quantum memory stick
so you can see immediately why quantum
computer is very powerful because
quantum states have this ability to
write 0 and 1 at the same time into
memory in general you can write 2 to the
power of n combinations into your memory
where n is the number of bits so how the
building 1 so this is this is exactly
what our bits are using individual atoms
charged atoms and each sprite dot you
see on the screen is exactly one quantum
bit and we illuminate these atoms with a
laser beam and the image stem using a
very good imaging system and this is
exactly what you're going to see so if
you want to learn about physics the best
place to start obviously is tom clancy
so he did actually get it right here so
i'm going to read this lee it's a little
bit small so in his famous physics book
mirror image
he explains quantum computing less so
you confine ions and webs of magnetic
and electric fields get a trap particle
with a burst of laser light to sell it
into an excited energy state then hit it
again to ground it
that's your switch rows of ions and a
quantum logical gate giving you the
smallest fastest computer on earth neat
clean and perfect now tom clancy is
absolutely right besides the last
sentence it is definitely not neat clean
so as you will see you later and we're
not going to show you some pictures so
how do you actually trap ions so what
you need is a minimum in an electric
field because remember ions are charged
particles so electric fields
and minimum and electric fields will
confine it however there's a problem
there's a there's a stupid physics law
which actually forbids us to have a
minimum an electric field so now are we
going to have to treat the system this
is how are we going to treat the systems
we have get this funny spinning
potential right so so now if I were to
place a ball into the center of this
potential who believes that ball would
be stuck there so hands up let's do some
democracy here so who thinks if I put a
ball in the in the center ball will be
stuck there will we be trapped
who thinks if I put a ball in the center
here will just roll off right okay I'm
an experimental physicist so we've made
an experiment so you can see if uh it
just rolls off if that thing doesn't
spin now I'm going to turn it on so now
we've got a spinning mechanical
potential and here you go so you can see
that traps now let's let's do another
experiment now we've had an old
microwave we slaughter this connected it
to these two electrodes don't do this at
home you will die is the large voltage
and you see it magically you have these
particles here moving in the center so
here you go even spinning electric
fields can confine charged particles and
that is the very principle of how we
hold individual atoms within the quantum
computer so so these these these are is
a very debated geometries in order to
build a ion trap to hold individual
atoms see if these electrodes and I've
on the left you can see these are these
are surrounding the the ions and in
order to make this more scalable you can
also just place them in one single plane
and the ions are trapped above this
plane and now this allows us to hold
individual atoms which are then forming
these quantum bits how does this
actually look like here's a picture this
is a microchip and to be produced
microchips which have electrodes on top
of the surface and you can see here this
is an extraction so these little squares
up there these are electrodes the ions
are trapped about
and now using it changing the voltages
on these electrodes you can move I
insisted like in a game of pac-man this
is the vacuum system inside which this
microchip sits in the vacuum isn't that
much better than out of space so if you
step out of a space shuttle you ever
look more into brief and inside one of
our vacuum systems and here you can see
how how in fact our famous book also
coded terribly wrong in terms of neat
clean and perfect
this definitely isn't it be imperfect so
this is a small quantum computer at the
University of Sussex as you can see
here's a lot of optical elements they
can systems all sorts of things
that actually makes up a quantum
computer so what has been achieved 2phi
worldwide now on developing of quantum
computers why haven't you got one on a
desk yet so so first of all many ions
have been entangled the eight the error
within quantum gates is has been reduced
to a very very small amount to 0.1% the
unless people have done teleportation so
so the extra teleported atoms from one
place to another so so this is quite an
amazing things has been done but what is
actually amazing what are we needing to
do now in order to build a large-scale
machine and so this is the same as with
conventional computers right now
unfortunately we're kind of at a stage
of individual vacuum tubes 8 10
individual vacuum tubes and this is kind
of where we want to be so this is one of
the first conventional computers I think
this is ENIAC and so this is where we
get on right now and as you can see
immediately that we are very very far
away from building small quantum
computers we're not even dreaming about
that yet so this is how our quantum
computer would look like give some kind
of place they store these up the iron
security informations it is a memory
region a way where we can transfer
through quantum information with and a
way to to so that processing region and
a way to transfer information from the
memory to the processor this is in fact
how a quantum algorithm would look like
so here you can see ions are being
shuttled like in a pacman game around
being quantum gates are being carried
out and so this is a very
very simple quantum algorithm on an iron
trap quantum computer so a simulation of
that so we restore the information in
the spin we call that a spin of the atom
and spin is basically the electron orbit
around the nucleus of the atom
and so different orbits correspond to
different states and these states were
resilient to to add to the environment
how do we actually do perform quantum
gates traditionally this has been done
using laser beams and si intact to ions
with laser beams but they have to be
unbelievably well aligned now if you
think of millions of billions of quantum
bits you'd need millions or billions of
laser beams in order to care in order to
build a quantum computer now you can see
you're not going to anytime soon and
have a small quantum computer
imagine billions of laser beams aligned
in a machine think of the engineering so
what we have done is recently at
University of Sussex we invented the new
way and this new way uses microwave
radiation and so instead of billions of
laser beams you can replace all of this
with a single or just a few handful of
microwave emitters so this is the this
is the scheme how this works as you have
ions on site this lettuce and the key
part you have to know is that the the
states within an atom they change their
separation changes as you change the
magnetic field and so what we do is we
push using voltages the ions into the
right magnetic field and so only when
they have a certain separation of the
two states can they then absorb
microwave or gauge which comes from air
which is everywhere in the quantum
computer and so this means by the
application only by the application of a
voltage you can now at execute a quantum
gate and this is absolutely possible in
a large scale and all we do now is to
apply voltages to carrier economy gauge
and so this now replaces all these laser
beams in fact it's a very similar
section what happens in our classical
transistor
how do we go about building a
large-scale quantum computer so we have
recently just two months ago published
the first actual construction plan of
how to do this and I'm going to give you
just a little flavor this is how it has
been proposed previously using optical
interconnects you transfer the quantum
state of an item to an iron and drink
these using optical interconnects but
that is very hard because the
entanglement at the time it takes to
transfer the quantum state put it onto
photon is very very long
so we came up with a new way to do this
and this new way uses instead of what
photons uses electric fields and so we
now transport ions from one module to
another module using electric fields as
you can see the see on this little
picture where you can see two modules
here to quantum computing modules and
now you transport an iron from one to
another
you obviously need many modules because
for large-scale quantum computer you may
need eventually millions or billions of
bits this is a module here a quantum
computing module and so this is a little
film where you can see how this thing
actually works so you can see an
extraction and you can see an ion being
loaded the ion is now being transported
to another iron here using these
magnetic fields and using global
microwave fields a quantum two qubit or
two bit quantum gate is now carried out
so so the two ions are now entangled
which is which is what is required to
perform a quantum gate now heat
transport them into another region and
using a laser beam which goes across the
whole architecture you can now detect
what state the ion regimes we get the
result of your computation so this
allows us to now measure what what what
is what is the result now all of this
happens in parallel so you have it looks
like a big game of pac-man like where
all these things happen in parallel with
atoms being moved around and carrying
out computations and now if you zoom our
information you get to the biggest size
you can make a wafer so there's a
distance our module size is electronics
the bottom and and Cooling the hell of a
lot of cooling in order to make this
machine work and then you go from from
one module to another module and it can
add more and more modules and now this
allows you to create an arbitrary large
quantum computer and so if you are one
if you want to now transport atoms from
one module to another you bring these
modules close enough with each other and
now you can transport ions if you align
these modules well enough electric
fields connect and you can transport
quantum information using electric
fields from one module to another and so
this allows even an arbitrary large size
quantum computer right so so what I want
to be now it is possible to build a
quantum computer using trap ions we have
now all the technology available it's
still highly challenging it comes at a
significant cost we are building a
demonstrator device at University of
Sussex in the next two years beyond that
we're going to build a large-scale
quantum computer which may actually fit
the whole football picture certainly a
building so it's a big thing
quantum computers certainly will
transform society and and you will see
them eventually but it's very hard to
build them and I like 10 and we do
require more people to write algorithms
so another another little advertisement
here and so let me end my talk by just
asking you what could an unbelievably
fast computer operating unlike any other
technology we now - thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
