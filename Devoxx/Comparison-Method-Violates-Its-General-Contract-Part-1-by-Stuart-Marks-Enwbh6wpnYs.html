is Stewart Marx I work on the core
libraries team in the JDK group at
Oracle and this is I actually called it
a comparator deep dive this isn't a deep
dive session because those last three
hours I only have about one hour of
material so this is this is a split into
two halves based on the time slot so I'm
going to talk for about half an hour and
then there's going to be a break between
the tools in action session and then
I'll pick up with the remainder of the
material afterwards and so maybe during
that time you can run out and get a cup
of coffee or I can just take a few
questions well while we're doing the
break alright so the title of this talk
is comparison method violates its
general contract and so you're probably
all here because you're wondering about
what this is and what's behind it and so
forth this happens when you call the JD
case sort routine and there's a problem
and in the middle of the sort you get
this exception and it's kind of it can
be kind of mystifying so that's what
this talk is about I'm gonna explain
what the rules are what what will cause
this to happen and then go through a
bunch of different different things
about the rules of comparators as well
as diving into the sort algorithm to
talk about why this sometimes occurs and
why it's sometimes this not before we
move on I put a hash tag up at the top
at the top corner devoxx comparator so
if you tweet with that hashtag I will
look for look for tweets with that and
if you have follow-up questions I will
try to answer them after the talk okay
so why do you get this exception and
what does it mean the short answer is
when you provide a comparator to the
sort method this exception can occur if
your comparator has a bug in it and so
what kind of bug causes this so there
are a bunch of consistency rules which
I'm going to go over next which every
comparator must adhere to and if your
comparator doesn't adhere to every
single one of those rules
the sort call might but is not
guaranteed - it might throw this
exception so let's talk about the rules
for comparators all right so if you read
the documentation the the specification
for comparator talks a little bit about
kind of mathematical concepts in
particular it says it must impose a
total ordering on values so I'll talk a
little bit about that there is some math
here it's kind of number theory stuff
but I think it actually is important I
know a lot of people like to avoid
talking about math but really
programming has a lot of mathematical
concepts in it and this is one of the
places where it's important so
comparator must impose a total ordering
on values so what that means is you have
a relation between two values and that
relation must have a valid result for
every pair of values so you're never
gonna in order to have a total ordering
that means you must never have two two
values out of a space of values for
which the the relation is undefined so
let's take integers as an example I
think that's that's an easy intuitive
way to talk about set of values and
relations among integers given any two
integers a and B one of the following
must be true a is less than B a a equals
B or a is greater than B so that's
pretty that's pretty obvious I think
everybody is familiar with integers and
so these are the things that have to
hold for for any total ordering
relationship now in particular with
integers we have what we call the law of
trichotomy given any two values then a
comparison between them is going to give
one of these three results less than
equals or greater so I'm going to
mention this a few times later in the
talk the law of trichotomy there are
only three possible results here all
right so total ordering is a
mathematical property and so there are
several properties that total earning
has to have one of them is transitivity
so if you have a is less than B and B is
less than C think about integers if you
have integers a B and C then if these
are true then a must also be less than C
it's kind of obvious if you think about
it it can't be any other way right
there's another another property that's
a little less obvious called anti
symmetry so if we have a is less than B
it implies that B is not less than a
substitutability is another one so if
you have two equal values a and B and
then you also have some some relation a
is less than C you can substitute a for
B and you get B is less than C and
finally you have to you have a total
ordering must be reflexive if two values
are if if you if you compare two values
sorry if you compare one value for
equality with itself it must be equal to
itself and also value must not be less
than itself or greater than itself
so again if you if you think of this in
terms of integers these are all pretty
obvious but you have to dive into the
mathematical properties and the number
theory aspects of integers to really
understand these all right now we're
gonna move from a mathematical world
over into the Java world and so the way
a total ordering from mathematics is
embodied in Java is with a comparator
interface and so comparator is a
functional interface it has one method
called compare and so it's a generic
interface so it takes type argument T
and so it compares two values of type T
and the result is always an int so the
return value of the compare method must
adhere to the law of trichotomy which I
mentioned earlier right and so the
result of the compare method is if the
integer value returns is less than zero
that means a is less than B if the
return value is equal to zero then it
means a is equal to B and if the return
value is greater than zero it means that
a is greater than B and here's something
that's a little easy to forget the
results must be consistent
for any two values a and B if if you
call the compare method on them
repeatedly you must get the same result
every time so again this is all sort of
obvious I feel like yeah everybody knows
about arithmetic and stuff but it's kind
of surprising what bugs people actually
come up with in the real world so for
instance consistency well so of course
it has to be consistent but occasionally
somebody will write a comparator that
depends on some external state that's
mutable and it'll give different results
for the same values and so that will
that will cause a problem all right so
like I said they're surprising number of
ways to get comparators wrong and so
here's where we start to get back to the
title of the talk if you get a
comparator that violates one of these
properties and then you attempt to sort
an array or list of values using this
comparator that's when sort algorithm
might throw the illegal argument
exception with this method with with
this message comparison method violates
his general contract and I think this is
kind of an outlier among Java exception
messages I think this is the only one
I'm aware of that
that where the comparison method or the
exception method actually ends in an
exclamation point so whoever wrote that
got pretty excited about the fact that
the comparator had a bug in it all right
let me switch over to demo here all
right oh that's big enough for everybody
to to read the code all right so let me
let me run this so basically this this
takes a list of integers that I've
generated randomly and there are some
various sort lines here that are
commented out but basically I'm just
going to run it without sorting and
print the list okay so we see a list of
integers here and as you can tell
they're the random integers and there
they're certainly not ordered because I
haven't I haven't sorted them all right
so now I'm going to write a pretty
simple comparator here it's I mentioned
earlier that comparator
is a functional interface that means you
can write a lambda expression that
implements the comparator interface so
here this takes two integer values a and
B and it compares them by subtracting B
from a and so at first glance this
should work just fine so if a is greater
than B a minus B is going to be greater
than zero if they're equal the result is
zero and if a is less than B the result
is going to be negative so that sounds
like it fulfills the requirements of a
comparator so let's see what happens
when we run it gee we got our illegal
argument exception I meant to do that
okay so so now I mean this is if you
look at this stack trace it's actually
coming out of the sort algorithm itself
the comparator didn't throw the
exception so what happened is the the
sort algorithm was calling the
comparator in an attempt to sort the
list and somewhere in the middle it
decided oh I'm going to throw this
exception so it's actually really hard
to debug this because there's there's
nothing wrong with your well obviously
there is something wrong with your
comparator but there's no bug in your
comparator that causes the comparator
itself to throw the exception so here
the the stack trace isn't telling you
anything useful really the problem is
with the way your comparator treats the
data and also it's dependent on the
actual input data if I had chosen a
different set of random numbers it might
not have thrown the exception so one way
to debug this is to do some logging so
what I have here is a comment this one
out I'm going to uncomment this one so
what I have here is a logging wrapper
comparator and so this is this is a
function that takes a comparator and
calls it and then just prints out the a
and B arguments and the result and then
returns it so what we'll get is this is
going to run through the exact same
algorithm using the exact same
comparison function but it's just going
to print out the arguments and the
results of the comparator so we can see
what's going on in
the in the when when the sort algorithm
calls the comparator alright so if we
scroll up here before we get the
exception we get a whole bunch of output
here so let's run through this there's a
lot here I'm not going to go through it
all obviously but if you if you look at
if you look at these we have let's let's
run through the first three values here
- 1.8 billion compared to - 1.1 billion
so that's less than 0 so that's correct
- 659 million compared to - 1.8 billion
alright so the first one is greater so
we get a positive number that's correct
- 659 million compared to - 1.1 billion
that's the first ones greater all right
now look what happened here in this
fourth line we have 1.3 billion positive
compared to negative 1.1 billion but
it's but the result is negative and that
says that the first value is less than
the second value which is obviously
incorrect but notice we didn't get the
exception here because the sort
algorithm is just calling this and it's
it's believing the results so what it's
trying to do is it's trying to sort the
input and you've told it that 1.3
billion is greater sorry if you told it
that 1.3 billion is less than negative
1.1 billion so you might think that
that's gonna cause a problem either your
result is going to be sorted incorrectly
or it turns out that the sort algorithm
runs into an inconsistency later on and
it has to do a bunch of more comparisons
but at the end of course you get this
you've got our favorite exception here
so what happened here right so if you
look at this if you if you think about
it oh okay I'm subtracting a very large
magnitude negative number from a very
large positive number and we get integer
overflow and so that's why we get the
wrong result all right so let's try to
fix this switch over to another file
here all right so
this is a slightly different scenario
but I'll run this without sorting so we
just get a few random integers between a
thousand and 1100 and you can see we
have some random numbers and they're not
sorted so let's uncomment this different
comparator here so here instead of using
subtraction I'm gonna say okay to avoid
overflow I'm going to compare the
numbers directly using the Java built in
relational number relational operators
so given arguments a and B if a is less
than B return minus 1 it can be any
negative number actually it has to be
law it has to be is less than zero but
sort of by convention if you're writing
a comparator you typically return
negative one zero or positive one all
right so if a is less than B then return
negative one if a is equal to B return
zero otherwise
again law of trichotomy you've already
handled less than case we've handled the
equals case so the result must be
greater it must be greater than B so we
return one instead alright so how many
of you think this works okay a couple of
people raise their hand oh gee there's
that exception again all right
so you might notice that I use some some
apparently random random number seed of
course I chose that so it causes it
generates the exception all right so
what happened here all right so let's
let's bring out our trusty logging
comparator again so this is the same
comparator except I've wrapped it with
our logging comparator it's it's
slightly different it just formats the
output differently but it's otherwise
the same as in the previous one so if we
look at if we look at the results here
all right there's a whole bunch of stuff
but if you look all the way down at the
bottom we find o it compares 1098 to
1098 and it says 1 in fact if you look
carefully there are no values that are
that compare equal to each other even
though there actually are duplicates in
the input array why is that alright okay
so our old friend Otto boxing has bitten
us again actually in this case it's Otto
unboxing
so notice we have a list of capital I
integers and so this lambda expression
does auto unboxing for the less than
operator and so this comparison is
actually correct but this equality
operator does reference equality so
you're comparing reference equality of
boxes and so it's like oh this is what a
cheater but you know this this actually
sometimes really happens which is why I
wanted to show it to you so really okay
so the way to do this is you you can
write out the direct comparison
operators it's just that if you're
dealing with boxed values you must avoid
using equals and not equals because
those give you reference comparison
instead of value comparisons all right
so let's run this one and hey we get we
got a correctly sorted list
all right so notice what I did here was
I compared less than and then I compared
greater than and I avoided comparing
equals all right now it turns out that
this is actually a fairly common thing
to do so there is a library utility in
the JDK called integer dot compare that
does that and so and run the same thing
get this get the same results and so if
you need to compare integers use this
use these method you could write this
out but it's tedious and and and pretty
easy to get something wrong so always
use the library routines to do that and
there's another thing you can do it
turns out that you can compare integers
directly using what's called their
natural order which I'll explain a
little bit later in the talk or maybe
maybe the next half not sure when that
comes up but you can actually pass null
in certain cases for comparator and that
will give you the natural order of the
values all right so let's move on to
another example here alright this time
we're gonna do floating-point alright so
let me run this again I'm generating a
bunch of random numbers I'm actually
generating a bunch of integers and since
since the random number generator gives
you full
range of integers including positive and
negative numbers I take the absolute
value to get a positive number and then
change that to a double and take the
square root of it of course we can't
take the square root of a negative
number so so that's why we use the
absolute value and then box them into a
list of doubles all right so at this
point I'm not even going to ask I think
if you've been following along nobody
should believe that this works so so but
notice I did write the comparison here
correctly a is less than B gives -1 is
greater than B gives 1 otherwise 0 and
so here we avoid the boxing issue all
right so let's run it and surprise
surprise we get our legal argument
exception again all right so let's
enable logging on this and look at why
that happened
all right oh this is interesting they're
not all numbers some of them are not a
number which is NaN and if you look at
the results here actually let's look at
some if you look at some regular values
they're all correct so 30,000 is greater
than 28,000 okay that's fine
but if you look at some of the results
where there's an an as an argument where
are they they're bunching on the bottom
there they are so here we have a whole
series of comparisons between some
positive values and Nan and the result
is 0 well that's a little odd and then
so here if the N is on the left hand
side we get the same thing so what this
saying what what's happening is this
comparator is telling the sort algorithm
that if it encounters an and value that
that's equal to any other double value
well that's and that's really strange
and so if you if you okay so I lied
earlier what I did was I said absolute
value if you take a bunch of integers
and take an absolute value that gives
you a positive number that's wrong
integer dot min value the absolute value
of integer dot min value is in the dirt
min value which is the largest possible
negative integer in John
so I very carefully chose this random
stream so that had integer dot min value
in it and I I fooled you by taking the
absolute value so I could feed it to
square root but it turns out that a
negative number sneaked in to us it
sneaked downstream and then to try to
take the square root of it that's where
the nan value came from so the square
root of a negative in square root of a
negative number is not a number or nan
all right so so now how I did it how is
it that this comparator is returning
equals for nan compared to everything
well if you look at I Triple E floating
point there's the special value nan and
it turns out that the way the floating
point standard is a find is that every
comparison between man and anything else
is always false so if you have some
value say a thousand and you say is a
thousand less than nan false is a
thousand equal to nan false is a
thousand greater than nan false is nan
equal to man false so it's it's really
very strange and in fact if you're
feeling uncomfortable right now
it might be because floating point does
not obey the law of trichotomy I said
earlier that given any two values now
this is true of integers and int given
any two int values it's it's always the
case that a is less than B equals or
greater and that is not true with
floating point values particularly I
mean I think the major exception is with
the special man value and so if you look
at what
so nan itself if you use the built-in
operators always returns false but how
do we how are we saying that nan is
equal how are we getting the result that
man is equal to every other value so if
you look carefully at this if one of
these values is nan suppose we're
comparing man to something else well a
is less than B that's going to give us
false so is is a greater than nan well
that's false and so the default is 0 so
our comparator again is incorrect
because it's returning equal for values
that actually are not equal and so what
what do you do in a case like this so so
basically there's a special special API
in the float and double class that
detects if a value is man so you can't
say ah if I have some floating value f
you can't say equals double dot man
because that's always going to be false
which is very strange thing to do you
have to sicily call a method called is
nan and that tells you whether whether
the value actually is not a number so
I'm not going to show you the code to do
that but basically you have to have a
special test for nan and treat it
specially and so in fact double dot
compare does that and so the behavior of
the compare method on the double class
treats nan specially and so in
particular treats nan as if it were
greater than every other floating point
value including positive infinity so if
we run the sorting algorithm with this
and we see ok so here's here's our nars
floating point values you can see them
all they're pretty confident they're
sorted and in fact the very last one is
man because that sorts to the very end
of the list because it's the highest one
ok and once again we can we can use null
as the comparator here to sort using
doubles natural order I don't think I
need to show that again because the
result should be the same all right so a
quick recap of of these demonstrations
they're a bunch of rules that
comparators must adhere to you know
there's there's a fair amount of math in
here but actually what you need to do is
think about the way the properties that
integers have I think everybody is
familiar with those and so mathematical
integer values behave this way Java int
do not in case you're and unless you're
unless you're very careful so again the
point is
that if you I've shown you a bunch of
comparators with different kinds of bugs
in them if you have such a comparator
it's important to note that the sort
algorithm does not always detect that
your comparator has a bug in it and so
typically the symptom is that if you
feed it some data it works and if you
heat it some different data it might
fail and so the fact that there are
failures indicates that there is a
problem with your comparator but it's
sometimes very difficult to diagnose
this now now I actually might think oh
well that's terrible if I get an
exception but but in fact if you don't
get an exception if you get an exception
you're actually lucky because the system
is telling you that something is wrong
if you don't get an exception what's
actually happening is that your
comparator is probably giving you an
incorrect sorting result and so it's
just that the sorting algorithm hasn't
detected it so the output is probably
incorrect and so silent slightly and
that gives you a silent error which is
probably a bad idea so let's see what
else is here okay so I mentioned already
that the Java's numerix and and most
computer numerix in fact do not obey all
the math mathematical laws right so the
law of trichotomy is violated by by a
floating point integer overflow can
cause a variety of problems to occur so
you have to be careful to avoid them but
for most things you can use the built-in
library functions called integer dock
compare and double lock compare or you
can if you're using box two today types
they have a natural order that that does
the comparisons correctly all right so I
think okay so I'm gonna run through this
and we're almost to the end of the first
half all right so I've been using the
term natural order for a while and so I
wanted to bring this up here so so
there's a common common point of
confusion between comparator and
comparable and so those are two
interfaces in the Java core libraries so
a comparator which is mostly what I've
been talking about it's a
function that compares two objects and
so it's independent of anything else so
I'd like to think of it's an interface
but it really it has no it doesn't have
it doesn't have any state and I think
the best way to think of it as a
function that only looks at its two
inputs and then does something with
those inputs and produces the result now
comperable is an interface that you can
mix into a data class and the idea there
is that if you're writing a class that
represents some value of some sort that
has some intrinsic order to it you know
that has some ordering that is important
to the nature of the object itself
comparable means that if you have an
instance of this class this instant this
instance of this class can be compared
to some other instance of the same class
and so you can see this here if I if in
the example code here suppose I had some
example called my value class it
implements implements comparable of my
value class meaning I can compare I can
compare myself to other instances of the
same class and the method on comparable
is compared to and it takes one argument
which is the other value I want to
compare this value to so you can see
it's sort of the same thing instead of
taking two independent values it's
comparing this to another value and but
it otherwise compares otherwise
comparable and the compare two function
have to obey all the same rules as the
comparator rules that I talked about in
the first half of this talk so really
they're kind of the same thing it's just
that they're they're expressed somewhat
differently in the way the object design
is set up and so now if you take a value
that implements comparable like I said
it has an intrinsic ordering that's what
we call a natural ordering and so if a
class has a natural ordering then you
don't necessarily need to write a
comparator to sort it so you can just
pass null for the comparator
and sort will sort using the values
natural order using the compareto
function of a comparable interface and
anyway so so like comparator the
comparable interface and the compareto
method has to adhere to all the same
rules about being reflexive transitive
and so forth
alright so actually I think this is a
good place to stop so we're at the
30-minute mark and so why don't we why
don't we bring the first half to the
close and if you want to run off and get
a coffee or something please feel free
to do so and we'll start the second half
in ten minutes and I'll hang around here
and answer questions if people have any
but this is what I'm going to start
talking about the in the second half</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
