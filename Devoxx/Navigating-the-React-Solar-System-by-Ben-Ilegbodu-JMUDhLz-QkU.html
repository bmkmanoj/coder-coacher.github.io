navigating the react solar system where
I'm hoping to kind of give you a grand
overview of react in all of the
libraries that go along with react
because react by itself is not a
framework that a JavaScript framework
like angular or ember it's just a
library for rendering new eyes so as a
result you need to have other libraries
to kind of put together with it so that
you can build your user experiences so
I'll kind of give an overview and then
hopefully point you in different
directions where you can look up more
information if you're not familiar with
it yet so i can show over hand to the
beginning who's actually been developing
and react anybody here kind of one kind
of okay perfect it's a perfect audience
so i can kind of clue you into different
pieces of react so that when you do get
started you kind of have an idea of
where to begin so i tweeted out a link
to the slides my twitter handle been MVP
so if you go there you will find a link
directly to these slides or you can go
to my website been MVP com and i've
listed it there as well so just formally
introduce myself like i said my name is
ben elec badoo i'm a christian husband
and a father the picture of my wife
rasheda and our two daughters Avery and
Simone we were just in tahoe this past
weekend so it was nice and warm yet cold
at the same time but a lot of fun there
we live in Pittsburgh California so I
call that the Far East Bay past oakland
past walnut creek pittsburgh and i
currently work at eventbrite so it's not
feel very a bit bright we're an online
events and ticketing platform for
conferences races food festivals
anything basically that has tickets that
small eventbrite it usually supports it
and i am our the manager of our
front-end platform team so the team that
kind of supports all of the other
feature teams in their UI development
we don't build any features ourselves we
just built a platform and we have been
transitioning our JavaScript framework I
guess from backbone and marionette over
to react over the past year or so and a
lot of what I'm going to be talking
about our libraries that we've been
using to build up our react stack then
lastly i'm a huge basketball fan love
basketball i'm originally from houston
so i'm a rockets fan not a warriors fan
but the Rockets are going to win the
championship this year just putting it
right there and I'll move on so react
solar system let's talk about it in the
center we have react obviously so
everything revolved around react so
that's the first thing I want to talk
about a little bit so react has a lot of
great qualities to it the main one being
that it's functional and reactive it's
different than an MVC style development
and as a results you just kind of
declare what your state is and then what
you want your UI to look like in that
state and basically your own is just
changing the state as a result of UI
changes and it has jsx which looks very
similar to HTML that you can use and
leverage in something called a virtual
Dom so that you essentially rerender
your whole UI every time the state
changes but it's intelligent and only
changes the part of the Dom that
actually changed in the UI instead of
having to do a whole rewrite to the code
and i really like react because it has a
very narrow api so i can remember
everything in my head i don't have to go
to the docks that many time to see what
different methods do so as a quick
example wanted to do a little quick
comparison between jquery and reactants
most people if you've done web
development before you're familiar with
jquery so jQuery is imperative basically
tell jquery and statements to do
different things respond to different
things and then as a result you update
your UI so here I have a simple UI
basically click the button
increments the text field that's all it
does and that's what the code is doing
as well so on click of the button up
button get the value of the or get a
jQuery object of value box being the
input and then parsing its value into a
number and then setting the value of
value box to be the current value plus
one so simple as that and imperative
statements are kind of how we logically
think of you I you say I click something
and then I want to set those values to
be something else and for simple user
interfaces imperative it's a lot easier
to understand and to build but as your
user interfaces get bigger and bigger
and bigger comparative ends up becoming
very spaghetti code because it's all
driven a bit based upon what just
happened and you have to put yourself
into certain states by user actions
instead of storing the data so if we
look instead at what I call declarative
react what we do is we declare our state
up here and the state is 0 and then as a
result the user interface is a function
of the state are based upon the state so
now the input field has this value here
and the button on click we call handle
click and then handle click updates the
state so the only thing that's
imperative is this set state function
that's right here and everything else is
declarative so the UI what's n render is
based upon what was stored in the state
and then as the state updates the whole
user interface rear enders but because
of optimization that reacting has the
whole UI doesnt actually really
rendering the Dom so I don't have time
this is not a talk about react and how
to develop in the reactants about react
plus everything else so I have time to
go into all the details but if you
really want to learn how to develop and
react I suggest the official tutorial on
react the first thing you want to do
when you're learning how to use react is
to learn how to use react because a lot
of times if you'll go look at workshops
or tutorials I'll try to teach you react
plus redux plus inline styles and all
these other things that try to throw at
you but the first important thing is
just to learn react and learn react
really really well and you can do a lot
with just the library itself and this
tutorial goes through kind of all the
details of how react works the way it
works different best practices that you
should use so if you get the slides like
I mentioned you can go to that link and
find the tutorial that's basically how i
learned react okay so you've learned
react the next thing you should learn is
javascript which seems kind of backwards
but what I'm talking about is actually
like a future JavaScript es6 if you've
heard of that es 2015 and past that
because the latest features in
javascript make react development so
much more easy or easier so there's
modules now there are classes something
called the spread operator destructuring
like all these different things that
make reactive element much easier and
they're important to learn because
basically es6 and react really go well
together just a gratuitous slide that I
wanted to put up here this is an example
of some react code I wrote that's using
like all the latest and greatest of es6
it's actually a synchronous code it's
using something called the called async
functions so up top here we see an async
keyword and an awake keyword so that's
like JavaScript that's about to be
official in this summer and it's also
using the set
such function that's available on the
browsers and i'll be talking about that
in a little bit but this kind of wanted
to show you out of what react code look
like in EF exp 06 actually gave a talk
last week at facebook's react off about
react in es next so if you're interested
in learning more about that and how they
go together you can watch that video in
the link there if you like okay so now
we've done react you've gotten learned
es6 what's the next thing you have to
learn in order to get good at and react
so to speak and the next thing i want to
talk about is tooling so the first tool
that you should have in your arsenal is
the react dev tools and it's available
for chrome and for firefox so if you use
safari or a use edge I'm sorry you have
nothing for you there but the tools
really go into details so you can see
what is actually going on in your react
app so you can see what event listeners
you have on nodes what you have in your
state what you have in your props makes
it easy to kind of understand what's
going on in debug without having to
throw everything into a console log and
the next thing you want to do is get
package managers so who's familiar with
NPM used in team before okay good so
most of you have mpm is like the
dominant package manager there's also
Bauer which has existed it's older than
NPM and if you use some really old
libraries and may still be using Bauer
but pretty much everything's on NPM now
and then Facebook last October released
yarn which is a new CLI on top of NPM so
it still uses mpm in terms of the
package repository but it gives a new
CLI for interacting with that package
for that repo and yarn offers a whole
lot of benefits above yarn so
it's a whole lot faster to install so if
you ever done it have had to do an NPM
install on a repo it can take a long
time but yarn is a lot faster because it
does things in parallel it also caches
libraries that you've downloaded before
so if you did an NPM install and then
went on an airplane removed all your
node modules and did an NPM install
again it would work because it's cached
everything locally on your machine so
that really helps as well and then it's
your install fails it'll try again
multiple times if you had a network
glitch so it's pretty cool that way now
a lot of people are now switching from
npm over to yarn because of the
performance boost you'll get we have
seen cases where an NPM something
installs in five minutes and in yarn and
it's dolls and two so it's like that
much faster next thing our bundlers so
you have all these different modules
you're using helper libraries with react
modules even within your application
because you're going to have different
components they're different bundlers
out there that you can use web pack is
the dominant one in the react space
browserify has existed for a while now
but it only works in the browser as the
name says and now there's a lot of what
are called isomorphic react apps so they
render on the server and note as well as
on the client on the browser so
browserify doesn't really work well with
that neither does require jf so web pack
and roll up have kind of been the top
top choices but mainly web pack for your
bundling and there's no web pack to that
has a lot of new features to offer to
make your applications more performant
and one of those features that i want to
show and highlight is called tree
shaking so what tree shaking is is that
say you have this module right here it's
called Massey is it has two functions in
it
Square and the cube so if we remember
from that I don't know what this would
be I guess algebra maybe geometry the
square of something is just x times X
and the cube is x times X times X so
that's in math jjs then let's say you
had a main jas down here at the bottom
and all you included was a cube using
the new module syntax we just import
cube from fjs and use that normally your
bundle would you bundled main DJ s and
mascot Janice would include everything
it would include both square and cube
even though you only use Q but now what
tree shaking does is it can tell that
you only imported Q so when it creates
the bundle it will only have cube and
console dot log your actual code in
there so it's kind of an optimization so
you imagine you're using a library and
you're only using two functions out of
the 15 that are in there you can really
see a dramatic improvement in the size
of the bundle that gets generated
because of tree shaking so it works
specifically with es6 modules so this
import syntax it doesn't work with the
common jas require or AMD require syntax
so that's one thing but that works both
with web pack as well as roll up ok so
let's move on so after that you want to
have a task runner is anybody use grunt
before and their task yeah ok your gulp
is kind of a newer version as well yep
Copa so that is more streamed based as
opposed to test imperative based as
grunt is but there's been a lot of how
do I call it a lot of backlash I guess
or task fatigue I guess build process
fatigue with grunt and gulp and now
people are just using simple NPM scripts
so if you've used npm and if you've had
a package.json file you can actually
declare scripts in that file which are
just quick things command lines that you
want to run so here is an example of a
script section inside the package.json
let's say I want to run es lint I can
just run that es lint module or if I
have a lint command this will run the
SAS lint as well as the es lint so we're
just running some command line things
and here down here I'm saying yarn run
validate and then i'll call this
validate script that will do linting as
well as testing and then testing does
that up there so is this the easy way
these don't have too many complicated
things that you want to do you're just
kind of try to it's just a task runner
to run things you can use NPM scripts or
yarn scripts because the yarn CLI is on
top of the NPM CLI so if you didn't have
yarn you can just replace all those
yarns with NTM and it would work just
the same okay and I think the last one I
want to talk about our static analyzers
so these help you find bugs in your code
before they actually run so the
predominant one is es lint so that's
mostly for historically has been mostly
for style so you want to have your curly
braces on the same line or the following
line do you want semicolons or knots in
my colons do you want spaces before
parentheses or not you can enforce all
these things so there's consistency
across your entire code base but lightly
more sophisticated type analyzers like
slow and type scripts have existed so
it's kind of trying to inject types as
you C and C sharp or Java or C++ and
checking that into Java so you can have
even more safety in your code so that
you can make sure you're not passing a
string when something expects a number
or a boolean when something expects an
object so an example of that and flow
that was developed
I facebook as well it is something
called flow type inference so you could
never declare any types in your cone all
you do is just put this comment up here
that's flow comment it can already
detect errors in your code so in this
example I have this a food function and
i'm multiplying it by 10 so by default
flow knows that x can only be number
because that's the only thing you can
multiply by 10 obviously but now passing
a string hello world to it and it
complains wait a second string is
incompatible with number you it inferred
that it was going to be X was going to
be a number i casted a string it's going
to give me a warning and I haven't done
anything to to annotate my code so kind
of slows powerful in that regard just
from the from the beginning which is
pretty cool so to recap this is what I
would pick if I was trying to decide
whether I was going to use to build a
reactor application I would obviously
have to react dev tools because you
always need those then i would use yarn
as my package manager webpack as my
bundling yarn or mpm the kind of
interchangeable at this point first task
running and then lastly es link for my
static analysis you just went find so
many different issues in my code it's
really nice so that's a lot sort of
figure out in the beginning I go back in
a second if you've never done anything
with reacted before it's hard to
determine which one of those you should
pick before you even know what those
things are and that's been kind of the
backlash with the reactants that you
have to do so much up front in order to
figure out how to just create an app
like you don't care about all this
tooling stuff you just want it to work
so the coral react team decided that
they wanted to create a CLI for
bootstrapping a nap so they created
something called create react app and un
star install it globally you can use
yarn or NPM I've used
yarn in my example and then you call
create react app and in the name of your
app so I'm calling it awesome app
because every app i created is awesome
and you go into the app folder that you
just created after you've done it so
this line look right here will do all
kinds of stuff it'll install things set
up things and then finally you just do
yarn start and your app is up and
running you can start building the
components so it does use web pack
aeneas lint and all the things that i've
talked about as well but it's under the
hood so you don't even know that's
what's happening could just focus on
building your app so I've listed a whole
bunch of links if any of those claims
were interested in to you information
further information for you to to read
up on okay so now let's start talking
about how to actually make our appt look
nice and there are at least four ways
that I can think of of doing CSS styling
inside of your app the first one and
most likely that you'll use especially
if you're converting over to react is
global CSS so here I have a react
component it's a fictitious card
component and it takes in three
properties title image URL and message
and then renders those out and some
markup there so we have the title here
you have the image URL there and then a
P tag with the message and i've added
classmate named each one of those so if
you go the global CSS route you'll just
have this huge CSS file and then at some
part inside of the CSS file you have
those classes defined and you'll use
something like bim syntax or some kind
of syntax to make sure that you're not
having name collisions so you will
prefix all of your classes with card
because you just created the card
component and to make sure that you
don't have any name collisions another
alternative
a slightly better alternative is to have
what I'm calling component CSS so
instead of just assuming that there's
some global CSS file that's going to
have all of your declarations you
actually import a CSS file and that just
will bring that in but you still have
your markup as the exact same you still
have your class classes there but in
your CSS now you just have a CSS file
that's just card that s CSS and nothing
else and you would still need to prefix
your class names with the name of the
component because in the end this
component CSS is just going to get
bundled up into one huge global file in
the end but the least you're declaring
your CSS and separate places just like
your JavaScript components they're in
separate places then the third another
option is what is a solution called CSS
modules so here we're importing the CSS
like we were with component CSS except
that we actually get a variable back and
this variable this object has references
to the class names so here instead of
saying class name of string we say CSS
route so CSS is now some kind of object
cfcs esta title CSS the image CSS
message as our class names so this
knowledge of CSS modules that we're
importing is giving us classmate and
those are generated from the CSS and now
in our CSS you no longer have to prefix
our CSS classes to worry about namespace
collisions we just say da truth titled
image dot message and what fits what the
CSS modules library the system will do
is that it will automatically prefix
your CSS classes for you based upon the
name of the file and then a random
for you so you don't worry about names
placed collisions anymore in your code
you just write whatever class names you
want whatever it makes sense for the
component itself and then it will
generate this in the CSS as well as the
resultant markup would also have these
as the class names so that kind of makes
that connection for you under the last
option which became popular because of
reacts maiden where they don't have CSS
is inline styles so it's kind of going
all the way back like 15 20 years from
when we were doing web development to
putting everything in line in the style
attribute so you declare an object at
the topic that's going to have all of
your styles that you want so that object
would have like a root property you
would have a title property and image
property and you would set whatever CSS
styles that you want in line so it's all
in JavaScript and in react the style
attribute or style prop and react is an
object itself it's not a long string
like it is in HTML so the drawbacks know
of inline styles or the benefits else
you say first before I get to the
drawbacks is that you don't have to
worry about cascading style sheets or
cascading styles so you know that if you
write a style that's just targets divs
it'll affect all des anything if you
didn't mean it to and so you always have
to worry about collisions and you throw
bang importance on things because you're
trying to undo specificity but now with
inline styles you don't worry about that
but the drawbacks as listed here or that
you can't be some of the special things
that CSS allows you to do like pseudo
classes media queries for responsive
design animations all those things don't
work with inline styles so if you don't
need to do any of those you can use
inline styles or you have to do
javascript to kind of recreate those
so more resources for you there okay and
then next sorry I want to talk about is
single page apps is this is kind of last
step in terms of building your full
fledged apps and when you're building a
single page app you're obviously going
to make some API requests to the back in
to get some data and now instead of
using jQuery because we don't want to
use jQuery anymore we have react you can
use as I mentioned before the set API
that now exists on all of our modern
browsers so if you do windows etch in
your browser you're now going to get a
new API that can make that new function
that can make API calls so the first
parameter is the URL that you want to
fetch two and then optional options for
it so you can set the method you can set
the data that you're passing if you're
doing a post all kinds of different
things and such uses promises instead of
callback functions to get the data back
so here we set and then we get the
response dream and you can do something
with the response tree or if an error
happens then you use the catch that way
so I've included a link to information
on an Indian article about fish as well
as a blog post I wrote about promises
because you're going to need to know
promises in order to use fetch and one
thing to note actually is that all
asynchronous API is moving forward and
the browser are going to be promised
based so there won't be any more
callback functions everything is going
to be a promise so learning promises if
you don't know they came if you don't
know them yet they came with es6
formally it's a good thing to know the
other thing you want to do in building a
single page app is routing on the client
so that when people click around you can
still use the back button to go back to
places or they can bookmark certain
places in the app and with reacts the
most prominent one is react router
I needed to have something else to
compare so I picked this other librarian
aviator but pretty much everybody uses
react router they just launched their
version for a react router but react
router basically uses the same jsjs X
syntax for declaring your routes so here
we have the router component that's on
the outside and then you say you have
your route pass so this is the home this
is the repos this is about and then you
can just point it to specific components
that you want it to render for each one
of those routes so it's pretty
straightforward and then when do you
want to link to a route you just use a
special link component that they provide
which is just a wrapper over an a tag
that will do the browser history work
for you ok so now we've reached the
asteroid belt and at this point the
firts first for libraries that we've
talked about are all you need to build
an app and really if you haven't done
any reactive element before that's all
you need to know you need to know about
react need to know about es6 you need to
know about styling you need to know
about single page apps such as well as
routing everything now that I'm going to
talk about it's kind of extra icing on
the cake sort of things but one thing
that's really important is testing you
can certainly deliver a nap and not test
anything an app will work but it'll
probably break so testing is the next
important thing actually after you've
actually built it and there are a number
of testing options you can use the
combination of mocha and chai for
testing you can use jest which facebook
has created for testing react components
as well as just testing javascript in
general and there's another library
called Ava Ava I'm not quite sure which
one it is as well so obviously Facebook
given that they built just they
recommend using jest and at eventbrite
we recently
which from using mocha and chai over to
jest and that's for something called
snapshot testing so you can imagine that
trying to test what your component
renders is not the easiest thing and
just makes it actually pretty
straightforward to do so all you do is
you render out your component here but
not to a browser out to an object so it
just renders it out to a JSON object and
then it does comparisons over a snapshot
that was saved to the disk before and
after so you will save your component
then it rendered to a JSON in your
github or in your get account and then
the next time you run a test it'll do a
comparison of file comparison to those
to see if they're the same so you no
longer have to manually test oh is this
class named the right thing this just
has the right tag this is that the right
contents you just do an easy comparison
of that so I have more resources for you
to read up about that oops so I
mentioned earlier about isomorphic react
applications and their purpose is to
make things more performant and for SEO
so you want to render your app on the
server side as well as the client side
because if you render its server side
that perceived speed for the user is
much faster because it's already there
returned back from the server to render
instead of having to first load the page
download all the JavaScript and then
render on the client having it rendered
on the server is a lot faster plus for
SEO a lot of the crawlers like having
the data already there to crawl as
opposed to having to execute the
JavaScript in order to figure out what
the page is so that's why you would
render server side and there are two
ways you can accomplish it the first
away in the easy way is if you have node
on your server so if you're running a
node server you can just
easily use Express you can do fetches
with no touch and then react router on
the server and it works just fine but at
eventbrite you don't have a node server
our back-end is Django and Python or if
you had Ruby with rails or dot net and C
sharp you can't render those because
those don't execute JavaScript so what
we ended up doing is we ended up
creating kind of a slave node server
that set behind the main web server so
all it did was take inbound request for
a component that should render and then
return back HTML so the node server was
basically a react render server that's
all it did was render they didn't take
any public requests so have a different
talk where I kind of go into the details
about how that worked and how we set all
of those things up as well ok so moving
right along the next big thing that
everybody talks about is how to manage
the data in your app so once it gets
bigger and bigger and bigger you're
going to have more data that's going to
be changing all the time and it's going
to get complex and you're going to need
a way to manage that and that's where
the flux paradigm design pattern has
comes in has anybody heard of flux
before well ok one person so flux came
about with react it's a different design
pattern than MVC so who's familiar with
NBC yeah ok so that's the familiar way
where you have a model you have a view
and that controller and the view
obviously renders the UI and the model
stores the beta and the controller kind
of controls both of those two but what's
the flux design pattern it's a different
it's a unidirectional flow so this is
what Facebook's showed when they kind of
unveiled the flux pattern and I looked
at it and didn't really understand what
was going on
and it got explained to me three
different times and I still didn't know
what was going on it was just kind of a
new way to wrap my head around how the
transfer of data happened so it's not
important in this go into detail about
how flux works but there are a number of
flux implementations out there so
Facebook ended up they came up with a
design pattern and then ended up
creating a JavaScript library that
implemented that flex clatter flux
pattern because it was such a high
demand for it but in the end Redux
became the library of choice for using
managing your data your state with react
so it has a single store and has
something called actions and reducers so
that you can easily test and update your
app state so more than likely so you can
build a react app without Redux
completely like it's one of the first
things that people end up throwing in
their app in the beginning when they're
learning react and it's just a whole new
mental model on top of react to learn
the flux design pattern so I suggest
just focusing on react and learning that
first before getting into redux but if
you are building an app that's huge if
you're working for a company you're
going to end up needing something to
store data so Redux is pretty much the
library of choice it became so popular
that Facebook hired the guy who wrote
redux and then Facebook ended up taking
in net that library as well and one of
the things is in react especially you
never want to mutate your data you
always want to make copies of your data
if you need to add something to it or
remove something to it that makes react
work a lot faster it has a results are
making lots of copies of data lots of
copies of arrays and objects and if
you're doing we have something that's
heavily intensive and doing a lot of
copies your app can get really slow so
there are libraries that
help with that immutable or seamless
immutable so that when you're mutating
your objects they can keep objects that
are the intersection of those two so if
you had an array and you wanted to add
something to it instead of making it a
copy of that hundred element array it'll
keep a reference to the 99 that were the
same and then just create one that's the
new one so it's this kind of high all
you have something that's really
complicated then you can end up using
this but more than likely you won't need
to use those lows libraries and here i
have an example of of using them so the
last thing I'm to talk about is API
optimization so a lot of times when you
have AP is you're going to make a
request to our REST API and you need
like four pieces of data but you get
back 100 things that it get you so you
want to know the information about
LeBron James let's say and all you want
to know is how many kids he has but what
you're going to get back is the team
that he plays for how many years has
been the league is age all kinds of
random things and sometimes we're
getting back a mega beta when all you
need is a couple of kilobytes so there
now some libraries out there that make
it possible so that you can just request
the pieces of data that you want and
there are two competing kind of ways to
do it there's graph ql and there is
Falkor so grouse ql is something that
runs on the server that sits on top of
your database and it's a JSON store so
it's a JSON interface and there are two
JavaScript API that you can use to talk
with grant pol that's real a in Apollo
relay was done by Facebook Apollo was
done by somebody else and then Falkor is
a competing way of doing the same
problem and as graph UL but it's
something that Netflix came up
so netflix and facebook at the same time
we're trying to solve the same problem
and came up with kind of two ways of
doing it so if alcohol runs on the
server as well as the client I haven't
even used any of these yet I just know
that they existed because I haven't even
had a need to build something I've
always been able to use rest and it
worked perfectly fine but that's just
something out there that you might hear
about as you start doing a reactive
element so in review we talked about all
of these things react was obviously the
main one the important thing to learn
that then going down the line this is
kind of my opinion of the order in which
you should learn these different things
learn javascript and es6 really well as
well and then tooling you're going to
need styling you're going to need to
make your app look beautiful and then so
on and so forth down the line so if
you're interested Facebook has actually
come out with a lot of these libraries
are ready they've done react as you can
see in the upper left the yarn that I
mentioned they also did that flow just
Redux flux and relay and grab ql so
Facebook is supposed to be a social
network yet they're turning out all of
these open source software libraries as
well so it's kind of confusing as to
whether they are social network or a
library but they're generating a lot of
things that us as developers can use so
for that I'm very thankful for and
speaking of thankfulness I'd like to end
my talks about thinking different people
so first want to thank devoxx for having
me to speak with you guys and allowing
me to share what I've learned as well as
eventbrite for allowing me the time to
come here to share with you and
supporting me in my speaking
opportunities and then lastly thank you
all for coming here and listening in
hopefully you're able to get something
out of what I talked about the main
reason why I like
in speaking to focuses I want them to
leave I want you to leave better than
you came in so having one thing that
will make you a better developer than
you were yesterday and something that
you can be able to apply to help you
grow and become a stronger developer so
hopefully that worked out well and with
that thank you very much I think I have
some time for questions if anybody wants
to ask questions yes
so I've been doing the rack development
for a little over a year now and react
has been like strongly popular for
probably two it's existed for four so I
think the rank the main reason why I'm
kind of betting on react is because it's
backed by Facebook and they use it for
their product so it's all integrated
into their app so if they were to just
throw it away that would really hurt
them so it kind of has that backing of
it do I believe that react will be
around five years from now maybe maybe
not but i think the development pattern
is strong so it will just morph into
something else that hopefully we can
move our code base towards so JavaScript
frameworks are down a dime a dozen like
you mentioned but I think there's a huge
emphasis in the community to make it
something that's useful to solve actual
problems like Facebook created react to
solve real world problems so I believe
that that will continue to be the case
of the question over okay
yeah so you're responsible for doing all
the CSS styling yourself with react yeah
so when you do components CSS you have
to maintain your own CSS you have to
solve it yourself at home how you name
the classes basically so in this case
are namely you could but I suggest that
you have a separate file per component
but you have to have a naming convention
to make sure that you don't have
collisions yeah you can use the shadow
Dom with react but you'd have to do it
yourself it doesn't do it automatically
question I don't think yeah so the
slides already on there on my website so
if you go there's a speaking engagement
page and i have a link to the slides or
at least there should be a link to the
slides there but if not i mentioned that
i tweeted out a link to them as well so
if you go to my Twitter account been MVP
you should see it there for sure yeah
yes the back
oh yeah right yeah so we knew that
backbone marionette was not solving our
problems we were trying to create really
sophisticated user interfaces that
eventbrite and backbone we're just
hitting the ceiling of what it was
intended to do backbone was really an
MPC library for managing your data not
for building statistic a teaser
interfaces and marionette was a library
that's set on top of it to try to
accomplish it but it's not very
component centric so if you're trying to
reuse components and kind of compose
them together it wasn't meant for that
so then we started thinking about one of
the other options there's ember is
angular 2 and react those are the main
ones and we wanted to go we decided to
go to react because we had familiar too
familiar any of the team with react
already and the community behind react
was really strong so there are a lot of
people excited about it and a lot of
just kind of ground swell around it and
I didn't feel like it would be changing
drastically like angular 1 angular 2 did
because like I said Facebook is using it
themselves so that was kind of the
motivation and then all the positives of
react in terms of the virtual dumb this
thing that it does I feel like it's very
easy once you learn how react works to
actually write react code so there are a
lot of positives in that regard as well
the other questions yes
yeah so the downside the major downside
of react is that you have to create your
own framework around it so you can't you
can build user interfaces with just
react but you probably won't if you're
trying to build something significant so
even here with this example with
components you get CSS you have to
create that environment and how that's
going to work you have to create your
own data store and how are you going to
do that so there are lot of decisions
you have to make to be able to create
your react stack so that is both a
negative and a positive if you know what
you're doing then you can really pick
exactly what you want but if you don't
know what you're doing you're probably
going to pick the wrong thing and then
be upset that you did it six months once
you actually know what's deal so and
then there's just a big learning curve
on react itself because the different
way to to program and to develop but
once you do learn it I think it's okay
yeah all right well if anybody has any
additional questions you can come up
chuck with me afterwards you don't want
to ask questions in front of everybody
or you can feel free you think of
something later to tweet me or email me
as well cool thank you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
