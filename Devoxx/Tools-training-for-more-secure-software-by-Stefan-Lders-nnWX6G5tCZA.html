have just one plea and this will be the
next 15 minutes to everybody who's doing
touching keyboards doing development
setting up services and since I'm a lazy
guy I'm giving you the presentation to
avoid that I have to do work I would
like to you doing more work and help us
securing every software stack with your
producing so this is about the use your
use of tools training for more secure
software why I'm talking this because
the problem is more or less sitting in
this auditorium we are the problem we
are producing code like the code here
which has been used since 2004 in one of
our interactive linux clusters which
means this is used by the lewis truss is
used by 10,000 of people every day and
10,000 of those people can more or less
submit to the function here their own
files and if they do since this is both
user control they can introduce some
shell commands they can put some
symbolic links which means that using
this routine will enable everybody was
spotting this to take over the whole
computing cluster and you running this
since 2004 why is this happening because
to diligence at the time of programming
wasn't there nobody was checking whether
the code makes sense code software
security is very very important at least
for me because I'm just working too much
correcting the mistakes of the past if
you look at CERN CERN is target we got
people outside CERN who tried to attack
us and get into our systems there are
people who are browsing sirness
disclosing passwords some source code
and tickets some of the things are true
some others not for example most of our
code is public because we have this one
on gate lap or github that's on purpose
but other things are not I didn't get
access to your databases first actor
website with a cross-site scripting
attack would you like to know if you're
the right person to talk about this and
try to make a deal to give you all
information there people blackmailing us
because they made it into our computing
systems they made into our web service
hacking the Large Hadron Collider part
number one part number two their videos
on the Internet where you can see how
they exploited cross-site scripting
vulnerability or some authorization
bypass they didn't get close to
let's see but this is what they thought
and last but not least using this
exploit some software to take over
servers against CERN would be win track
the people who create the Internet
there are people who are trying to get
into CERN misusing systems services
which are set up by CERN developers
maybe by you maybe by others we get
problems like cross-site scripting
cross-site scripting means more or less
you can inject into an input field like
this one where you're supposed to type
in my name to get my telephone number
but if you type in some code like alert
script alert and or script this is
executed by the browser here does not
bring any harm but of course if you
change the code you can start doing harm
to the end users and fortune the new
version of the phone book we had had the
same problem you can inject some HTML
code here at a lake and underscore and
it's dead thirdly making it into web
page she can go worse directory
transversal input has not been checked
so if you put lots of double dots here
you go up the hierarchy on your hard
disk and then you enter in the etc'
folder and you get the full list of the
password w file a WD file whereas here
it's just a listing but if you can
inject commands like cat slash et Cie
password you get the result or if you
inject something like you name a news a
you get the operating system in the
worst case and this happened in 2009
somebody was able to take over a server
and establish a nice terminal at home
this is what his turn mill was looking
like and he had direct access to our web
server because again he was able to
inject some code this is a server
takeover it's early trying to control
this we got a security team which is
helping developers and I will explain
you later how we try to to help
developers but thinking of you you are
the generation who is not dealing with
service anymore you might be the
generation who is dealing with this I
just took the pictures last weekend this
is my Sony television this is my Apple
TV box here you can see this here it's
black I bought the black one I think
there's only black one got my wii u here
i got in a llamar sound system here this
is my pause
solar power converter which is connected
to the internet or to the intranet this
my Sony HiFi stereo and this is not my
car I don't like
but this is the car of a colleague
innocent leave all of those systems are
highly interconnected nowadays I can use
my telephone to send music here I can
send my films - Apple TV I can browse
the internet with Sony TV of course I
can play a super mario kart 8 with other
peers around the world and this one is
just giving me some information how much
energy I made per day or per night and
of course listening music here airplay
and here get my starts with my car code
this is the internet of things this is
software and this is software like the
control systems for arthritis which can
hardly be corrected for once it's
deployed and this is where the next
fuckup will come and the next a
patent already in October Nastia where
the mirai botnet was ddossing the world
using the internet of things devices
routers and other things which were just
horrible because the software which has
been written was not sufficiently
secured not sufficiently tested the
software's coming in beta and it's up to
me it's up to us as end-users to bear
the cost it's up to us to bear the cost
for fixing this it's up to us for paying
patching cycles and whatever else and
this weather SQ comes in the rescue is
developers reviewing how development is
done you might have seen this one fixing
a bug in the development cycle early has
no cost
fixing the back once the system is in
service has a tremendous cost the
difference is who is bearing the cost
here the cost is borne by you because
you have to invest more time here the
costs are not necessarily born by you
but by me because me my organization
knows to invest in antivirus software we
have to invest in monitoring intrusion
detection system we have to do active
scanning we have to patch and patch
again and once we've patched the patch
again again and we patch a third time
every month we patched Windows computers
because software Devon lifecycle and
Microsoft is not the perfect one I'm not
talking about androids because in
androids you are bearing the costs
androids nowadays are vulnerable and you
will never get it fixed because your
software vendor or your hardware vendor
doesn't even care
to make it more easy for you xkcd what
are you working on trying to fix the
problem I created when I try to fix a
problem and I try to fix a problem when
I try to fix a problem and now the
question is do you want to invest in
fixing the problems beforehand or shall
I invest to fix the problem in aftermath
so what are we doing a very simple thing
so we're not going in rocket science
here there are tools around which you
can run in top of your code for
identifying standard design flaws
mistakes usages of routines for c c++ c
CP lint floor finder Rebs cavity vgg
there are tools for java there are tools
for Perl who ever use Perl PHP Perl
Python and PHP those are tools which you
can use freely you just download them
and once you compile you just run it in
front of your compiler or if you're even
if you have a software demand life cycle
you integrate this into gitlab common
interface for example this is what we
are doing with writing docker images for
the developer community which they can
run on top of the code before the code
is finalized and getting production you
run this and you get some outcome and
this is not only for the security this
will also increase the availability of
your code not having memory leaks
anymore on your code is stopping every
30 days every year every 10 years this
is also making your code better running
those tours and those tools come for
free if you do not like this you can
even go into the cloud there's a webpage
called swamp the link is here where you
can submit your code you can be found on
which platform you would like to compile
this and then before compilation this
software this cloud service is checking
your code for vulnerabilities beware
with this you give your code to somebody
else so if you get something secret in
your code maybe this is not the most
optimal way there might be better ones
like downloading those tools which you
got here there also commercial tools I
just listed here mostly apart from
cavity I listed only public tools if you
develop webpages we had CERN which we're
giving the possibility to web designers
to test their code for vulnerabilities
ap
a local application beta there are tools
we can run a vulnerability scanner if
you set up a webpage at CERN here's
webpage which is called ap eg you see
how you can manage the webpage and you
can ask for security scan and then the
security team will do a scan and look
whether your website is susceptible for
cross-site scripting SQL injection
having some common flaws which are
exploited by the attackers once you have
pages getting online and you can run
those tools yourself this is based on
open voice which is an in spin-off awful
tool called Nasser's it's freely
available you just can download this and
use this on top of your code if you go
on the web there's the open web
application security project which is
listing the ten mostly exploited
vulnerabilities for web pages and if
you're doing web deeply the web
deployment if you're doing web
development go on this web page try to
understand what those vulnerabilities
are and whether your code can be
exploited by one of those means open
versus testing for this but maybe we can
even go one step further what about
training we're giving training courses
for secure programming in Python in Java
developing secure software because what
we learned is most of the students
coming from University have learned how
to set up a web server how to run a
database how to program how to design
software but it's very rare that also
these setting up a secure web server
securing databases or developing secure
software is not in there Monday that is
not what they've learned so this is the
chance to give people additional
expertise how to program in a secure
fashion such that the code cannot be
misused for those ones who are got some
leaking blood hair and getting interest
we even going one step further so far up
to last week we've trained 150 people
becoming something we call white hats
people who we gave the chance to learn
penetration testing capabilities
penetration testing means how do you
attack a webpage to find the flaws and
to break into the webpage it's based on
something which is called a
capture-the-flag portal you got
different exercises and here the
exercises one two three four five six
seven you get all the names and what
you're doing is you're starting on a
fake web page with
lots of on abilities and to try to
figure out who's running the webpage try
to get ownership of the webpage order
information on the webpage exploit
vulnerabilities this is a trend in which
we're giving so the people are learning
how the other side how the attackers are
misusing your services why that if you
program you usually think of use cases
I'm not I'm not looking at use case I'm
not looking at the name field on the
phone book I'm looking for abuse cases
how can I misuse your software how can I
misuse a webpage how can I misuse the
database
such that I can enter in the database
into the web server using the software
that I get ownership of the underlying
server because this is what I'm looking
for I would like to own the server if I
own the server I own the life of certain
if I own your computer I own your life I
own your web camera I own your keyboard
I own your music files I own your
software I own your pictures and your
access to Facebook this is what I'm
interested in up using the software and
this is where we need you to help us to
avoid that training if you want to train
yourself hacked yourself get on those
webpages hacked aside the DEM valuable
web application there's google grab
project or wasp again is providing you
hacking portals you can go on those
website you might subscribe but then you
get a plethora of lots lots of webpages
which are all vulnerable and for you
it's the joy to break into those
websites and figure out whether they can
be broken and once you've learned how to
do this apply to your software apply to
your webpage and see whether you can
break in to your own website this is
what we're doing at CERN giving people
the chance to break into their services
so here are my plea to you when you
starting programming as offer tonight
the first thing and this is moment
smaller said we mean 80% of my cases is
check your input whenever you have an
input field which is public check the
input make sure if you're expecting a
number you get a number and not
something which is looking like code if
you expecting a name they shouldn't be
in ampersand or they should be a a
bigger sign or a smaller sign those are
things which must be filtered away in
some software packages this comes for
free their routines for this for
filtering this away it just must be done
with this new SQL injection
with this no cross-site scripting no
cross-site request forgery
I'm already prevented no comment line
injection very easy but you must find
the time to apply those routines to your
code on each user facing input field
protect secrets sometimes you have to
exchange secrets if you connect for
database for example or if you connect
between client and server make sure that
those secrets cannot be taken over by
somebody else this sounds very very
simple but there are still too many
services out there in particular if you
look at Internet of Things devices which
are using HTTP and believing HTTP is a
very good protocol to ship a password
from the client to the server side but
HTTP is not encrypted which means that
even in this room wireless access points
are sitting over there and over there
and I can now enter my computer in a
premiership mode and I can look who is
browsing at this very moment web pages
in clear-text maybe I can look at your
cookie once I get you cookie in HTTP I
can over hang over your session if a few
password I can take over your session
too so protect the secrets and their
means for protecting the secrets and
please don't reinvent the wheel if you
have no expertise in setting with web
server or a database maybe you ask
somebody maybe get a book I see too
often at CERN that people think they can
up set up a web server some summer
students coming in setting up a web
server for somebody a nice web server
here fully functional using Internet 4
out of 5 5.0 technologies brilliant
completely insecure and the summer
student will be gone and I'm sitting
there on a web server which is
completely unsecured because the student
has no clue how to set this up in the
proper fashion so again here get a book
get some training ask an expert or maybe
you're not the right job and you should
switch jobs at CERN we got an IT
department so I asked their IT
department guys sometimes they know what
they are doing look on our web page we
get tests we get good programming
guidelines for C C++ Java Perl Python
PHP here we are again with the secrets
recall here the secrets we get a
security checklist which you can go
through your code did you do this did
you do this did you do this
and then here the static code analyzer
tool also for apex for applications and
some bibliography think of your
development lifecycle if you're doing
proper development you're using tools
like Jenkins gitlab continuous
integration other tools for your
deployment process and those deployment
processes usually allow you to plug in
any other checker so take security code
analyze the static code analysis tools
into your checking it's not only about
compiling it's about compiling and
checking if you check out your compiler
- W all is your friend
maybe it's dumping you a lots and lots
of messages which you don't like but
those messages have a being so maybe
getting rid of the messages is a good
idea instead of just not using this
company this this this is this flag and
ignoring everything else and then I
mentioned or wasp and the academic where
you can go and and learn yourself last
but not least at least if you're working
for CERN computer dot security standards
eh we can help you we can make code
assessment reviews and helping you
together and agree to get your code in a
secure fashion I still have a few
minutes so let's use this few minutes to
figure out and this 20 lines of code or
we can ignore the first four are many
many different vulnerabilities somebody
got an idea
I leave this for you as an exercise you
can find the slides on our security web
pages maybe attached to this so they
didn't know this through this event
here's the solution thank you very much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
