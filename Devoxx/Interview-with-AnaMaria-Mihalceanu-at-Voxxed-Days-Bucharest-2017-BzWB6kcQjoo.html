about 12 factor app so so people who
aren't familiar with that could you just
explain a bit of the background yes
the 12 factor app is actually a
methodology that helps you into building
successful cloud application usually the
technology is being used for
applications that are offered as a
software service or applications that
need to be delivered on a platform as a
service
so this 12 factors app is actually a
blueprint when it comes to building your
own application that help that should be
ready to run on a cloud offering so
basically what I known about this
methodology it has applications and
software as a service and platform as a
service why not an infrastructure as a
service this is because they usually
infrastructure the service is just
Hardware stuff with things more basic in
who was a developer as a coder you not
feel the change from on-premise fine
actually you feel the changes will be in
performance because you know clouds
should be more performant than what you
used to have before and so then to sum
up this is the main applicant for for
this is a methodology and as you can see
it's not something new it's something
that's been used usually by those that
build the platforms but it's also
something that we as coders can use to
design our applications and to make them
I don't know it's agnostic it's possible
to change so when you're building an
application you really want to be able
to move it very very easily to do not
feel very tight to the environment to
the services that exist in the
environment and of course when it's in
production you don't want to get
panicked
when something didn't happen as you have
presumed initially a lot of things can
occur
and you cannot think of everything from
the beginning so basically this is what
I'm going to talk to you about today and
how to do such an application and I hope
to have time enough time to show both a
code for an application made with Java
and code with for an application with
notes yes because I want for coders
developers and any technical person to
understand that this methodology applies
not only for a certain language that it
kind of can be applied to multiple
languages it's a success ok it sounds
really good I when I write about it it
seemed like it it's really integral to
building in a microservice building
something with a microservice
architecture
yes not only that actually I believe
that's a very good methodology to build
as an enterprise application actually
it's a very good methodology to um you
know to migrate something from
on-premise to cloud so I mean a client
or somebody wants to move their their
application to make them better to
improve them you just follow these rules
these factors and you can get a
successful product so I have used some
of these factors also uh none from it
because one of those are applying also
turn on premise parts but they're not as
successful as for the cloud so the cloud
offers because more elastic is offering
a much better support and using those
factors and have a very very robust
application one of the some of the
factors that apply not just to the cloud
but also 25 applications so the first
factor the codebase it's the most
important and a lot of developers saying
go come on you think the source control
system but the problem with the source
control system is not the fact that
you're ok I'm using it so I don't need
to know anything else about it so on
your version income there's a lot of
persons that are have different opinions
on how versioning and application should
occur
and it was one spawning into a lot of
codebases occurs and people lose their
focus from what they were doing and and
developers have to think about all this
feature was on that one-city of is
another so you are just caught in a web
when doing that that's one sector that
applies to both also there's other
factors to you know to code your
application in a very decoupled manner
so to not use those one-time more
processes like all coded in the same
place or all starting in the same time
because you might not need for all those
to be started at the same time other
factors I think there's an important
factor about logging that can be
thinking too encouraging taken into
account also in our ultimate application
so logging should be done not just by
you know that's a lot for change that is
so popular but guys do not be afraid of
using third-party libraries they're very
helpful when you meet audits trust me
I can serve for that so yes there a lot
of a lot of these factors can find
similar application ability in our day
to day life as I'm premise</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
