Victor octave and i am a developer
evangelist with samsung electronics
canada and here's my colleague Sean
O'Brien it is senior developer also we
both came from Mike or British Columbia
to share something interesting with you
and there's two of us because there's a
lot to show and a lot to talk about so
we needed a reinforcement today so I
want to start with the puzzle just to
you know wake you up what do you thing
is this it's kind of it's kind of tough
on huh isn't it so I'll give you a hint
so n is the number of Samsung devices
that we currently have in this audience
and can you show me the hands just to
indicate how many of you have samsung
smartphone or okay so thank you so plus
1 means that we're going to increase
that amount by one device after the
session so what we're going to do are
you all given the coupons when you came
in here so based on those coupons we're
going to do the draw and one of you
lucky winner will come here and you know
do a little talk in exchange for the
device and how many of you guys have
attended yesterday is a keynote session
yeah I also enjoyed it quite a lot and
especially the presentation by dr.
Lawrence cause he basically minded us
that according to the cosmic scale you
know we don't have much time because our
galaxy and the earth and the most in
Java and everything else is going to
disappear quite quickly you know in a
cosmic scale so what do we do well I
think we better to have fun right and so
for those of you who are going to have
fun building b2b mobile solutions
that's the presentation and that's the
reason why we're here to help you to
equip you with some tricks so you can
join an army of those gold diggers you
know um it's kind of interesting because
if you look at the research there's a
huge demand for mobile b2b solutions and
there it grows at about twelve percent a
year because if you look at it like you
walk into pretty much any cafe you walk
on a train you walk to a restaurant you
are you check into your hotel room and
there's mobile devices everywhere
tablets you know that dew point of sale
you know you can buy the tickets you can
control your room environment everyone
goes mobile these days but the number of
developers who actually focus on b2b
mobile solutions is kind of low and of
course the rest is focusing on consumer
market so hopefully after this
presentation we're going to bump up that
number a little bit so just to give you
an example what are the b2b or business
mobile solutions or here's an example
it's basically one of our partners who
implemented this solution it's it's a
point of sale advertising so they
basically install this tablet in a shop
and you know the arm the visitors can
you know browse through the products and
do some queries selections and as you
can see it it's a it's a quite different
use case then you know then the consumer
kind of use cases because you know you
kind of have to protect the device so
people cannot really mess up with the
settings they cannot you know they you
know they should leave the device in the
same state as it was before they came to
work with it right so here's another use
case that's a visiting nurse association
basically nurses go to the patient's
houses and you know they conduct some
tests and they they
I have to access the patient's data on
on those tablets so as you can see it as
you can feel it's quite important to
provide some additional degree of
security in case if a tablet like this
is lost the patient records should not
be available for extraction so the
security agreements are quite quite high
here here's another example you check
into one of the Costa add a hick run
hotel and spin and you'll see a tablet
like this in your room so with that
tablet you can interact with you know
with the hotel staff and you can you
know check what the local points of
interests and you know what's the menu
you are you know some of this is the
hospitality solutions they even allow
you to control like the room parameters
lighting temperature turn on TV and
again you can think you know if you
think about the requirements it's quite
different than the consumer can ask but
is because again you know even if you
allow people to browse for example an
internet you need to make sure that when
they check out you clear everything
because you don't want to leave any
history any cookies anything that you
should be able to again make sure that
they cannot mess with the settings so
different requirements so when you
compare a b2c being you know consumer
mobile solutions versus B to B which is
business mobile solutions they're not
quite it's not like comparing apples to
oranges it's comparing to apples
together but these apples are you know
quite different so the head let's have a
look at some non functional requirements
to and up or solution when you build it
for consumer market so obviously
performance right everyone wants to you
know wants to have a smooth you know
running device you know everything is
done synchronously you know all data in
the loading and done properly and you
know nothing blocks the UI thread and
user experience should be nice you know
ergonomic layout
in a nice flow hopefully native
experience on the platform that people
are used to some degree of security and
usually in consumer you know solutions
we are with secure data in transmission
we just use all good SSL and that's
usually on desert scalability is
important of course because you know
what's the worst and the best that can
happen to our app you know it's the
increased amount of users you know and
the worst part about that is that we
have to our architecture has to scale
properly and has to deal with that and
of course when we build for consumer
markets with target generic kind of
platform we want to build for you know
for old Android devices out there and of
course we're talking about Android here
so we built for all android devices
regardless of you know vendor and
hopefully we target the latest three you
know android versions said to make sure
that as many people as possible can
actually use our solution so when you
look at the non-functional requirements
for b2b that's you know a bit different
so we need their demands for hardened
security and I going to actually show
you what what other bits and pieces of
hardened security we need to be able to
manage the devices like imagine all
those nurses that you know go out to the
patient care homes and you know carrying
all these devices and what if you need
to push a new version of the app what if
you need to enforce a certain policy on
the device you know it's impossible to
you know pick each individual device and
tweak it manually you have to be able to
do it from a central console you know
somewhere in an IT department of that
hospital just you know make sure see the
whole list of devices and manage them
okay and device customization that's
another requirement so if you think
about you know that the three whales
upon which the whole earth of b2b mobile
solutions situated that's basically it
harden security device manageability and
customization so customization means you
take a stock consumer device and you
customize it to a single purpose
appliance to a point of sale or to
in-flight entertainment system or to
hospitality up or to that health care in
a tablet you know instead of building a
special hardware why don't we take you
know a stock consumer device and turn it
to a single purpose device or single
purpose appliance and in b2b we have a
luxury to target a single platform and
sometimes just a single device model
because we don't have to you know be
able to deploy you know those nursing no
patient care solutions across all the
devices we pick the best platform that
provides all these you know options you
know the best manageability options the
best customization options and we built
on that platform and one important thing
to notice is that you know you can
probably as Android developers you know
that sometimes when you need to you know
squeeze something extra from your
Android device that's not supported by
you know on an API you know you go to
stack overflow and you ask the question
how do I do that is it possible yeah
it's possible but you have to root the
device so for consumer market it works
right for b2b market you can pretty much
forget about it for two reasons security
because you know you're going to install
untrusted you know a planning system
image and the second good reason is that
route rooting voids the warranty okay so
you can't possibly sell your solution to
a customer you know with the little
discourse that you know it by the way
you're not going to have any warranty on
the devices so that's just not going to
cut it so let's just nail the the the
point about building for a single
platform so again there's a you know
pretty big the existing issue with the
device for
entation in in android market and we
talked about fragmentation across
different vendors so you know of course
when you build for b2c you basically
want to cover you want to make sure that
every single square in this map is able
to run your solution in b2b you pick the
best square from this whole matrix and
you build and you deploy your solution
to that square ok so we have a luxury of
doing that so in other words in b2b
businesses they have control over the
device fleet as opposed to the wild west
of you know consumer market so let's
have a look at all these three
requirements so hardened mobile security
what does it really mean you know how
how hard should it be well quite often
when you build especially for
enterprises for healthcare for law
enforcement for you know Department of
Defense they want to have a hardware
rooted trust on the device so what does
it mean it means that at any point of
time we want to have a proof that the
system has been compromised and that
proof has to be based on the values you
know on some keys or maybe algorithms
that are stored in a hardware cannot be
modified cannot be stolen cannot be you
know substituted okay so there's
different measures how to do it so for
example you know I you can install a
pair of a symmetric keys on the device
and it's called a hardware device root
key and so you know the oam basically
signs the public key you know with their
root key so the benefits of the of doing
that is that every device has a unique
pair of keys and every device can
actually you know sign some data using
you know the private key from that from
that pair and provide you with that send
data and you can look you know at the
certificate
and and say okay is coming from the
trusted source why would you need such
data signed by the device well look at
this at the second board remote device
attestation you know I in b2b sometimes
you are you have to ask the device
before you do anything else on the
device you have to ask the device are
you still in a good uncompromised state
and the device should gather all the
evidences you know from its own hardware
software you know layers and you know
put together a statement that says yes
I'm still good or no sorry I'm broken
and that evidence has to be signed by
that private key you know the
certificate is added and you look at
that assertion and you basically you
know and then you kick in your workflow
whether or not to do anything else
interesting measure is void warranty
fuse you know sometimes the requirements
come from the business if a device has
ever been compromised there must be a
permanent evidence that it took place
and from that point on that device
shouldn't be used for any you know
security sensitive you know operations
so basically for some in some use cases
that device becomes kind of obsolete it
still works in a consumer you know
consumers are still normal Android
device but for businesses for
enterprises you know based on just one
time you know warranty fuse you know
that device is no longer acceptable and
you know once we go up the up the stack
you know there's a there must be OS
level data protection we know that
Android is based on linux of course and
in Linux we have discretionary access
control so basically you know
enterprises they don't really have
control over you know what data are
secure and you know what what are the
what are the rules basically it's up to
the developers or up to the users well
on
it's not good enough so for example this
could be hardened by security
enhancements for Android when you know
when you create security domains and you
place applications in those domains on
the phone and the the boundaries of
those domains are governed by the rules
and those rules are controlled by the
enterprise okay so moving moving on when
you boot the device you know the
sequence of boot loader loaders kick in
you want to make sure that those boot
loaders are authentic they haven't been
substituted because bootloader basically
initializes your you know some of the
components of your hardware so you know
providing drivers so you don't want
anybody to intercept all your voice for
example by adding a malicious bootloader
so you need to authenticate boot loaders
and you need to you know remember you
know that they actually authentic for in
case if the device has to provide
attestation later moving on integrity
based services so all this normal common
kind of secure cryptographic services
that we all use everywhere else they
become integrity based in a hardened
security area what does it mean it means
every time you go to the key store and
you ask you know get me the key or get
me the certificate by this Ellis the
system first checks it's in your
security state whether or not it's been
compromised if the system realizes that
there was you know there was a an
untrusted bootloader for example or the
warranty bit is set that's it you know
ever going to get your key ever and it's
really impossible to extract it so this
kind of stuff application security
moving all the way to the application
layer you know it's important to have
measures like containerization and we're
going to talk about containers on mobile
platforms it's important to have VPN you
know a choice of
from VPN implementations and quite often
enterprises they don't want to channel
all the traffic through their VPN
concentrators they want to just you know
pick their app like maybe email and said
that only email traffic goes through
that VPN so we have to be able to
provide pure up VPN capabilities and
single sign-on of course quite often
requested by by the businesses so on you
may think gosh that's that's like a lot
that's a lot of measures that have to be
you know provided to satisfy the
hardened security requirements well this
is why we here guys we basically want to
introduce so-called Knox Samsung Knox
platform can you please show me how many
of you heard about Samsung Knox that's
quite impressive so our mission is
basically a decade in a developer
community that there is a secure
platform like this that implements all
these measures you know comes with the
hardware root of trust and it's actually
been certified by a number of government
organizations around the world you know
that have pretty strict requirements to
security okay so the whole stack has
been certified not just the application
layer the whole stack okay so if your
face the requirement of picking a mobile
platform that's you know that that that
has to satisfy the hard and security
requirements this is the platform to use
but platform by itself wouldn't be
enough right you still need to have you
know the programming tools the EP is to
take advantage the whole power of this
platform and so this is this is where we
move to another requirement mobile
device management so you know it's known
in a disease as MDM MDM solutions or
mobile device management this is in a
nutshell how it works we we have a
device and the device has a bunch of AP
is that allow you to enforce certain
policies turn off
on the camera configure your Wi-Fi
pre-configured Bluetooth profiles so you
know when you pair it but the device the
user doesn't have to interact at all a
lot of different ap is and so on and
then there's a some kind of third-party
implementation that you know provides an
MDM agent on your device and that MGM
agent communicate somehow with the back
end it's completely you know irrelevant
you know what kind of protocols they use
the point is is that that MDM agent
invokes local MGM EP is okay so the more
granular and the richer set of those
api's you have on a mobile platform the
better it suited for again b2b and
enterprise solutions and so here we're
happy to introduce you a set of those
eps we called knock standard SDK we
basically have a number of different API
that will package in SD case and
separate SDKs okay so this is not
standard SDK and if those of you who
actually been to a booth you can see
that each SDK has a dedicated station
where you can see that how how that
works so knock standard SDK comes with
430 device policies that's quite a lot I
bet if I can if I challenge you right
now to name to come up with at least a
hundred of possible policies you can
think of about enforcing on a device
that would be quite hard but 430 you
know you can imagine you can tweak
pretty much every you know software
setting on a device and you know there
are some examples here and what's
interesting this is not something that
we introducing right now this API has
been used by our MGM partners for years
already at least like 34 years and
hopefully you see some of these names
are you know they look familiar you know
they all provide MDM solutions you know
that we
that you know roughly with that same
architecture that I showed you before
and they all eventually call our api's
from nock standard SDK so here's just
one of the examples you know you are you
can you can implement a simple kiosk
mode it's basically a very restricted
Android environment you know still you
have Android launcher but maybe a couple
of apps maybe I'm you know disabled
settings removed notification bar but
still Android environment there's
another kiosk type that we're going to
talk about later so when it comes to to
the code it's quite easy to to to use
those api's so one thing to tell you is
that every time you use each of those
api's from from the Knox platform you
basically need to activate the license
and some licenses are free some licenses
our fee-based but once you activate the
license basically the top part of the
slide is all about that the plumbing you
know once you have the license it's
basically a single call so in this
example we're applying a policy and
we're saying that this application
cannot be cannot be uninstalled okay so
once you make this call the user comes
to the application manager they just
cannot uninstall this up and clearly
this is one of the perfect requirements
in b2b you know solutions you know a
taxicab driver should not be able to
uninstall you know the point-of-sale
solution that you've implemented on the
tablet so you may say well that all
sounds great but i'm not an MDM vendor
you know it's not my business I want to
just build you know something else some
solutions business solutions not an MDM
product and that's fine because you
don't actually you don't even have to
implement this whole distributed
architecture in on the backend you can
invoke all those ap is locally you know
by triggering some local events you can
draw a geofence for example and
implement parenting control you know
application based on that geofence when
the kid lives near the secure perimeter
or maybe you know maybe it's some kind
of school you know solution you know you
disable certain apps that's you know
everything happening locally there's no
need to build an MDM so the best way to
our to show you what what you can do
with the NOC standard MDM API is to ask
our friend Sean to give us some demos
perfect thank you victor and so there's
going to be about three demos and for
the rest of this talk for the first one
I'm going to address the standard APK
the victor just talked about and a quick
word on the set up here so this is
actually a device that I've hooked up to
the laptop using a solution called
sidesync and it is a device is not an
emulator and so if you're developing
solutions it's best to have a device on
hand to do that and so for the folks of
this demo will be the standard SDK I'm
going to cut focus on the application
management policies and so that we there
are four hundred and thirty so I'm just
going to narrow it down the application
management then show you some kind of
unique things you can do in terms of
application management on a Samsung Knox
device and so the first one up will be
disabling an application and so you can
see in my home screen there I have the
player store and the bottom corner there
I'm going to launch a demo application
so this is effectively a test harness
type application and you can see my
phone is actually an airplane mode at
the moment in case someone gives me a
call for them so that that's the point
here is that there's no kind of ambient
back-end required as Victor just
mentioned the all these applet all these
apr's have been invoked locally on the
device and so I'm going to disable that
and the google play market sort of a
shorthand for this to save the market
and toast android american has been
disabled and you'll see that the user
now has no longer access to that play
store and the use case for that could be
multiple sewed it could be just a
corporate liable device where they
don't require the android market or they
might be pushing in-house applications
for example and what the disabled
feature is good and that it will
maintain the application data from that
apk so you're not going to removing
anything so it can be used quite well
with features like geofencing which is
also part of the standard SDK and so a
good example of that is maybe disabling
the camera if you enter a certain
location so we'd have locked down
geo-coordinates some application gets
disabled when it enters that circular
geofence or whatever geofences to find
when they leave the application can be
restored it can be enabled again and and
all is all is good so if I click enable
America there it'll pop back up and
although it will go through my probably
at the last screen there faster and for
the next one that's going to be the
final application damn well then I'm
going to go through for the standard is
the more nuclear option of uninstalling
the application and so a lot of the
application api's are based on package
name just to point that out so in just
in this test app I actually have an
ability to just pull up all the package
names and but there's you know the
multiple workarounds or ways of getting
this multiple third-party utilities that
can pull the package name and so I'm
going to take maybe chrome there calmed
Android Chrome and apply that as a
parameter for uninstalling
okay uninstalled package APK uninstalled
and so if i go to my google folder I no
longer see chrome so that is and the
reason I picked that one too damn was
it's quite unique on us on an Android
device to Abdul simply uninstall that I
step to it I click the button enter the
package name but you can imagine as an
application developer you can simply you
know that can be completely abstract
from the user and so this could be
useful for as well as corporate liable
deployments it might be something that
you know antivirus vendors might be
interested in and that has been the case
we have a number of partners who deploy
their solutions in combination with MDM
where they would do behavioral analysis
of certain apks if something reaches a
certain threshold it will uninstall that
application for example okay and that
concludes the demo for the NOC standard
so I'm going to come back and four two
more we'll talk about customization and
premium shortly Thank You Jean there was
no good so when we talk about device
management there is one interesting
problem that comes to mind specifically
when you are deployed to the
enterprise's managing personal space
versus workspace you know you know these
days people bring you know people would
like to use a single device to you know
to their personal stuff browsing
facebook you know instagram and the
businesses would like to would like to
provide the ability for those users to
access their corporate resources but
there's one problem there's and of
course you know you you probably
recognize those scenarios if you ask
some IT administrators what BYOD stands
for they'll some of them will tell it
stands for bring your own disaster
because it doesn't really quite work the
way it was expected because people bring
all kinds of devices so you know as a
remedy at least they
list and say well choose your own device
from that list and then we'll we'll make
sure you can access the corporate data
but generally speaking you know when
your access both personal and work data
and applications on the same device
there's a conflict of interest who
controls what you know because people
don't want to be told what websites they
cannot cannot visit what apps they can
or cannot install businesses they you
know they want to protect make sure that
you know nothing happening you know that
can potentially compromise the device
compromise the data so there's a
collisional interest and the way to
resolve that collision is by using
containerization okay so business
installs their apps you know host their
data in a container that provides an
interaction isolation data isolation any
day that that's generated within the
container is getting encrypted right
away with one of those hardware-based
keys meaning you cannot decrypt that
data anywhere else on any other device
okay and so there's no there's a lot of
different container solutions for even
for Android and but they're all
different some containers require
application wrapping which means you
actually have to modify the application
bytecode some of them you know provide
more or less you know manageability
features because you I tell mints
traders they manage the container they
have a full control of what they do and
of course the more manageability options
they have the happier they are the
easier it is to manage the container so
you may ask well where do I get one of
those containers and the answer is if
you have a galaxy device in your pocket
the container is already there you just
need to activate it and you need to you
know manage it and you can do it
programmatically okay so one of the the
actual name of the product that that's
actually a defense great great container
is Knox workspace and it's already on
the devices
a and it's you know integrated with all
this hard and security stat and it
provides a pretty seamless experience
for the user you know basically their
personal personal state space stops at
the left screen here and you know they
in order to enter the container space
they have to get authenticated and and
this is something already subject to the
policies the IT admins they actually you
know they can decide what kind of
authentication is required is it pass
code base is a pattern-based is a
two-factor authentication that's already
subject to the policies and once you
move inside of the container you know
users cannot do anything that they're
not supposed to do because all is
heavily you know controlled by the HM
inst Raiders and so there's an API that
also exists it's integrated with the
Knox platform it's already on your
phones and you can use that API to
actually create one of those containers
programmatically you can actually create
up to two containers programmatically in
case if you know sometimes you need to
do that and you know the architecture is
quite open because you can actually you
can even plug in third-party containers
that would be situated on this hardened
security hardin platform okay so this is
a quite you know amazing API it allows
you to you know manage the container it
also allows you to for example request
at the station data using agitation API
this is the API that you use to access
hardware backed keystore remember I
mentioned you know the one that you know
every time you trying to fetch a key it
checks the state of the platform for
security from security point of view and
so it's really easy to use again so we
we try to you know make sure those tools
are you know pretty
pretty painless for the developers so
what we do in this case that you know
enabling that hardware-based keystore i
left the package name specifically to
show you that it's actually good old
Java Java keystore all you have to do
you have to specify a different provider
Chima key store and you know I I'm not
going to explain what Timmy is it's it's
another like an hour-long talk but
please come to our booth and we'll we'll
tell you all about it so that's all you
have to do to start using hardware back
key store you know quite quite obvious
right and again you know if you're not
and then you know in the MGM providing
business you can use a lot of features
of this API like for example you can
enable pure up VPN maybe that's the
whole reason why use this API ok or you
know you can you can integrate smart
cards you know there's a lot of
different ways to integrate smart cards
you know bluetooth USB you know just use
this EP I can do that so here comes
another demo just to show you how
touched yours perfect perfect perfect
thank you and this is going to be kind
of pretty straightforward so I'm just
going to go through the usability side
of the Knox container so on the device
here you can see that it's a it's in the
personal space which is the device owner
with Android and and the idea would be
that you would keep your personal
information on the device side when you
want to secure a few sensitive data
confidential information that you wished
an extra layer of protection and that
would be deployed into the knocks
container the Knox workspace container
and a key takeaway here is that it's a
native environment it is not virtualized
or anything like that it's it
essentially another user profile on the
Android device so what the multi-user
framework came into android in I think
for dot 4 and principally targeting
tablets so you can you know share your
tablet at your home and whoever is
whoever's there and but it's not it has
been utilized so much on the phones yet
as a phone is effectively a single user
device really and but it's been
leveraged by Sampson to create this
workspace so this maintain strong degree
of isolation between the application
data and for example every application
in error and you couldn't even have
Google Play running inside the container
and if you saw which the point being
that it will support any application
that supports the Android multi the
framework can run natively in this
containerized environment that would be
one of the benefits on top of a kind of
third-party container solutions that
don't have that native experience and
some of the policies that you control
the fixed we just mentioned would be the
VPN example so you could do a VPN for
every application that situated in the
container or you could use duty p.m. on
a per application basis if that was
wished as well the file system is
completely separate as well and
encrypted AES 256-bit encryption and the
the way it's hooked up is that as Victor
talk about the Hydra back to integrity
if the device is compromised at boot
time the fact is on a separate file
system which is encrypted tied to those
Hydra backed encryption keys means that
the file system will not be accessible
and so those would be the decryption
routines happen in this trust own area
on the on the chip and it's not going to
release the decryption keys there are on
the routines to allow you to access this
file system so if the device is rooted
privilege escalation attempt like that
the container factory just locked down
and you just have an ax cryptid file
system or you can access the keys and so
this environment is referred to as the
launcher so it's a complete context
switch for the end user and we have a
separate one and that can be added more
folder based you I where it's not as
jarring and so the launcher was how
knock was originally launched which is
actually back in October 2013 so it's
quite a mature and product at this point
and so I'm just going to switch the
environment from being a launcher to a
folder mode you I everything is the same
under the hood it's still an encrypted
file system and the difference now is
that when you activate there when you
wish to look into the knocks container
it just effectively looks like a folder
on your device
you don't get that big navigation poach
but the file says everything is the same
underneath the hood so to speak so you
still have a separate file system there
and maybe just to illustrate that
quickly if I take a picture of all you
guys oh ok not alight nope doesn't like
it ok and so you can see that's that's
been saved and and this is in the
gallery and the file system of the Knox
container now so you can see there's two
pictures there and this will not be on
the gallery of the actual device it'll
be a separate set of pictures in that
space because it's got it's completely
separate as I said okay and yeah so I
guess those are the main takeaways
native environment everything inside the
container is totally configurable so
it's a fact you like the standard SDK
that I just went through in terms of
application management all that can be
applied to inside the container as well
and so youÃ­ve the ability to if you
don't like these set of applications the
container you can put your own
applications in there as a developer you
can control that mucositis stays there
and what goes and with Knox the platform
provides security by default so that
that's to do with encryption routines
the victor talked about what's
configurable is the kind of application
air stuff so things like copy paste can
I move data between my work space versus
my device owner space a lot of those
decisions are left up to companies on a
kind of per app and a prayer department
basis ok so I was a quick run through
the container let's switch back to
Victor now Thank You Sean thanks a lot
so um containers are great there's one
problem about containers they provide
interrupted user experience because
users kind of have to switch between
personal and work space and you know
that requires authentication and you
know some containers they you know they
don't even look like Android environment
you know if you look at the third party
containers day you know they look like
I'm up with you know up within you know
Android and little icons like like some
kind of custom launcher so in other
words sometimes you face a requirement
from a customer we want you to you know
put and up in a container but we don't
want to you know interrupt the user
experience you know what can you do well
fortunately in you know if you implement
your solution with on a Knox platform we
provide you with a simple way to achieve
just that it's called Knox enable up so
basically all you have to do is to tweak
your manifest just add basically this
line to the manifest and recompile the
app and you know when you deploy the app
on them on a desktop it will receive
that little icon you know that that
little key log okay and what that means
that means when you launch the app is
going to launch in the invisible
container you know still data isolation
interaction isolation from the rest of
the space you know from the user space
but it is completely uninterested user
experience what's interesting if you
sign your apps with the same you know
key then those apps will be both of your
apps or many of your apps will be
deployed in the same invisible container
so you'll be able to interact between
your apps but not with the other vendors
not with the personal space not with the
other invisible containers so that's
quite nice and so remember again the
requirements the not different
non-functional requirements for the b2b
solutions or hardened security device
manageability and customization so let's
talk about customization so these are
actually examples you know for what some
of the solutions made by you know built
by our partners so on this one it's a
swisscom they it's a hospitality
solution babe I
built by swisscom they basically plays
those tablets in in the hotels that they
you know provided him IT management for
and the users use those tabs to you know
to change the room environment as I
mentioned earlier you know access some
of the hotel services browse the local
directories of you know points of
interests and they cannot do anything
else that you know that hasn't been you
know provided as a use case requirement
they cannot you know change any of the
settings on that on that tablet here's
another example buffalo wild wings
there's a there's a chain of restaurants
in the States you basically come to the
restaurant there's a there's a tablet on
a table and you can use that tablet to
answer some of the quizzes there's like
TV screens all over and in the writing
you can jump into those quizzes start
answering them and and you can win some
prizes you can use this tablet to play
some games with your you know with your
friend at the table and what's
interesting just introducing that you
know feature to a restaurant boosted the
number of visitors like by some crazy
percentage close to 20 or 25 I don't
remember exactly but it was amazing you
know when people have a choice where to
go they said well let's go hello to
buffalo well they have this cool tablet
and here's an example of in-flight
entertainment system you know if you fly
with urge Virgin Atlantic airline you
know you'll be provided a tablet like
this it's it's it's actually a samsung
tablet that has been customized it the
only purpose the only way you can the
only thing you can do on that tablet is
to watch videos and listened to the
audios and and read newspapers
electronically and by doing by
implementing this kind of solution they
could remove all these wires from the
airplane they could throw away all these
people newspapers printed newspapers and
magazines
those folks actually they they work with
the airlines and they told me that if
they save one killer of weight you know
on the airplane then over the year on a
normal airliner it accumulates 250
thousand dollars of saving and fuel just
one kilo okay so you can imagine if you
reap those kilometres of wires you know
from the legacy in-flight entertainment
systems the airline wouldn't have
problem paying for your solution just
from the saved money right some and
there's mapi we have an API to customize
the devices those API is they actually
package in Knox customization SDK and
you can you know it's basically an
extension of NOC standard it goes into
you know more detailed customization
features so for example you have more
granular control over your device
features like notification bar you can
do way more things with notification but
you can actually print a custom message
on a notification bar if you want to you
know there's really no such API is in
the stock Android as the game and what's
interesting sometimes your customers
come with like absolutely crazy
requirements we want we want you to bump
a standard USB charge rate from 500
milliamps to seven hundred milliamps
just because you know this solution
require you know drove so much current
that the normal charge rate cannot keep
up what do you do there's really no api
for that even in our library well you
come to samsung and we can build a
custom rom for you guys you know a
custom binary for your solution and we
can do a lot in those custom binders and
sometimes when we have this the same
request coming on and on and on we
actually you know build an API because
you know we get tired of building custom
banners we'll just build make that so
one of the recent additions to an API a
feature that migrated from the custom
banners to an API layer layer it's a
custom boot loader and the custom sound
so you can actually provide your own you
know
branded you know animation and sound
maybe you know instead of playing music
you should provide instructions to a
taxi driver how to use that point of
sale system it's perfectly perfectly
normal and then so here's an example how
to use our customization API so
basically in this case we are setting a
kiosk mode a professional kiosk mode
where we are we can pick an activity at
home activity basically an app that will
be invoked when you press a home button
and it doesn't have to be a launcher
because normally you know you can you
know you can implement a launcher style
application but in this case it could be
any of you build your point-of-sale you
bind it to you know to a device's home
activity next time the user clicks you
know home button they land on your point
of sale system and they cannot you know
land on a normal lunch or anymore and so
on and then you can apply some policies
to that kiosk and then you basically
turn the device into pro kiosk mode and
that's it from that point on nobody can
you know use it as a general purpose
android phone now it's single purpose of
plans and one of the questions that you
may ask well how do i escape that mode
like sometimes I you know even from IT
management perspective I do need to have
access to the you know to the steel to
the old good android environment well
that's why you have the passcode so sean
is going to show you you know where you
can actually enter that passcode to
unlock the device into the normal
generic mode okay and here's the demo
perfect thank you yes a change of device
so a lot of customization opportunities
tend to work best on tablets so i'm
using a tab a device here now it's
connected to the to my laptop so I just
blow up the lock screen and so we have a
demo application that can show you a lot
of the API is that are available and
with customization SDK and it's all
accessible via the settings menu so it's
arranged by sdk version support and so
depending on what device you have if it
supports the latest SDK is it will be
here and in market at the moment
anything on Android lollipop will be up
to nest EK 2 dot 4 and and here are some
of the features ejector talked about so
the pro kiosk mode another term for that
we have in the API in the javadocs that
you'll see would be sealed mode and so
when you activate see them or do you get
a lot of other choices in terms of what
you can do even with the status bar
icons there so you can choose to display
them so um the battery percentage of the
battery if this was connected to Wi-Fi
network you would also see them you know
you'd see that was connected to Wi-Fi
network and maybe we don't want to show
that for this deployment but the clock
is fine and in terms of setting the home
package so you could select any
application here that's currently
installed in the device and so I
actually have an application that's from
a partner solution and forced air wind
Airlines so this is bae systems we
develop in flight commercialization
solutions and so I'll set that package
to be the home package and and I can do
other options here so if you've seen the
lock screen when i logged on initially i
can just hit remove lock screen there at
that point and that will remove the lock
screen so that when i turn if the device
is in a powered off state and i turn it
on again it's not going to prevent
present the user with them i swipe even
a swipe if that was there we've blown
away because it's just an extra if you
think of the the point of Seram the
point of sale terminal type solutions
it's it you don't want the whoever's
taking the order to have to hit the
power button do a swipe at whatever it
just wonder you wanted to turn onto your
application straight away and so with
your really simple api to allow you to
do that and some other examples at the
bottom we've enabled adb so i could kill
my demo right now if i decided to turn
off USB access here and we can also
automatically turn on gps so that's
without presenting the user with a
pop-up it would just automatically turn
on
and some other various options that I'm
not going to step into an all super
detail but you can see with lots of
things there including even remapping
Hydra buttons so you can get the
hardware buttons made the volume keys to
do task switching for example or
depending on the deployment okay so at
this point if I hit the home button
which woodside sink is this on the
right-hand side of the screen it should
launch that stair wind Airlines
application so I'll just switch that
into landscape mode and this is their
in-flight entertainment solution then
and so this is what we hand out to
customers on the flights and for
accuracy movies so one of their
requirements when they're building this
solution to allow them to run the latest
Hollywood releases for example and it's
very important that end users cannot
extract the movies after device so
oftentimes the movies are they're
actually physically on the device and it
could be a streaming solution as well on
board the aircraft I've seen them do
every which way and with the key
requirement is you're not allowing end
users access the USB for example if they
physically at oftentimes it's physically
blocked but we need we can also block
that the software layer so if someone
hacks in air someone plugs into USB
device and they're not going to extract
em these movies for example and another
thing I'd point out about this solution
and where we can wear the application
management API is that I talked about
earlier common useful are the fact that
they allow and users to log into their
email application for example so if this
tablet has been passed around multiple
users the next time some comes on it's
very important that application data
does not stay there and we this is where
you could use customization for one part
of the solution the professional kiosk
and then use other api's such as wiping
application data when the tablets been
restated effectively when the flight is
over in the handed back to it to the air
hostess for example and for escaping
then so at this point you're kind of
locked in and so this button on the
right hand side normally presents the
multitask window that's been blocked and
the home button whenever I press it's
just going to come back to the launcher
of that application and so how to get
out of it and so I'm just after holding
down the physical power button on the
device and that's disconnected there but
you can see it's added another option
the power screen for seal mode and this
would prevent you I to enter a passcode
that you can programmatically set in
your code to escape the kiosk and we can
also add custom menus to this power
button so we could add a contact ozzer
you know maybe that would direct them to
your support channel and and the obvious
one in terms of power off and restart we
do have api's to prevent that as well
abso end user just completely locked
into that environment and in totality
really until the until ism administrator
allows them to do one installer to get
out scape the kiosk so if I click on
that it's just going to pop me a
passcode 6824 if I had the right one rfh
it for this sake of the demo app I've
enabled the back button to be used and
but we could also disable in a proper
deployments you would disable all
hardware buttons including the the back
button getting back to this stage okay
so I was really quick walk through of
customization and an example of a
partner solution and play thank you some
yep so we coming coming to a conclusion
a few more options to describe so those
of you guys who who know about hybrid
apps you know you know it's a different
way to build an application you can
basically instead of using native code
you can take a webview and put together
a UI using html5 CSS and JavaScript
deployed on different mobile platforms
and if you use a proper framework it
actually going to provide the hooks to
the native services on that platform so
one of the great examples of such
framework is Apache Cordova project an
open source project and something has
contributed a number of plugins to that
project you know making it an open
source as well so if you want to
or like if you want to provide
additional user experience you know
reach your user experience when you do
when you can actually detect that your
app is running on samsung device at the
runtime and in that case you can
actually invoke some of those api is to
enable s-pen support or to provide multi
window environment or send reach
notifications to your variable device
okay all these it as complex as it looks
it basically requires you a single
JavaScript statement okay so in other
words we don't expect you to leave this
room and immediately start you know
jumping on Knox platform and and and
building solution that would be too much
to ask but what we hope you remember
that Knox platform is an
enterprise-ready environment it comes
with the hardware software stack it
comes with a bunch of AP is that allow
you to do pretty much anything you want
most devices okay and here's actually
how to check whether or not your device
is compatible with Knox platform and you
know what kind of versions of HD keys or
supports on that device and so the next
question comes well great where do I get
all those SDKs there must be some portal
and this is you know this is part of our
presence here we actually promote this
portal it's called Samsung enterprise
Alliance Program and the whole point of
this portal is provide developers with
the SDKs with the developer development
licenses with the documentation sample
apps tutorials if we accuse everything
you can possibly think about to get your
started in the right direction okay and
there's a there's a forum that's
basically attended 24-7 by our customer
support engineers how good is that and
what's interesting once you done with
your you know proof-of-concept you're
exploring those api's
we can we can move you to the partner
once you have a solution we're going to
help you to market that solution and we
can help you to you know to get in touch
with our sales team you know we can do a
lot of stuff for you for example we're
on every year we have annual are samsung
android samsung developer conference
will invite you hopefully some of you
from this you know auditorium to present
your solutions to you know to all the
attendees because your success is our
success your solutions you know
reinforce our story okay so please keep
that in mind so at this point i'd like
to thank you for being here thank you
for listening and there's a few things
that we need to do so first of all
there's a Samsung Knox developer
challenge going on at the moment so you
can join it in and you know try and see
how well you understood you know the
presentation you know just just see if
you can you know I get something
successful there okay another thing is
that please come to our booth and fill
up a stool reform we do it in an
old-fashioned way paper form will trade
it for a souvenir and here comes the n
plus 1 puzzle in action so for those of
you who came late and it's the number of
Samsung devices that are currently
present in audience plus 1 means that
we're going to increase it by one device
because we're going to do a draw ok so
again no random code generator just an
old good seeking okay you guys ready all
right
so we have number zero to 60 26 right
please come on stage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
