enjoyed been enjoying the day so far at
at devoxx I can imagine that some of you
already getting a bit tired been up
early and absorbing a lot of information
today so I hope you can still squeeze
squeeze out like one more hour of
attention I've also removed all the
pictures of food from my slide that
because we're getting close to
dinnertime so I don't want to make it
harder for you and already s so short
introduction my name is Pittman and I'm
the technical co-founder of shop at and
what I will be talking about in this
session is how we went from a prototype
of our products to actually the company
we are today I'm not going to tell you
what the secret recipe is to get from
point A to point B as smooth as possible
because it's the secret and simply I
don't know but what I do have in store
for you tonight is our story and our
experiences and some some lessons that
we have learned along the way now maybe
before we get started just for my
information who of you is actually a
software engineer okay the majority kind
of make sense at this conference and who
works at a start-up according to your
own definition of startup Oh quite quite
a bunch of people let's assume the other
ones or considering it no still here you
may have seen that this is a picture of
a rocket launch which kind of
illustrates the title of this
presentation but it's not just random
rocket it's actually a spacex falcon 9
rocket I'd probably don't have to
introduce SpaceX to you it's one of the
companies that Elon Musk found it but
SpaceX particularly has a really
fascinating story and I will be
referring to that a bit bit late
so let's get started so what is show Pat
exactly and i know that i'm not talking
to our main target audience so i will
keep it short so let's consider a random
company and they have a marketing and
sales department and what happens is d
marketing departments they prepare all
kind of materials for their salespeople
brochures and catalogs and videos and
interactive applications and they spend
a lot of money doing that and then they
give it into the hands of the sales
people whether it's that printed is to
done a lot printed catalogues printed
brochures or in a digital format doesn't
really matter they give it to the
salespeople and then they're basically
blind to what happens with that material
from the sales person perspective they
get all this content to various channels
where it's sharepoint or books or by
email so for them it's really hard to
find the right information at the right
time it's also not always reliable they
get content that works on the laptop and
not on the tablet things like that also
it's kind of hard for them to provide
how to give feedback to the marketing
team of what they like what I don't so
what you get is this one direction data
flow marketing pushes data to the sales
reps and basically that's it so what we
do with chapa is we solve a bunch of
problems that you have made recognized
first of all we provide a platform for
the marketing team where they can upload
order materials and we automatically
optimize all that content so it works
across all platforms then the marketing
team can actually decide which content
goes to which sales teams they can send
messages to the sales reps and so on and
then they can push that content to the
to their salespeople in the field and
for the salespeople we have a show pad
application specifically built for
salespeople and allows them to consume
that content in a very easy way
everything is easy to find
to have everything in one place it all
works and they can actually provide
content to back to the marketing they
can give comments on those documents day
they can say where we like this we like
this or not and they can actually use
our application to support their sales
conversation with the customers so they
do the conversation they go to all the
content they show their products and we
measure everything what happens with
that content so what content is being
used in which context how long is being
watched all that kind of information and
we send that back to the marketing team
to the online platform and that provides
a lot of actionable insights for the
marketing team they can see which
content is actually being used by whom
in which context what slides do that
particularly like which pages are view
to most and so on and so on so they can
decide where to spend their money on
we're no longer to invest in what
content that may they should maybe push
to other departments as well so that's a
bit very much in a nutshell what we do
is it there's much more to it but this
has been the core functionality of
Chopin so where are we today at company
so we are with 115 employees of which 30
engineers that includes QA developers
and DevOps people it spread over three
offices we have our headquarters and
gents we have an office in London and we
also have an office in San Francisco so
far we raised 10.5 million dollars in
venture capital and we have about 900
customers in over 50 countries and those
customers represents about 100,000 users
on our system now if you look at these
numbers you may argue that we not maybe
really a start-up anymore but yeah
there's no really definition for a for a
start-up right well there are tons of
definition but not really very accurate
one it's kind of a term that is commonly
used and
when we refer to ourselves as being a
start-up which we still do we sort of
mean like the vibe and the spirits and
the way we work and the agility we have
so that's actually what we mean if you
say that also some some of our customers
you probably know the brands and this is
how the team looks actually looked that
was a picture from back in January so
it's pretty outdated since we've doubled
in size since then and you can imagine
that taking a picture like that is a
pretty expensive because we basically
have to fly over half of the team to the
other side of the world which we do once
per year and this was so last time was
back in January when we have our annual
kickoff event weak so weak of close
collaboration and presentations and yeah
then followed with followed by a team
events which the last two years was a
ski trip to the Alps legendary ski trips
now this is where we are today but where
did it all start so I kind of split up
the presentation in three parts
according to the analogy of of the
rocket so there's the there's a
preparing for launch phase there's a
take-off and there's the towards the
full trust face but there's also
actually short prequel to it the
prickles so back in 2010 I was I had a
very modest web development company we
did a lot of projects for 4pm Evan later
mtv europe and and before that had a
started a side business developing
custom business applications but that
that was project-based every time so I
go from one project to the other and I
felt like I wanted to to build something
that I could really be passionate about
and dedicate all my time to it
have it if you go from project to
project you can't really do that so I
was already playing around with an ID
for about two to three years so I
decided okay I'll stop doing what I'm
doing now it's kind of a tough decision
because business was going quite well
and so I took the decision and 2010 was
supposed to become my sabbatical year
not really sabbatical because I would
keep on working but you work on my my
own things so back in those days I was
working i had my office in the same
building as a net loss was him some of
you may know mr. no net look at that
time they were still very popular social
network and the building i was having my
office was actually split up in many
small offices and i had one of those
small offices and network kept growing
so they were kind of surrounding me and
i was closed in by by net loss which was
in a way good because i got to meet a
number of people at netlog one of them
being Peter Dunne Peter John Burton and
one evening we started talking and I
explained him what my plans were that I
was gonna take sabbatical and work on
this idea of mine something in the
mobile space and he said well we
actually me and two friends of mine we
also thinking about starting a mobile
business so why not join forces I mean
we seem to have complementary skills you
have a technical background as an
engineer we have more business
development background so let's join
forces and start together this business
so this is how in the pocket got started
a mobile agency which is now has grown
into one of the biggest mobile agencies
in Europe so my sabbatical year was
reduced to about two weeks and but I
think was a fair deal right we agreed
that I could continue working on my ID
but under
umbrella of in the book so now this is a
picture from how he got started this is
what we didn't have any money so we had
to save costs where every good so we
hijacked the apartment of Louie who is
also one of the cofounders so we didn't
start in a garage but we will start in a
pretty comfortable apartment there was
actually a cohabitant which nobody knew
about until he actually stepped into our
office in his underwear so we were
surprised he was surprised kind of the
scene if you know I've seen Notting Hill
the guy that opens the door in his
underwear and like depressed and
standing in front so basic that but yeah
this is how we started we also didn't
pay ourselves any salaries just to save
more money and we started developing
applications and after some time we got
a request from a company asking for if
we could build an application for his
cells people on a trade show on the
trade show Wi-Fi always sucks so they
wanted to have all the contents within
the application in a certain structure
so we put the application it worked very
well customer was really happy and he
decided to continue using it but of
course the contents had to get updated
and he also wanted to changes to the way
it was organized and the structure of
the files we actually it was a
hard-coded Jason document so whenever he
asked for a change to the structure we
had to go into the Jason and change that
so not really a fun thing to do but
that's how we did it at first so we
should we shipped an update and around
the same time we got a similar request
from another company hey can you build
like an application for my sales reps on
on a trade show so I thought yeah of
course we can kind of recycle what we
have here so we did that we got the
content from that company again going
into the Jason changing the entire
structure putting new files and Yap we
started thinking okay this is
pretty much something that many
companies were once so maybe we can keep
reselling this application but I didn't
really want to start modifying Jason
fileserve day in day out so we quickly
build some kind of user interface where
we had a list of all the files and we
could easily drag and drop it in the
right place and just like an iPad
simulator kind of interface so just drop
it in there and adjacent Paul gets
exported and those two things realizing
that we had something that we could sell
over and over again and this user
interface to make it easy to put content
in there was like for us the Eureka
moments we realized that if we give this
user interface in the hands of the
customer we make a more generic
application that actually downloads the
content once you've installed it that we
have a scalable business here so we saw
the opportunity and we decided okay
let's go for it we all wanted to some to
build something scalable something that
we could sell over and over again and
have recurring revenue so we took the
decision and it was not without risk of
course because basically we're growing
two companies at the same time and so
maybe that would cause the two to fail
we didn't know but you know nothing
nothing in life is worthwhile and unless
you take risk it's a quote from the
famous philosopher Denzel Washington and
so we took the risk we did made the
decision we're going to build a SAS
solution that helps salespeople to be
more efficient this is actually the very
first draft of the application now we
made a decision so we better prepare for
for launch for launching this sauce
business so go but then we had grown to
together with in the pocket too but I
think seven or eight people and
basically too much guys for a Louis
girlfriend to handle so we had to look
for a real office and we found this bill
building for people that know ghent a
little bit it's right across the
Deauville steel which you can see there
so we had this magnificent view from our
office we also incorporated the company
as a separate company basically because
in the pocket and shop at completely two
different business models which were
hard to combine so we decided to have
two different companies and we settled
for a name obviously shop at maybe some
advice on picking a name of of course
you want something that that is that
sounds good and it's tacky but you also
want to be able to register the major
domain names and probably also the
Twitter and Facebook and LinkedIn
handles maybe you don't need that early
on but you definitely need them more and
more when you grow but another thing to
consider is and that's where we at some
point ran into some troubles because we
had our application already in the app
store for some time named Joe Pat and
all of a sudden we got an email from
apple saying that they want to kick day
they never kick us out of the store
because there was another application
also called show pad who claimed to be
entitled to use that name in the US so
there was a little panic then because
being kicked out of the store would have
been a little disaster would have meant
that we would have to rebrand everything
within a couple of days because of
course people and needed to be able to
still download the application so
luckily and I won't go to into too much
detail here but we were able to prove
that we were entering in the US market
before the other application did so
basically with its own google adwords
campaign in the US and that was
apparently sufficient to prove that you
entered the US market if you hadn't done
that then report will probably have lost
we wouldn't be entitled to use the shop
at branch in the US so immediately after
that we register
yo pat as a trademark in the UN in
Europe and the US to avoid further or
more situations like that but if you
would do things all over again we
probably do that from the start it's not
something that costs a lot of money and
then you're safe so we had the office
setup we had a company set up so it was
time to build the first version of show
pad that meant maybe that meant building
like your prototype like the first
version but maybe a bit more than a
prototype but it's often to refer to as
a Minimum Viable Product so basically
means you only built the minimum amount
of functionality to prove value to the
to the user to the customer so you only
focus on the core functionality it's
something that we have you could have
done better probably and we also quite
early on spent time on automated
building on implementing car all kinds
of limitations so they couldn't abuse
our system time that we probably should
I spend on modern core functionality
also looking back at it automated
billing is quite a naive thing to do
when you're in the business to business
space companies they want discounts they
want to multi-year contracts they want
to spread out payments over different
departments over time so automating that
is kind of hard and also as far as the
limitations ago that we implemented for
example if you had purchased 10 shop at
licenses you put only create 10 users
you couldn't create more something you
shouldn't do if you prepare yourself 10
licenses and you see after six months
that that customer is actually having 16
users well that's that's pretty good
news actually because it's more
successful than they did originally
anticipated so you just give them a call
and you ask them hey we see you exceeded
the limits here what can we do and you
settle the situation and you
usually I translate into selling some
additional licenses so you shouldn't
restrict the number of users they can
create we also went with a very simple
stack at first just straightforward lamp
stack with some other functionalities
like like or other technologies like
gierman but nothing nothing fancy hosted
on I believe two dedicated servers and
in Brussels datacenter load balanced but
that that was about it actually we
didn't have any resources either to
spend on that and in fact it serves our
needs at that moment why you may wonder
why we didn't go with something like
Amazon Web you have to consider that we
were in 2011 then first of all we didn't
have any settlement or DevOps resources
so if you if we went with Amazon we
would have to manage it ourselves and
basically couldn't do that second thing
is that we needed a vertical scalability
which was at that time very difficult
with Amazon if not almost impossible we
had certain services that needed
specific resources from the service so
we wanted to have that option and third
in 2011 and actually still today there
is quite some reluctance for companies
to actually adopt infrastructure as a
service like like Amazon if you would
have said then like hey we are going to
store your content on Amazon that would
have definitely been a no-go so that was
a major major factor so once you have
your minimum viable product built and
it's it's running try to get feedback as
early as possible we were lucky because
the initial request came from companies
so we could immediately have them try
our products and get a very early
feedback it's important because you want
to know if the thing that you're
building actually corresponds with your
value proposition and
if you don't have that firm foundation
right everything you build around it
doesn't really matter so you should be
you should try to validate that as soon
as possible in the process so you can
still make some changes if needed to
make sure that you're developing in the
right direction and when you get that
feedback don't get of course and what I
mean with that is that when you have
some if when you have your very first
customers they may have like specific
requests and because they were first
customer and you're really excited about
them you want to do an extra effort
there so you may consider like building
a some custom feature or some custom
module for them but think long term and
make sure that you keep in mind where
you wanna head to we wanted to have a
scalable business so we have to make
sure that we could keep on track there I
just get I'll give you an example like
very early on we got a request from a
company like hey we wanna you shop at
first we want it to be hosted on our own
infrastructure IP so-called on-prem
installation of course that didn't fit
into our roadmap we want to have
scalable business and once you go on
prem it becomes much harder to to do
that so we said no but if that company
starts waving with a big check you
reconsider and you reconsider again and
another time and eventually we we said
no but it was a bit painful at that
moment it was a big financial injection
that we missed out on but over the long
term this was definitely the best choice
we we could make now once you have your
of what once we had our first version up
and running everything was set we were
ready for takeoff so we released version
1 believe was summer 2011 and of course
we start with websites on ad campaigns
we added the free trial sign-up and
actually you don't have to wait with all
this until your product is finished you
actually can start with that sometime
before and especially the free sign if
we try a sign-up page it's a great way
to gauge interest in your product so you
run some ad campaign all over the world
and you attract people to that page they
sign up and there's no product yet but
you can reach out to them once the
product is a finished yes yes so the
question is where we already targeting
the US market at that point yes we were
from the start actually so we had a
something that was accessible from
across the globe so why restricted to
Europe so we went global from from day
one so when you launch your product
support is crucial and I can probably
dedicate an entire entire presentation
on the importance of support for the
success of your service but let's say
that it's not only a way to allow
customers to report on books and give
feedback and request features it's also
your face to the outside so you can show
to support how professional you are and
how serious you are about your service
even if your verte still a very small
company if I report a book about a
service and I only get a response like
three or four days later it's not likely
that we will roll out this product in
your company because it doesn't feel
like it's trustworthy so offer support
from the first day you launch your
products and make sure to follow up on
anything that comes in and then once
more and more users start using your
products you start to get more and more
feature requests and you have to find a
way to manage that so initially we just
push things on the backlog and then to
realize six months later that we had a
backlog of a thousand items and that we
never looked at any more so what we do
now for example is we have a channel
our future requests get posted but
usually by the support team we thought
we are we also asked them not only
report on the future the thing that
customer asks for but also try to dig a
bit deeper in and ask what kind of
problem they're trying to solve with
that and what's the underlying need
because that's important for the product
team to know just you don't just wanna
implement the feature you won't actually
solve the underlying problem so that
gets posted in the channel product team
refuse that on a frequent basis they are
just say okay we're not going to do that
for this and this reason they say okay
this is already on road map it's
expected then or we're likely going to
do that but not we don't have a timeline
for it yet like that you're supporting
can reach out back to your customer and
and set the expectations right and not
everything gets pushed on your on your
backlog now you don't only get more and
more feature requests you also start to
see more and more use cases for your
products so you actually sell we sell
yourself short but as a solution for
your marketing and sales team but once
you have more and more customers you
start seeing that they also use your pet
for whole different use cases like yeah
or in or Target it as a marketing but
you see that I start using it for field
services for education for training for
shop kiosks for product information
manager management and so on and so on
so at a certain point you start to think
like hey we kept we can solve it all we
have like a holy grail here we can we
can cover this entire market actually
you can't I mean that's quite some
overlap between all these use cases in
terms of functionality but if you want
to do a great job at solving the needs
of that use case you will have to
implement some specific features for
them and if you want to address all the
specific features for all these use
cases you will end up with monster other
products so you probably don't wanna go
there there's there's there's no silver
bullet to solve all of this I think
there was a present another presentation
today on
the fact that there is no silver bullet
so that's why I mean we'd stay focused
for was it was sales and marketing and
we didn't pay attention to the other use
cases and if we solve specific use case
while focusing on sales and marketing
that was great but that was not the
intention and actually that's where I
want to come back to the story of SpaceX
there's a it's quite special stories
basics and interesting story and I don't
know if you know the mission of SpaceX
do you know the mission of SpaceX what
is it special kind of rocket okay sorry
going to Mars yeah well they're planning
to go to Mars but it's not their mission
and that's the answer that most people
give like they want to put people on
Mars so they want to go to Mars but
their mission is actually put a million
people on Mars and that's big difference
in there so if you want to put let's say
five people on Mars you can justify the
fact that it costs 100 million dollars
per person to put em on Mars if you want
to put a million people on Mars you
can't really justify that price anymore
but still they want to do that it won't
actually want to put a million people on
Mars so they thought about it and they
reason that okay if we can drop the
price of a trip to about the five
hundred thousand dollar level we can
actually convince or we believe it that
we can convince people to buy their own
ticket because it's affordable not for
rich people it's a one-way trip by the
way so they figured how can we get the
price down to a level of five hundred
thousand dollars and well they first of
all they innovated the rocket engine
they figured out a way to build a
cheaper here an equally powerful oreimo
even more powerful you probably also of
some of you have seen the video where
they actually launch the rocket and then
it
runs back to the base so that's
something that had never been done
before and also is a way to cut costs
because they can recycle the entire
rocket for a future launch and so
they've done all this innovation and
they've come to a point where they can
launch things into orbit at about a
seventh of the price of Lockheed Martin
which is the major partner of NASA so
one seventh of the price any person in
business if you would be in a situation
like that would say fucking hell you
have to conquer the entire market here
less there's no competition one seventh
of the price we can conquer the entire
market like this but that's not what's
basics is going to do they could but
they won't because that's not their
mission they are not going to export
from the full potential the full
commercial potential of where they all
right now so they will do commercial
launches but only as much as we're
needed to fund future research and
developments to get the price even more
down so I think that's pretty
mind-blowing and it takes a lot of guts
and vision to to make a decision like
that but I think it's a great great
example of how you should stay focused
is of course a complete different scale
but still applicable I mentioned
different use cases for where show Pat
is being used actually there's another
one it's to control robots and let's see
if this works
so the Lego Mindstorms challenge was
actually part of the Lost engineering
team building so they had three hours
time to build a robot with with five or
six people and hack the shop at app so
they could control it via the shop at
hub which was a lot of fun and great to
see the results of it so we had launched
our products and we were steadily
growing so we got more and more
customers more and more traction but on
an organic path organic speed and then
in I believe in April 2012 we got an
email that we didn't really expect we
got an email from apple inviting us to
go and demo application in their offices
first we talk k apples some local
department which would also be great but
no I was apple in cupertino so they
asked us to fly over there for a demo
luckily we had already booked a trip to
the valley and because we wanted to
visit some VCS so that was like great
coincidence so we flew over to San
Francisco and we met some visas but then
we went to meet Apple we had a great
meeting there everything went smoothly
because you know how goes do demos
actually we had 1 500 error so that was
a bit painful but of all the rest things
went very well there wasn't
really a direct result from that meeting
but we kept in touch ever since and a
couple of months ago we actually signed
a global partnership with them which is
a song which is really big milestone for
us so yeah definitely one of the most
exciting meetings for me in my life and
not likely going to forget that while we
were there in the valley we also visited
jive which was one of our very first
customers and they actually have a
enterprise collaboration platform
something like Yammer bit similar but
more in the enterprise market and we
also assigned a partnership with them so
we built an integration with their
product because we were very
complimentary so that was a pretty
exciting to see as well I while we were
there we also had some fun I don't know
if you know bay to breakers but we
happened to be there at the same way the
same week it was a bay to breakers which
is kind of a mix of Gay Pride meets
tomorrow land meets all Scott Navajo
something like that so I'm see so yeah
Apple Apple meeting went great they
loved our products and for us it was
like the ultimate confirmation that we
were onto something so it really gave us
a big boost we also got quite some
coverage and the local media which was
of course also a nice bonus so we kept
growing steadily step by step we build a
solid foundation for sales for
engineering for the support teams but we
were in this new space the so-called
sales enablement space and we were the
first ones there and there was there's a
huge potential was an explorer market
and of course other companies noticed
that as well so we started to see some
initiatives that were yeah bit similar
as ours so we realized that if you want
to stay ahead of them we had to scale
our team faster the organic growth that
we were seeing so far was not was not
much just too slow so we decided to go
for
financial injection so we could scale up
faster and that's actually the start of
the full trust part so we went talking
with VCS and march two thousand thirteen
we signed an agreement with a Belgian
venture capital front or European
venture capital fund and basically what
that allowed us to do was if this is a
hypothetical organic growth curve so
with this financial injection we could
do something like that and this money
allowed us to expand to the US so we
already had a number of customers in the
US but if you really want to penetrate
their you need to have local
representation it's also a different way
of a different way and different style
of selling in the u.s. so we set up the
US side of the company we incorporated a
shop at ink and initially we went for an
office in New York basically because
yeah it's only six hours time difference
or just took quite some overlap and
there are a lot of direct flights
between Brussels a new york so if you
start an office in the US you know
you're going to have to commute a lot so
this was kind of a practical that it
would be a lot of flights and Louie one
of the cofounders he moved actually to
the US that's maybe one of the
advantages of being with three
co-founders is that you can send one
over there so after six months though we
realized that in New York was first not
really the place to be that the vibrant
startup scene but we've been in the
valley cup of times before and the vibe
is like pretty different it's it's
unique to be there there's also a lot of
expertise that we needed at that moment
you don't find those profiles anywhere
else and we also have a bunch of
customers and the value in that region
so far is it kind of makes sense then to
move to San Francisco so you see is the
very first office in San Francisco we're
on the top floor but in the meantime we
are
oh that office so we have to move to a
new office on Market Street well which
you have outgrown as well now so we're
looking again for something new they're
starting an office in San Francisco and
included well involve some challenges
you're dealing with a nine hour time
difference which you can't fix you can't
do anything about that there's one
advantage organizing your support gets
twenty four seven support gets a little
bit easier but the challenges are like
dealing with this dealing with this time
difference so we take some initiatives
there like early bird night owl on
Tuesday so they start bit earlier on
Tuesday way we work a bit later so that
there's more overlap in office hours and
can have little longer discussions we
also have the meeting room set up with
the video conferencing so they just go
in a meeting room tap a button and they
can start discussing but not a challenge
is maintaining a sense of unity so
obviously you wanna operate us as one
company but yeah if you have two offices
on both sides of the globe you want to
somehow maintain that even there's a
nine hour time difference so we do that
by for example by having a weekly show
pie where we set up video conferencing
course between the offices and where we
introduce the new colleagues and we can
ask questions to the CEOs and do some
presentations on specific topic and so
on so this really creates this sense of
unity we also had this annual kickoff
which I already mentioned at the start
and for engineers specifically we have a
sort of an exchange program so engineers
in so and the entire engineering team is
located in canton Belgium and we offered
them the chance to go and work in San
Francisco for up to three months not
only to work around a specific projects
but also to get to know the colleagues
better get to know the culture better
feel the vibe of the valley and and so
on do it the feedback on that has been
really great so we continue doing that
another effects of
having offices across the bond is that
there are cultural differences and I
listed some some of the cliches and you
recognize them and us they are usually
more self-confident more assertive the
sky's the limit they like to think big
in Belgium you're more humble more
reserved we are down to earth people and
this may or you may start thinking of
this as potentially conflicting
characteristics that could lead to
situation where it becomes us versus us
versus them but in fact there's a lot of
richness in this difference and the key
is to understand those differences and
to accept them because you can't fix
them anyway there's no point in trying
to fix them you only get frustrated and
then to realize that when you combine
all of those you can actually make a
much stronger team you can you can learn
from each other and you're a more
complementary for example something that
we learned from the u.s. colix's like
try to think bigger we always we are
very realistic right we are down to
earth and we if you want to set a goal
we have to sort of already see how we
gonna get there before we actually set
that goal while in the u.s. they would
just set the goal and they don't care
how they will get there they figured it
out along the way and that's something
that we learned from them when we set
milestones and in the way we were
ambitious so something that some that
was actually an eye-opener for us for
the management so we turned kind of the
US versus them into us and them combined
now we are I think about mid-2014 and we
saw that the competition wasn't taking a
break either so we realized okay we
great we see explosive growth but we
need to grow even faster need to scale
this team even faster and and all
revenue accordingly so we decided to go
for another round of funding a so called
series b and in october 2014 we got 8.5
million dollars in funding by the same
vc as in series a together with another
london-based VC and so if that is the
organic abroad and then the series 80
series be allowed this to do this so
that was October 2014 and by the end of
2014 we had we reached a milestone a big
milestone for us and five million
dollars in a orar and almost no churn
air our is it's it's pirate speak but in
this context is stands for annual
recurring revenue basically your revenue
generated by subscriptions so
subscriptions that get renewed year
after year and churn means loss of
customers so when they no longer renew
their their agreement so almost no
chance so basically all customers
continued using a show pet after the
first year so with this 8.5 million
dollars on our bank account we were able
to double the team size again over the
next 12 months but doubling your team
from and then we were a bubbly 52 over
100 there are some challenges with that
and as a small start-up and this is
always this has always been one of the
major strengths of offshore beta was our
culture the way we collaborate and the
vibe and the atmosphere and the office
and as as long as you're with 20 25 30
people it's quite easy to maintain that
culture but once you go beyond that it
becomes difficult especially if you
start opening offices in other locations
so we wanted to make sure that we could
maintain that culture
as long as you grew and why we try to do
that is by defining what actually made
the culture toward this so we come up
with what we call or seven showing so it
basically seven key values that define
our culture being humble so valuing the
team success over personal wins being
humble keeping it simple a very very
important one that we use a lot in
engineering as well take ownership so
responsibility for things that don't
even belong to your formal assignments
embrace transparency we don't like
politics we don't like too much
hierarchy we don't like things happening
behind each other's back aim for maximum
impact so make sure that your actions
and decisions have the maximum possible
impact gift to grow so contribute to the
growth of your team your colleagues the
product and so on and maybe most
importantly be passionate not only about
your job also about the product the team
the customers and life in general
actually so we kind of use this and
everything we do that it's from hiring
or making certain decisions this is sort
of a guideline and that ensures that we
maintain the same kind of culture in the
company another effects of growing your
team so fast is that well if long as
you're small and you're working from the
same space on a small office you have a
lot of interaction with each other you
see children day to day is a lot of
communication and so on so a very
vibrant space if you are with 50 or 60
or like we had now in March we had to
move out of her office and find a new
one which was three times the size of
the previous one so by definition
creates more space between people and we
wanted to make sure that we can maintain
that same vibrant atmosphere at the
office so we do that why out starts
actually with
the most important machine in the office
the coffee machine we serve good coffee
and espresso actually I don't understand
why some companies serve this rubbish
coffee from this big vending machines
it's not like serving espresso will make
a big dent in the financial situation
I'm sorry I do have a picture of fruit
in here so we service our fresh foot and
we have a really cozy area where they
can read a newspaper and hang out and
talk talk with each other and so on we
also provide some cozy spaces we have
our arena where we do where there's
actually a big screen here in the back
so we can do a lot of presentations here
or just hang out this get some work done
it's just a cozy place to hang around
and on the right there's the zone if you
want to work in the zone go ahead you
should go and sit there and you're not
supposed to be interrupted when you're
sitting there of course there also some
we like to make two say people stay
healthy so we have a recreation area
what is the startup without a ping-pong
table right we have standing desks
although the concept wasn't entirely
clear from the start and ergonomic
chairs so that you sit up straight and
spaces with a lot of daylight's maybe
not all developers like that but
daylight's is supposed to make you feel
happy so and next to that we have
another initiatives to further stimulate
the good atmosphere at the office
actually many companies they organize
all kind of events to sort of create
certain team spirit actually it's a job
at its or team spirit that creates all
the events like aloha friday or formal
friday was very interesting to see an
entire development team come to the
office suit up with a tie you don't see
that every day halloween and us this is
actually one of the co-founders louis
dressed as a bottle of wine Pete Rihanna
summer in there as well
dressed like waldo so bit hard to find
that was the engineering team building
where they had to build a robot also
some sports events we had the shop I
open with a ping-pong competition we
organized frequent boot camps and for
the more passive bass exporters there's
a football on the big screen and this is
actually when we celebrate it or 100
employee which was last month actually
why we celebrated it twice not because
the person got fired but there was some
miscounting apparently so we IV 8-byte
twice which is okay and in the meantime
we also started our office in London our
sales office so they celebrated long
with us so to kind of summarize this is
these are the most important milestones
so far in the history of shop at in very
short history so it all started in May
2011 one year later we went to visit
Apple which gave us a big boost then in
one year later in March 2013 we had our
first series that allowed us to expand
into the u.s. we opened our office in
October that same year another year
later we raised the series be round of
funding and exactly one year later we
had or 100 employee joining job at still
have nine minutes left that's great so
at the beginning I mentioned that I'm
not going to tell you the secret recipe
but no I still don't know the secret
recipe but I do know for sure some of
the ingredients and I trying to fight I
try to find a video that sort of
captures or illustrated those those
ingredients and long long time ago I
used to be a skateboarder and
skateboarding is a lot about creativity
and originality and one of the biggest
compliment
comp compliments you can have is nailing
a trick as the first one whether its
first one in the world or the first of
your group of friends doesn't matter but
like that like gives really a lot of
adrenaline and the short video I'm going
to show you is about a trick called an
air 900 so 900 because you basically
make two and a half turns into the air
you guys watch see the 900
funny was either gonna make it or kill
himself trying 900 with him 10 years
deep buying it so many times I started
to feel like this could be the ultimate
disappointment you know if I if I just
can't do it so that's why I was willing
to stick it impossible to mention I was
going to get taken out and taken to the
hospital Soviet you know it'll be worth
the effort he think it was a conscious
decision like okay everybody stop
skating lat Tony try and make this we
all just wanted to get behind him and
then see him do it Tony Oh Tony huh
crowd wanting to see something
spectacular the whole other side of the
skateboard community knowing that this
is history this is something very
special they all wanted to see and make
it as much as you wanted to so some of
the ingredients you you would have
recognized his so dedication a lot of
hard work sweat tears determination keep
going even if you fall get back up and
try again focus stay concentrated don't
get distracted passion definitely the
most important one if there is no
passion you shouldn't even get started
with it it's your fuel to overcome a lot
of fails and then to keep that gets you
keep going sense of unity you're all in
together going for the same goal taking
risks and accepting failure the last one
is probably the hardest one you will
fail and you will fail about and it's a
matter of accepting that that it will
happen and just getting up improving
yourself and just give it another shot
and when you reach a certain milestone
and everything works out there's of
course celebration
what are you people
hey yeah this is the best day of my life
I swear to God that's how we celebrate
at Jupiter as well except for the crowd
surfing maybe so that's it i hope you
liked it and if you think i felt
completely just you can actually i think
there's an app for that where you can
give comments to the presentation so let
me know then i can improve myself if you
have more questions I don't know if we
have time to actually do some questions
maybe a bit short but if you have any
questions you can reach out to me by
email on Twitter or LinkedIn or leave
some questions in that app and you can
also find us on Stack Overflow we have a
company page there you can find it on
glass door which is a website for
employees to review employers and if you
want to know a little bit more about the
technologies that we use you can check
out structure that's it thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
