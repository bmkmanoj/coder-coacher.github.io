you very much for those who don't know
this is Stefan Johnson who is the
founder of the DevOps franchise and my
name is Mike bowling kovitch I'm the
executive director of the Eclipse
Foundation it's a real pleasure to have
you folks here for the first-ever devoxx
us we're pretty excited although
obviously there's a lot of people stuck
in traffic on the 101 this morning but
that's that's what you get for living in
this neighborhood oh no that's what you
get when you do a devilish why'd you
bring the Belgian whether it's to San
Francisco exactly on jose's yeah well
yeah you're you're pretty lucky we
didn't bring the Canadian weather with
us so but I thought this was an American
company organizing that you know today's
daily speaking the Eclipse Foundation is
actually legally an American company we
just happen to run it from a nicer place
sorry I couldn't resist it but no this
is great I mean we have about 700 people
attending def Fox I mean yes so we refer
to like the first java polis which was
in 2001 we had also around 700 people
and has grown every year with thirty
percent and we now have like 3500 people
attending so i think we're in for a
first edition yeah we're off to a good
start and internationally there's people
here from 31 countries including as far
away as China and India and we also saw
about twenty-seven percent of the dev ox
us attendees are from from international
sources so welcome for the people to the
people who traveled from far away yeah
thank you for the effort
I'm sure we probably would have more
Europeans if it's well I don't go there
don't go there okay so we have lots of
things to say thank you to and about
first and foremost we need to thank our
sponsors so thank all the companies up
there that are generously supporting our
first deadlox us there's a great exhibit
hall across there so please take and
well please take the time to go and
visit the exhibitors and talk to them
look at look at why they're here and by
the way just in case you haven't figured
it all if you want a cup of coffee or
anything to eat you're going to have to
go through the exhibit hall so we're
pretty clever that way I'm really proud
to have that type of list I mean if you
have like eclipse and JetBrains back to
back yeah you have google and Oracle
back to back and that only doesn't
reflect in the exhibition floor but you
will also see that from the speakers we
have some really great rock star
speakers from both google oracle netflix
and so on so it's a truly diverse and
then vendor-independent conferences yeah
and ducks that's absolutely true and
we're very very proud of the fact that
we were able to get you know 25
companies to step up to sponsor the very
first dev up and well thank you very
much for that not have been possible
without them for sure so we should maybe
welcome our diamond sponsor Reggie from
my where's Reggie Reggie come on up
there is also no no it wasn't for
Reggie's perseverance and support we
would not be here today so thank you
very much Reggie very good Thank You
Richie before you start so this guy is
to blame I mean we met a deaf box
Belgium 2015 and he had an idea right so
first of all let me say I'm not happy
today not happy at all because I'm
ecstatic because the Stephanie and I had
have a previous relationship I used to
work at Sun Microsystems and we worked
with Stefan many years over and to the
extent that we stopped doing events in
Europe because of what dev ox work they
were doing right and so we had a
conversation about 15 17 months ago yes
i said hey Stefan guess what I'm at IBM
he said yeah I said yeah I said I have a
problem that we don't have a developer
conference he said you don't
hmm he said have an idea I said let's
talk about it and this is what the
culmination of that particular
conversation and for me it was really
really exciting because we needed a
developer conference and developer
community that was innovative had
thought leadership and in individuals
are going to ask the right questions
about technology right and I wanted it
to be not sure you're all your
grandfather's IBM but next generation of
IBM and have a conversation with
developers and communities that can
actually drive that conversation so this
is it and I'm ecstatic I'm gonna have
very happy to be here looking forward
for the next few days and so forth let's
have a great device and thank you for
your support man thank you thank you
this is the team efforts right there's
so many I mean it takes a small village
to make this happen and there's lots of
interesting people who are actually
helping out and we definitely want to
shout out and I think the next slide is
yeah a good point for that but first of
all I need to thank Roman key for this
nice picture that we were able to use
which we going to use as an intro before
all the talks but a rune Gupta where are
you come on upper welcome to tell Fox
room welcome to their walks as well well
I'm super excited this is San Jose this
is my home city so as excited as I was
when the box he was coming to us I was
super excited you know as Reggie said
ecstatic you know that is coming to my
home city so right welcome to San Jose
this is where I live for a number of
years now the weather has come along
with the box Belgium of course and the
beer as well we didn't fare as well it's
only going to get better don't worry you
know we're going to make it sunny
absolutely so walk around the downtown
there are lots of good eateries here to
play around you know so feed yourself
welcome it's very exciting hopefully you
know the as Stefan said 700 is the
beginning and we will hopefully surpass
even the d'box Belgium make sure you
three to use the hashtag delphox us and
let's make just all our colleagues which
are working at the office now jealous so
they want to be here next year as well
right so make make sure that happens
it's all about us to is a viral thing
you know the more you spread the word
you know tell your company's why they
should care about you know sponsoring a
box
well they should send attendees why do
certain speakers to it as a program
committee member make our job super hard
and submit as many proposals as you can
so I think that's what makes it exciting
for us and so we actually already
started on some day right so if we look
at the next slide you actually have some
really nice pictures and I mean your
founding and running this initiative
which is called deaf Fox for kids so can
you talk a bit about that absolutely
well I mean the box is for big kids like
you and me and then there walks were
kids is younger kids you know which is
anywhere from six here onwards to 16
year onwards and inspired by you you
started this in Belgium I founded the
nonprofit and a 501c3 here in the US and
we have about six or seven chapters
running across us and then we did a kids
workshop and a bunch of kids work
actually eight kids workshop on Sunday
the good thing was we were able to get a
nice facility so really wonderful
experience and as you can see in the
pictures you know kids were building
lightsabers they were learning how to
build their first iOS application so
we're always and all of this content by
the way it's available on our github
repo so if any of you want to run your
own workshop take the content and run
with it it's open source even if it does
if it's not names their folks for kids
it doesn't matter as long as we are
doing something inspiring the next
generation with technology because the
educational system is broken its broken
in the u.s. it's broken in Europe
they're getting PowerPoint and Excel
that's what they get for computer
science right we can do so much more so
we need to inspire not only our children
but also the teachers and even like in
Morocco we have def extricates Morocco
they're involved in the federal or
national Ministry of Education to
actually help them identify workshop so
this is like this good karma this is
well I mean essentially it gives you
that goose bumps you know their boxes ok
now we have been doing this for many
years and every time you do they walk
for kids there are people genuinely
interested in figuring out what are you
doing and end of the day I want to step
back and have these kids take a
leadership role and you know these are
my minions we're gonna be running around
and doing all the good things for us so
absolutely I would love for you and if
you live in the Bay Area I would
love for you to get involved with their
work for kids help us you know
contribute content if you contribute
content then that gets translated to
multiple languages gets delivered in
different chapters become a speaker
become instructor become a volunteer and
make a difference yeah thank you
absolutely Thank You Arun thank you for
support thank you yeah actually happy to
say that we had a number of people from
the foundation their red box for kids on
sunday and they came out all saying
we've got to do this in ottawa in our
home cities there were four new dev fox
fur kids generated because of that event
it's really a chain reaction it's like a
virus but a positive one absolutely so
yeah we definitely need to do a
shout-out the companies who are really
supporting this event and sending quite
a lot of attendees to this event yeah so
each of these companies are sending five
or more people to the Tudor box us so
thank you very much for supporting the
event by sending people but I got it's
really appreciated absolutely another
one is really important is that make
sure you install the my delphox mobile
app this is actually an application
written in java using java effects and
we have a talk about that with Johan
Voss later this week and what it allows
you to do is to rate the session so you
don't only have to rate it by giving it
stars but you can even give feedback on
the content the delivery and other
suggestions that you might have for that
speaker it's very very valuable for both
the speaker and the organizers as
ourselves to know if you liked it or not
should be blacklist that speaker next
time or what ok you know so you use use
the application and let us know what you
think about it as well yeah absolutely
breakfast feedback is the breakfast of
champions absolutely so the other one is
the make sure we have on the batch of
you our code the QR code is something
that we can use at the exhibition floor
as sponsors can actually scan you so
make sure you visit them share your
details talk to them listen to their
products I mean there's some really
interesting companies out there and we
think we oughta thank you disperse to
your team for building it absolutely
yeah I almost forgot so Horacio and
Fabrice Nicola Martin you all the team
from dev box France they actually build
an application to do the scanning and
we're using this for the first time here
so thank you guys if you're in the room
for
for making this happen and like I said
it's a small village making this all
possible and we have like a tree troll
developed in javafx as well open source
yes Chet maybe we are still using javafx
and this is like a tweet wall where it
actually shows nice transitions between
all the different tweets or spin
dreamers from a Java user group in
Germany mater so thank you for that as
well yep it's awesome and we wouldn't be
here without the without the program
committee and I think actually we're
probably even missing a few pictures it
was a big program committee but it had
to be big because we had so many talks
we'll talk about that in a second but we
all owe a huge thank you to the people
who put in a lot of hours make this
possible and in particular I'd like to
thank our program chair Stephanie Anson
who was here to help us put on our first
day box us and make sure our program had
that devix flavor so we really really
thank you very much that's very welcome
and it was a pleasure we have rockstar
speakers that so much content baby I was
like begging can have an extra room we
have an extra room so we have like ten
parallel sessions because I just wanted
to have those speakers and the content
and even if there's only going to be
five maybe people attending in a room
who cares it's recorded and it will get
10,000 views afterwards anyway right so
again thank you everybody from the
program committee to help and we had
actually had more talk submissions for
this 785 proposals that any other dev
oxon hill a bit jealous yeah so it's the
program committee had a lot of work to
do because they had so many submissions
but that really indicates the interest
and support for the event and like I
said if you can't make a decision which
talk you want to go don't worry pick
your favorite run the other ones you'll
see it online afterwards on youtube so
we're going to share and record all the
sessions and share it with you on our
channel so I run an open source
foundation so I obviously believe in
free software but given my waistline you
can also see I believe in free beer so
please join us hahaha please join us at
the exhibit exhibition reception tonight
sponsored by our friends at pivotal
thank you very much thank you for that
canadians where toques is what we do so
and of course I'm really happy because I
finally get a piece of swag i can use
when i go moose hunting next fall so
that's pretty cool but if you if you
need any help look for the staff wearing
the the the blaze orange hats and the
the stars the star-shaped hoodies and
not star-shaped star scattered hoodies
we have a great staff here and really
appreciate all the effort that they put
on into being here and helping us but
also making this whole event possible
and also big shout-out to our conference
Queen and Jaco I mean without her it
would not have been possible yeah Kevin
and give her a round of applause and
she's the lady and this is like a
pattern the real conference is actually
origa organized always by a woman yeah
they really have the discipline and they
know how to do this and they did they
can really do multitasking in case
you're wondering Stefan was not really
joking when he said conference queen
that is literally what it says on her
business card so she has been our
conference queen at the club's
foundation for many years and we
wouldn't be here without her no
absolutely thank you n just when I
mention that this the consolidation is
the producer of this event and like all
of the events that we produce we do have
a code of conduct your you know you can
go and read that if you really want to
but the short version is just go out and
be nice and awesome to each other and
it'll be in professional exactly and
everything will be everything will be
awesome yeah and so I do want to use
this next slide no that's fine I do want
to use this flight to thank you very
much for the Eclipse our nation to make
this happen and seriously without their
support without their expertise and so
on this would not have been possible
right I mean I really had nightmares of
this event just because like oh man
what's going to go wrong and all of that
and but these guys really got my back
they support us they're very
professional and thank you Mike for that
I really appreciate thank you it's been
great it's been a great partnership
agreed so we still got five minutes so
before we wrap up and introduce the next
keynote speaker I want to have a rune
and Reggie back on stage so we can take
a selfie I mean that should be part of
the experience right
so make sure everybody smiling for the
so your hair you should put your hair a
bit like that yeah okay make sure you
smile</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
