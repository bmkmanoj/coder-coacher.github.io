present this what we are doing of course
it's a work of many people in case you
don't know me I'm one of the Eclipse
developers
I do love open source and I try to help
as much as I can with Eclipse project
and we also have a popular website with
Android and Eclipse related things so in
this talk I focus on the foundation
which is used to build any Eclipse IDE
which you may be using so it is called
the Eclipse top-level project the clips
drop level project is responsible for
building the Java tooling but also the
framework and any other tooling can be
built on top of it and I will leave some
room for questions
I talked only about platform but if you
have later questions with any other part
of the Eclipse idea I'm happy to try to
answer them I will talk about four
things in this presentation and the
first one is a little bit internal which
is typically not very interesting for
Eclipse IDE users and just for my
understanding we have a small audiences
here and I know some are committers so
who here works by extending or working
for Eclipse by sign of hands so like one
foot or so on the rest is in tips IDE
users it's just so true okay so so I
hope up something also for you I also
talked about what we're doing actually
for the Eclipse extenders and also for
users and then also I have a separate
point where they try where to speak
about what we're trying to improve
usability like I said I would have some
room for questions so if you have some
proposals which we can improve let me
know or let us all know all right
um so first of internal stuff if you
look at our commits statistics which we
have in the last three month that is the
Eclipse top-level project I think you
see that it's relatively nice
distributed here of course IBM still
does a lot of work but we also have a
lot of contributors coming in not with
any company associated people we have
red head working on the lips idea our
little company Vogel our GmbH and also
Google does a lot of things and I think
this this combination of individuals and
companies makes for the char
for me at least for Eclipse IDE because
we have all these different areas that
people work on performance stability
enhancement eclipse Ridgeline platform
very nice and some of the results were
presented here at every year the Eclipse
project tries to recycle a little bit
the code base I think that is something
we always will continue doing and it's
one of the activities I personally enjoy
a lot because I always steal if we do
this constantly we open up the way for
new people doing amazing work so if you
kick out our little white space issues
then people will come and see I it's
easier to contribute to this codebase
and I think we see actually a result
there's a lot of people driving by and
just providing a patch for their special
need huh within fast increased version
of what we have seen earlier and you see
that even though some people contribute
a lot to the project you also have a lot
of people which just contribute one or
two patches just to fix their individual
needs well very nice and I think this is
one of the results of cleaning up the
codebase and make it easier to
contribute the of course do a lot of
pack hunting this is actually a slide
from yesterday it was used in the
European talk there captain tomes
identified in memory issue it basically
they were string allocations during the
talk someone in the audience open the
duck and someone in Germany and unreal
or scoot off fixed it I think it within
an hour or so it's relatively trivial
fixed but it will solve this memory
issue and of course this is just one
little tiny fix but this code clean up
actually resides in hundreds of
thousands of these little fixes and as a
result the IDE becomes more stable
faster more efficient and so on and so
on huh oh I love these fixes it's
relatively trivial but reduces garbage
collection quite significant
but you're all not only cleaning up of
course things we also would like to make
it easier for our extenders to build a
ton of the clips platform so for example
we also introducing lambda in our API
of course we have some legacy within
eclipse we have interfaces with what
more than one method so the building
secretary methods just to allow people
also to use lambda lambda we also
reorganize the coattails of Eclipse four
years ago significantly and we
introduced dependency injection as
example the service service architecture
but as we are the Eclipse platform the
also supporting the existing an old API
and this was not using dependency
injection so we open it up soon
step by step also for Eclipse extender
to not have to use any sector ease or
Singleton's and just use add inject and
get these objects injected if they
handled by the our workbench Eclipse or
the Eclipse workbench may be a little
bit specific for most of you but we also
supported supporting Austria decorative
servers 1.3 Thomas Watson also sitting
in more D and integrated Felix for that
into equinox and someone else
implemented fit enira implemented the
support for using this and if you have
no idea what this is
it's basically having a notation and
this annotation leads to effect that
will later a service registered and that
service can be used in your application
for example via dependency injection and
it's really nice to use record is
working or worked on a way of building
easier support for new editors the old
way of building an editor was you create
a class you you registered for a certain
file extension you build all the
infrastructure yourself of course word
is getting faster and it should be
easier to to build such a thing so we
now have this generic editor support it
is an extendable editor where you can
register a little bit and then you have
support for a new language as an example
if you write this code here on the slide
and it didn't fit on a slide but your
effort I think six lines of XML and
maybe 20 additional lines of lifting the
keywords which should be highlighted
then you end up with a great and editor
of syntax highlighting at least now that
is
compare the easy to the old way of
building and great an editor and of
course then you can do more sufficient
things like code completion and so on
very nice the relative also works on
textmate support for this editor and but
also planning to as far as I know
they're also planning to build in
language service language server
protocol support for this I'm not sure
if you have went to any of these
sessions which spoke about language
server protocol but beta D it's a
protocol which allows you to integrate
any programming language in an editor
speaking a standard defined I think by
Microsoft very nice so you get basically
support for PHP in your editor without
doing anything
and we also planning to have this of
course on the ships um so that's more
internal so things you as user may enjoy
are that we have an able account
operations by default what was actually
done by me working I think a few weeks
on an Android project with Android
studio and I returned to eclipse land
and I was so fed up with all these
dialogues popping in my face Android
studio has a nice way of hiding certain
performance issues by putting it a
dialogue into your face and then it
hides the dialogue becomes that brings
up a nice nice new dialogue and we're so
happy to start again with eclipse and
then I got immediately this dialogue I
doing something which could also be run
in background so my super mono
development
we just changed the preference after a
few weeks of discussion and now
everything runs in background and I
think as users he will still pretty much
notable for you because it feels like
everything just works in the back like
immediately building on that or doing a
parallel several people have contributed
to an improvement at the job say p.i
jobs API are now much faster even if the
person who employ using this jobs API
did not do the correct thing so if you
report a status update every every
milliseconds
we're just cashing that and waiting
until 16 milliseconds to do the next two
I update we also have now API
are also always can suppose so if this
API is used then you can just press
cancel and respect operation will be
cancelled and we should get a way of
these things where you press cancel in
Eclipse and it just never cancels until
the very end we also move into an a
string currently outing that is actually
something which is very common in
Android development and in Android you
basically only mark things for layouting
and then let me just open it and then if
you mark it is basically the render will
at some point say okay I'm redrawing it
if you do synchronously outing it can be
that the UI event queuing up and you are
still reacting while you're not doing
anything anymore
Harvey serialize I hear you scrolled a
bit and it continues to scroll a
synchronously out there is so much nicer
because it only draws it one in a wire
then the next frame has to be rendered
so it basically is stable you scroll and
it will be rendering operation of course
happen but it just will not like that
much anymore and if you still continue
it basically stops once you stop with
the mouse much nicer we also offer a
synchronous complete code completion
it's more less the drop-in replacement
if your completion provider does not
accessed the main thread you can just
put it into outside of the main thread
very nice also done by Red Hat also used
already very generic editor you're also
improving styling the whole time UI
glitches which were actually unnoticed
at least by several people in the
development community for years so if
you see this red little thing there was
an inconsistency toolbar and that is not
bad at all it's just a little bit
annoying and and be trying to fix this
on neck we had a little P line so there
was a notice that on the Macintosh miss
the little yellow line in the toolbar
and nobody know why it's there I guess
it was there for testing and these
things of course or
have been removed we also constantly
improving our dark theme we have now
also styled the buttons and the windows
which was not the case before so you can
either also nice buttons in Windows we
recently added styling for table headers
and the windows and lineups
so these can also be nicer in the dark
scene if you prefer only attack team
who's usually actually with a dark scene
not necessarily in Eclipse but in
general okay okay so half of the
audience uses the dark scene and it
should be nice or now um of course
there's a lot work on going in the JDT
team to support java line and J unit
five there were special talks of it or
our special talks of this so I'm not
going to cover this but it's available
now you can use it you can start eclipse
with Java 9 you can also develop for
Java 9 it's not included in the latest
builds for some legal reasons but
there's a Vicki page which you then
follow you can just use it Jane with
five is the same if you have questions
to genuine five nope or maybe raise your
hand so main developer for this so we
can ask questions to her shit also nice
talk can go in the past and try to see
it and also nice things like if one of
our tables teachers it eclipses you
press control and you go to a certain
implementation and can go to the super
implementation of that and it didn't
work for interfaces and now it works for
interfaces a nice thing which I think
it's available since a long time in
IntelliJ is that the debugger shows you
the last return value of the return
value of the last code method so you
don't have for debugging purpose you
don't have to assign result of the
method to a very able to see it in the
debugger it just yeah very nice I think
also nobody to do that okay sorry okay
some Google developers work on a new
index
Google has very big workspaces as I have
heard 50 million classes I think it was
set
and they see certain performance issues
especially with accessing the type
hierarchy or any java element or jar
fired because the way the all the next
was implemented it sometimes needed to
go anywhere in the jar files and if
you're lots of Java it's what takes long
the promise is that this once this is
finished it average Java operations will
be tenth of one thousand times faster
which is pretty impressive number B not
there yet they look at the moment we are
sometimes slower and sometimes
significantly faster but da Vinci knows
from Google is is very hot working on
this and we hope that this will which
would be improved and I'm actually
looking really forward this because they
have also several customers which have
these huge workspaces and contents
OpenType is very slow and it would be
nice to have this much much faster all
right we are of course trying to improve
usability let's have a look I think that
is board one
usability is a big topic I think
especially competition of course makes
it also relatively usable as much and so
for example if it's my favorite thing of
usability back in Eclipse is if I want
to restart eclipse I obviously have to
look for a menu entry after print but
before the import yeah so I think that
it's not we can all agree that it's not
the best place for the restart menu so
in the next release we we have it moved
of course here and also switch workspace
we've also kicked out menu entries which
we thought nobody uses so it should be a
little bit slimmer here we also trying
to make the usage of Eclipse as
efficient as possible so if we have a
dialog and did we expect you to select a
lot of elements I think a logical
implementation actually gives you a
filter box on so the bottom is new so
you have a filter box instead of like
going through the selection again and
again think
the team be--would everything which has
a big collection of data we would like
to give you a filter for that we also
relabeling our dialogue so that it's not
canceled okay anymore but then cancel
and then a description of what will
happen if you press this button it's
actually something I learned like six
months ago that this is an something
which you should do and ever since I see
such a dialogue I get and it's really
easy to change this so the end process
of changing like the majority of
dialogues we control so that is just a
nice look and feeling again nothing big
that's why it's in the usability thing
one thing I would really like to see is
an improved debug perspective who here
likes the existing debug perspective of
Eclipse but one person who some say one
person came in but he didn't catch your
question so the user comes and who does
not like it okay okay I think and
everyone didn't like it the first time
on you know if you actually liked it but
it can be improved because the default
one has just a very tiny space to to
look at the code and hopefully this goes
through this too of course
political change involved in that um
yeah and there's their little little
more small things which I think I don't
want to cover here so in summary we
trying to do our best to improve
performance
we of course try to improve usability we
also build API which is efficiently
which is nice to use hopefully and as
the end result I think the whole
experience with eclipse would be better
and still of course should be the
fastest ID out there and one thing I
wanted to show you before I go to the
question if you have questions it's the
nice thing which I fifty is pretty nice
what do you notice about this Eclipse
IDE
we just maybe play around with it and
let's say new Java project and then
testing or something like that
anything you notice about it okay it's
actually eclipse in the running in the
browser it I find this pretty amazing
it's a work of a reddit team reddit has
ported and the SWT implementation under
Linux to Wayland so it removes all x11
cords and that enables you to run any
clip space application including rich
line platform and the IDE in a browser
which is basically started up so let me
just stop this I stopped a server so
basically start up a server which is
available on the lineup now this runs
and can render any of these applications
in the browser and then you start with a
certain command because you're not
allowed yet to use the launcher you
started in then um the clips will be
running on the specified port no ever to
default on it can have multiple windows
you can actually use it I find it
actually even faster than the native
implementation was a little bit
surprised yesterday about that fully
functional um and there's a lot of
interest actually in the rich client
platform community this is a desktop
application based on the Eclipse
framework no change required it just
runs in the browser with just a few
commands there very nice listing and you
can actually also combine it with a
docker container in front of it so we
would have like a web page where if
someone logged in you start up a docker
container and you get this own port and
you do port forwarding so you could just
have a deployment in the cloud with your
favorite ID oh one of the other things
are really nice and actually I noticed
yesterday it's for me at least faster
running in the browser so it might
switch to a web IDE
I only said that that's what I wanted to
tell you do you have any question
anything you particularly dislike about
eclipse which you would like to see
improved not necessary in platform but
in everything anywhere else
I mean actually like the screenshot so
the question was how would the improve
debug perspective look like and I
personally my and it was on the
screenshot most gifts come the room for
the code the current debug perspective
on an average resolution on a monitor
has maybe 20% for the code and now if
that would be accepted what's or maybe
an improved version you would have let's
say 60 70 percent of the code and you
have a console on the button and then
you have review you need for debugging
like variables or SEC trace on the right
side an alternative solution would be to
integrate the debug experience in the
normal perspective life like IntelliJ
does this actually a lot of committers
using this approach in eclipse but
that's not not the scope of this
development we were just an out of box
experience would be nicer and of course
then you can customize it to your liking
still we're not taking that away but
it's just some something we noticed that
a lot of eclipse users just use eclipse
as is and sometimes I feel painfully
touched if I you see an eclipse user
looking in this little window and trying
to scroll and find the right right data
to look at it alright if it's a ghost
I'll use the microphone laws our project
has thousands of bundles and every time
a developer changes a manifest they have
to wait for a minute to two minutes for
the whole thing to resolve will this
Google contribution that you mentioned
help with things like that with the
indexing or is it is it not going to
help what
maybe this ascend there what is actually
doing well what's blocking so it's
recompiling or yeah it's waiting to
resolve those manifest changes because
you've made a new dependency then it
goes off and I've got thousands of
bundles to figure out where the
dependency is and the whole tree is just
taking ages to resolve
so so the question we can have a
discussion later but I think the
questions I don't know I don't know why
yet so maybe just if you run a stack
trace or like you trace it and see where
the performance issue is then it could
be too many places but if it indexes and
what the Java index then of course goes
will be faster but if it anything else
like like Tom pointed out then of course
we need to fix the other issue then you
also so maybe one last question before I
fly back to Hamburg like no questions I
think so thank you very much and enjoy
the rest of the conference</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
