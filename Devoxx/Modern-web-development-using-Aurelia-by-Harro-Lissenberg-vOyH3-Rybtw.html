my name is Harley Samir I'm a Java
developer for a quality I'm going to
talk here today about irelia it's a
JavaScript framework and I think it's a
good competitor in the current space
which is pretty crowded with a lot of
different choices most of the time I
will write you a script but of course
Jaffa I said you have to double but you
affricate of course it's a important
tool nowadays for all of us this session
is going to have a live demo it's going
to use John it's going to use the
network so if you've seen the previous
session you know there's I mean a lot of
problems lots trouble here but I hope
everything will be fine
also I have a bit of a cough so to make
matters worse I might be working in a
microphone a London okay let's get
started
so what is Aurilia I really is a
JavaScript framework it's a modern it's
based on a green it's written for
greenfield browsers which means Internet
Explorer 11 up and of course the modern
Firefox Safari and whatever Chrome it's
basically a collection of collaborating
libraries that means you can use parts
of the framework that you like and you
can leave out the parts that you don't
like but all in all it's pretty complete
it has everything there that you need it
does not have any dependencies other
than the build the build is based on
cope and p.m. so there are your
dependencies but other than that it
doesn't have dependencies it brings its
own Paula files for when your browser
doesn't support a specific technology
it's free to use its MIT license so
that's pretty permissive and what I like
best about it is that it's clean and
unobtrusive and this is what I want to
show you in a small demo so in order to
get started with with a I'm going to use
the command line interface which is a
pretty new tool
and I'm going this is not really
important what I'm going to type here
but I'm gonna create a new project it
gives me some options I'm gonna use a
custom project I'm going I can't choose
typescript or JavaScript I will use
JavaScript no she is yes I certainly
don't need unit testing and I'm used
intellij and webstorm I want to create
this project I don't want to install
right now because that will do an NPM
install and I will go to for that I will
use yarn because it's a little bit
quicker and time is of essence here so
your install also it has nice icons that
NPM does not have there are other ways
to get started there's also skeletons
available on the website of relia which
let you choose web pack or a GS p.m. or
typescript JavaScript whatever you want
and this the command-line interface will
use requirejs
as a module loader so we're done what
did you just create okay
there is
right so we have a project here it has
really a project like folder which
contains all the built files it's got
four based and node module scripts the
source
that's where everything is happening
will I will delete most of it because I
don't need it and I will we start with
the index.html and so like I said before
it's in required you yes module loading
in your system so it's bundled in the
vendor bundle and once required yes it's
done it will offload to the really a
bootstrapper which will initialize your
application it will find a really app
attribute here and then it will know
that it uses the main dot JS file to
load its configuration so here we're
going to remove some of the stuff that
we don't need as well for this small
demo I have to be careful what to remove
okay so this just basically configures
aurélia with the standard configuration
which is pretty much all you need
I mean if you wouldn't use plugins
normally which you configure here but I
don't need them right now I'm going to
set the root of the application to
devoxx
that means that once I really I started
it will find the dev Fox view model
which consists of JavaScript and HTML
file so let's create those files you
found def fox dot j s right and earlier
uses modern JavaScript so Atma script
2016 and higher it uses classes for
instance double X right so and we want
to tell IntelliJ that we are using
modern Java scripts so it helps me a
little bit here
so I am well I'm a bit hunched behind
this desk so typing is not ideal and we
need a few HTML template so let's create
that and we need a template tag in there
which is basically in a HTML template
and now we see some magic of Aurelia
here we can get the property that we
defined in our JavaScript the heading
property and we can simply use a string
template to get the information out of
it so now I'm going to start the
application so I'm going to back to the
command line once more and we're gonna
run in watch mode that means that every
change will get picked up and will issue
a reload now let's see if we have a
browser hi-def Fox there it is let's
make this a little bit bigger so now we
have a basic application running of
course you can hardly see this so let's
make it a little bit bigger let's see if
it's run yep it's a real oh that's fine
okay
so now of course to make things
interesting
we need an application we need to do
something unique something that has
never been done before to capture all
your attention so what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna create a to-do application we
need to do close because well that will
hold our troduce so let's create it to
do it's a JavaScript 6 ACMA script 6
class so export clause you and it has a
constructor and the constructor will get
an arguments with the description of my
to-do and it has two properties which is
again the description
description and we need a property to
keep track whether or not we're done
with it so this done is false right so
this is all we need for our to do we
have a description and we have a boolean
that says whether or not we're done with
it and we're going to use this in our
deaf ox class funeral so here we have a
list of the do's empty lists and we have
a holder for a new to do that we of
course need to be able to create now
let's also create a method to add to
deuce to the list right add to do this
is a normal job get method this to use
let's push in you to do in there you to
do and we're going to create that to do
with the property new to do which we are
going to enter later and once this is
done we can say this new to do it's
gonna get reset to empty okay well this
is the basic JavaScript we need to
create a to-do list and add to-do items
to it so now let's make sure that we can
actually enter them and we need a form
for that and still input type text all
right and here are some of the Aurelia
magic we are going to bind to properties
with the dot bind method which really
uses now this will imply two-way binding
because we are an input element but
really also supports one by binding or
one time binding it's automatically
infer this when you use the dot bind and
in this case it will use two-way binding
because because we are in an input
element and we need a button to add a to
Deus we have to make sure that we have
the right button kind of button it's a
submit button and well of course when
the button is pressed we need an event
is triggered and unsubmitted vent and we
need to capture that and we do that in a
form we say submit so we bind to the
submit element and then it should
trigger our methods
I had to do which we created before
right so let's see what happens
no we can enter something I know there's
a bit there's a bug here the bug that I
make all the time it's more than Java
it needs to import it to do class
because otherwise it cannot work so
let's do that
okay no actually I think it's working
right now but we need still way to
display our traduce so for that we need
to recreate a list
I'm numbered lists with list items and
here again some Aurelia magic we use a
repeater which will repeat over the list
of to do so for each to do of all
Toulouse we are going to repeat this and
we say we're gonna bind to the to do and
we want to know its description to do
description and also we need of course
way to check that to do off so that's
saying boo type checkbox and value dot
binds you've seen this before is sorry
is the to do dot done okay now let's see
if we see or deduce yes it works great
I've got 3 mins left so we starts a
little bit quicker now we have a to-do
list but of course we can check to deuce
but nothing will happen of course when
we're done we're done and we can clean
them up so I'm going to add a little
more a little method first let me create
a button while I'm here and this button
says clean up and
when this button is clicked it will
trigger an events and that will call the
methods cleanup though which is not
created yet so let's get back to the
code stare problem right so cleanup and
this will clean up all my methods so I
need to go to the to-do list once more
marbles assigned them with a new value
of this dot juice let's filter out or
done items to do done so will this work
hopefully so okay hello there's no it's
not working
that's excellent this cleanup just to do
is to do is filter ah
wait yes I forget
well of course it goes down the drain
just click that trigger is cleanup
button should be working clean up
maybe if you do something like this okay
well sorry
all right well I'm not going to fit and
finish this clean up because my times up
so one more thing for you this was a
component although you might not have
recognized it as a component so in order
to show you that we are going to create
a new file we call it app dot HTML and
write F dot HTML and a new JavaScript
app dot Java Script right so this is a
course export class app and this will
simply say template and it will require
from divorce and let's do this
so basically we are building custom
component here with Aurelia which can be
reused and we have to tell our
configuration that we don't want to
start a divorce but we won't start that
app so there we efforts we have two
to-do lists which are not functioning
properly but still they are in the
independent independent components so
that was my talk that is a real yeah I
will finish off the slides I've shown
showing you a little bit I've shown you
how not to do a live coding demo I've
showed you custom elements but there's
much more or less complete flavor so it
has options it has validation it has
dependency injection it has a powerful
router for your single page application
needs everything is there
whatever you need you can find it on
over here that I oh it is pretty good
documentation there so I'll fight you to
have a look and thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
