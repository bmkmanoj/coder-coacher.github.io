make sure we're here at devoxx UK and
I'm at our Walker who hello she's maven
I thought this morning about deep
planning in the cloud so maybe she
thought speech learning is to anyone who
people might have had at machine
learning but they might not know what
deep finding is correct
perfect timing because I actually in the
beginning I thought that was the first
thing I went over what's the difference
between AI and machine learning and deep
learning and the quick and dirty is AI
is obviously what we think it is right
it's the human interaction of an a
computer a computer actually making
human life decisions or you know you
know that kind of thing I mean there's
two types we won't get into all that but
the two types of AI and of course the
narrow AI which is people are afraid of
Skynet taking over we're not there yet
and so then machine learning Ben is the
implementation of AI so how do you make
IO work that's machine learning and
that's just a predictive modeling and
algorithms that do predictive modeling
based upon data sets right and so deep
learning is really um and it's kind of
stair step right deep learning is
machine learning but a specific theory
of machine learning called neural
networks and the reason why it's called
deep learning is because neural networks
use several layers and past inputs to
each other as they process them now
we've had a hearty debate about deep
learning so I should probably mention it
there so we talked about there are three
types of machine learning right there
are supervised as unsupervised there
semi-supervised which is a combination
of both and so in a purist view neural
networks in a purist view should be
unsupervised right it should learn from
the data and be able to be self learning
but I never had so many debates on this
here lately were you know even today's
and was like no but newer networks today
are really not unsupervised they are
supervised so you know the debate goes
on but from a purist view I guess you
know the algorithm should be able to as
a layer slow down learn from each other
and get a result but the debate rages on
so that's what the learning is
we're going to say for argument's sake
deep learning right now is semi
supervised machine learning so they come
and that enables AI was that clear as
mud maybe we should say that well for
anyone who's not show that supervised
learning typically you're learning with
labels agents there you have they're the
right answers anyway think can you find
if I tell you what is the output should
be can you get close to that
exactly right I don't supervisors okay
and I have this image I'm not going to
tell you what the images are can you
find a pattern in the image and I don't
know can you tell it's a cat but that
would be I guess semi-supervised because
it has to know what cat is so I'm not
sure yes Matt okay so great question so
at the purest view supervised is it has
to have some kind of user interaction
right yeah I know that if I give you
this data I know what the expected
output like you said should be and I'm
actually interacting to get to a result
yeah unsupervised is the computer is
running these algorithms and making
these predictions without user
interaction and learning from each other
which is why the debate rages about what
neural networks alright so you know
unsupervised is where Skynet you know if
we ever got there - everyone chagrin
okay
I like to think of it you know narrow a
is if it's Star Wars cp3 year there we
go he's nice he talked to you right he's
not
Skynet but yeah but um yeah so if we
think about supervised you know I would
say when people really don't know just
think about it a user has to do
something they haven't won something at
they know something
unsupervised the computers running
algorithms and learning from those
algorithms based upon a set of unknown
data so known unknown and then
semi-supervised think about it is it's a
combination of both right we have some
variables that are known we have some
information is unknown we have some user
interaction and we have some interaction
with the computer is actually running
them the cells and right now I think
we're really in a soup semi-supervised
learning mode with the newer networks
that we have so that's yeah that's that
is a debate
the debate rages all I see eat you come
in right exactly exactly
and yesterday was fun though good so in
your talk about deep cleaning in the
cloud what some applications would make
use of deep learning in the cloud what
say I don't know what a situation would
be I have a tech company and I want to
start using some kind of machine
learning who should use it
goodness everyone so what I talked about
today was the premise of the talk was AI
for all the deaths right so there's
obviously we just went through this huge
debate of all this you know what is AI
Michelle our deep learning and what my
talk was today after going through that
was how can you get started without
being a data scientist without
understanding you know neural networks
or deep learning any of that and so I
talked about some of the services that
are using deep learning that you can use
a day to your point if you had a tech
company and let's say you had a gaming
company and you want it to have your
game have the characters talk at
specific times and you only had the
stream Claudia right now it's really
really difficult so what happens there
and cut up those audio streams and try
to match it to the mouth of the
character that is talking right I mean
gaming is a great example of that and
think about how hard it is you develop
this this game and you're trying to get
the sequence of them talking exactly
right well one of the AI services that
is using you know these machine learning
deep learning technologies is poly so I
can make an audio book and have
something called speech marks using also
a standard called FSM L right and I can
now make audio books and say the
sentence Ian's here the inflection of
them boys should be say this fast and SS
ml is a is a w3c standard but then when
you add things like speech marks so it
knows the beginning or end of a word or
beginning an end of a sentence then
think about how much easier it is in the
map a text to be spoken based upon that
metadata of those things so if you're at
for instance so immediately a game is
video to do that or audio book for kids
and then I also talked about you know
natural user interfaces so talking so
think about customer service things
where
we call in and ratings right now IBRS
can be challenging yes but what if you
had similar to Alexa where I was calling
in and I could actually talk to a
machine as if like I was taught like I'm
talking to you and so natural user
interfaces and natural speech language
is really important for those things if
you think about the ramifications of
that I can now have customer service
things to be better I can to what if I'm
an employee system in Oh think about the
stock market right everyone's yelling
out things that nature what if I could
just talk to my computer and just em
into my phone and say hey by you know
Amazon stock it's at this price yes and
that's better than yelling and waving or
writing down paper and everything else
imagine how silent coolest route would
be if people all they have to do is go
OK buy the stock and I want this many
shares and it could automatically do it
for you and think about how much more
effective because again from a stock of
the timing perspective it's really real
time and so we talked about that and
also talks about text-to-speech
interfaces so we talked about things
that just have api's right now that even
without knowing about all this debate
about neural networks and deep learning
cognitive learning and all the debates
going on now you can immediately become
a pseudo data scientist by just calling
different API and leveraging that so we
talked about that and then finally we
like most file providers have offerings
now for what we call a deep learning AMI
so just you know it's simple a VM right
but it has every machine learning
framework already installed on it
alright and we have what we call a cloud
formation template where you can run it
and it immediately sets up what a deep
learning framework in the right way for
you so you can immediately get started
not only with learning but let's say you
already are familiar with the models you
want set up as part of the battle right
yeah so imagine being able to have one
click and have this huge GPU instance
ready to go for you and able to do some
cool deep learning things whether it's
learning are for real-world examples I
mean today everyone's using AI and I
don't think we even need it
know it even down to think about this if
I click sleep on my email yes that's
using a four
a machine-learning right I just say hey
I want you just sweep all email that is
30 days old or by this person I mean it
literally can run a quick algorithm and
say okay
more than likely she means sees or this
person all I know is John you know 30
days and John I can make some kind of
you know indication so there's lots of
things going on
fake facial recognition for security
banks are doing that to prevent fraud I
mean there's lots of implications as we
keep going down the pathway I hopefully
not the Skynet oh yes so yeah hopefully
not but it make it do it makes sense</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
