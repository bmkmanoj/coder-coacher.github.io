of IOT data with Minecraft
my name is las Liguria I'm working at
Hyper's labs in Munich and we are
connecting electronic with the
e-commerce platform of high press and
also with as a piece of high prices on
ASAP my agenda will be first yeah
reading IOT sensor data then store the
data and of course I think that's the
reason most of you are here for
Minecraft and talk about Minecraft API
so first of all there are lots of data
like temperature and noise for example I
have here something build up it's a
light sensor and a temperature sensor I
think in the bank you will not see it
maybe the cameraman will it's oh yeah
cool so this is on an Arduino and here
somehow we know code which setups the
serial communication and also reads an
analog value for the light and the
temperature sensor uses a ds1 8 s 20
sensor it's one wire and I have some
demo for it let's see first of all here
is that we know code once again so if I
run this DIF foot not work because I
have to select a port
run it again and here I'm getting the
values for the light first one is light
so I find him it
it's 47 10 bit first 24 so try to heat
it up a little bit yes works so I have
to close it
okay I also have used it in Eclipse for
it to read the sensor data so just to
get data out of it's your data all right
it uses some native library for eclipse
our XTX and doesn't for the value of
that yeah 24 right and limit I don't
know temperature value sometimes get a
little bit hiccup yeah heat it up maybe
that helps yes
great so
now I've got data that was one thing I
did in the office we're working I had a
temperature sensor put it on the
internet or we put it on a bigger bone
was it and read it and was happy okay I
now have the temperature okay summertime
it's getting warmer every day fine but
what should I do with it I thought okay
store the data because we're doing
Internet of Things
also at Hyper's labs so I have to store
it somewhere and we're using an ax I
used Hana for it but because I want to
play around with her a little bit and as
you can see there's Hana HT HDPE Hana
cloud platform there's a black in a
service Internet of Things service and
Hana itself is a database which you can
do some rest cause JDBC it handles time
series data which is important for
example if I only store the value of the
temperature well you will has changed
before so it could be one minute it
could be ten minutes could be five
seconds for example so there's something
which called time series and yes you can
do those at some prediction on it here's
the big picture of all it all of it so I
have my Arduino using serial
communication or in some kind of gateway
there's my laptop in this example
there's a rest call to Hana and Hana
sauce in Hana HTTP and then I will do
some rest call for minecraft later on
but notice this theme of I only fake it
because I'm not true with the internet
here so first of all it shows some
little bit of there's a hunnit trial and
internet is not working great
said working not working
that's my lifetime I hope I have time
great photo getting nervous getting
scared doesn't work
where's my internet yeah
no internet why star no internet because
I plugged in this maybe network is down
great okay
I have to back up with some slides
uh-huh
so I explained it here by hands with we
can define some device type for example
I can say I have the box temperature
then I have a message type which will be
a value on sensor it for example and all
this can connect it to a device for
example the the Box room 9 yeah this
would be the demo crate the internet is
down ok
so to put this data in into Hana the
areas a rest call with a post message
and I have a message type which I will
define and with this message type I also
defined light for example and this is
where well you get in so this is the
body and with where L I called some API
call and then the end is the sensor data
and then I post in the body and all this
authorization I have a token for each
device and it's fine
and later on I can also look at the data
via for example it would draw 14 the
last time I tried it okay Internet's
doll down maybe for thought of yeah for
the information there's a IOT
starter kit for Hana with ending
messages and so on and at the end with
and yet with the starter kit you can
also show the graph with the normal
business chart so now we have data and
I've stored the data yeah didn't stored
it really sorry but when I was in the
office I also had the data and I store
the data in Hana and then I thought okay
what can I do with this data I'm showing
it a normal graph it's interesting but
yeah it's nothing special nothing you so
thinking about it and then came up my
kids are playing with Minecraft and I
recognize okay minecraft with a
Raspberry Pi there's some API and I can
draw some blocks so this is the first
version which I used some later and
brought some classy blocks and then I
played around more and always when when
some colleagues coming by they asked me
did you always play minecraft and say no
no I'm connected with Hana and I'm
showing temperature day so yet data for
example this is in the morning during
the night everything was normal
temperature someone opened the window
and doing some what time is getting
hotter and hotter and at one day it
always there was some some island in my
world it's getting so hot that the
temperature value gets through the
island so
as I told our using Raspberry Pi there's
a free version for Minecraft for it the
API has language support for Python
which is standard on the Raspberry Pi
there's also Java support in nodejs and
the API itself has something like get
pose position or set position for the
player on the Minecraft I can get a
block I can set a block I can set blocks
and also can do a poll on the heat so
now I have some demo Oh
later on tips lucky I didn't use so this
is running and temperature data are
still working and here we have minecraft
so there's a one diamond block and it's
depending on the light so if I deem it
the block falls down now it's little bit
complicated with one hand in the other
end bring it down yeah
so first version worked great
how did it work it's the question maybe
so I call it light pixel this is
readable yes good I'd see some thumbs up
called maybe meaning bigger No
so in the first part I sum in this
dilation I set the position of the
player where my scene is then I clear
the scene for it it only moves up and
down so I'm starting from 0 to 100 and
clean 110 and clean it with air ok
minecraft has XY set so exists in this
way why is this way and said would be
this way if I'm looking into it when
your way it would be this this and yeah
next one I've stored the last position
if the last position I would clear it so
the block will move around and clears
the previous block and depending on the
light temperature it calculates the Y
position and draws the timer block
so maybe I can change it and put some
glass block
I have to stop it and run it and Trust
and now I should see somewhere some
glass block yeah
there it is and should still work okay
falling down somewhere here it is there
it was great I think you believe me okay
next demo I always have to stop this
because it's using the serial
communication and if I don't stop it
the port is already used and then I
getting an error so yes just orgy okay
coming up great
next scene where it is here so now I
have depending on the light that's this
curve and also depending on the
temperature the block should change the
color yeah getting red so I damn it red
stop it
okay the next thing I can move there hit
on it and get a light 66 temperature 29
and yeah if I want to I can so sorry it
stand on the might well you also fall
down a wait when it's coming looking
from this side yeah
of time here great so this one also
clears my area loops all through the
yeah looked for an hit event if a
heating vent is there then it reads the
value the position of off the block and
sends the value back as a message post
to chat is it concede here and the
sensor data itself are here drawn and
depending on on the car on the
temperature the color will also change
so it's between 23 and 25 it's yellow
orange red and as blocks I'm using some
wool they have different color so that's
nice next one would be oh my flower you
know I don't want to use it here okay
now I have the same graph it's drawn the
other side around so it starts in front
of it and then it just draws it that's
nothing special but I can put some water
on it
oh nice and function the P is here here
stop run and now the waters flowing so I
get some dynamic graph I can also put
some light on it
yeah
so I have some some dynamic graph in
this situation it's also possible with
lava but lava destroys most of the scene
and I can put some water on it
halftime maybe maybe this would be
something so what I'm doing is setting
the value for lava just one for water
one one block up everything on it I
wanted our no lava first first Darwin
and on top of it some water
so let's see what happens maybe it's
getting crazy
well trust the same I just put your
Slava maybe that's cool
yeah here we go
and maybe also depending on the
temperature of yeah maybe later on trust
getting mind could be some idea if the
temperatures getting higher it's getting
lower otherwise its water oh sorry
okay so another demo would be a control
room I don't want to search I want to
say Here I am
start yeah but this side is better so
here's my control room everything is
green I'm fine so instead of temperature
values you could also use your
drinking's or build system for example
and display it on some TV the great
thing about a Raspberry Pi that's are
also reason I used it it has an HDMI
output so you can plug it on the TV and
yeah put it in your office maybe and or
at home so what happens when it's
getting warm for you not too cold
yeah it's getting red so something is
burning or something and in the
background I have also some light
control so it's saying 376 I'm reading
getting dark then it turns out
my dance of still might and great yeah
400 oh great number sorry it would also
be possible the other way around so that
I can do my smart home if it's getting
dark then I did should light up more
lights and yeah also with with with the
temperature
so what else yeah great work on oh so I
am
on an island and inside of this volcano
there some Lala so I should be a little
bit off and let's see my hands are to
freezing temperature 26 lavas coming
okay oh I'm so hot I would come here for
trade I thought I would be have cold
hands but since I'm nervous
once again
just move it
so I'm stupid boy
don't do it 29 is the yeah
and now waters coming so yeah depending
on on I can also turn it off I think
flowers great here in this situation
water is more stuff with water throwing
and destroy it at the end
know what happens Oh unn okay
honors are soft here great
this is when out of the running now it
seems better once again getting out of
the way and heated up I also prepared
something for a hand so maybe this would
be great twenty nine
to
anymore
everything is cool to you yeah now it's
getting
great
so on this yeah first of all I cleared
up everything because lava is that hold
destroys everything and then you have to
put water on it and then it getting a
stone and you have to throw it away
yeah break it down and so I cleared
everything on build up the the island on
myself
put the volcano inside of it and this is
where it's starting you know some here
of the lava right and I setting some
blocks set blocks with starting vector
and ending vector and from bottom to the
up depending on on the temperature
vector to will be yes the temperature
just to minus 21 divided and so I
getting depending on the temperature the
value gets up and down okay I think I
have some slides and then yes I said
hold set play on on the scene itself
clearly seen and you have to slow down a
little bit so it don't render all your
data on the Minecraft itself when I
rendered pyramid for for the temperature
I took some time and before it was at
the end it's the arts again and then
sometimes the raspberry pie didn't fit
really well then so I only shot the area
where the players looking yeah what else
more sensor data so maybe some noise
maybe a button or also possible from
minecraft to something else as I thought
when you hit on the temperature bar
you're getting some value and maybe this
could be okay
foot turn on the light or something like
this
the reason is yeah why why why should
you do it
okay you have a 3d view it's a nice
background it looks better than this
business style graphic you can use it
for monitoring in some kind and you can
also do some some data mining on it like
when you're ticking around or something
you you find your data maybe it's some
some gamification on it Raspberry Pi
supports multiplayer so if you put it on
the on your local network I think four
players can also look at the data so you
have a multi few on your data and yeah I
don't know what what else there are lots
of ideas sometimes those with a bridge
for example eventing on on the light a
bridge can be up and down or yes and one
more thing I have some time starting
with this idea I'm some colleague came
up and asked for a summer holiday his
son is a Munich for one week if we add
hyper slopes have can have something for
him and then we came up with the idea to
build a shop with it so and out of this
there was a kid's workshop with 16 kids
and they built some shopping malls and
we put some blocks inside of it as
product and when then when you hit one
of these blocks this will get into the
shopping cart yeah hybrids we have also
some my microservice frame
system and they can put something in the
shopping cart with the rest call and
also checkout so this was oh and that
another big thing we are doing I can
I don't know I think I have set it up so
if it's working connected let's see
courage oh I'm still burning from the
lava
I need water I need water
Oh No
yeah great
I'm burning okay No
so this is the shopping cart these are
product items and this would be to check
out for example and if I hit it then
yeah it goes into the first it goes into
the shopping cart and then I get an
email for checkout work fine yeah so are
there some questions maybe the time is
nearly over you can find the slides on
the slides there's also the source code
if someone is interested in and yeah
time is up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
