present a new react support in je
hipster which is not released yet it's
kind of an alpha beta stage we are
hoping to release it probably today so
let's see hello everybody I'm sandal I'm
Jenna and Jay Exley I'm currently doing
the part that angular as well as with
react and I'm product developer at the
Bell Labs and you can find me on open
those projects like gesture the pack
servo and many more and currently I'm
hacking tube assembly if anybody with
you interested in it just bring me in
Twitter yeah my name is Deepu and the
co-leader of jay hipster i also work for
a company called AVL ZB labs we make
devops products I'm also no robotics and
astronomy enthusiast you can find me in
Twitter we are co-authoring a book on J
hipster it's available from pact you can
find the link here if you are interested
so how many of you guys using react
already in this room we have file ok
how many of using angular 1 2 4 5 ok how
many of you wanted to change to react
your angle application so we have three
full fine
and how many of you using Jacobs
territory not bad not bad yeah and how
many of you loving typescript Bob we got
a good amount there yes and I assume
your Java developers as well do most of
the Java developed a Java developer
success okay so for those of you know
don't know about J hipster it's a
development platform with the
application generator at its core
currently it supports developing spring
boot and angular applications as well as
micro services we are adding react
support we are working on it we have
been frantically trying to
today but yeah you know how open-source
goes so probably will have at least a
beat our an alphabet today or at least
tomorrow or day after tomorrow or next
month so for a Java project we seem to
be quite popular so you can find more
info the website listed below so this is
what we are going to do in the session
we are going to generate an application
and then run the application and then
showcase the code and finally we go
through the app that has been generated
with J hipster so it's code time can we
move to terminal so we are a directory
now we are just going to create a taster
project in this directory okay we are
creating a directory so
je hipster to create a jape stir project
so it will ask you a set of questions
and we just have to go through this
questions and then select something
based on that ok so just just a minute
okay so we have the first question as it
asks what kind of project that you want
to use its monolithic or a micro service
or micro service gateway based
application or a UA server we have an
option for that and we have chosen my
monolithic here and the next two
questions are simpler you just give the
base name for your application and then
you select a package name and we do have
a gesture registry which helps you to
monitor and register your services and
then scale them this is mainly used for
micro services and of course you can use
it for monolith to track or know to
monitor the application all those things
and we have three kinds of
authentications used one is the JWT
authentication which has been selected
this is a default version and we do have
the authentications like os/2 and the
other stateless authentication is also
present there and then now we are going
to select what type of database that you
have to select so we have an option
between SQL NoSQL databases and then no
sequel databases we are currently
supporting MongoDB and Cassandra I think
Couchbase is on the list soon we have
Pia waiting to be merged so we will
select an SQL database here and when you
select SQL database you when you develop
an application you have two things here
one is a production level database and
development level database we will
choose MySQL in the production level and
has two based for a development level
here and you have a second level cashy
so we can choose eh cashy here which is
a default version that we have we do
have support for hassel cat and in
finish man and one cool thing about this
is the original people from the projects
come here and deliver this stuff so for
example in finished man we have someone
from Red Hat contributing to our source
so things like that happening and we do
an option between choosing maven as well
as Gradle so we will choose Miam in here
and we have some other stuffs extra
added to here like you can use social
login you can use elastic search and
things like that there are extra modules
that are available inside our generated
and if you wanted to use you can use
this we just go ahead for this demo
is for the react some of these options
are not yet completed because we are
still working on it that's why we are
going with the default options so we are
not going to go into details of the
other options because the because this
is about react so we will directly go
into choosing react and then yeah no
sass for now
no I 18 and I mean yeah we can choose I
18 and actually so that part was coded
in recently so let's say mmm that's very
touch it's Dutch yeah
so we have currently these many
languages we are supporting it and added
to j-unit and camel test unit test
framework which will be automatically
generated for you
we also have an option to choose between
three other testing frameworks we have
Catalan which is in Scala and cucumber
which is in gherkin and also we have
protractor based testing so if you want
you can go ahead and choose it but no
not for react we are not radical react
not for not soon I think we can skip
this about markers please so what
happens now is it just creates
application for you we will go through
the code that has been generated now it
creates application for you and then it
installs everything all the node modules
NPM packages whatever you want to have
it installs everything and after that it
creates a get in it for you it just
initializes get in your repository and
then it's done so it will stop there
then we have to just boot up my
application and see how beautiful
application is or not so this is a
folder that has been created it's a
normal spring boot based project
structured so you have a main folder
here which has your Java and so
resources which mostly deals with your
spring part of your system and then you
have a react based application inside
the web app folders people can you go
inside you can yeah he was supposed to
present it from his fancy new Mac but he
forgot his fancy new adapter so here we
have everything inside this app folder
so if you go inside here we have a
config folder
and then the modules which actually
encompasses the list of modules or lists
of segments that we have any
applications in our application so you
have an account module which deals with
your personal account information
administration module which deals with
metrics which deals with databases which
deals with API endpoints and all those
stuffs which you are required and you
have a login model which basically tells
that it's going to for login and you
have reduces here
so this react application is made up of
freedom it has Redux inside it so you do
have reducers and actions here so these
are the things that is there and all the
common stuffs or inside this shared
module so so this is how the application
is is did you get this this is a hipster
react but it has an angular thing here
yeah it's an old log logo I mean it's a
it's a tattoo you cannot remove that too
so
so probably we we just go to the
terminal now yes so the application has
been generated and since we have used
you just go ahead and put maven command
to start your application
yeah and you can see the gate has been
initialized and we have initial set of
commands present their application is
initializing now so you can see the yarn
build was already completed during the
initialization I mean during application
generation you can see that after
generation or your yarn dependencies
where I mean NPM dependencies were
installed we use the yarn by default
because it is faster and the build was
also triggered so the front end has
already been built so we are just
starting up the server that's been
started so server is started here so
this is by default the simple
application that has been generated with
Jake hipster and this has bootstrap for
in it huh yeah just yeah just here it's
a different guy not the same guy yeah
fully new tattoo or laser treatment
whatever so this is application that has
been generated we have JWT based
authentication and we have a database
also created the back end so we'll just
go through whatever is there so you have
an admin module here which has user
management and
by default you have a list of uses that
has been generated in the system so it
lists there and you have basic credit
operation for the all the users over
there and you have metrics which
actually takes all the jvm metrics and
show in a nicer UI so you have the IBM
metrics the request all your server
statistics everything is present here
you can go ahead and look at it and it
also gives an endpoint for health check
so it's a it basically works on top of
spring' actuators so you have the same
point metrics Health metrics everything
is there so you can go and see all your
health database URLs burn the disk space
in which the server is running all those
stuffs you can go ahead and see and the
configuration so again spring actuator
stuff you have API documentation this is
based on swagger so this list all the
API is it available in the system this
is very useful in terms of microservice
application of course it is useful in
monolithic to so it gives all the
details about the API is that the
application has and you can play with
that API over here so all those things
you can do and you have Lister fork own
settings there so that is pretty much of
it and you can change the language and
show them so yeah we wrote our own I 18
and plug-in for this because we couldn't
find something that already works with
the 18 files we have for angular because
somehow all the react item plugins seems
to do their own stuff so we had to write
our own I had teen plug-in just not bad
so we had now have one more react I 18
plugin it's nice you also have password
log out and all those stuff here so
let's see what we have on gender next
whoops so these are the few things they
upcoming we are trying to pw8 fi our
application so works has been going on
for angular now already added support
for PW yesterday night in its night 3
o'clock in the morning something like
that yeah so there is already a basic PW
support already there and there is a
peer that is currently open for angular
5 we will be doing angular 5 very soon
we are waiting for some of the library
is to migrate to angular fight then
we'll be going to angle fi Cain he also
a spring boot on the pipeline spring
boot to on the pipeline along with
spring file the work has been started
been going on we also have work going on
for some basic templating or blueprint
support where you can override
individual parts of je hipster with your
own templates and stuff so you can
extend jhi easily to fit your needs if
because we won't be able to satisfy
everyone's needs
we also are planning to modularize or
entity generator and stuff so that it is
more reusable for others I know module
developers and like blueprint developers
and stuff like that
so if you guys have any questions you
can ask me we are here so we can
approach this outside also if you want
to have any questions and any questions
now and if you want to see a Smackdown
between angular and react we have a talk
Matt and myself have a talked today
afternoon so please come you can have
some nice battle of the teens react fans
I hope there are enough react fans to
support me here I kind of feel singled
out because there are a lot of angular
people even the board outside says yes
please
currently we have Tom we used to have
Tomcat then we switch to undertow so
probably we will stick to that unless
there is a huge issue or like you know
there is a huge performance benefit from
another option like jetty or something
but I don't see that happening in some
but because undertow seems to be the
lightest and like it's fast it's faster
so probably not we have some J hipster
t-shirts if you want to grab so there
are some yeah there are few if you want
few stickers too if you are interested
and start contributing to the open
source that you are doing and start
hacking thank you thanks guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
