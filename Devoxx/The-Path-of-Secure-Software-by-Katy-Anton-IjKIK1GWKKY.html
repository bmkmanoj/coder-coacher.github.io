very much for coming to this session I
hope that you are here because not
because you are in the wrong room but
because we are interested in operation
security in securing the software
because the reality is that developers
have not learned about secure coding or
crypt in school at university level
secure coding or software security is
not part of the curriculum in most
universities at the same time cyber
attacks are a real and growing threat to
businesses an increasing number of this
attacks takes place at the application
layer the best defense for this is to
develop the software where security has
been incorporated as part of the
software development cycle the asked of
the interactive controls consider
security as part of the software
development cycle how many of you have
heard of asked proactive controls ok
pure hands up that's very good
in this presentation I will go through
these security techniques that you can
use while writing the code and for each
of these controls we are also going to
explore which of the most common
vulnerabilities or of the risks you can
prevent my name is Katie Anton and I
come from a software development
background where I have led and created
teams of developers in my previous job I
was asked to take care of this thing
called security and this is when I start
looking into security and incorporating
security as part of the software
development cycle
I didn't join the ass of the impressive
controls as contributor and then later
as project co-leader I currently work as
application security consultant at
ferric code a business unit within C
technologies where I advise developers
around the world on how to secure their
software the asked of the risks is by
far the most cited as document and this
presentation will be tied in with the
most recent version of this which is the
our top 10 2017 a release candidate so
you are the first one to have the
security controls
presented two on how to defend these
vulnerabilities found in software
applications but how many of you have
choice starting from the list of
vulnerabilities to secure the software
because initially this is what I tried
to do I looked indeed and I couldn't in
fact I got stuck at a one injection
where you have always injection LDAP
injection XML injection SQL injections
just to name a few injections and each
of them have its own defensive mechanism
so for me at the time the question was
how can we as developers to write more
secure software and how can I explain it
in very simple terms to my team of
developers so they can use it while
writing the code inversor times on the
very tight deadlines this leads the ask
top ten risks is an awareness document
which suits organizations and
professionals that need to assess the
state of a software like for example pen
testers because it gives them a very
nice checklist that they can assess the
state of a software against it but it's
not for developers so for me the
question was how can we as developers to
write more secure applications in
particular all that the security
techniques that we can use while writing
the software without being security
experts and still helps prevent this the
most common vulnerabilities because when
these are in the software these are the
some of the exploits that can take place
why for example most like Fonseca or
Panama papers the latest one paradise'
papers which has searched every leader
in the world a vulnerability into a
third-party library in HipChat which are
allowed attackers to gain access to
remote servers and still users
information customers information a
vulnerability in instagrams API which
has allowed attacker to steal users
personal information an interesting one
that might not be that well-known which
happened in the software powering the
slot machines in US casinos
and there the problem was that
the numbers generated my dad software
were not random this meant that it was
easy to predict them and this is exactly
what the attackers did by loading a
sequence of numbers analyzing them they
are able to predict the next ones in
this way increasing their wings in fact
a team of four were able to win around
quarter of a million dollars per week
and the latest one
Equifax which has a rate related to data
of million and million people around the
world so all of these breaches has in
common the fact that they were bleep
britches to do the vulnerabilities in
the software and they happen at the
application layer and as developers will
write applications from enterprise
applications webs web services or even a
small website like this gorgeous little
website with balloons and butterflies
regardless of the size of the website
will write the question is how can we
make it more secure but where do we even
start a good starting point is the
awesome application security
verification standard or for short
ASVs how many of you have heard of a SES
feel great
this document helps you to choose the
right level of security for your own
application where the level one is the
minimum level every application should
be verified at a minimum level one level
two is for those applications that in
case of data breach ok it's going to be
embarrassing it's going to create a
little bit of a mess that needs to be
cleaned up but it's not going to be the
end of the world and level 3 is for
those applications that we really do
care about those applications that are
really critical to the business and in
case of the data breach well they're
going to be serious financial
consequences those type of applications
must be verified at level 3 and this is
a good document because it helps
but over the Vella hers our managers
within the business to have a common
understanding of the appropriate level
of security of their own applications
and here is an example of how the
requirements look like where each
requirement is clearly marked if it
applies to level 1 level 2 or level 3
now do you remember the breach that
happened in to the software powering the
slot machines so if for example the
requirement seven point six was taken
into account which says that all the
numbers the random number generator
should be created using the approved the
cryptographic modules approved a random
number generator then that type of lock
would have been avoided so we can use a
document like SBS that helped us to
choose the appropriate level of security
for our own application from there
extract those requirements appropriate
for that particular level and use them
in the software furthermore we can use
those requirements to generate the test
cases that can help us to verify for
security early and often and this is
control number one verify for security
early and often and when we say verify
for security early and often we actually
mean that we should verify throughout
the entire of the development cycle from
the moment during the development stage
in using unit tests code review before
committing the coding to the repository
you can perform further checks use using
the pre commit hooks and here you can
add checks for sensitive later on like a
secret token passwords that must not be
committed to github or get into
production for the checks for deprecated
algorithms like md5 or dangerous
functions like eval or exec in fact I
had a developer that kept committing
debugging messages into the production
code not only that it produced error but
also it was a case of disclosing
information the same
the way we dealt with it was to add it
to the list of forbidden functions into
the pre-commit hook once the code is in
deeper into the main branch
here you can use the tests that have
been generated from our space vs the as
functional tests you can integrate
create selenium text test in conjunction
what's up or other tools and also they
said you can actually have tests using a
static analysis tools prior to
deployment you can run your regression
suit of tests in conjunction with
dynamic analysis tools so control number
one helps you from the start not as an
afterthought to prevent all the our top
ten risks this control gives you a very
nice framework where a rather than
thinking of security as another thought
you start with the requirements from the
beginning and instead of testing for
security at the end of a project or
project phase you incorporate security
technique testing into yours of the
software development cycle and when
possible make it part of your continuous
integration and continuous delivering
great what else can we do with about
today's 2017 and we still have cases of
SQL injection so this works by tricking
the SQL parser and interpreting the
input as part of the SQL command the
defense for this is parameterize queries
this helps untrusted input from being
interrupted as part of the SQL command
but it's important that if we use these
then we bind to the variable and this is
the an example in Java where not only
does use the preparedstatement api but
we create the SQL command with a
placeholder and then bind the variables
to that placeholder in this way the
actual defense happen happens at the SQL
parser level from that point on the
parser will treat those variables as
simple strings
and using control number to parameterize
quiz can prevent injections most like
and receive further which types of
injection cannot prevent the next type
of vulnerability cross-site scripting
and unfortunately the koozai scripting
is not giving the required and attention
and there have been in the past exploits
where from a simple script injection
script like this that loaded the cookies
of the user loading browsing that page
and sent to a remote server entire
system were able to be brought down in
the case that the user browsing that
pages an administrator in that case the
attacker also gets access to
administrator privileges so there have
been attacks all started from this
humble cross-site scripting now in the
case of cross-site scripting we have to
be aware that depending of your where
your dynamic data is within the HTML
document there are different type of
injection payloads so for example if
your dynamic data is into an HTML
element like PT a P tag or a div tag in
this case you need to inject a script in
order to trigger the script execution
like a script tag or another case you
can actually insert an image with an
invalid source that when trying to load
the source triggers the own error event
and that's when the actual injection
starts running in the case of URL for
example you are already within attack so
you don't need to inject to tag in this
case you can trigger the script
execution with the JavaScript but if you
are already in a JavaScript context then
you are already there so the only thing
you need is just a function that needs
to be executed one of the things that I
see has a defined
is our filters we have to bear in mind
that the filters are simple blacklist
they are not the best defense and they
are not loved by security professionals
but they are absolutely adore by hackers
because it is possible to bypass the
filters and why one way to bypass them
is to write the same thing in multiple
ways and this is what you can see me or
in the JavaScript example you have you
inject the alert function which is going
to execute but you know right absolutely
the same thing using in this case HTML
entities and both of them are going
tricks execute successfully so for this
type of defense of vulnerability the
best defense is to encode your output
encode it just before writing it to the
HTML parser like we have seen on the
cross-site scripting injection payloads
it's important to apply the right method
for the right context so if your dynamic
data is into a euro or an HTML context
then you need you need to encode for the
HTML context if you're 10 having the
days into JavaScript then you need to
apply on incurred for the JavaScript
context today from the scratch is not
the simplest thing to do so the best way
to deal with this type of vulnerability
is the user library that has already
been out there designed specifically for
this purpose in the case of Java the
base library out there is the AUSA Java
encoder it's simple to use you can
easily includes using maven has no
dependencies and it's a regularly update
and maintain also it has a contextual
method encoding so you just need to use
the right method for the right context
where your dynamic data it is and
contextually including the out which can
prevent injection and cross-site
scripting what else so back to our
website what other things we we need to
protect against what about the data for
this we have control number 4
all data and when we refer to data we
actually refer to all the data that
comes via a get or post including hidden
fields' file uploads HTTP headers
cookies including data from the database
because when we validate the data from
the database as well then you can
prevent other types of injections like
second-order SQL injection how many of
you have heard of second-order SQL
injection meaning okay okay so I'm going
to go through a very simple example
about this type of vulnerability so the
the second-order SQL injection works
when the injection payload is stored
into the database stays there dormant
until is used in other parts of the
software and that's when the exploits
actually occurs so let's consider that
we have a case where we already have a
user John into our application but now
we record another user let's say John
single called search - this value will
be stored in the database and it's going
to become the injection payload when
used in other parts of the software so
let's suppose now that we go in other
parts of the software like for example
to change the password and when changing
the password for our initial user the
SQL command for changing the password
can become from the initial warned of
changing the password for user John
single coders - to change the change in
the password for a completely different
user because that input is contains an
injection payload which has been
interpreted as part of the SQL command
so we can say that we have successfully
changed the password for a different
user and have perform a second order SQL
injection the best defense for this is
to validate the data including the data
that comes from the database and
validating all the data including the
one that comes from the database can
prevent injection its turn
exonic XML external entities insecure
this realization and credit scripting
right so let's see what else can we do
our website like many other applications
out there has pages sections that are
available for everybody and sections
that are restricted to certain users for
this we have Control Number five
employing authentication controls the
authentication control is a complex
security control in this presentation I
will just go through few best practices
like for example implement the secure
password storage use multi-factor
authentication having placed a secure
password recovering mechanism you
transfer any sensitive data via TLS and
having placed one design error messages
that do not disclose information about
the users of the application when it
comes to error message to password to
Soaring the password we want to make it
as difficult for the attackers in case
the database is licked for this we must
use a strong cryptographic algorithm
like password-based key derivation
function to be crypt or a s script when
it comes to the actual password to the
latest NIST guidelines which have just
been published this year recommend to
align the passwords all the ASCII
characters including space we have to
take into account that today these days
more and more people have more and more
passwords and there is an increase of
the password managers so it's important
to align the software the paste
functionality the password that is
entered by the users ideally should be
checked against the lid a list of bad
passwords you can come up with at least
this list of bad passwords by looking
into the data from previous bay bridges
and selecting the top most used
passwords to which you can add word
dictionary words and sequential
characters like one two
ABC when it comes to the actual limit
lengthen limit of the password the
minimum recommended is 8 characters but
we should help the user with password
strength meters to choose a strong
password and should allow the users to
enter passwords as lengthy as they want
if the passwords are too long then there
is a risk of denial service also we have
to bear in mind that bcrypt
I will truncate everything that it's
over 72 bytes to deal with these two
problems one way is to implement a
strong hash like sha-512 which is a
modern hash and has a higher collision
rate so if we are to recap when it comes
to a strong password storage we should
use a user specific salt to avoid
problems like denial of service or
truncation or you should we should hash
the password with a modern hash and
protect those with strong cryptographic
algorithm like password-based key
derivation function to be crypt or a
script depending of the nature of the
application a second factor auditing
authentication is also good to have we
have to I have to point out that SMS is
not considered a second factor
authentication and this prepares to
bangs it from their recommendation you
should use a fiddle or a dedicated app
but if you are implementing a secure
strong password storage in your software
then it's important to be consistent and
do it throughout the software and this
is an example from Ashley Madison
website where a bridge where they
actually have used the strong
cryptographic algorithm like a crypt but
what they did next was at the same
password the user would enter was also
used for a fast locking key and this was
thought with the deprecated md5 as soon
as well this was understood it was very
easy to crack the passwords around 11
million passwords were cracked due to
this floor
now when it comes to error messages
important it is important to design the
error messages in such a manner that
they do not disclose information about
the users or their identity and this is
an example in you can still find many
out there where the visitor is presented
with one error message if the user is
found in the database and a different
error message if the user does not exist
in the database so you don't need to be
a hacker to figure out which is a valid
user and which is not so it's important
that for both cases the user exists in
the database and the user does not exist
in the database the visitor is presented
with a a the same HTTP header 200 ok and
same HTML message so like I mentioned
the subject of authentication is a
complex one in this presentation I just
focused on few best practices you can
find more within the project but this is
a good store to protect against broken
authentication so until now we have
discussed about who is accessing the
page what about which pages are accessed
for this we have Control Number six
implement appropriate access controls
the access control to these why it is a
very complex design heavy security
control the best way to deal with this
is to use frameworks that have already
been incorporated with well-designed
access controls and using a framework
with well-designed
access controls can prevent broken
access control great so what else can we
do what about to the data the data that
is transferred between computers over
the Internet or the data at rest for
this we have control number seven
protect the data protect data both at
rest and in transit when it comes to
data in transit the best protection out
there is still HTTP which helps with
confidentiality integrity authenticity
we have the very mind that HTTP by
itself does not protect against certain
scenarios of man-in-the-middle attack to
reduce some of those scenarios we can
add an extra header and this is the
strict Transport Security Heather
this is a browser standard and what do
this does is one cities download it on
to the users browser from that point on
any communication between that browser
and the remote server is done via HTTP
channel only so if the user no types
into the URL location bar example.com
and this header has already been
downloaded onto dobrze that browser the
browser automatically switches to the
secure channel and from that point on
all the communication is done by the
HTTPS channel when it comes to data
opera is the best thing control out
there is still a yes Advanced Encryption
standard we have to bear in mind that's
important to have in place a security
management for the key used to encrypt
decrypt data and appropriate access
controls and edit auditing in place and
having emplaced controls for both data
at rest and in transit cam protect
prevent sensitive data explosion great
so what else can I do what about the
logging for this we have control number
eight implement logging and intrusion
detection logging should not be used
only for debugging and troubleshooting
but can also be used for application
monitoring compliance monitoring and
intrusion detection when it comes to the
intrusion detection there is sever six
type of events that can be considered
good attack identifiers like for example
authorization and authentication
failures client-side input validation
bypasses whitelist input validation
failures obvious injection code
injection attacks like for example
obvious SQL injection payloads or
cross-site scripting payloads and high
rate of function use for example if a
page has me requested a high number of
times in a very short period of time
so some example of this intrusion
detection points are if your application
expects a get but receives a post then
that's something that it's an indication
that somebody has tampered with that
additional form or URL parameters also
it's the indication that somebody has
tampered with that data since it has
left the clients night until hazard
reach the server side for example
somebody can add an extra URL like admin
equaled one or another form parameter
like debug equal true if the input
validation fails on the server side
despite the fact that there is a
client-side validation that's another
indicator a simple example is we already
have we have a form on the client and
the form has an input with a maximum
length attribute defined in the form
however when the string reaches the
server the length of that string is
greater than the value defined on the
client side so this is another good
indication that has somebody has
tampered with a string since it has left
the browser until it has reached the
server so ideally you take an action and
decide of what the software should do in
this type of scenario or if the
server-side validation fails for non
user editable fields like for example
hidden fields checkboxes a good example
is a commerce website
basket page because in that basket page
can be various interesting informational
like hidden fields for price that can be
tempted even mice to actually start
playing with that value but if the value
that reaches the server is different
from of the price that was part of a
hidden field is different from what the
software actually expected and we should
put in play
is logging and give the software the
ability to respond if this is the case
so from software point of view what we
are doing we are actually ensure that
the data the software expect is the
actual data that the software receives
when this does not happen then using
this intrusion detection point we put
into the software the mechanisms that
allow the software to respond in
real-time and to minimize possible
attacks or even stopped them and having
in place a secure logging in conjunction
with a well intrusion detection
mechanism can prevent all the our top 10
risks great so what else can we do now
starting from the scratch and to write a
code for security control every time we
write a new application or a new soft or
a new web service not only that is time
consuming but can also lead to security
design flaws and implementation flaws
think for example of access controls
these are complex design heavy security
controls you don't want to do them from
the scratch or even a library to protect
against cross-site scripting is not the
simplest thing to do to these well so
the way to deal with this is to use
security frameworks and libraries that
have been already designed with security
embedded in and this is control number
line elaborate security frameworks and
libraries not only that this saves time
but you can also reduce the security
design flaws and implementation flaws
for example we can choose a framework
with well-designed access controls or
end CSRF protection we can bring a
library to protect against cross-site
scripting or an RM to prevent SQL
injection but there is a problem out
there at the moment the problem is that
there is a lot of software with
vulnerable libraries in fact in the case
of Java 88% of Java applications contain
at least one component with one
ability and looking further into it the
the main cause of this is the technical
debt and the way it has been implemented
in the beginning incorporated this
third-party components these external
libraries so let's consider the
following structure where we have our
own codes but now we bring a package
with the library that depends on another
library that depends on another library
and now we start implementing
functionality from this into our
software and we add that functionality
from the third-party component into
module then another module then another
module soon enough functionality from
third party components touches your
software into tens hundreds or even
thousands of points in the case of
course I scripting it can easily go into
thousands of this point and now
vulnerabilities report this am I not
being a primary library maybe not depend
on library so in the structure is very
difficult to understand first of all
what's the impact of that for ability in
that independent library and then what
are the best controls that we can put in
place okay so if we have agreed on the
controls then how long do you think is
going to take a developer to go through
hundreds or thousands of places to
change the code and how long is going to
take the tester to change all of that to
test all those all those changes in fact
I had a team with this type of structure
and it was a case of cross-site
scripting and the developer has
implemented all those changes into
hundreds of places and during the key a
they have discovered that the software
didn't work as expected it was a French
French Spanish website awaits special
diacritical characters and in certain
parts of the application those did not
work correctly in panic the developer
developer
back all the changes and they were back
to square one so the Queen so just by
bringing game libraries but not
incorporate them and not manage them
correctly the software is at risk of
being breached through vulnerable
components we have to bear in mind that
an attacker would not try to break into
the nicely develop software when they
can achieve the same thing with much
less effort by breaching into one of
these vulnerable components that have
been brought into the software and it's
important to understand that when we
refer to vulnerable components we
actually referred to those
vulnerabilities that are publicly
disclosed on national vulnerability
database available for everyone to see
understand enhanced and how to exploit
so this is the reason why these publicly
disclosed vulnerabilities are easy to
exploit and very easy to automate as
well so the question is when you bring
in this third-party libraries how can we
do it what is the best way to actually
implement this well I go start to answer
this question can be found in two robots
in Martinsburg clean code how many of
you have her read the book okay this is
what I expecting a few hands excellent
and what he says there is that by
wrapping the API you minimize your
dependencies and if you want to change
the library in the future this can be
done without much penalty so these are
some benefits from us of your design
point of view there are further benefits
from a security point of view we have to
understand that in the world of security
there is a continuous cat-and-mouse
chase between the developer and the
attackers the developer rights library
the attacker breaks it developer
fixes the attacker breaks it again so
it's important to be in a position where
we can operate these libraries easy and
in the case that library has become
obsolete it hasn't been maintained for
years then we can replace that memory
without much penalty
apart from these there are further
benefits by rubbing your API what you
actually do your document of what you
use and how you use it not only this but
you exposing to your software only the
functionality that you require and hide
and want to behave behavior in this way
you reduce your attack surface you just
live into the soft your software only
what you your software really needs if a
vulnerability is now reported in the
scenario then you have the wrapper that
documents of what is used and how is
used and this is the one place that
allows you to change your code and if
the implementation is done as
recommended in angles Bob clean code
book which it has a very nice chapter
between boundaries and if you also have
tests for the functionality expose into
the software then you can also quickly
check your changes and how those changes
affect your software now depending of
the complexity of the library that you
bring into your software there is a few
software design patterns that you can
consider if you are just using a simple
or library then you can use a simple
wrapper to expose in your software only
the functionality that you need and hide
unwanted behavior in this way you reduce
your attack surface if you need to
convert from the required interface to
the provided interface you use the
adapter and if you have a complex
subsystem then you can use the facade
design patterns that helps to simplify
the interaction between your software
and a complex subsystem now when it
comes to the number of these components
of for even a normal application not
even a large one it can easily go into
tens or hundreds of components within an
application especially in Java so to try
to monitor all of these components on a
manual basis it's impossible so the way
to deal with this is to automate compile
the checks for these components now you
can use commercial tools which are out
there but you can also use free tools
like ours dependency check how many of
you have checks for their components
external components quite a few ok so if
you can't afford the commercial tools
you can use the OS dependency check this
has support for dotnet and Java and how
it works it actually looks at the
libraries from maven and then searches
on the national vulnerability database
nvd to find out if there are any
vulnerabilities reported against those
components so when we leverage libraries
if we are to sum up then we should read
we should use those libraries from
trusted sources and when we bring them
into the software we should encapsulate
them exposing to the software only the
functionality required by the software
and hide unwanted behavior in this way
we reduce the attack surface it's also
important to regularly check them and
regularly upgrading or if they have
become obsolete
you should replace them which should be
done without much penalty and leveraging
security frameworks and libraries but
doing it in such a manner that the
software is safe and safe say stays safe
throughout his life can prevent all the
odds of the risks great and the last
control error an exception handling now
when it comes to us a good role term is
that all the errors and exceptional
handling should be
directed through a centralized routine
the air should be verbose enough to
explain the the user they ship but
should not give information about the
application as an analogy think of the
coordinates by themselves the
coordinates latitude and longitude have
no value but put them together and they
can pinpoint the exact location on earth
so the same is valid for the error
messages one error message by itself
might not mean much but one of the
things an attacker do is to poke around
the application and see the responses
the application it gives then aggregate
allows those messages and from that
aggregation of data extract information
about your software the business logic
within the software the environment
which services on which database is
behind so it's important that we don't
like information about our application
one way to deal with this is to give the
user an error code and then log into the
database the actual error message or if
you still need to display the user a
message then have all the messages
centralized into one place like a config
file or a database this will give you
the same bird's-eye view like an
attacker and helps you understand if you
disclose too much information about your
application and having employees will
design error messages that do not
disclose information about your
application or its environment can
prevent all the are certain risks
gray so let's go back to our website and
let's recap which are the controls that
can take developers on the path of
secure software so we can start with a
document like SBS that help us to
understand what was the appropriate
level of security for our own
applications from there
extract the requirements of
for that particular level and use those
requirements to generate the test cases
that can help us to verify for security
only and often we parameterize all the
queries but we bind the variables and
this can prevent injection most types we
can textually encode the output and this
prevents injection and cross-site
scripting and revalidate all the input
including the one from the database
which can prevent injection including
second-order SQL injection XML in
external entity in secured this
realization and cross-site scripting we
implement appropriate access controls
authentication and access controls we
protect the data both at rest and in
transit we implement logging in intro
and in conjunction with them well design
intrusion detection system to give the
software the mechanism to respond in
real-time to possible identified attacks
for complex security control we'll we
leverage security frameworks and
libraries but do it in such a manner
that we ensure that the software is safe
and stays safe throughout its life cycle
and we have in place well design our an
exceptional handling that does not
disclose information about the user the
application its environment its business
logic so what I like you to take away is
that using these controls can help you
to build a more secure application but
it's important to use them in a
consistent manner continuously we have
to remember that an attacker needs one
floor to bring down an entire system so
using those consistently throughout the
software is equally important as using
them in the first place now if you'd
like to know more about the project you
can have a look at the asp project
Paige for the or something proactive
controls and you can also find us on
Twitter thank you very much
do you have any questions yes please
well you would you in the case of Java
you G of bring them from maven then
there is a little less risk to actually
be corrupted I can't say it's a it can
be honnest ensure but in that case what
you have is the md5 of that component
and that is what actually the tools are
checking for owner ability so they are
checking against the hash for that
component that you get from maven if you
download that component from a website
then it you can't you don't know what
actually contains that component so you
are received you good to in the case of
Java use from repositories like maven
because that's what the tools are using
as well to check for vulnerabilities
against databases of vulnerabilities md5
is the signature of Allah its signature
of the file yeah any other questions
okay thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
