we are going to be or I guess not coming
in today we're going to be talking about
hacking usability and for me the most
important part in this talk is to make
sure that you learn a few things and you
will you want to look more into it okay
so my name is Miriam and a quick profile
I like anything that's octopus related I
think they're amazing I specialize in
digital marketing the technical parts
and whenever I'm angry I come and talk
to people about it which is why I'm here
today I want to talk about usability and
whenever I get started with anything
since I do digital marketing I'm like
most humans I'm gonna ask Google first
so I ask Google about usability and
Google is telling me that usability
started being sexy around 2010 or so
which I find absolutely amazing because
to me it's not like DevOps it's not like
angular it's a bit more ancient than
that so as a quick note this person is
the reason why I got started speaking in
Europe so now I'm trolling him every
chance I get I feel this picture is
illegally and I share them with people
the main point is you have to think
about your users needs as being part of
your product goals I mean it's really
good that the product works and that the
code is clean it's not going to explode
but there's other things you should
think about thinking about your users
needs and putting them first when you
build something means that you have
increased customer satisfaction and if
I'm a happy customer I'm going to let
others know about it and I'm going to
keep being your customer it also
increases loyalty I mean let's think
about all the Apple fanboys out there
they're very very loyal and the more
time people spend on your website or
your application usually correlates to
more money more money that you make so
this
not just for profit it's also to
reinvest in other features and you also
waste less resources and when I say
resources I mean time patience money
whatever else so now I'd like to talk
about pin cams I don't know if all of
you in the room know what tin cans are
I'm hoping that yes there's a thing that
usually get your sad dinner out of you
know you open it dump it put in the
microwave those tin cans and the problem
with tin cans is a usability problem why
because in 1795 the French directory so
a weird government decided that it
wanted to improve the military's food
supply because you know that year French
armies were being assholes that's
something we know how to do very well
full disclosure in French French forces
fought in Italy the Netherlands Germany
and the Caribbean I don't know how they
managed all this but apparently they had
food issues so they said you know what
we're gonna have a contest an inventor's
contest we will pay twelve thousand
frames to whomever will find a solution
to feed our army and it took 14 years to
invent a tin can and that guy got the
prize money what I find absolutely
amazing is that it took 14 years to
develop this and then an additional 30
years to develop the can opener I don't
know if you realize how bad that is
let me give you a quick reminder
soldiers have to open their tin cans
with their bayonets
this is what a bayonet looks like so for
me I want to you know explain usability
simply usability means having to be able
to use a product without stabbing it
open and it sounds very very simple but
somehow it's not and somehow we keep
failing at this and I don't understand
why you know from a theater theoretical
standpoint when I think about it in
practice however I do know why I know
why because usually use abilities
left two developers going to figure it
out
we know you're going to you're going to
do something great but how are you
supposed to be quick to face this so one
of the solutions is to do usability
testing and there is nothing more
heartbreaking than watching or a
recording or a live user basically not
be able to use the stuff you made it's
really really sad and the first stage is
telling the person you idiot just click
on the right and then you realize oh my
god we are wasting 5 minutes 10 minutes
15 minutes we still can't get it done
then you were wondering wait maybe it
was me maybe I didn't think this through
maybe I didn't think how it would be
used so there's this wonderful quote by
David Orr that says that usability
testing is the killing field of
cherished notions it's really true
whenever you test something you're like
oh I thought this was going to work in a
subsistent
so let's get back to basics why would
you want to test usability well because
at the end of it all the reason why we
code things is to make them useful we
want to video things that are useful and
what is useful well it's utility so does
it provide the features that I need as a
user and then usability which means how
easy and how pleasant is it to use can I
get the stuff done fast and efficiently
so with that in mind how do you look at
the core components of usability you
have learn ability how is it how easy is
it for me to accomplish what I came to
do which often times you will see poster
saying get done well that's
basically it how efficient is it am I
going to waste half a day to get my
stuff done how memorable is it so
memorable doesn't mean how hype how cool
no it's just once I learned how to do
this thing how easy is it to do it again
will I remember and last but not least
for me is error tolerance like you have
to cover these up error tolerance means
that you know that your users are going
to it up it's true it happens a lot
so you should make sure that I don't
commit a fatal error when I try to use
your product it should be error tolerant
and the really last one but that most
people tend to forget is hey does it
feel nice what I want to do it again or
is it pure torture kind of like paying
my taxes online in Canada it's you know
something that's important however
whenever I talk to death teams this is
what I hear most often the five core
components for me that I hear is but it
works yeah I understand it works I mean
you explained it to me for two weeks
everybody to help you on the project
understands it but nobody else so yeah
technicality works in really the other
problem is it's not a bug it's a feature
okay I know this was a joke once upon a
time now I'm just so tired of hearing it
industry standard but it's an industry
standard that's great
I don't care about your industries on
the customer I care about you solving my
problem
and that does not make me stupid that
makes me a customer it's not broken all
the unit tests pass yes and oh that's a
five-minute hot six yeah I've seen so
many five minute half sixes that are
piled on top of each other that in the
end if I want to use it I basically have
to hack your entire product which I've
seen happen okay it gets to a point
where if I have to change the URL go in
the code modify some from field in the
form to be able to pay something then
you're you're really really off there's
an error in your product so when it
comes to usability oftentimes you you
will see people go oh I'm not ready for
this or it's not my responsibility or I
think a team should do this and you know
what yeah you're right if you have a big
budget hire somebody hire an entire team
go for it but if you don't if you have a
start-up or if you are part of a team
that really needs usability testing and
nobody's willing to get started well
pick up the slack you can do it
when should you start at each step of
the design process and by design I don't
mean you know the make it beautiful part
really thinking about the product
developing the product planning it
testing it any moment you can bring in
usability testing what can you test well
here are a few possibilities for you the
old design that's something that drives
me nuts personally oh we don't need to
test this we're going to have a brand
new one yeah I can bet you good money
you're going to keep making the same
mistakes over and over again no matter
how fancy the technology is you can also
test the competitor's design believe it
or not one of the things that most
people tend to forget especially in
e-commerce when you have an internal
search engine that's something you
develop as an engineer and it can't be
stolen or copied that easily it's an
investment you make so testing the
competitors design and how it works it's
usually great spot to start especially
when people don't want you to test your
own product so you can come back and go
look they do it critical features
critical features can be features that
are critical for your company internally
or can be business features I mean if
you're selling me something and I can go
through the buying process if I use
PayPal for example that's a problem you
can also test features you're not sure
about like this happens often a
marketing person will come and go you
know what we should have this this is
super hot
great I'm not so sure we should invest
in this we can test it out have a little
MVP and then you know we can actually
kill this thing off it though if it
doesn't work so who should carry the
test now that we've seen what you can
test and oh sorry who should carry the
test we said anybody but where should
you carry them also so where it can be
in conference room I would not recommend
a broom closet because it's not
comfortable for your users and once
again that's a usability issue but if
you want you can also have virtual
testing meaning that the people don't
even have to be in your office it's very
easy to implement so going back to all
of this your solution is not just one
size fits all you should think about it
in terms of the
any the people within the company the
rolls the product figuring out what
works for you let's get into DIY testing
because if I talked about hacking it
means getting started somewhere and you
have different types of testing that are
available to you
you have formative testing so it's while
the product is in development so you can
fix the issues before it rolls out or
you have summative testing which is
after the product is finished to
validate if the product meets
requirements I don't know if you've
heard about the wonderful IOT juicer
debacle recently they basically spent
120 k 120 thousand dollars
developing this Internet of Things
juicer that nobody wants in their case I
would have recommended just you know
testing the market testing the product
during the development not at the end
while it's crashing and burning so once
again you know you do a DIY you do it
your style just figure out what works
for you and what makes sense there's a
good quote that I really really like
it's basically spend 10% of the design
on a design projects budget on usability
usually we'll bring you back a lot more
so this comes from the Nelson group
website you're really famous for
usability and I think that this
percentage may vary a lot depending on
the industry the company the product but
it still something to keep in mind
because once again you're making things
for people to be able to use or systems
to be able to use so if it's not user
friendly and can't be usable you have
issues why should you get started with
DIY usability testing well it integrates
into the development of a product at
very little cost so you're not going to
be spending a lot of money on this it
does not impact the development timeline
negatively okay so what this means is
it's not an excuse to go oh well if we
have to redevelop this or if we have to
iterate it it's going to be complicated
no it's not it's not if you do it
correctly it's not and it can be done
early and often that's really really
important because if you're developing
something
you're putting your sweat your tears
your time on doing this thing and it
doesn't work because the users don't
like it you're gonna have a hard time
pivoting away from it you're going to
have a hard time admitting to yourself
that it doesn't work because you spent
so much time you're already engaged
there's multiple ways you can test
usability and today we're going to be
mainly talking about the scripted tests
because they are the easiest
quote-unquote when you want to get
started it scripted test lets you
analyze the users interaction with
product based like set instructions
you're basically asking people to do
stuff on your website seems pretty
straightforward it's not at least as
easy as it seems we're going to look
into it but there's other types of
testing that you shouldn't ignore for
example you have decontextualized
testing and that's great when you want
to validate well the people who are
going to be buying your thing are they
interested what are the personas what
are their habits would they be
interested you know so you can do this
with user interviews surveys card
sorting all that type of UX stuff you
also have natural testing so this is
think of it more of a a be testing
first-click testing better testing so
you have different things available to
you different tools and if closer to
analytics than anything else
but it helps you figure out how people
are doing things on your website not
necessarily why but how and then you
have hybrid testing which is you know a
mix of everything and it's pretty high
voltage I would not recommend you get
started right away with this so let's
start with a framework there's plenty of
different frameworks available to you
when you want to get started testing I
have to pick one I wanted to pick one
that would make sense to the people I'm
talking to so we're going with something
that involves number one you figure out
your hypothesis where do you think
there's a problem where do you think you
could improve where do you think you're
going to actually do really good
identify your goals okay what do you
want to do what do you want to test then
you develop a user script which is you
know the test itself and then and this
one a lot of people forget because it
doesn't feel super natural
you have to ask for a verbal reaction
because when people think out loud
you're going to learn a lot of things
about how they think and why they're
doing what they're doing on your website
and the last part is compiler results
and do a short recap compile them to
know what is the priority
what do you ignore for now what is you
know really really urgent and what do
you plan on testing further seems pretty
straightforward except that a lot of
people forgot a few steps along the way
budget what's your budget for this
figuring out how much money you have
because all these tools are not created
equal they don't cost the same amount if
you want to have a friend of mine is
specialized in this and she has up to 50
people wearing huge helmets and she test
their emotions and how they navigate on
the website that's a hundred caper tests
for her I could never afford to do that
but doesn't mean I don't do usability I
have some friends they have the weird
glasses and they send people in stores
to do usability testing on the shelves
of supermarkets I mean it can get pretty
pretty deep and intense so figure out
what your budget is figure out who your
users are oftentimes you may not notice
it but it's one of the pitfalls the
people that you are going to use as
users may not represent the ones that
will be using your product in the end
and that's not necessarily a good thing
why because you may have situations
where you will say go with a product
that's online you want to do remote
testing what you don't realize is that
the people that do the remote testing
they became professional users kind of
like professional gamers that make a
living off of it well these are
professional users they are getting paid
to test things so they are have already
hacked usability they know how to make
you happy they know what parts they
should test but they're not necessarily
the best people for you to test so if
you're going to choose these solutions
think about who is my user is it a
segment of users that are already and
better yet do I want to have specific
people by demographics do I want people
by age do I want people by language
because you may not realize that the
language plays a huge part I'm French
but I live in French Canada if I'm going
to develop a prod
for the French Canadian market I'm not
testing with French people not the same
kind of people not the same habits so
don't make those mistakes you also
should think about ok tools but do I
want to carry it out in house and then
do I want to have people looking into it
how do I set this up do I want to do
this remotely because it's easier for me
and then if I do this remotely um the
person in charge are they aware that it
may take up to a week to get feedback
are they aware that may take up to an
hour
do I want webcam recordings what do I
want look at all of these specificities
to decide so officially step one we're
in it hypothesis you can choose to rely
on data to create a hypothesis and not
in that case I would recommend thinking
about maybe google analytics heatmaps
a be testing anything that you have
access to and if within your company
you're in charge of usability testing or
you start doing it and people don't want
to give you access to data something's
wrong okay you deserve to have access to
data to understand what people are doing
on your website then you should figure
out what's working well define what you
think is bringing in money or bringing
in users or bringing an engagement
define what isn't working well and
specify the improvements that could be
made so you already have your hypothesis
in mind what you're going to test then
you move on to your goals business cat
really knows the goals though so you
should identify where people get stuck
try to pinpoint the objectives that you
want your user test to accomplish for
example I want users to be able to
reserve a train ticket which apparently
the doors ban didn't really want me to
do for example I had to reserve a train
ticket from France to Germany via the
Austrian lines their website was way
better I could actually just reserve my
thing which is a fail for two websites
on the third one that has nothing to do
with it actually tasks you should also
clearly establish the goal of the
testing what are the main features that
require feedback and this is a bit
tricky because you're going to find
yourself having a huge Christmas
and that's great like you should keep in
mind the more objectives you want to
test at once the more room for error and
misinterpretation so take it small make
the right decisions and remember it's
iterative so you can test at any time
and keep testing then you move on to
developing your user script okay so what
are the actionable tasks that you want
your users to complete and before we
look at the tasks you should know that a
script should include a short background
about the website I mean if I'm going to
be testing something I'm a human being
give me the context it's something that
drives me insane just test this I'm like
why and nobody will tell me why what it
is what it's supposed to do and you
should be very very careful about how
you phrase it because often times I see
that companies love talking about
themselves to themselves so if you're
going to come at me with a lot of
acronyms I'm not going to understand
what's happening if you're going to
describe your ideal product to somebody
who's supposed to use it but doesn't
know all of this it's going to create
confusion so be careful you should also
have questions about the testers so if
these people are wondering who the
tester is what they're supposed to do in
the room what's going on it should be
implemented in there and then you move
on to five to ten specific tasks I
included a link to a stereotypical like
a really generic user testing script you
can steal it whatever you want with it
it's really nice and the one thing that
is not in my slide that you should know
about the script the one sentence you
should always find a way to put in there
is remember we're testing the website
we're not testing you because at its
core humans want to please and most
people will try to actually give you
what you're expecting they want to make
you happy so they're going to behave
very differently than they would if they
were by themselves trying to actually do
the same so always put them at ease and
make it very very clear that you really
want your product to work and that they
cannot hurt your feelings okay because
otherwise I've seen a few tests where
the people are really really trying to
help
the startup and it was like it's not
working we need to go remote so I tell
you that you should include five to ten
tasks in your test but how do you pick
the tasks well there's three steps you
need to decide what tasks you would want
so you know for example reserved a plane
ticket on a website then you have to
formulate them and the formulation is
very tricky and we'll look at that
the way you use words will impact how
people perceive the task okay and then
you have to be careful about their order
it has to be logical you can't ask them
to pay for the ticket when they haven't
chosen the destination yet for example
so what tasks can you get started what
can inspire you tasks that are important
to your team or the company at large
tasks where you predict that the user is
going to have a hard time like you know
this is not perfect but it's the best
you can do test it out tasks that
influence the business goals if I can't
pay on your website that's a problem if
I can't actually fill in the information
for you to contact me again that's still
a problem
tasks that target redesigned areas so
you're really proud of the brand new
thing that you've done they'll test it
out or tasks that target newly added
features not the same thing as design
it's really trying to figure out if the
new features are adding value to your
product and you have different types of
tasks you have quantitative and you have
qualitative quantitative is a closed
task it's a yes or no pass or fail can
you do this or not
open is more of a sandbox so you could
ask them hey you're trying to look for a
good curry recipe that is low in
calories for example that's not a yes or
no I mean for them maybe a low calorie
curry is like 3000 calories so you know
you will have qualitative results Engle
I thought that you know they were die
conscious and turns out they're not so
think about this when you design it you
should include both like I said
everything presented to users during a
test impact healthy response
and a clear example of this is in a task
that was designed in 2002 they found
that Bollywood style scenarios so not
instructions for a robot really brought
out a lot more emotional response and
you would get a lot more feedback so
this one if we read it it's you're young
you're innocent and young sister is
going to get married this Saturday and
you just got news the prospective groom
is already married and then you are
asked you know booked a flight as soon
as possible to find your sister and
safer okay I know it's dramatic I know
it's hilarious but at the same time I
kind of feel pressure to save my sister
I kind of want to get her the plane
ticket right what's the same thing with
your desk if you're saying you know
purchase a plane ticket on this website
it doesn't have the same emotional
appeal as this so another thing that you
have to go to Bollywood route but if you
can provide context or emotion it will
probably work and and I have a very very
good example of this the unicorn here
actually has a lot of feedback on his
talks because emotional strings you can
you know have problems in your code and
it's okay you're a unicorn so how do you
articulate these facts because now that
we're talking about emotions we're
talking about words we're talking about
how important it is then you have to
figure out you know hey am I doing this
thing that everybody else does which is
including cues in my questions to get an
answer I think a lot of people are
specialized in this by asking hey you
don't mind eating Indian tonight do you
well the cue is no you don't mind so be
very very careful when you do this
because you will influence people be
realistic and then avoid ambiguity if I
can't understand what's going on or if
you know you're asking me to reserve a
once again I'm sticking with a plane
ticket
you're asking me to reserve a plane
ticket with three stopovers and that go
into a country I'm not supposed to go to
that is actually not getting me anywhere
close just because you want to test your
feature of multiple segments of flights
I'm
to understand as a user I'm going to be
very confused because that's not the
stuff I would normally do so be very
careful about you keep it real live
scenario oriented and you'll be good
ensure that you have an appropriate
amount of details so when I say this I
mean this both ways you can have too
much details and then I'm drowning and
I'm confused or you have so little that
I'm like where do I go that's not good
enough so trying to figure it out you
know write it write it again have other
people read it tasks should be designed
to be independent from each other I know
this sounds normal but most people don't
realize that if you're using you the
implicit cues then people are going to
think there is a specific order but
technically they should be able to
accomplish all of this on the website
without jumping through hoops so be very
careful about that except except when
you have scenarios of the user has to go
back and forth the user has to log in
and log out those tasks kind of make
sense to be tied together if you need me
to access something that's you know in
the logged in portion you should have a
task right before it that requires me to
again is pure logic and how do you ask
for feedback verbal feedback not just
you know recording people doing things
it can get a bit tricky it can get very
very tricky because it doesn't feel
natural to basically try to get into
people's heads so what do you ask is
this what you expected to see or you
could ask would you recommend this
website to other people why or why not
that's called a Net Promoter Score you
get an idea of people you know if they
like it or they really really don't for
some reason asking non-leading questions
should also help you know just like oh
hey r did you get everything done were
you expecting this or oh how do you like
using this app and once it's over just
ask them and I know this is a very
dramatic way of asking it once again but
if they had the opportunity of redoing
anything on the website like there was
just a magic wand and poof it's the
perfect app for them what would it be
you're learning for a few things
congratulations a null technicality at
this point you are done with the test
the problem is of the test does not end
when the user stops testing you need to
compile your results you need to compile
as much information as you can as many
details so you don't forget it
do not be vague don't just go you know
hey they probably didn't like the flow
the flow of what and where and when
so explain if it's a navigation issue if
it's the layout that's confusing on this
page that page whatever else then you
can prioritize your issues and usually
this is done as part of a team so you
just write everything out in little
post-its and then you prioritize and
then you include recommendations like I
recommend that this be taken care of by
doing this or doing that so this gives
you a clear roadmap of hey we should be
taking care of this in the next cycle
and this usually is a little bit
confusing at first but I promise that if
you put all your post-its on a map that
goes high priority low priority medium
whatever else or however you want to
organize it and then you hang this by
the coffee machine or by the water
cooler people within the company will
give you their advice as well like you
will get a lot of feedback because it
looks really interesting and it's great
that I talked to you about all this but
what about remote testing what about
okay I can't afford to have people come
into my company and test it out well you
can choose to go the remote route but
things don't necessarily play out the
same way what do I mean by that well you
need to define your hypothesis as we
said previously you need to choose the
right participants
the finder questionnaires review your
test and configure your testing tools so
you'll notice that there's number four
and number six they are a bit different
from the framework I proposed and this
is really adapted to what's going on in
terms of remote testing you basically
have an illustration for this
and if we go through it you figure out
your objectives the same way however the
users are a bit tricky like I said how
do you figure out your ideal users well
that's something that you should do
before you pick your tool and you really
need to think about it because you can't
make the mistake for example of choosing
super users what are super users well
they're the users that absolutely love
your brand your product your whatever
and whatever you throw out them they'll
figure it out because humans have this
tendency of thinking that if something
doesn't work they're stupid
and it's their fault and it's not so you
would get a biased view of your product
if you choose you know the type top five
percentage of people that are already
signed up spend money on your product
are advocating it it doesn't reflect the
generic user that you're going to have
so be very very careful about this
because most platforms won't tell you
how they recruit users need you would
get an idea of who you get but not
exactly if they fit for you so there's
that point and as you can see number
four defined questionnaires
it's this think out loud portion you
can't necessarily be in contact with
your users so you can't necessarily ask
them these questions with your voice so
you have an opportunity there's three
times when you do remote testing you
have an opportunity to ask at the
beginning a questionnaire you have the
opportunity to ask after they've
completed each task how the task was and
to get feedback and you have an
opportunity at the end of the test so
use these wisely develop like spend a
little more time and develop
questionnaires to really get the most
feedback you can from your users and
then you figure out your scenarios and
you set up your tool setting of the tool
can also be bit tricky does it integrate
with something that you need does it
work with the platform that you want to
test or is it in the right language like
I said this is often a problem there's
an additional problem that's a bit
unusual for example in some countries
testing for accessibility so usability
for people that are disabled in some
manner is not necessarily that easy
right
and seems like you could cost a lot of
money because then you have to bring in
the drug in a blind person to test it
out in your office that's not the case
once again you have to get creative in
how you recruit your users but it's
super important to make sure that you
have the right people otherwise it's
going to be problematic so here are a
few things that you should consider and
yes I love really strange images because
usually that's how I feel when people
tell me always choosing this tool
because it was really nice and I liked
them marketing and I'm like but it
doesn't work it just doesn't make sense
a prime example for me for example is
you have a very simple website and then
you're like you know what I'm going to
do this in angular 2 because it's cool
like but it doesn't work for this client
why did you do it oh it seemed like a
good idea at the time for me yeah for
you after you're hired
same thing for your usability testing
you will have a lot of you know
companies I'll go oh I'm super cool and
I do this and I do that and we have this
great brand and we optimize this and we
got plus 100% usability on this and
you're like does this fit my market no
are you going to take forever to get
back to me with the test maybe oh do you
provide video recordings oh no you don't
okay so you know you really need to sit
down figure out what you need what you
would expect your test to be like and
figure as they fit the criteria so the
criteria for example for me I should be
able to add participants I'm not saying
that I should be the only input in
participants if you have a pool shared
with me great but if I want to upload a
list of users that I want to set up a
test for let me do it give me
flexibility same thing goes for the task
choice there are some tools that aim to
be so useful that it will provide you
with all the tasks even if they don't
make sense for your products once again
so be very careful about tools that tell
you we'll take care of everything will
automate it no don't let them do that
pick tools where you can upload your
tasks and ask them in the proper
language that you want this goes back to
my Canadian french-canadian thing if
your task is entirely in French
and I can't tweak it that's going to be
a problem because half of my audience is
not going to understand what I want them
to do because I don't use the same words
same for speed
when I am in speed it's not even you
know the platform itself how fast does
it load know how fast you get back to me
if you take one week or two weeks to
provide me with my data that's
problematic for me personally if you
feel like waiting for a week go for it
till I don't mind but me I want these
things a few hours later so think about
you know dig in and figure out how long
it takes and then you also have price
you have device support and advanced
feedback options advanced feedback
options you want you know webcam
recordings you want to sound with this
device do you want laptop do you want
mobile hey you know what maybe we're
going to have VR testing soon so you
know figure out if they're enabled so
ask all of these questions before you
make your choice and last but not least
tools for you to use so you will have a
user testing script here I'm not saying
that it should be used as is but you can
check it out download it tweak it to
your needs so that it makes sense to
your users you also have a user research
plan one pager it's literally one pager
you want to get started here it is guys
there is a usability testing kit also
that I've included if you don't know how
to figure this out you know by going on
an adventure and you need a real kit how
to figure out every little piece it's
there as well and if you want the
ultimate guide to usability testing or
you know has been advertised that it's
actually really really good go for that
there's a few services out there so I'm
not saying that you should be using
these or not which is why you have a
link that says need more tools there's a
huge comparison chart but there's a few
that I like personally so you have hot
jar why do I like hot jar because well
personally I use Google tag manager I
can implement this stuff really fast it
has a lot of features that I like and it
makes sense to me great and their team
is really like improving a lot of stuff
you have eyes decide you have user Bob
that I included here because I think
their name is hilarious and they
actually did reach out to me for some
tests there's user testing calm not the
most creative name but it gets at home
you have try my UI you have five second
tests you have one that I haven't
included here because it doesn't make
sense when I talk about you know hacking
usability but there's a usability so
this is actually a very nice company the
I used to include them in this list but
now they take on big clients so if you
are part of what they would consider a
big corporate client go for it they are
very reactive team and they really
really pinpoint problems and they help
people improve I should know this
because as a user I dealt with some
platforms I won't name and usability I
have them as a client and I see a
definite improvement I mean I don't want
to rip out my hair when I go on that
website which is so much better after a
good fifteen years of suffering so yes
they they have different tools figuring
out what works for you they have mobile
specific tools as well whatever your
thing is there's probably a tool out
there for it you just need to look into
it thank you very much for hanging on
with me I finished a bit early so if you
have a few questions let me know
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
