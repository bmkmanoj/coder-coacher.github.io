who's speaking this afternoon about
curing microservers and it's a practical
example using game on which we spoke to
you Adam about earlier so you written a
book about the best practices for most
conservative and we also threw the Box
Q&amp;amp;A so you can have a look at the
website on some of the basics but what
is the changing landscape threat so
unstressed decently a bit different I
want you to ask you whether you think
that with the change from monoliths to
microsoft and everything that comes with
it including looking at security and
authentication whether you think we've
done enough to shift our thinking as
developers towards developing in a
microscope is mine sir that's a very
interesting question no one's ever asked
me at four and I think that in some ways
no there's still lots to change that
needs happen in terms of that shifting
mindset and pop the reasons that is I
know that I know people who've been
potentially building microservices but
are still kind of leaving the devil so
I'd maybe a little bit later or kind of
still almost having a silo approach
maybe to Mike receivers and I think it's
just it's something that's difficult to
kind of change and your mindset because
we've been so used to the environment
where you know we have 11 people kind of
writing code and then another sets of
testing in and then ever say who deal
with that okay we can add the security
on and we can build in the
infrastructure and we're suddenly not
just in an environment where a single
team has to worry about all these things
but they have to be able to implement
them and really be responsible for the
whole life cycle and I think a lot of
that comes not just from changing your
thinking but also the way teams are set
up so it might be to begin with we
actually need to have a team that has
like someone who knows about develops
and someone who knows about testing a
someone who knows about development and
then gradually with the team kind of
evolves over time and then he builds up
the skills so for example I know and how
it in when we were creating game on we
had one or two people who were really
kind of audit with
I more like you know we need to test
homeless start every time every time we
put code in like you need to get tested
and maybe too given with other people in
the team myself included would forget
about texting or forget about security
but then now because we will work
together for it a year two years now
we're now getting into that mindset of
okay I've written some code I need to
test it I've written some new endpoint
how am I going to secure it so I think
there is that kind of evolution and I
think we're doing kind of right things
to go along that but I think it is going
to take time for this kind of adaption
and get the heads around it and really
start thinking about security and
testing communication prefer that they
might have had to cope in the past to my
black and her later that's really
interesting point because certain
someone earlier about how and he's it
endeavor but now would you my service
continuous delivery there's a lot of
pressure on developers to be doing the
arts and the testing eventually that
because sometimes just leave a lot of
the expertise it's already available
outside of the team yeah yeah I
definitely think it needs to be
something that's not just developers
pushing forward and learning all these
key skills they need to be something
that the whole team is involved with and
if there are people with existing skills
and you can use their skills and bring
them forward and then even maybe have
some people who which additionally doing
and more DevOps role understand more of
you know what code has been delivered
and kind of yet bring everyone forward
together crawl of them being from one
side with the other side being like oh
hang on a sec we were doing this before
and now you're doing it but you're not
doing it with the expertise level that
we already have so yeah using those
skills if you have really just before
they say yeah I've definitely been
unclean prefer where we haven't had
texture like you don't need a tester
think actually only test the code i
think i right most of the time yeah i
said i think from the testing site is
interesting so I was definitely I would
count myself as a software engineer
rather than that software developers I
said you I would generally do like
test-driven development and write my
test first but as you say if you have
come from an environment where you were
just develop and you didn't do as much
testing then
might be you need to bring someone in to
let me grow the skills before you can
then say okay yeah I'm happy now and I
can go ahead and show you this girl for
so it really is it quite big i
guess in a lot of ways organizationally
wise as well as the kind of technology
changes they're coming along yes now
when you test your micro services do you
get outside groups and do say for
example penetration testing as well as
maybe unit testing that the
authentication software works or
libraries so to gain more specifically
we haven't done any of this just because
it's kind of a learning environment we
have quite got to that level where we've
looked at this specifically but I think
it is important to do a range of
different testing and kind of when you
are building micra service if different
teams are owning different services you
should be doing testing kind of in an
isolated unit we all little micro
servers over here and then you need to
do key testing at the next level up
where you will kind of put everything in
a staging environment and test it and
then also the level above in production
doing some tests there i think is
important even just within your own team
but also i guess bringing in people who
have expertise is always a good idea but
for example we're using a technology
called amalgamate to our service
discovery just because it allows us to
inject by data requests and we can see
how the system is handling it lies which
something that's really powerful and
something you maybe haven't had to
consider before just because everything
was in one place you could test it all
in one place now that it's more
distributed and things might come and go
you really need to at some point to an
end to end test but it might be later in
the cycle than you previously we doing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
