hello Leon hey did we turn Ollie off
again one two one two
can hear so the back oh yeah awesome
cool everyone welcome to the Java
Council what are we missing today oh
yeah I know what we're running on
Belgian time unfortunately so on this
way so welcome to the Java Council beer
will be coming today we have myself
Simon maple Martin Verburg hello and OLX
life if you wanted to follow us that's
my twitter handle
Martines do you know yeah 500 followers
above me yes so there's my Titans
Twitter handle you feel free to follow
that so make sure you follow at least
one of these people but in reality yeah
Karianna and live people by the way
complain about the earlier rap music
that was being played today yeah a few
people complained so only our league is
actually the artist responsible no I
don't speak French it wasn't me
I'm gonna hear a piece now okay so yes
very good time sponsored by the rejects
everyone yeah please say cheers
when it comes to the V jug and the first
people we want to really say cheers to
is Trisha and Ezra who Trisha obviously
is normally here amongst us but
fortunately she is at home with her
lovely new daughter Amy so a big cheers
with yes please please let's flood her
timeline everyone get their phones out
and just tweet variously everyone get
their phones out and please tweet at
Trisha underscore G and at Israel chaos
vibrations or other nice things their
lives really will be chaos
yeah fit for the lovely two daughters
now Trisha are always trying to push
diversity in Java and she's doing it one
child so odd cast who here listens to
our most awesome we
Clee monthly whatever the timeframe is
because we never remember a podcast yeah
you're all just here for the bear
sucks to be you did we actually put the
URL for where the podcast it's actually
right at the bottom left Java Council
calm
so please please do if you want a your
weekly monthly dose of chaos mayhem and
somewhat opinionated opinions on what's
happening in the world of Java then Java
council calm as a place to go can ask a
follow-up question since we're talking
about this low participation
who here is a member of virtual jack
itself so the podcast is like 20% of the
virtual drug members interesting eyeball
can you put your beers back if you're
not part the virtual joke so we're going
to start with an interesting report that
we that we've done people here who's
heard of rebel apps yeah loads were
people okay we're going to talk about
productivity report I'm gonna go through
some of the numbers we used to do this
as a as a light talk but this time just
can do it as a discussion and and we can
all together rants at different
technologies as one if we do annoy or
insult technologies we're just joking
so I miss hibernate yeah and then that's
deadly serious so so yeah whoo whoo the
respondents to this survey well actually
it's not quite a survey first we have
2,000 people over 2,000 people who sow
this survey in fact this was actually
done and written by you right yeah yes
so we tried to reach out to anyone who
would listen mostly we reach out
obviously people who follow us or close
to us on the social networks or email
lists or the virtual junk number list
but we try to honestly reach everyone
for a couple of months so when I'm gonna
do this next year if you see that please
support the survey and sure it forward
it does come with a bit of a bit of a
health warning there is no resemblance
to the survey being any sort of
statistically significant or rigorously
scientifically run right so who are the
respondents well we have 54% software
developers 18% architects some team
leads tips any managers here yeah a
couple you represented whoops well I
don't get as the 18% Arctic's I mean
this is
really really taking the idea of Java
being over engineers yeah that's true
extreme wait we need a single arctic per
five developers apparently in Java well
okay so management some reason our
design team has represented you here in
this groin area
I don't know what that is probably
convey some kind of coincidence again
like I would Barrett goes there on the
and the c-level existing the path so by
team yeah people have around three to
three to nine people typically you're
looking at enterprise companies
mid-sized companies few small one
percent out of work shame
comparing our this is an interesting one
actually comparing IDs who uses Eclipse
who uses IntelliJ Wow who uses the third
most popular vai so who uses Emacs let's
not go there who uses NetBeans a fair
representation of what we've got here
yeah specially free mix so yeah it
doesn't look like it's a fluke I mean
yeah we talk about bias you know this is
this is done by the community what by
zero turnaround sorry
and we try and get as many community
participants but obviously zero
turnaround sell tools as do JetBrains
yep so there could be some ice here so I
expect eclipse and jetbrains are
publicly so but when you look at this
room it's actually fairly representative
of this thing interesting so I see where
it goes Java 8 looks pretty good there
this was obviously done a few few months
ago so Java 9 obviously would probably
be dominating by now but it's Jets Java
8 just sorry for the rest of you yeah
it's no beer for the audience carry on
so event time to see where Java 9 goes
next year on this on this particular one
every if it has the same rapid adoption
as 8 or a slightly slower adoption
that's it and it moves to be honest
there will be a couple of the inversions
because the report will probably go out
at least in summer so ok we are looking
at Java 10 maybe yeah or 18 point no
something no longer 18 point something
well the new proposals going back to 10
point something we think
we'll see very shortly we may have the
Arctic region that's also said to be him
earlier spring versus EE wise not really
versus is it spring uses EE as well as
other things so yeah
46% spring users who uses spring it why
you got the spring talk free beer
amazing what betters who uses EE any
kind of EE technology servlets he's a
servlets jpe now this year we asked some
of the questions of which IDs are like
eclipses 7.5 intellij 8.7 netbeans wins
8.8 a space there's gotta be a reason
you're using it right exactly a
centering how these least used one of
the most ya devout following if the most
love languages who's used Kotlin before
keep your hand up if you use it an anger
for production hard that's not to be had
to if you work for jet prints java 7 at
the bottom the parlor but Java 8 doom
doing pretty well just behind SCADA any
Scotty users alright and I mean users
like it's an addiction but Scala uses so
now this is really interesting so I
think three years ago and we did a
similar kind of survey I mean at least
half of the audience were like yeah it's
all that Scala and now the truth of
Scala has come back home to bite there's
only three of you left
here's a question about groovy who is
using groovy if for Java right before
Java right who is using greeby today
more more that's weird because your
theory yeah that guy's okay spring
pretty much 8.2 in the ranking
Java EE 8 reactive doing pretty well in
the twin custom in-house monstrosity at
5.20 that was badly met except badly for
late question if someone says they're
using a custom in-house monstrosity
that's unlikely to go quite high isn't
it so let's talk about naming names hard
make this work who here has heard of the
upcoming shift of Java EE to be fully
open
or spics our eyes TCK as a whole
swinging match to eclipse right so for
the other half the audience who hasn't
heard of this this is fantastic news to
the industry and so we now have this
wonderful Twitter handle Eclipse Eclipse
enterprise for j4j but in all
seriousness this is just started as a
community over in Eclipse is there about
500 members actively on the mailing list
and if you want to have a say in the
direction at Java EE technologies is
going as an more cloud friendly more
reactive more mark service jump in there
so this is what an enterprise logging
framework was yeah okay right so news
for Jennifer Jason yeah okay let's talk
about why people use their IDs so
interestingly IntelliJ IDEA and NetBeans
IDE all are both are very largely on
functionality people believe NetBeans of
superior people believe IntelliJ IDEA is
superior let's just love Eclipse so
people would just use it because they
used to it yeah change or the company
tells them to use it or budget that's a
fair reason actually well if your
product or is it there is no reason to
change for the sake of changer yeah I'm
also productive of maven yeah it's a
superior butyl why people use their
programming languages so Kotlin groovy
Scala a hundred percent functionality
JavaScript 100% ecosystem mmm
interesting I guess that is growing
literally daily yeah Java 8
functionality ecosystem team skills Java
7 not a single person said functionality
that's interesting
oh well now I love this one I love this
one the next one 51 percent of people
say that they are reluctant to change
their ID because it's a fixed project or
company requirement let's move to the
next one though only 45 percent of
people stack because it's a fixed
company requirement so the company
requirements it's a higher company
requirement to change your to keep with
your IDE
then your stock Howard's that mean let
me let me elaborate so this question but
why wouldn't you change your fuel for
something different was asked only from
people who would rate their satisfaction
about the till usage five or fewer less
it's only unhappy people who were asked
about those if you were satisfied fully
with your IDE or with your application
stack there is no reason to change Tosa
scientific there we go it is alright no
one agrees on DevOps no one really knows
what it means
17% think they are the DevOps 14% have a
DevOps engineer I thought that was only
a LinkedIn thing 17% don't even have to
have up 6% don't care they like a wall
where it is like the ones who don't even
have opps yeah yeah we don't deploy our
software yeah yeah 7 don't even have ups
they just develop iris libraries
libraries Leo files
central you know your software's perfect
if there are no users ever just does it
differently when do people do
performance as we all care about
performance it cares about performance
this is where you all raise your hand
yeah how can you pay everyone cares
about performance so yeah most people
react to user complaints some people
catch regressions some people monitor
deployments this is is this a hundred
percent yeah looks like the circles fall
yeah this is an interesting one gonna
take this one I like because you know
you quite like this activity oh yeah
this was the question was where do you
think the biggest product game lie so
people love to you flame worried about
their IDs right and compare who is
better people like to blame their build
tools and so on because well that's what
he probably kind of hate or get annoyed
by the most but when we ask the
questions among all the tools that we
asked about IDE applications
infrastructure architecture DevOps and
so on where the biggest productivity
boost lies and almost what
1/4 1/3 almost 1/3 said the project
architecture is what prevents them from
being really productive I guess those
are the people who didn't move to micro
sources yet and didn't cover other
problems but you're expected to be ID
most people
always say my IDs not making me
productive I guess so or maybe a
programming language yeah I mean if only
7% of people say that they're the
programming language is the thing to
change to be more productive then well
call those contents and there's a super
confident 8% isn't there I'm good I'm a
rockstar ninja yeah do percent
management do percent directors yeah
developer advocates so I see what
everyone's from in the audience we've
talked a little bit too much now who's
from North America whoa there's no me
the loud ones come on who's from North
America whoop who's from Europe there we
go who's from the UK excluding Scotland
who's from South America oh yes he's
from Asia Australia Australia Africa
okay citizen so who's from Belgium
grumpy bastard
Belgium is the lowest country as the
country that gave the lowest answers to
hurt how happy they are with their
current technology choices with an
average rating of 6.9% that wasn't done
because we're going to DevOps that was
this is pure statistical fact yes I put
eight out of ten South Korea and yes so
that's what what are you coding about
real sore during XML web services or
something like what is going on
Oh SGI on websphere usually ants you
know Oracle's made the braid brave move
of finally getting rid of corner but I
have a sneaking suspicion Belgium still
on it yeah it's not good I'll take a bit
yes
Oh who's stoner sorry whose story you're
asking us who still needs a beer anyone
want a beer or anyone want another beer
Qi people very fun case so this is
exciting this is exciting
exciting tech in 2017 Thank You Kirk
exciting tech in 2017 this was actually
an open answer open yeah it was an open
question and the question was firmly to
her that what is the technology that you
were excited and proud of working in
2017 or looking really forward working
with in 2018 because the next report
will come out next year so it's a quite
a large time span and very open question
like what excites you in technology boom
yeah : top well done JetBrains yeah
doctor number 2 did anyone say
kubernetes is right it will be is saying
Cuban is this is this actually was a
little bit surprising me people are
actually well quite rightfully very
excited about Java 9 so there was a sort
of misconception out in the tech media
especially their Java and I is just an
infrastructure release and it's just
about jigsaw and modules and only people
have build in libraries and frameworks
really excited but according to the
audience the other features so it's
pretty cool shout out anything other
people are interested in gone oh it's a
bit surprised there's no virtual reality
in here or machine I see machine
learning a oh yeah all the other
buzzwords and on here profile thank you
you do you work for IBM red ha okay
anything else look Jane blockchain
vulture yeah see enterprise developers
okay
Bill James well ultimately if there's
multiple options and you get two
developers as long as there's Google
people never agree with with which ones
better so that's why we have such a good
split okay so which Java versions
everyone working on right now let's go
Java development or production or that's
great development development versions
of Java using in development let's start
with Java version Mark mark always loves
this
Mark's net gets gets any real stress
when Mark turns into an owl right Java
let's go for watch we start with mark
1.1 let's now let's go one point for one
point we are one point for good answer
this is the first year we've had no one
on one point for yes person at the back
1.44 Jagger could we get some more beers
up there yeah
one point five once it's not why was
that beer doing a beer or 1.54 here what
maybe a bit of each bad be here one
point six you we mean six we were only a
tiny handful this is good news
seven okay seven eight
Wow mark you have been mark you and
Brian you were very successful well done
there's nine men hasn't seen develop
18.3 ten well there is an EI build right
now anyone on ten and went down low to
ten one person right the bat is that
true or do a beer that it's true yeah I
have something so job Java 8 completely
winning so this is this is jharvard
option in our report so what do we have
here
Java 8 let's start from let's list
really only talk about Java in Java 7
here Java 8 2014 so let's go here on
seven percent in 2014
going up to 62 percent 2016 a year ago
and I think that was what 80 something
percent in 2017 you have Java 7 this
blue line 2012 going up to 65 and then
dropping down to 28 let's let's when we
predict job and 9 Java 10 because you
have a 9 and 10 on LTS releases anyone
not know that awesome who thinks they're
gonna be using Java 9 in for their main
development Java or production in the
next 6 months not terrible next 12
months
what cuz you would be on 10 12 yes true
you'll be on T okay who wants var
who is who is waiting for version
version 11 in September 2018 before they
make an upgrade that's the next LTS
release there's a lot of undecided I
feel undecided interesting so those of
you who don't know what does anyone not
know what LTS means no good okay so
let's carry on that chess we have a big
milestone so let's invite the the
Duchesse jug people up on stage please
give a round of applause so please
introduce yourself we have Regina we
have Linda please introduce yourself
okay hi my name is Linda Paul I'm from
the Netherlands and about 10 years ago I
saw that there were more and more women
out there and was very shy and I decided
okay I want to meet all these women and
I started dutchess so I would have to go
out and talk to them and then we decided
well it's nice that we have a support
group for each other now but let's see
if we can also get more women into IT
and also support more women get them to
become speakers and it's also - and when
was the ten-year anniversary was it
somewhere this month well it must have
been an amazing opening party when you
saw someone in November listen if you
know when masters of Java was 10 years
ago then that's ok then right ok so how
do you structure the organization you
have what I understand you have Dutch SJ
Duchess or Duchess meetings or groups
all over the world right there's not
there's not one big Duchess group it's
an umbrella where you have lots of
different meetups right yeah I had the
idea and in the beginning I even wanted
to put a tea in the name to be a pun on
Dutch and somebody else said well just
in case we ever go international let's
not six weeks later we had a Brazilian
chapter and what some podcasts had heard
about us and thought it was cool right
from the start I said well I can't make
up the rules because I don't know what
each
each country or each law needs for the
group to be so go out and play and
people did so I now have no clue what
they are doing so that that chain pyre
is reborn how many groups are there now
run the world estimate about 660 so why
is it why is it important
my time why is it important to have
these groups I'm not this a question I'm
asking you look I think I think any
group which is underrepresented in a
community needs to have a sport network
and so that's why for me personally I
think it's right also when I was a
little speaker moving to New Zealand for
the first time I sought out fellow
duchies I I could speak to so to have
that support initially and what how
would you mean obviously diversity is a
very important thing
how would you I'm a conference organiser
myself as well as a speaker and I know
it's extremely important to have a
diverse very representable you know
group of speakers representative of the
of our population to go and speak how
how would conferences or people you know
get diverse people to join their groups
one of the things you can do is organize
a speaker mentoring program we did that
for the energy r4j fall so that's also
possible and then invite also speakers
make a mentoring program or invite the
diverse group ask people personally to
send in paper so that's also helpful how
do people get in touch with we've got
put your URL so is it just jayjay
Duchess dot or how would someone create
a Jay Duchess group or Duchess group in
their local region same as all the other
user groups start one yourself start a
meetup group or somewhere else invite
people to come get together don't forget
to sign up at Oracle because you have
user groups gets benefits if you're
longer running longer than a year so
awesome so yeah massive congratulations
to about ten years
okay okay so what should we do should we
do ask the JDK architects first and if
there's time we can do the JC Channel
yeah so how many do we have any J is
there any JDK architects in the room so
MUC please invite someone and this year
actually I have not
I've not provided the I was me in the
last couple of years where I put the
Death March music on is Mark Wallace
yeah I think we will actually give
Oracle a special mention at the end for
the amazing work they've done but
everyone has a day job everyone has a
passion but the amount of work that
needs to go in to release something like
JDK 9 is is not something anyone can do
it's an incredible amount of work and
there is so much I'm not gonna say slack
there's so much people have to take
in order to get something like this out
I think not just mark but there is a
huge team behind mark as well
mark Bryan John the Allen Alex there's a
huge team there's a massive round of
applause in all the work they do to to
get JDK 9 out the door and without this
team Java wouldn't be progressing
anywhere near as fast as it is so let's
welcome mark on stage and gear Markus is
very big
thank you for the kind words right now
let's get a really nasty question okay
so our policy on dough we're gonna we're
gonna actually change it up this year
right what if I'm asked a couple
questions first and then which engine a
couple of questions first
so uh did you say no tonight I don't
know what they're about to ask yeah what
are you looking forward to most in say
Java 10 11 and 12
Nix 18-month what is what is what is the
thing that mark is most excited that see
Hawaii thing I'm most looking forward to
still being done with jigsaw yes I love
the word still buzzing wonderful word
that you had a you know I mean I are is
is there a particular is there a
particular feature that you yourself are
most most interested in seeing and
seeing in coming into Java it's probably
not for 10 or 11 or 12 but project loom
continuations and fibers oh that would
be very cool yeah it's gonna be very
yeah I mean that one person is gonna be
so happy with that guys
that's not versioning come on let's talk
we got to talk versioning right so tell
us I don't I roll me come on moe let's
talk about 18.3 18.9 then moving to ten
what's the I think a lot of people don't
actually follow mailings so what's the
current proposal for versioning and why
is this the best in your opinion the
current proposal yeah haven't been for
those of you following along at home or
not is that the March release will be
called ten the first update release of
that will be called ten 0.1 the second
update release will be called ten 0.2
the release in September the first
long-term support release will be called
eleven and it's update releases its its
update releases will be numbered in a
similar fashion that's the current
proposal
where people seem to like this proposal
then first proposal which was really
more of a suggestion that I'm actually
written down thought out proposal so
there it is
let's buy a show of hands have a round
of applause for people who are in favor
of 18.9 18.3 19.3 several round of
applause for those were in favor with
that versioning system a round of
applause of those who are in favor of
ten eleven and the the version system
which we just discussed people have
spoken is that done till now yeah the
tidal wave of support for this proposal
has been pretty large I think Brian gets
is just here to get a zoning back and
he's gonna pull mark off stage now right
yeah let's give a big round of applause
to Brian guess who's an amazing amount
of work in recent years really Charlie
and I think your biggest achievement
coming up
brian is you've just managed to add a
single keyword to java called VAR that
that's that's the next big achievement
right it's not actually keyword is a
restricted type name I stand I stand
corrected this is this language language
architects phrase for dirty so this is
to save characters when people instead
of talking in they can type bar things
like that okay
to make your code more readable yeah so
and so the argument of course from a lot
of people is you know what people are
gonna overuse this people are gonna use
it in such a way whereby code is gonna
be unreadable and so forth a lot people
are asking out I'm not a lot of people
are how would you respond to that well
that's absolutely gonna happen
mhm but you know people will also use a
directed code and hopefully over time
best practices will develop for how to
avoid overusing it and abusing it and
how to use it more effectively to write
clear more readable code you know one of
the one of the things that it's easy to
to look at the code that we have today
and say oh if you wrote that with var
instead
would be less readable but one of the
things people do today that makes code
less readable is they in order to keep
not have to declare a variable they end
up wrapping things into these big long
chained expressions with 19 levels deep
of nesting because they don't want to
have to declare a variable because
writing out the type name is so or both
and if writing out the type name were
less verbose they might write make that
code more readable so I think it's one
of those things where it could be used
for good and for evil hopefully we'll
learn how to do the former and not the
latter and we're only getting var we're
not getting pal so if we want if you
want a value would you write final var
yeah two words that contradict each
other
next to each other yes who's looking
forward to VARs he thinks that's going
to improve their code so I have one
small plea please please please name
your variables with meaningful names if
you're going to use var that yes all I
ask of you snow var X VAR y vazat every
way a great example is VAR underscore
underscore because it's a restricted
keyword you can say var var equals for
the next generation of Java puzzlers
it's gonna be fine I'm really glad we're
getting this out so everyone know that
that's so just syrup just to confirm
these are things we shouldn't do yeah so
it's like this have a chef hands again
who's look who's gonna use var oh sorry
who's looking forward to var sorry who
is not looking forward so far not to me
that's pretty good and everyone else
just probably C++ developers room who's
not looking to other people using var
yeah okay so actually one question that
we asked mark which i think is probably
a very good question to ask you is well
what are you looking for what was the
feature that you're looking forward to
in ten eleven twelve for us
so I'm super excited about pattern
matching mom so this is this is a
feature that once you start using it
you'll wonder how you ever lived about
it it's something that even though
people associate it with functional
languages historically it fits very
nicely into the object model in fact
more deeply than I think people realize
at first and it's it's a feature that
has a lot of depth and so we can sort of
start out with
pattern-matching and go deeper and
deeper and deeper over several several
releases so I think it's something that
is people will really like okay well
someone else looking forward to please
shout out yeah
anybody heavy J&amp;amp;I users no foreign
function interface people here no data
types right yeah yeah coming to us in
Java 15 maybe so that's it's it's about
two months actually there's I'll talk
about it more in my talk tomorrow but
there's a public prototype available in
the amber project already fantastic I'm
personally excited about that one I was
gonna make a big difference so we've got
a slide here that says ask the JDK
architects you just did a session about
ask the j-league architects
I've already briefed mark and what's
about happen this is gonna be news to
you we're gonna get the JDK architects
to ask questions of the average
developer so let's start with some
developers one at least one of these two
gentlemen in the pink shirt if one of
you would like to come up on stage you
hang up if you're ready to come up on
stage now you've had a beer please
gentlemen all right anyone else anyone
else who wants to be asked a question by
a java rocked it who wants another beer
yeah please come down alright so we have
three so start with mark obviously is
he's had a little bit more time to prep
so so MUC what what question if you had
one question which you do right now
what would you ask of a group of Java
developers that that you wouldn't
necessarily better get in your ivory in
in Oracle
if you could add just one language
feature what would it be why do you want
it and do you think we would ever
actually do it so I asked for one
question we get three let's go
it's data types because I like
immutability and do you think they'll do
it obviously yes I will actually go for
what you already mentioned type
inferencing which which I was preaching
at for years actually look type
inferencing is one thing I'm looking
forward to but yeah yes in that case you
will get it in so I'm happy now I go
with data types also yes you will do
that does someone want to be Lucas at
her and say multi-line strings someone
please sit yeah it was operator
overloading and no you probably wouldn't
do that
but I just would like to watch the world
burn
I think I was from the audience module
version no no it doesn't make sense
cipher he saw a race the hyper racer
okay can I ask a follow-up question
please do suppose you you are forced to
choose one language feature to remove
what would it be in life that's a great
question
jokes or allows us to do this now a
little I thought you were gonna say
jigsaw so in a session with the ask UDK
architects how are ya
I support Brian with serialization kill
serialize it is easy one to remove right
actually we had a session in Jay creep
about what would you add or remove to
Java and serialization was one of the
top ones about removing external agent
it causes so many issues I have actually
no clue means the Java language is
perfect this is great
it's already come come over the Yahoo
feature the loves of frameworks that I
would like to get rid of but my company
won't let me care to name and shame any
gonna love having it so I would say I
would say api's actually not in terms of
api's in general but the application
making deprecation actually work which
is happening doctor applicators anyways
enjoy its editing working duplication
more one's always been there but it's
actually working now so I think that is
that is a very big thing if you've any
questions burn so if go to the book
store you'll see books that say learn
Java in 21 days so can Java be learned
in 21 days if not how many days are
needed and is that number too large or
too small so these architects are good
at getting three questions yeah I think
you can learn the basics in 21 days but
you can't be a good Java developer in 21
days and I would say it takes six months
to a year to be a decent developer is
that is that from someone who is already
knows how to program okay I would say 21
days is falling not enough I'm gonna
give a political answer I mean Java is
evolving so all you ever done learning
in that case I think you keep learning
you keep learning by the day by things
you do by things you see other people do
by going to these conferences and all
that that stuff so no 21 days it just
gives you a small basic notice of the
language and after that you need to keep
following up I think you ask you and
that's okay of course yeah I'm gonna
send it to josh bloch effect of java
third edition you're not done yet Josh
yeah yeah yeah 21 days for the basics
definitely even hardcore on the command
line if you want to there are a lot of
books that do this ahead also just not
ideal learning but really on the basics
you can get your basics done but
so watch me dig too big is not the right
word but there's got a lot of things in
it I mean I've also done C++ want to go
there too many options no I think FA is
robust enough to learn in 21 days for
the basic but if you want to really get
deep dive in it you have to what they
said also you have to keep in it
otherwise you get lost and you don't
know what you're doing anymore so
unfortunately due to time we need to end
this part of the session here but let's
please give a massive in a massive round
of applause for the work that both both
Brian and Mark are done skate grounds
thank you very much I think you have
actually awesome so we have it may be a
few minutes left let's see how much
we've got it do I also alert how to ask
three questions and one today so that's
really good
what are we do a quick speed-dating
interview loads people are actually
asked to sit at the front cuz we because
we can ask a few questions with them so
let's see you should we pick
let's pick steep pull seafolk come on
upstairs hello Steve
so let's give a round of applause Steve
Steve Steve also works at a really small
three litter startup yeah with started
with an RI yeah so the startup must be
going about a hundred years now the mics
here oh ok so well I have a question for
you
oh really why is this big got no label
have you build it off no okay drink it's
a good question kool-aid the kool-aid
yeah yeah thank you so two minutes let
me get my phone there's no two minute
two minute Oh have you got questions
you've got questions yes
so recently iBM has also joined in the
open source all the things came open j9
here who here knows what open j9 is okay
Steve let's educate the wrist the
audience want open J Niners design is
the that we've been producing for a long
time and it's as good as hot spot so
that it's as good as hot spot and we
open sourced it last other one
we announced valves JavaOne and it
actually got out the door just before
this one which was pretty quick for IBM
right
Oh stunning yeah you know it was at
least less than what odd yeah amazing so
why would people move to join because
it's better than a hot spot okay what
else is IBM open-source was something
well this is thing called Liberty weight
loss applications
HR application server okay uses
WebSphere who likes using IBM WebSphere
right who uses IP uses IBM wizard
because that's what their company tells
them to do thank you right okay so I
need to ask the gentleman a question uh
pause this what why do you like using
IBM websphere Stockholm effect used to
work for about ten years but I know is
there you're shorter because of it so
IBM WebSphere people probably got a good
right hey IBM full profile WebSphere
comment and it's the same with things
like WebLogic but what IBM have released
in what five years ago six years ago not
a lot of people know this but a really
really good application server modular
application server using OS join of the
covers so you can literally at runtime
add and remove components you want to do
that that's absolutely fine drop your
app server drop the application on it
and build your application server around
the application it's actually a really
really good piece of work
how something go so did you actually
leave IBM I did okay did I found the
bill okay so so where C's would be five
years ago it I think it was released
about five years
oh you mean maze physics oh okay you
don't mean open sourced no no no no so
it was a question times tickin yeah
question was you're asking me the
question was
how big is Liberty well she's about well
yeah in size competitor cuz people are
more familiar with this wonderful
modularity system so you can get it down
to pretty small footprint it's got this
nice little configuration thing so yeah
so is joy pwned so you know the best
modularity system going yeah you know my
BBM's using yes so the footprints DMX
America
he apparently starts up in seconds yes
very different thing I'd be in pay for
the beer you did try running Watson on
the moment central or on the github on
Java code and see what it learns from
the current best practices ah so I yeah
yeah you might take big Watson and
pointed at maven and see what it learns
yeah yeah I wouldn't understand what you
said Oh two minutes right thank you very
much Steve Steve Paul Thank You Robby I
feel we've got time for one interview so
let's talk about Oracle let's talk about
our who who was that might talk earlier
today where I wasn't very nice very cool
so I really a lot nicer about Oracle now
so those of you who saw the Java 1
announcements so Oracle is going to
fully open source all the commercial
parts of their existing Oracle JDK so we
are going to get mission of control
flight recorder open sourced we're now
going to have a six month release
cadence for open JDK all the stuffs
going to be done out in the open etc so
I just wanted to say a huge thank you
foot to Oracle for doing this they've
also again allowed Java EE to move into
a fully open foundation at eclipse so
all of enterprise Java is now going to
be completely open and free and this is
actually a huge turning point for the
driver ecosystem both end in the
enterprise space and in the core driver
se space so for the first time in eight
years I'm actually gonna say well done
Oracle and thank you Oracle and I'll
just like to give them a round of
applause for having done this
but you say I kind of hope next year
they do something evil again so I can
get back to you know yeah and it's a
shame because it's fun it's really fun
taking the piss out of Oracle but weed
they've actually done a really good job
yeah actually yeah I'm gonna quickly add
IBM to this as well
because they've done some amazing open
source stuff as well and as a little bit
part of that if people were interested
in getting open j9 so that's the
alternative JVM that IBM have open
sourced and if you want to start getting
access to some of these early builds of
some of the projects that Brian etc has
mentioned and if you're perhaps running
on some sort of esoteric platforms like
AIX or linux XIII 90s or I got I can't
do that
who paid us more money for the beers so
yeah our Oracle IBM has done an amazing
job have yeah so put the community first
and we really look forward to hearing
from both their lawyers for for not uses
it for not getting permission to use
their logos on the slides
yeah that's gonna be great fun you're a
director of the ventral junk rat so if
either of the virtues so if I resigned
tomorrow I'm safe is that how it works
so what's next what's coming up in Java
next we talked a little bit about it we
have value types at some point we have
pattern matching we have j'ni
improvements we have six monthly breeze
cadence co-routines and fibers somewhere
down the line hopefully that's all
awesome news as well a more hopefully a
more open kind of build infrastructure
and things as well so it's looking like
all of a major vendors who build games
are actually starting to get together
with the community to build aspects of a
common build infrastructure so now
you'll be able to get open JDK which is
well built well tested and you'll know
where it came from and how it was built
which hasn't always been the case so it
may seem like a small thing but if
you're distributing a JVM in a secure
environment especially this is actually
really important there's a lot of really
exciting things coming up and this is
probably one of the most exciting you
know times to be
Java's i've been something so fast i
think you know me to learn so quickly
yeah okay that's pretty much it all we
have time for a bang on time the next
veto session yeah you know I encourage
everyone here to drink virtual joke so
the virtual drop come click join and we
will continue our sessions of the online
Java user group which is an official
Java user group surprisingly and the
next one will be next Thursday already
at 6 p.m. local time here which is a
reasonable time to do a session so like
EEE enjoy that that would be Baruch so
the Gorske and Victor Gama and they will
do the second issue of the Java puzzlers
which is gonna be super fun we're gonna
have slack and we're gonna have polls
and we're gonna learn that we don't know
Java at old and it's gonna be amazing
we'll have some virtual beer yeah join
us awesome so I must thank you from us
to you please do follow our podcast
which we do every couple of weeks Java
Council calm and the one thing we will
ask actually we're very very kindly
allowed by the the venue hosts here to
have beer in in this location so we will
ask if you could bring your bottles out
and leave your bottles and your caps by
the crates on the exit that's all we ask
and that will allow us to have beer next
year hopefully on time so massive thank
you to everyone for joining and</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
