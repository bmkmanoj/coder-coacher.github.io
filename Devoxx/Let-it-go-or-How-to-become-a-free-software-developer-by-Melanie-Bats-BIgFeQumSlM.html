the open source world for six years now
and my purpose today is to share with
you my experience and explain when oh
and why I became an open source woman
developer nowadays we talk a lot about
diversity everywhere in the hope
interest communities in our companies
but most of the time taking care of
diversity just boils down to publishing
a code of conduct this is not enough I
propose to start with a small ethnic
neurological study what is an open
source developer are some of you working
on open source software Here I am
okay there's some here is an open source
developer specimen if I look at him a
little closer the popular belief is that
it is a man especially a bearded man he
lives and works alone at home completely
isolated it drinks coke hits pizzas and
other results he writes code all night
long
what the hobbits with developer like
most is superheroes sci-fi and cats now
let's look at what a female happens with
developer looks like if we compare the
two we see that there is a lot of
differences in the end as an open source
developer I do not really match the
classical stereotype and I promise you I
tried I really tried but it's completely
impossible for me to grow beard so I
grant you we have some common points of
interest
I like sci-fi I like cats and I am
nothing against a small piece of pizza
from time to time so how did I get to be
open source developer according to you
answer a I'm born knowing how to code
and so be high in coding until the end
of the night and so see I'm organizing
surprise party answer DS answer D who
votes for so answer hey
nobody oh one one answer be awesome
answer C no one oh one one okay
answer D okay all the time and so these
what is warning so once so not to
surprise for me so let's take together
answer hey
I'm born knowing how to code wrong I'm
sure you've all heard these stories from
developers who at two years old we're
talking binary at four years were coding
in C and at six were writing their own
operating system unlike usual said
amongst developers I'm going to be
honest I'm not born knowing code I was
trained and it look it took me a long
time and I continue to train and learn
all the time I was educated not
especially like a girl I was always told
that I could do what I wanted I was
pushed helped encouraged and supported
so the first step to become an episode
developer is to begin by being a
software developer so what can you do to
help
Hauser's becoming developers the first
thing is paying attention to the way you
talk about your journey for example I
can't explain that at the age of 10 I
had a computer and I started to develop
small video games in Pascal yes I'm
sorry but I'm not so young no I started
with Pascal then in high school I
decided to take computer courses or I
can tell you our authors helped me to
get there at ten my dad brought me
brought home a computer and let us play
with it then my brother told me how to
start my video games and show me the
source code that was hiding behind in
high school my physics teacher suggested
I take the computer options knowing my
love for science and when I was children
my friends were members of the computer
club and proposed me to accompany them
to dare run free software conclusion I
did not get there alone far away so now
it's our turn to
brought help advice encourage your
colleagues when they tried something new
the young people would integrate your
companies the students and of course
your children so I did not become events
with developer because I knew how to
code let's answer be a I'm cutting until
the end of the night wrong one usual way
to become an open source developer is to
find a project that is useful to you to
start contributing by reporting issues
then as you are more and more aware of
that project you become a beta tester
and one day you have a bug that
horrifies you and you decide to return
for good in the code to fix it you
decide to participate in a hackathon and
you hand up having a fix and there to
send your first patch usually this is on
on your free time then bit by bit thanks
to the meritocracy you touch the gray
and you become committer Alleluia and
one day you can be iured in the company
who contributes massively to this
open-source project that is true the
meritocracy can do the rest but
sometimes it is a little too strict it
can tend to respect in a project how
many people would know how to make
sophisticated code or who can be heard
so what you need to do is to try to
break the stereotypes by attracting
different profiles first tips and tricks
to become an open source developer you
should contribute to a project remember
people are can and it isn't their best
interest to help you to get him to the
project notice that the first patch you
will send me we need to be reward so do
not be shy send it so that someone can
read you it to help you improve your
code second point when you will need to
hire people in your team you have to
become aware of your bases if you only
have people on your team who love sci-fi
who eat pizza and Linux coke you have a
problem but so how do I get
sir when I do not live to program hi do
records weekend and even if I did it I
still would endure submitting my first
passage to strangers so how do I become
an open SUSE developer am i Horgan izing
surprise party true convinced by the
values of free software and its helical
aspects I became an activists but from
free software user to developers there
is a step and few years ago I was a
software developer and I wanted to be
able to act and be recognized for my
work I used everyday and open to a
software named axel EO creating a divide
by a small French company named Abu my
technical skills could mostly fit what
this company was looking for so I
decided to apply to be prepared I
continued to work on my technical
knowledge and once I felt I was ready
all I needed was to create an
opportunity to meet people from OBO
thanks to my involvement in free
software and as an activist I was used
to organize events in order to meet the
hobby or guys I propose to co-organized
an event in my city about the
technologies they were based on Eclipse
this event was named an eclipse party
conclusion I entered in the open Swiss
developer world by meeting people by
participating and Horgan easing events
by developing my network I discovered at
that period that being part of a
minority is very useful a true fact is
as a woman in the software ecosystem you
meet men with stupid opinions some asked
my opinion on the corrals while
microcredit succour of software and you
have to face sexist jokes and still I'm
happy I'm not blonde
so I kept a positive side of it being
part of minority is an advantage because
people his really remember will you her
six years ago I was able to join her Big
O so OB o is a company specialized in
the develop
of modeling world benches Riya relying
on open source technologies and
particularly involved in the eclipse
foundation while it was it easy for me
to join them because Xavier is a company
that is based on the values of open
source people are open-minded attentive
which allows us to his elite change and
learn from each other everyone is ready
to give and reduced and redistribute his
knowledge and all this is done in a
framework of high level of expertise and
excellence where the quality of the
produce code is at earth of everything a
big part of the software produced at OBU
is open source so everyone can see how
we work which pushes up to always do
better
since my first day at hooby o people
helped me a lot and advised but not only
the offer means opportunities because
they were listening to what I could
offer that's all the day I propose to
make cut set bubbles with an Arduino to
promote our modeling solutions they said
ok go ahead and that's great a bit crazy
so clearly this was an atmosphere that I
will summarize eyes very open and
inclusive but what I want me to join
them was the fact that they offered me a
remote position I could get the job I
wanted while staying in the same place
physically they did not hesitate to
offer me a remote position because the
teams were already used to work with
remote colleagues
thanks to their involvement in
open-source communities so remember give
yourself the means to find the best
change your habits and open up to
hustles hoofer remote rock and give
opportunities in addition to advice so
what does it mean to be in the open
source the world of software development
is not to be difficult to access for
women and open-source even more I think
that it depends on you the people around
us we do the projects we create the
atmosphere so certainly I was lucky I
came across the right people but
remember that it is complete
possible and feasible what I love most
in open-source is that ovince DRM has
been highly sociable it constantly
exchanges with also developers and users
all around the world using bug trackers
code reviews forums so for me open
source is first about sharing you have
to communicate remotely with
decentralized teams and with many
different tools we have adopted these
tools and methodologies within our
company to work in same way at the earth
of our organization we will find tools
such as get Garrett and matter most
which is a free version of flag so then
my preferred moment as an open source
developer is when I can meet the
community in real life during events and
conferences and this is a very good
opportunity to improve your English also
moreover being part of a large community
will help you to be helped to date and
aware for example as you can see I am an
eclipse committer I'm pretty sure that
you know it keeps as being java heidi
but participating to eclipse conferences
allowed me to discover much more than
that because in active community you
will find java related projects such as
micro services GE or appengine ID but
also many other topics like coyote or
modeling I am NOT an Java IDE committer
I met Jeremy Nick hips modeling
committer what her regrets is that in
open-source communities as well as in
businesswoman developers as soon as
unicron's that is mythical rare and
precious creatures this does not make
sense whether in your companies or at
organised events we will find some kind
of positive discrimination as special
rates for conferences Coty's special
events males for girls and you seek to
integrate them and you do everything to
make them feel a part what I want
everyone to understand is that I can
come to a conference alone no I do not
come with my husband yes I am here
because I do talk and no I do not want
to chat with other women just because
they're women and please when you meet a
woman at conference stop asking her how
to improve the diversity of our
community
she hasn't more the solutions and you
have making hope answers brings you so
many things you will progress thanks to
the exchanges you will leave a trace you
will be recognized for the work you did
by your users and by your peers and it
can lead to unexpected perspectives of
evolution remember six years ago I was a
free software user but a closed-source
software developer then I decided to
became a free software activist but I
still was a clothes truce developer and
finally because one day I decided to do
it and because some people believed in
me I succeed to be a full-time
open-source software developer which led
me to become the new CEO of OBO since
two months no I'm the technical director
of decentralized team of 10 people
working on a dozen different happens
whose products provided thanks to the
Eclipse Foundation or github remember
that you can really win with computing
to open-source projects and by opening
your mind to new people so go ahead do
not hesitate
join us contribute to open source and
let it go thanks I have no more time for
question but I'm her own so the lattice
day to come
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
