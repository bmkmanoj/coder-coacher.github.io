Java EE and now this time we're now in
capsule of Romania in Bucharest and you
just gave a keynote about serverless so
I wanted to ask you because you gave a
brilliant demonstration where you built
a little Java EE application essentially
that was only four kilobytes and then we
looked at the JavaScript code to the
front end compared to what you can do
with Java EE and verbalist do you think
that the front-end JavaScript code and
the libraries are kind of maybe a bit
behind and letting the side down because
they're a bit heavier you mentioned the
so much code to disease yeah I think not
behind
I think the JavaScript community makes
the same mistakes with it
five years ago but fortunately there is
another movement like web components and
polymer which get very pragmatic and
they have very similar mindset to Java
II like focus on business and on web
standards and just provide additional
syntactic sugar without without too much
craziness so arm and what I try to
express in the keynote is that it's
somehow somehow converges so like the
serverless ideas we already have in Java
this will actually the point and we get
it in the JavaScript world as well
there's coming a point in the future
where the two will work really well
together it works right now perfectly
the it is not obvious that the ideas are
the same because the JavaScript people
tend to hate Java and the Java
developers tend to hate JavaScript so
it's like a mutual hating but but but
actually what I try to do to show you
that this es6 this was these more than
javascript actually looks like Java so
for Java developers is not not a big
deal to learn web standards right now
what's your recommendation in terms of
JavaScript libraries to use with a
service application actually this is
also interesting I have exactly the same
approach what I have in Java and Java so
I look at the standards what is coming
up
and try to build a similar architecture
to stand out as possible so for instance
in the JavaScript world and HTML world
we get like fetch which is like very
lean HTTP client and it's not available
in the browser but there is so called
polyfill like a patch and if you use it
right now in one day you could delete
the patch and then your application
becomes leaner this is what we did for
years with Java your obit what I did in
my architectures and you can do the same
in JavaScript so if you have the same
mindset for Java EE developers can build
a very lean JavaScript architectures
actually what's your pet project at the
moment
using JavaScript and Java EE so my
leisure project I think you mean your
leisure project is actually two projects
Prometheus and I built called stuff
called X ray it's like statistics
project for my block I think five years
ago and it runs with hazel cars Java and
exposes these statistics using rest and
so first I would like to do is to prove
to implement some charts with JavaScript
and just using just using web standards
at the same time I created also a
JavaScript projects which exposes docker
some stay two sets with angular 1 it was
a very old one and I would also like to
rework that with or rebuild this with
web standards and the last one there's a
Prometheus it's like monitoring their
sport very modern a monitoring tool
which is using cloud environments and I
would like connectors with application
servers which I partially already did so
there is a project called light fish
which captures GlassFish monitoring data
and stores in database and I would like
to expose it in Prometheus format and
not only this also business monitoring
from apps and and implement you know
monitoring for micro services so this is
actually and the last one I will try to
hack in flight back to unique so today
and the other ones let's see how many
how much leisure I will get data in
looking at feedback and what are you
trying to learn from this the main
problem always was in Java everyone was
focused on code coverage which is more
or less meaningless in disturbia
systems and something like no key health
monitoring or key performance indicators
is completely lacking and with Java is
very simple to expose your business
statistics like know how many attendees
registered to the conference how many
the registrations failed oh how many
throat attempts there were and you could
expose this by a simple format and make
a nice dashboard for the client to see
what's going on the app so no one is
interested in amount of thread sessions
whatever but everyone is in really
interested what's going on in the app
it's like a dashboard or a cockpit there
is not a good name for that and this is
what I will do and we need it in all of
my projects actually and we do it
afterwards so if the projects fail then
we implement this and yeah I will do it
start with that right now and you are
you all right we need some charts for
the clients you know because no one is
interested in numbers or sheets</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
