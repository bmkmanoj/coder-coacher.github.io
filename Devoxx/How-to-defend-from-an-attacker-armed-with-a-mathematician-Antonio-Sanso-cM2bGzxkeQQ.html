you gave a talk at lunchtime how to
defend yourself from an attacker armed
with a mathematician is that correct
yeah it's great there about yeah
basically yeah
the talk is about how the transport
layer security works and basically
behind the connection from your browser
and the server is not really clear but
in the background there is a lot of
maths happening and sometimes things
goes wrong and today I shown an example
of vulnerability that I found last year
on open SSL there's one the biggest
server software that runs TLS and some
research have done with some American
universities what was the vulnerability
so basically open SSL had three small
issues that combined together made the
the server vulnerable an attacker can
still the private key of the server so
basically this is a big deal the outcome
was not nice let's say so months behind
it where would you start
yeah I mean was a the the mat is not
really complicated but it's basically is
is what it's behind the scene on
diffie-hellman handshake and this some
the math is not really complicated but
with the without the right knowledge to
implement it can be some some issues
like in this case so open SSL did not
big mistakes but usually cryptography
doesn't is not doesn't forgive even the
slightest mistake brings huge
vulnerabilities so the basics of a
handshake from a mathematical point of
view and do you have to correct me as I
go is I would like to communicate with
you right so I send across to you
publicly publicly exactly yeah and
you're good
check to see whether or not that public
key matches your perfectly and then you
send me a private key is that right is
almost correct basically in there in the
handshake this is correct in some cases
but in this case is basically me and you
so you send me a public key as a new
public key and finally we are able to to
share a secret okay and say that secret
who sends the secret if I send you the
public key no one and that's what the
secret is never send in the network but
basically just me and you sending our
own public key to each other we're able
to to derive a new secret and somebody
says in the middle so a man in the
middle cannot derive the same secret and
it's only using in Matt's and so-called
one-way function so there are some times
that are really easy to calculate in one
way and really impossible to calculate
the reverse so is it a transformation of
the public key exactly you can see us a
transformation yes think of wrong
basically in this case open itself did
the true mistakes and the first one
would was repeating this this public key
every time so usually this key is better
being a female so changing every time I
was not the case so because the
importance to understand is that if you
do all these mistakes nothing happened
in this case there were really three
little mistakes that eventually landed
to the vulnerabilities and so did these
mistakes about repeating you the second
mistake he did he was not validating the
public key that the brass or the client
was sending her mistake they were
employing in some case or they were
lying to employ some prime numbers the
number was not ideal they were not small
but they were good but they had the P
minus 1 so P a prime is a prime number P
minus 1 is they always even because P is
prime and this payment Swan was a
yukl factorize this P minus 1 in many
small factors and the per se is not a
problem if you validate but since
open-celled it as well the mistake of
not validating and it was repeating this
this public key every time adding these
three little mistakes I could actually
retrieve
the parrot key and the interesting part
is why it's a way open-cell was using
this female squad with this so many
small program no factors the reasons
like because they follow an Arab scene
so some specification was actually
giving these prime numbers that in this
case was not ideal right switch be ultra
careful yeah and then is it that if you
repeat the public key it gives more time
for an attacker to try out different
combinations yeah yeah the attacker cool
like the ripe they keep before more to
for example then mod 3 then mod this all
these small numbers then it will use
something called Chinese remainder
theorem and you can basically then talk
you back that's the bit where you lost
me I'm afraid
thank you very much thanks to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
