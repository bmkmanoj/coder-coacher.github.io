welcome
I think I've got a stomach here welcome
to anatomy of the Java vulnerabilities
by the very nature of this we would like
this sorry I'll introduce off in a
minute but it make it as dynamic as
possible ask questions because there's a
lot of dry stuff and there's some scary
stuff
so through weird circumstances the only
slide about speakers is me so my name is
Steve Paul work for IBM I'm a developer
advocate now for the runtimes team I
spent a couple of years prior to that
being a lead engineer for DevOps I've
been Java and open source and stuff like
that so lots of from this talks point of
view I've seen it on both sides from a
from a Java until the point of view but
also sort of as a customer and
understanding some of the issues
concerned and Tim who's standing here
quickly which I do just give an
introduction so thanks this so I'm Tim
Ellison and I look after the the Java
runtimes team at IBM so I'm working with
Steve and I didn't do that detour into
devoxx I've been in the Java runtimes
business for many many years and we kind
of submitted a joint talk but I've been
off traveling around working some other
stuff out at the moment so steve has
kindly agreed to to lead this talk I'll
just be chipping in from the sidelines
yeah yeah asking other questions and
together but it I could brain them we
could brain dump to you what about this
stuff and there is some dry stuff but
actually I'd be really interesting your
feedback and your questions about this
because it's an important topic to talk
about
right so it's part of the talk is
technical and part of this is the scary
stuff the scary stuff will be in black
not necessarily so and the technical
staff will be the standard devil stuff
ok so let's start with the really
straightforward thing what is a
vulnerability so let's talk about the
the wording right so generally people
talk about vulnerabilities being bugs
which can be exploited right I found a
bug in your code and they will people
can use that bug to do bad things too
so the primary things are like attacking
your vulnerability or your availability
so you have a bug somebody finds it
somebody exploit sit and they make you
crash Nick ratted your system your
system is down you recover they make you
do it again you know that's where you
get ransomware that's where you get
denial of service things right whether
it's crashing it some exploits that will
actually make reuse all your memory art
reduce your you know hog up your CPU
deal within it within a reduce your
networking use you know just bash you
over the head by using exploits against
you right so there's availability so
looking for bugs in that space they're
also looking at the integrity thing
which is can I get in and modify your
data you know can I find exploits in
your code that you where you run
something and I find a weakness where I
can get your Co to run something else
right and then of course the one that
sort of probably gets the most press is
vulnerabilities that expose confidential
information or any sort of data so
primitively
elevation is the idea of I can find a
way to get root access to systems go
through through some vulnerability they
discover in your system but
confidentially mostly is about where you
think you've secured your data but
actually they find a way of getting at
it and you know you might heard about
SQL injection vulnerabilities and those
sorts of things where they just pull out
the data so first thing you should think
about why should you care so you talk
about John revoir job of and abilities
they get fixed you get these updates and
okay why should you care what's what's
change so I said I give you some scary
chart cybercrime realities there's a
real perception which hopefully is
beginning to change that the people who
are hacking the people who are finding
exploiting these vulnerabilities are
loan individuals they're just people out
there in their bedroom you know doing it
for fun for profit but they're not how
big a problem is this
so I set the scene organized crime is
the most profitable type of crime in the
world right 2016 so last year it was
estimated to be 445 billion dollars a
year that's how much the criminals are
getting out of this right so I'm not
even talking about espionage or cyber
warfare this is just the crime bit right
so 445 billion dollars a year the
illicit drugs raid according to the you
know it was 435 in 2013 numbers not
perfectly easy to calculate but you can
see are there on a par so 2016 vs. 2030
which one has the least risk to the
custom to Luke took the criminal side of
Rome which is to grow which one is the
growing the fastest cybercrime the
expectation is is that by the end of
2020 there will be oh yeah twenty
nineteen twenty one twenty one hundred
billion dollars so four hundred forty
five billion dollars is like 1% of the
world's GNP it's going to be three four
five percent right so it's a massive
problem okay and basically prosecuting
these people is almost impossible turns
out that pretty much everybody who gets
arrested for cybercrime doesn't get
arrested for cybercrime they get
arrested for another type of crime and
then it is we discovered that they were
actually and I'm doing something in the
cyber space so it's totally lucrative
you never get prosecuted and they make
loads of money that's why you should
care because these guys are coming to
get you
now the other thing about
vulnerabilities is it's not a smoking
gun there's not this situation where you
can say look I can see an obvious thing
in a piece of code where it is a bad
thing you know alarm bells go off
finding them or people look out and find
these things which we'll talk about the
the actual an exaction alarm for example
of the vulnerability and I have some you
look at those and go why is that
vulnerability right why is that
important so let's have a really simple
one so this one is fixed pretty much
everywhere but I'm going to talk about
at this level because it is a not a good
thing for us to talk about the details
because even if I said this was fixed in
all versions of Java apart from one or
two I would then be saying that those
one or two versions of Java are still
vulnerable and you could go find it so
we're not going to do that home let's
talk about this one this is really
clever profits object maps labels 2/12
names right decode equals use this this
this class right when the code was
cooled if the code which pulled out the
stuff out the when you try to
instantiate the class manger from this
label when it wasn't there this nice
message got sent back and it said I
can't instantiate decoder and here's
what because it's got this value and I
can't find that click that client code
and you go why is that 1r ability right
so the vulnerability comes from when
people exploit that because if the if
the property that you were looking for
wasn't in the properties class that
you're calling the code would actually
then go off to system properties so
somebody could parse in a label saying
please give me user dot home the system
will try and stand check it as a class
doesn't exist and it will give you back
a nice message that tells you can't find
class users Joe so
you might think that's not a bug you
might think that in fact that is a
feature or a helper right you were just
helping the people understand what their
problem was but he got exploited all
right
that's how vulnerabilities work they are
people finding ways that your code
behaves and finding ways to get around
this ok so that's what it one ability is
I told you about the scale of the
problem it would be worthwhile just
quickly making sure that you understand
who the bad guys are it's not these guys
this is 1920s Lee just a random guy goes
there you sorry they're not you
personally what what we know about the
people who are in who are exploiting
these vulnerabilities the cyber
criminals they are very organized they
do agile they do scrums they share
things they're really really good
because they're very motivated okay they
tend to be people who are coming into IT
so there are people who learning about
computers they go to conferences they do
like online courses they learn all the
stuff they need to learn and then they
apply their brain a different way to
break your code okay and we know as you
can imagine that when you when you have
cyber crime people they're targeting a
range of people right that's fine you we
know about the fact that they're going
to be going ago against people have just
joined the company because they're
confused people are frightened there's a
whole bunch of phishing scams are out
targeting individuals but they go for us
too they go for developers right they go
for the people a week and run the born
ignorant okay and the reason they go for
us the reason that we are a good
candidate is because of what what we can
do so we know how it all works we write
the code we tend to have pretty good
privileges
we're very over trusting we use people's
code with out looking you are very good
at making use of other people's code
whether worrying about vulnerabilities
or even about Providence or anything
about this because we trust people too
do the right thing and I hope when you
see this you'll start to think about
when you're using other people's code
you're starting to think about what are
the vulnerabilities in that code what
are those guys think is it being updated
do I hear anything
do I see activity in that space right
we're very not we're very poor as a
community in terms of how we worry about
security matters right right so which is
why I say we're weak runnable ignorance
right we do this we we are targeted and
if you don't agree how many people have
done this
how many people have googled for words
like this very how do I find getting
Java to accept all the certs over HTTPS
how do I trust NSS any SSL certificate
how like how do I disable certificate
validation okay everybody does that
because we've all had that instance
where we want to get access to something
and there's a self-signed certificate or
some skinny gates in the way and it's
just painful so we do this this is the
then really important there is the it is
client trusted return true right we do
that because we don't think about the
consequences right so a takeaway from
here is for you to think about when
you're writing code that you are aware
of the security implications of what
you're doing right and we're not
educating about security and how to
write secure Java code there's lots of
stuff on the web to do that this is
about just trying to get you to think
about tech right so vulnerability is a
bug for sure they can find it but it's
also features that you've put into the
code right because you think it's a
feature doesn't mean that it's not
vulnerable right it is they will make
use of how you code it and find ways
around it there are people out looking
all the time so we have researchers
doing it because it's very good that we
find those as soon as possible and get
them fixed because it's better than
somebody who's on our side finding the
vulnerability is better
than having one of the black hats wanted
it okay but everybody is scanning right
it is a big business so when you've got
a vulnerability right
and of course if your piece if you're a
commercial software our open source
software vulnerabilities are just to you
know part of life now there's a process
you know how do you deal with them so
the world has got together a lot of this
and there are some commonalities about
how they're reported and how they're
tracked so I'll go through that so we'll
do the processing the price bit first so
there is a word that you'll hear about
is kawatte acronym called CD a common
vulnerabilities and exposures this is
important as a website cv my tour gets
the primary one there are a couple of
others if you want to go read about CVS
about vulnerabilities go there right
look for CVS
it's a convince a community there's got
together it's all the people who care
about this we want to know we want to
talk about vulnerabilities so that you
understand they vulnerability has been
fixed we don't want we need to have a
standard naming convention a standard
reference so that we understand this bug
has been fixed or this vulnerability has
been fixed okay so you can go to this
website and you can search so I did it's
a mixed thing here so I the you can just
search so I search for Java as of this
morning I've got 1592 CVEs
I did Java sterilization my perennial
provider of vulnerabilities I got 12
these are just example lists which I
didn't update but you can go get these
stuff yourself okay so if I go to Java
serialization so if I go to CVT the
website and I search so as of this
morning because this is this is up to
date I went and said what do you know
about serialization of vulnerability to
CVS and the top three all right no
particular order just the top three that
came up right and so here you can start
to see how vulnerable it sees are
described all right what they're in some
information right if you just down into
one of these so if you dig down into I
know let's dig down to the middle one
right
specified right this is all your games
here about that vulnerability alright so
the challenge for us as a community is
um you may be interested in what's the
code for that vulnerability but nobody's
gonna tell you about it we're going to
go to lots of lengths to ensure that
it's hard for you to find that out okay
and that's very common unspecified
vulnerability and if you try to go from
that wording to the code well you could
probably find the glyphs but because of
the type of what a vulnerability is
you're never going to find the smoking
gun no you can say I fix this so bad
guys can't access this thing it's not
going to work like that okay so the
question is how would you assess them
how do you know what are the things you
need to improve you need to look at
which are the ones that you need to get
fixed so apart from being a website that
lets you see how they are in a common
tracking process is there's also a
scoring system that goes with it
which other it would use the CDSs system
okay ah the interesting thing about it
is so there's we talk about our
explained a minute about the different
complexities of a vulnerability there's
also two assessments one of the things
that you have to remember is is that
there's a tempura tempura access to this
as well so it might have a low score
today but it may have a high school
tomorrow or BBC so when you're looking
at this you need to take into a year
also look at how it's progress and there
are places you can go to see the score
change I'll go through a little bit
about the details in a second so the
thing again is is that we have a common
place to go find them we have a common
scoring system so you can see the impact
right and if you look at that in more
detail you can see here the basic
classic applications it's like all these
it's like a risk assessment right how
what's your tactical inspector how hard
is it to get applied to you how easy is
it to explore is it really simple or
does the person having to exploit it to
work really hard and what sort of
privileges you need you know
again it's about there's this
combination of active attributes and
vulnerability will tell us whether it's
important enough to get fixed quickly or
slowly because everybody has to put
developer effort into fixing things so
this gives you the ability so you can go
up into any CVS and you can see how what
the list is you can go to the school and
see the details alright and you can
start to assess them like yourself it's
something you start getting a head round
because you can't just go our fixes have
been applied to Oracle version bla
that's fine by me you need to be getting
into the program understanding why and
whether you need to move to the next
version of Java or or not based on what
some music these impacts and you need to
be assessing whether not just the
critical ones but some of the lower ones
are actually things you need to assess
so you know you can get scores and then
you can make decisions based on what
these guys say they work on the
assumption that you are sensible human
beings and that your if you for instance
gave everywhere your machine root access
then you know this thing doesn't work
for you you're just generally stupid
right so the how they communicated so
we've got a process we've got
commonality we've got scoring there are
a whole bunch of ways right so Oracle
have the CPU advisory which you can
emails lists etc IBM does the same blogs
notifications we are publishing all the
time what's going on as I said you won't
get to see the detail you're getting to
see CV descriptions and scoring right
and that's all you're going to get but I
think it's important to understand that
that youth needs to be applying these on
a regular basis you cannot ignore these
sorts of problems right so we don't talk
about the details because I like me like
the if we were to talk about the code
the vulnerability or the fix if I talk
to you about the fix you could work out
what the vulnerability is it's exactly
the same as me treating my credit card
and PIN number right I'm just giving it
away to the bad guys if I say look I
found a vulnerability right which is why
we try not to do that there are times
when they do get published some of the
people who report
you get very upset they're not being
fixed and they go public which doesn't
really help anybody so oral call have
their cpu updates and they have these
version numbers you know odd numbers so
you can get into a habit going it's a
security fix I take it I should take it
I should take it
IBM does similar sorts of stuff transfer
out that Oracle tries to do everything
that same trying to have the same
cadence right just do it it's security
update the advantage of having that
regular upbeat is is it you as a from a
IT point of view can say right we will
be doing that we will be applying at a
regular basis so everybody gets lined up
and it happens fairly regularly and
fairly quickly
the IBM has a piece that the product
security incident response team which
has been around for ever I think it's
not just a Java thing IBM policy is very
careful about security is something we
focus very heavily on and so there are
lots of activities going we have the so
I'm not at the side of it but we have
the x-force as well which is a research
glory source group that is out basically
knee-deep in this or next deepening
vulnerabilities and finding them
reporting in the script is awesome yeah
so that's basically ours we're going to
try all to get out as close to Oracle as
possible doing same sort of things
version numbers there's a pad you can go
use this stuff right so anyway that's
let's process let's move on how they're
being found who is finding the
vulnerabilities that you use that are
being fixed at one level is basically
large companies who are product
companies are doing it
third-party researchers so there are
lots of good people out there the white
hats who are doing it they're finding
these are under bridges in the reporting
because it's an important activity for
everybody to do that and of course the
bad guys are doing it as well all right
so product teams white hats researchers
and the bad guys are all
out there trying to find the
vulnerabilities to get that and get them
fixed so that you can apply the next
version of Java so you're not vulnerable
so you don't lose money your information
right so we're all kind of working
together on this so what about if you
found one what should you do okay so the
basic thing is report it if you think
you found a vulnerability do letters no
don't ignore it don't hide it
don't shout about it don't stick out on
Facebook and say hey I found a
vulnerability when you do this and this
and this I can bring your system down
please don't do that
all right just report it you go to the
CVE website and report it you can go to
pretty much all the corporations and go
I found a security I think well I think
I've an availability report it okay but
as I said you won't be looking for
smoking guns you'll be looking for those
circumstances with you X Y Z you bring
the system down you do X Y Z and you
find a hole okay and then of course
however they find them in the end of the
day we're going to fix them as quickly
as possible but obviously we don't have
all the resources to think of fix all
the bugs all the time which is why I
have a scoring process so that you can
see the if we assess of a vulnerability
is high you need to get it fixed right
we're not doing it for anybody else
other than you and you know a lot of
effort is going in to give you secure
systems how valuable is Java so the
reason this talk exists is because one
of the guys I work with and Tim works
with who is knee-deep in spend all his
time working a job of vulnerabilities we
were chatting about whether people be
interesting at all by this and I said so
is it just isn't it just security just
plugins and you in now now there's a lot
more than that and and over the last few
months we've been digging through it and
going actually most quite interesting so
how vulnerable is it well we have a poor
reputation that's for sure you know that
the press hits job over the head and
says we're as vulnerable as flash etc he
did get bad but that wasn't really our
fault it was the fault that
right day one didn't really think about
security and in fact pretty much in the
beginning of the internet people didn't
think about security
most vulnerabilities that we we get are
actually number-wise are going to be
plugins and things like that because of
some really intrinsic design problems
but because that's pretty much gone and
people don't use that you might think
the job is actually really good and
secure but as you'll see actually there
are still vulnerable ities right and it
says we're currently getting down to
about you know fixing ten of these per
release so there are the numbers in
chart form 2013 I can't do the Latin
thing but you know really bad and then
he got better okay so the stats of those
things are yes a lot are in the applet
and browser space and there's a lot and
also untrusted we'll talk about that in
a second untrusted code untrusted data
cryptographic and a few others so
there's still stuff looking around so
let's move this move on so let's talk
about how they get in untrusted code
untrusted code is literally that is
bypassing your security manager I find
ways around it they talk about
client-side but actually it's server
side as well there are lots of places
where you can these one debilities come
out and again you there are the old
classifier that you have partial
bypasses where you can get some
information full bar bypasses we can get
a code right
vulnerabilities that let you run things
as routes right
and there any good really good news is
of course with with applets going away a
lot of a lot of those attack vectors are
being over being removed but untrusted
code is still potentially possible so I
think with an intercept I'm all can move
on from that one untrusted data so this
is where data comes into your system and
you don't validate it
right that's the thing like we're very
good at making writing code that's
flexible and without checking the data
that comes through and so that means
people will find vulnerabilities in that
and exploit you they'll realize that you
are uploading data you're validating and
your shimmies in some standard form and
maybe you then execute it or you know
you are you it's a piece of it's a SQL
inquiry SQL query those sorts of things
right the cryptographic ones are in
various places there Reena there are
obvious places where people have
realized that the security the
cryptographic process is broken and you
need to upgrade with some examples of
that but there are also places where
we've cryptographic is also about
exploiting the weaknesses in the
cryptographic code not just about the
fact that it's a yoga the the the
cryptographic albergue algorithm is
broken it's also there are
vulnerabilities in that code as well so
they get they can get lumped together
then there's local attacks where you've
given people access and because it's
useful to give people root root access
etcetera because it makes your life
easier
you then run the risk of the person
you've given it to doing something they
shouldn't do inserting code there is a
fraction of people out in the world who
will take money because they have a
grudge against their company and would
insert things like that okay so loads of
vectors right let's talk about one
serialization that's the best one I love
this so serialization has got a special
place in my heart because it's so full
of nice places for working around things
because of the design of serialization
people forget that when you deserialize
objects using serialization you're
driving a code path that is not the same
as if you constructed the object okd
serialization bypasses a lot of checks
unless you specifically done something
about it so this one well they call
gadget chains
this this shows you why this is not this
stuff is not smoking gun
so at the example would be what should
we use I know so let's suppose that you
can find a piece of code that uses calls
runtime dot exec right like Apache
Commons okay but it doesn't have to be a
cure patchy comments it's just the basic
problem of I find a piece of code that I
can that I can called runtime topic
thing so I can construct through
serialization chains the because you're
not checking them you're just getting a
serialization data in and you just go
again construct a to construct a to
construct data I can construct an object
for any thickness on your class path so
if I can find out what's in your class
path or I just do it on spec I keep
trying it I can construct quite complex
objects right through these
serialization gadget chains I'm not
running any code unless maybe you've got
some specialized code running when you
deserialize but at the end of the day I
it's a way of being able to get your
arbitrary string being executed by a
code so if I can find some code that
will take some that will be the isafe
here's a class that's got some data and
I want to run then if I can construct
that class using serialization then I
can get you to do something okay so I
don't know much about what's happening
in to to 290 but um can we going to say
about 290 it's going to be white listing
of classes which are allowed to learn to
serialization so be a mechanism that you
can put in to be part of the base gel
but also then final applications they
can say these are the only types of
classes I'm so that should help
providing you guys make use of white
this thing today and and yeah yeah and
again detention is from a vulnerability
point of views is that these
technologies we're doing things to fix
them but developers are very good at
making things flexible
there's the flexibility that can bite
you so that's all very dry tack vectors
and group
processes and things like that simply
have some examples now I have a few
examples I have set examples we are not
going to pop CV numbers I'm not going to
put you a code I'm going to try and be
as obscure as possible so that if you
haven't had this thing fixed you need to
go get it fixed so with these examples
there's some of the stuff you can go
google for right so here's a really good
example this is one around for ages this
researcher found that by doing the right
sort of calculation you could hang the
CPU so it was I was it that just putting
a number in there some calculations
involved but you end up going if I can
get this number into your system then I
will hang your angular computer right
and it was Abel's everywhere and of
course it said yeah it can be fast as
XML document it could be anywhere this
number could get in in a and so somebody
could be on you it could be anything you
could calculate it and pass it in or it
can be passed in and the end of the day
your system Hanks alright that was a
good one right and you've got denial of
service attack cut out that really
simple one if I can get the number to
you the important thing is CVS scores
low okay because people don't always
understand the consequences of the
problem so you you have to be you know
checking these things so we spent a lot
of money everybody spent a lot of money
fixing this because it was so easy to
create once people knew was available
and how to do it we knew that everyone
that was going to a lot of people trying
to make it happen ok so here's the next
one
Patti struts I'm mishandling it request
data right untrusted as it says
untrusted string data passenger on Tom
exec
but it's not easy to describe because it
was a series of events that took place
to get to the point where that would go
wrong okay the thing about this one that
stands out is is that it was exploited
alright and as soon as somebody said I
have a fix for something right if you
sort of go I have a fix a really
complicated dangerous problem people
will be watching once they know that
that problem exists then there's like
give me your credit card details of it
eventually you have to fess up and say
I've got a fix for a problem and if I
tell you this a really bad problem then
you know by consequence of that will be
do a piece a lot of people who are going
how can i exploit it right so the theta
it was actively exploited straight away
and it was easy to find security
vulnerabilities you've got a really
you've got a vulnerability in your
system and I can find that you've got it
and I can exploit it quickly right and
another characteristics of the
vulnerability problem is that it can be
in all sorts of code it can get copied
it can get reused
there are variations of it and it can
spread around which is why we have the
CVE process in the first place is so
that you can at least track that problem
somebody fesses up so they fixed it you
now know the problem has been fixed and
that's basically because it's the same
common problem even if you're not sure
the details at least you can track that
the specifics then there are examples
where we're just silly jdw piece this is
a great tool for people to use if you
want to debug however it's not good to
let that port be available publicly
right because people can then connect to
your server and they can read all your
data and they can make your code do
whatever they want because they have
access to the debug console on point
found by reached researcher after a
simple port scan right nowadays port
scanning is obviously something happens
instantly nowadays if you deploy a new
server on the internet you can expect to
be probed within 15
seconds and you can expect to have a
target attack within 40 minutes all
right so these sorts of things are just
you just gone to that right trouble is
of course you don't realize you're doing
it or you're doing it because you're
doing it because it's the right thing to
do for you as a developer right bad
thing to do the allow sideloading
vulnerabilities it's the same thing as
all these others is that is I found a
hole in your code right where you're
being useful when you're saying a type
in here what you'll need to do give me
the full path or something I want to do
an exploit in that is connect so so it's
a code exploit connected to new writings
and codes to allow generic things to
happen and because there's you're not
thinking about that consequence of if
anybody can do this they can do also
they could do bad things you end up with
situations where you get malicious code
planted because you've given people
access to things right right so this is
the similar sorts of problems that we
all talk about we know about SQL
injection and how you're supposed to be
validating the data okay so we get that
but actually everything where you're
using data that is from your from your
system or from other other machines you
should be thinking very hard about how
you're validating the data constraining
it right and every time that you create
some cool tool that allows something to
do cool developer stuff think about the
consequences and how you lock that down
so it's not actually accessible at
runtime or production time so I said
vulnerability is a bug right which can
make selecting a tacher
it's also a feature if you've written a
feature that could also be a
vulnerability and also I've just said is
anything that you add into this system
for your benefits can also be a
vulnerability right because people will
exploit what you're doing to help
yourself
and it's a very classic way nowadays of
create for getting into systems is to
find the developer backdoors that
they've added
which you may easily share with other
people so that's the anatomy of
vulnerabilities so we I've got 15
minutes left because I was assuming you
guys were gonna ask me questions so
either I will talk too fast or your
enthralled or what so summary you have
to keep current absolute nowadays right
you need to be getting your sister your
system to the point where all that can
be exploited or what they call zero day
vulnerabilities which ones have just
been discovered right if you if your
system relies on old software that has
known wonder what it is then you are at
risk so keeping current is the most
important thing to do and I know people
go what I can't keep carrying cluster
testings well because of the fact that
we have some really nasty people out
there trying to exploit you you have to
get the balance right today yeah JD case
have an expiry date field in yes
so they explode they stopped running
yeah yeah so I say you know keep current
compartmentalize is another good way
around this we do things like micro
service designed stuff which are
beginning to how can sort of incidental
ways but actually you've got to be
thinking about not having people have
full access to everything and how you
should construct your application so
that you keep these separation as you
know it's that it's the bulkhead idea
don't let people in have access to
everything so I said micro services are
really cool ways of separating that and
things like docker and that will give
you a compartmentalization by default
but sorry somebody's putting their hands
up yeah
yeah yeah so I think your your assertion
is is that you can easily lock down jwp
because you know the address
absolutely but that Bank didn't right
it's not you're totally right but you
can secure these things but it's the
fact that people don't and they either
don't because they yeah it's dead versus
Oaks but actually people don't realize
when you give an ops team some code and
they run it and it says I've got that
some ports are open they may not
challenging my do some I t's will go I
shop some like you open a port yeah yes
so compartments like designed for
intrusion start thinking hard about
whether the what you'll be doing in
terms of helping people and helping
yourself is giving away too much
information and how it could be
exploited when you start to get your
head around how you're put your own
white hat on and start thinking about
when you write code how how much of the
helpfulness the genero sizing the I can
do anything here approach is going to
make you vulnerable and I would also
suggest in general that you go down to
that penetration testing it's not a Java
thing but when you go see what the
guides do to you know professional
penetrators who are looking to get into
your system happens a lot they will show
you how they get in and you'll be quite
surprised at some of the easy things
they do to get in and some of the social
engineering they do to get you to give
some of the secrets up because you may
think you're very secure but actually
generally these guys are very good at
winking out those edges so if you go see
the basics that they do then that gives
you the you know more information about
how you would construct your system so
that you're less vulnerable right and
again so there's a handle back but I
please
static code analyzers how do I feel
about static code downloads is okay so I
think they're good yeah we use them
I like static code analyzers that you
have ways to turn off false positives
right that's my history of starting
analyzers is static analyzers that warn
you about the same thing over and over
again which you go yes I accept then you
get noise and then you if the tooling
becomes less useful because you then go
to sort out the new warnings and the old
warnings but in general yeah absolutely
any of these systems that can help you
identify issues I mean you get
vulnerabilities because you're not doing
quite the right balance checking around
when you're processing arrays and things
like that's a static code that will tell
you that you've got potential bugs or
you're not accessing all the code
correctly will help you identify whether
you've got you know yes yes yeah Tim
says it's like lint it catches the
low-level stuff yeah there are people
you can pay he will come in and review
your code and tell you whether or not
you have one written I'm not sure to
tell you whether you what the
vulnerability is but there we go yeah so
technically I think I've said most this
stuff
don't write custom stuff unless you know
what you're doing
all right don't write the very very very
trusted cluster manager please just
don't do that one think about I mean I
mean what can I say there you know these
things right you know about what's
happening here you know you've you've
heard all about bad serialization and
how fun will have fun abilities get in
the takeaway is that it's not ever do it
which is never evident to you when you
write code unless you're thinking about
it when you write the beginning why am I
doing this what bad things can happen
okay because if you go if you put your
happy hat on and go this is really cool
I can do all these cool stuff course you
can but possibly so from other people
who exploit that all right so when
you're writing your custom crypto code
don't do that when you're writing your
custom XML parsers you know all these
things
it's bypassing the security systems are
things to do turning them off which is
another classic is it's not only about
things like writing the very very
trusted security manager it's other
things outside jobs per se but it's like
using W get and turning off each SSL
checking or in these tools getting code
from may even repositories without
thinking about security these are all
important things when you download the
next version of something from maven
central what do you have in terms of
your processes check to see what see
these have been addressed in that and
and I suspect the answer you won't even
think haven't even been thinking about
it
so ok that's it thank you very much for
for listening to the vulnerability rant
and there any questions do you feel more
informed are you going to go away and
write more secure code good thank you
I will put these slides up so have I
heard of or attack yes have I seeing
that specific stuff no not personally
Tim's nodding his head do you want to so
I haven't you getting angry
but yeah I'm aware of our techno we have
spoken to those guys it's a very
interesting solution it's got I can say
cigars virtualized environments it kind
of fits in with all the other stuff that
we're doing
back in the day yeah we're at first
light VM so I haven't used it on guys I
don't know yeah successful yeah I I
think though it's all this stuff is good
but I see people chucking large amount
of money to solve some of these problems
in quite weird ways like you know the
ideas like having encrypted JVMs and
things but actually so much of this is
just really simple so much of the
vulnerabilities are not realizing that
that it's a bit of code I mean to be
honest a lot of stuff you wouldn't even
as we wouldn't like it you'd write the
code you know what's wrong with that and
the fact that somebody else is chaining
these things together I think so many of
the vulnerabilities that I've seen are
all of that really straightforward thing
all those really weird things with the
double number I mean you're never going
to spot that one so I'd say the takeaway
is not go get really big solutions to
the problem the thing is too edgy okay
educate yourself the way you design and
write your code so that you're more
aware of the consequences of your
actions from the developer points we
have no security point of view it was
because many complements together how we
do at IBM I guess this we've got a cap
to being a large process and being a
large company of course there's a
process around the whole development
cycle and so as a single stated people
feed insecurity issues into a
deliverable from a variety of different
channels so obviously we're receiving
things from external researchers and
were those links life the underlined
links you can you know present a new yes
because the the the link sending
vulnerability reports to Oracle idea
second all right
Oracle to come and IBM HP certain idea
not come I believe yeah and the open JDK
project is starting up a vulnerability
group where you've got to report things
into the open source project but without
making it publicly available for
everybody to see to be made available
just to a core team at open JDK you
can't work on this
and so yeah we get some reports in that
way and but obviously a lot of the code
is being originally authored by by folks
inside IBM and large companies and so we
do have a process around what happens
when you develop a new feature and you
know developers will have a design for
it they'll be working on it and we ask
certain questions about the nature of
the feature they're adding and so such
things as you know are you accepting
data from an untrusted source and so of
course that has to be flagged as being
what I'm looking for
you know I think has to be cleaned
before it's using sign system was a word
for anything go back I just got back and
are you handling sensitive data as in
flight or statically managed on disk or
casas network communication and so you
have to actually encrypt and decrypt
some of that stuff and and it's a whole
bunch of different areas in which we
check whether the features are being
added in there having a security impact
around them and so we kind of have a
secure engineering practice another step
that you have to ensure is if you have
any dependencies if you're adding in any
dependencies into the application from a
third party then it actually triggers a
whole bunch of new systems Louis as
Steve mentioned earlier we do like a
pedigree review to find out who wrote
our code and not only because we
interested in the license allow us to
reuse it but also was it written in a
manner which is going to be dear to our
secure engineering standards as well and
so we'll end up doing some reviews on
those codes depending on where they come
from because obviously a lot of the
products that IBM has and we passed
downstream well will be warranted by IBM
so there's any problems in the
third-party code it actually comes back
to our responsibility to to get those
things fixed or be responsible for the
losses that the company is using it time
it may have suffered and again as we've
mentioned any third-party dependencies
you can do that analysis at a point in
time but you'll be expected to keep that
up to date and so it was an ongoing
mechanism by
we have to ensure that we're monitoring
for any vulnerabilities occur in those
and then finally what is it organic gets
put together when some features have
been delivered and shipped as part of
the product then there's a general
security testing where we do the static
analysis and we have a look folks who
look at the overall security of the
system to make sure it works well so so
the point is and yes there's a role for
a developer but it's part of a much
bigger process of ensuring the security
of the entire system end-to-end yeah
okay thank you
so I have a question just Barth
aggressive Security's so I we put this
together based on what we thought people
we interest in to in terms of job
hundred versus I haven't missed anything
cows or anything that you would like to
have heard that we didn't cover apart
from giving you a total examples of real
code okay cool okay so there's a
question
so yeah Arthur yes so other yeah other
tools to do to check against the CVE
days but yet we're so they're beginning
to turn up so I mean our our our cloud
has some stuff built in but docker for
instance has checks where they all list
the vulnerabilities now I don't know
whether it's got down to two maven votre
ceinture
sorry lotion hi so there's a quite quite
a good product that I've seen called
version I which keeps track holes so you
can plug a tap on file and you'll go
through the false or transitive closure
your dependencies and look at the
versions and report back to you whether
that's got a known vulnerability to any
of those versions yeah cool thank you to
that house question yeah cool thanks
okay um wow this is one minute thank you
very much I'll give you our money back
thank you for listening</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
