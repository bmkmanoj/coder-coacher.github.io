session about art of parsing and serve
her a little delay my name is yevgeny
mundra curve and i work at sooner source
company together with my colleague at
the spare time i also work on some other
projects that you might know like jacoco
and my name is Nicola Barry I'm working
also two nozzles I'm working on the job
that he canna leiser developer tuna
sauce soy sauce is the company behind
soloq formerly known as solar and today
we are going to talk about parsing but I
just want to explain a bit where we come
from at Colossus we started the products
on a cube solid as an aggregator of
different tools liked in the textile and
at one point we needed to to help more
rules so we started developing our own
static analyzers and so that we needed
to parse encode a while for Java and C
sharp you can find some existing parsers
ok even for C C++ you could use selangor
EDG compiles compilers definitely you
can't find any existing parser for such
exotic languages of Kobol and that's
where all started we needed to analyze
Kabul so we develop it our own
technologies to do that and nowadays you
might think that bar sink is a problem
that is soft but it is actually not we
have a little code and exercise it's on
our source for for interview we have to
implement a simple calculator forth met
expressions and it turns out that while
parson kiss heavily learn it in
university afterwards that successfully
forgotten and this is incredibly hard
task so today we're going to ya today we
are going to understand why
one example of parser for athletic
expressions on example of parser for
simple constructions from Java finally
we're going to implement within 30
minutes a parser for c++ it is I don't
read where it takes you two years
actually if you are doing that yeah we
can do nowadays we can do in 30 minutes
and we are going to answer on the
questions why all the compilers why do
they use handwritten parsers instead of
parser generators so okay so I'm gonna
play the night guy here so I want to
create a parcel so why well if how hot
can it be I do want to create a parser
for java language so let's actually do
it nicely I will just take the Java
grammar put it in a parser generator and
we should be done okay but well in fact
it's not dead up just because if i look
at the Java language specification the
GLS 7 I have actually two runners in
there one that is readable for humans
another one that is suited for passage
in alto but then if i look at GLS 8 the
grammar for pathos in a tub is actually
gone so that's a bit weird and then if i
look at GD k i have also Nova grammarly
finder and then there was a project to
have a puzzle generator for Derek which
dies so actually if you need that
doesn't that seems a bit confusing so
why so why so many languages wait so
many grammar sorry yeah so we're going
to see why the grammar which is suitable
for parser generators disappear it from
GLS let's say that the reason for that
says we're going to show that such
grammar is quite hard to maintain and as
it is not useful for humans it's it's
mostly useful for generators and not so
many people would like to write a parser
for java there was a decision instead of
maintain it to get rid of it
and yes we also going to show why idea
to use the parser generator is not a
good idea so let's start from an answer
and you Nicola might knows it's
Universal answer is 42 it but the game
jokes apart a little bit spew of a
theory what grammar is grammar consists
of grammar productions each grammar
production on the left-hand side
contains some non terminals on the
right-hand side it contains some
terminals we also going to call them
tokens yeah and this is a grammar also
grammar production might have multiple
alternatives like in this example we do
have a definition for digit what is
digital it is either 0 either one and so
on till till nine and this is
alternative so this is annotations that
we are going to use to express grammars
and let's start from something really
simple let's try to write down the
grammar for arithmetic expressions
containing only subtractions before we
do this let's just just agree on what
should be the result here can you count
Nikolai 4-3 that should be 1-2 we should
get minus 1 I do hope that everyone
agrees with that result yeah so the goal
is to write a little grammar and a
little parser which is going to produce
this result okay so let's try it try
this out so actually what we have here
is we have a subtraction which consists
of two apparent and then we actually the
operon can be either an over subtraction
or or a number so you go i have my
grammar here which have to alternative
ques- expression or a number so let's
try to actually use that drummer to
parse things then so I can actually do
that by saying okay so the minus two is
so let's have the first subtraction so 4
minus 3 will be an express
minus an over- the number and then for
ministry is actually a number of mine is
a number so that we as well and that how
I can actually get my result what about
this right here in fact I consider the
right over and a 3-2 so that's work out
well and then I have 10 parents are
actually okay hold on there's something
fishy here I can produce to syntax tree
from the same grammar so which one the
computer will choose let's roll a dice
actually can you help here yeah indeed
there is ambiguity while this grammar is
easily read by a human it doesn't suit
for compiler generator for parser
generators exactly because there is
multiple choices and it's unclear which
one to take and depends on concern one
taken parse tree syntax tree going to be
different and so going to produce a
different result we can fix this grammar
we can either do what is shown on the on
the top or what is shown on the bottom
the top top one is called left recursive
we change it the rightmost expression on
a number this allows us to encode
actually left of its activity of
expressions and the bottom one just for
example it is unambiguous it allows to
in God's right assets activity of
expressions of operators and we we don't
need this but for a shaker for example
is shown so given the correct grammar on
the top can you now implement a little
bar sir n equal yeah of course so let's
cook things that was fast now what I
will do actually here to implement a
parser for this I will apply simple
principles you have one method for each
grammar rule and so here what i will do
it it so i will have this method for
expression and then i will actually
parse mer which will give me the result
and as long as I see a talking minus I
will actually continue to consume
number and make the selection and then I
will reach on my result you go yeah well
danica let's a little bit complicated
task for you let's add one moderator
which is multiplication before we do
this let's again agree on the answer I
guess it should be minus two someone
disagree no okay so people are good at
much yeah so let's try to write a
grammar for this now okay so actually
it's kind of the same thing we did
previously right so we did that for
subtraction let's just had an
alternative for multiplication the same
way so there you go I just helped the
alternative for multiplication in my
grammar but and along there's something
fishy inside because here how will the
parser react we will parse having a
number at the at the top at the right of
the expression and then star so that
means we will have an expression and
this expression will be a subtraction so
in fact what we will end up with its
four minus three x 2 which is 2 which is
the wrong well so again I may have
missed something here yeah you missed
something in fact in order to so we
learn it how to encode a society VT but
in order to encode the president's we
need another trick and this as a trick
is introduction of new non terminals and
new production so we're going to
introduce one for multiplication and
using against a trick for left of
subjectivity we gonna and codes that
multiplication is also left a subjective
and this grammar is going to give us a
right parse string so can you implement
a parser given the solution oh no that I
have the right grammar I can implement
following the same principle of one
method / grammar rule and so i will have
the subtraction implemented to actually
part first in multiplication while I
continue to c minus taken I actually
subtract the results parsing
multiplication
and formative vacation i have like
exactly the same principle so I part
number and then why I see a token which
is multiplication I actually multiply
the result and then return it so here
the nice thing is that know how I've
actually president's correctly included
in the grammar and the parsing so
congratulations Nick Allah we just so
and let's say reinvent it somewhat very
well-known which is called ll one it's
known science 1969 this is a way to
express grammars and write a parsers
based on those grammars which use want I
can look ahead which is just just one
token to make a decision they don't
handle well left recursion that's what
you saw because instead of doing a
recursive calls we did a trick using a
wire loops as you so they don't deal
with ambiguities that might be in
grammar so you need to solve all the
ambiguous cases by modifications of
grammars and it's a process to all this
as a tree though it's easy to write by
hand a parser bases on an ll 1 grammar
as was shown so let's move forward let's
do a real deal ok let's try to write a
parser for a little part of a Java
grammar consistent of expression and at
Cole assignment ok so I have the grammar
here and i will charge you into the
parser but here the forum is that if i
try to do the same trick as before with
one method by rule i will have trouble
with expression because no matter what I
do I can't actually choose the
alternative for expression because they
will all start with an ID so i will have
no possibility to choose which to choose
the correct alternative between
qualifier limited current assignment for
expression so in fact i'm a bit stuck
here to be able to
my parser from that grammar yes so the
problem again is that a little ones is
it they take one second of look ahead
and here one token it always will be I
de venta fire it's not enough to make a
decision and the solution in a lil one
way is to do a little let's say
refactoring of grammar factor out common
parts and introduce new non terminals
for the factor it out productions so
here is what exactly what we do we put
qualify tidy out into the expression and
so after parson qualified 18 expression
we now can make a choice because method
call starts unambiguously from opening
parenthesis assignment starts from
equality and just qualified ID is going
to have ID and with it so that means no
i can actually make the implementation
based that's a grammar so applying the
same principle i will have the
expression doing exactly what chef Kenny
just described so I will consume
qualified any then if the token is
actually in opening parenthesis I know
I'm going to consumer me not cool and
then if the token is actually equal then
I know it's an assignment if I have or
and then if I nothing it's going to be a
select ok but then that's one thing and
then there's the reality singing that
this huge current is actually from javac
so as you can see in the URL displayed
so it's on recent part it's an internal
file at stealing the GDK and what's
interesting that's not going to
disappear it is necessary is jerrick
parser and the thing is that it's
interesting to adjust the first apply
actually because of Java me to look at
some contacts are ambiguous in the
prison I presentation what does that
mean that means that switch type
annotation introduced in Java 8 actually
we can end up in cases where we have no
way to decide which alternative we want
to take and that's actually that's
actually one of the reason why we
henredon parsers in some way because we
can't easily rewrite the grammar to have
a single bottle no actually this is
exactly what happens you can say right
grammar and that's what you do if you
want to have ll1 grammar and so ll 1
parser and usually handwritten parsers
the kind of l1 this is what we see in
exactly what we see in jhalak
handwritten parsers they have an
advantage over parser generators they
give you an ability to provide precise
here reporting because they give you an
ability to do some smart here recovery
compared to what you can generate
automatically the the fact that they
just need to want I can look ahead and
heavily refactor it and optimized
grammar this gives you gives you the
best performances exactly what you need
from a real-life compiler you don't want
to wait you're built for ever you wanna
best performance but at the downside all
this comes with a maintenance hell you
end up writing and explain and such
grammar refactorings as the one we we
see in jarek and sit let's move forward
so a little recap on a lil one usage of
ll 1 grammars requires major grammar
changes on the other hand with some
additional tricks on steroids as in
parser generator java sea it's actually
usable for real languages and although
in fact instead of rewriting the grammar
I have an idea why don't we try every
alternative and we actually choose the
first one that doesn't fail so the
example we took fourth efficient let's
actually try to post qualify ID that
doesn't work let's get let's try parsing
method call and if that doesn't work
let's try parsing assignment yeah great
idea Nicola except that maybe they
shouldn't use
package but the case is your God's with
a refractor it later but ID is indeed
grad we can use so-called ordered choice
indeed we can try alternatives in the
sequence also what's not great in your
example you again for God's that you
shouldn't start with qualified tidy yeah
you should you should swap a little bit
if indeed we first try to parse
assignment and this succeeds and we
definitely looking on assignment if if
this doesn't succeed then we probably
look and consumption curves we can try
and edit go and so and congratulations
Nikolai yo great ID is actually also
well known its parsing expression
grammars it's back to 2000 to the formal
the only difference in the formalism
that parsing expression grammars they
use of the rotters relations that of a
parrot or pipe which means order it
choice in order to implement this order
a choice usually use a backtracking
algorithm maybe you will memorize some
choices to to improve performances again
as with ll one such grammars they don't
cut with the left recursion so again
you're going to have loops instead of
recursive calls again there is no way to
encode ambiguities and grammar you still
need to adopt its to be unambiguous they
again three though FLL one and on
practice we observes that such grammars
require fewer grammar changes compared
to the one that is suitable for for
humans for for reading and on the
practice it's it's actually usable for
real languages to be more precise I
don't know for 22 out of 24 languages we
we have ads on our source we use parsing
expression grammar so they they're quite
good on practice but actually we tried
to use parse expression drummers for
such a language at C C++ and we actually
find it
this is a dead end for such language
chance we are going to show you why and
speaking of parsing expression grammar
we actually have a tool to generate a
parser for based on the grammar of based
on on a dsl to express that grammar so
these two ssl are and well it took us
all so you can actually check it out and
that's what the i ljv any pointed out
that's what we use for our most of the
languages with support for sonarqube a
colossus and so we have this movie
yourself to express its a non-terminal
and its alternative with the different
kind of of other choices okay you look a
little bit tired nicola maybe too much
at like just like just like know me too
much beer so definitely just like maybe
we should take a little break okay so
time for quiz hey so here is a small jar
program and the question is what this
will actually print out who thinks it's
gonna be food someone know who thinks
that it's going to be bar okay who
thinks that it's gonna crash okay so
it's not going to crash maybe it's not
going to print anything okay just one
what others think there seems there are
options yeah some people didn't answer
we saw that yeah but okay sorry compile
earlier yeah yeah okay well actually it
will print out nothing is not Mario it
without nothing because here is the
dangling elf problem that you may know
the idea here is that we pay expression
grammar you can express the fact that
you have ordered alternative and we will
actually try to first part if statement
without our clothes and if we don't have
an ethical then we will pass a statement
and what happens in this example that
means that the else is attached
to what happens they're not modern in
that example actually the earth is
actually attached to the closest
statement so that means here of the
first if is false it has no else close
it will print out nothing just a trick
on Hammadi and so let me correct you a
little bit this is not because of a peck
this sexually clearly written in Java
language specification and in many other
languages that else in such cases attach
it to the closest if and this dumb
blinkers problem is an example of
ambiguity which exists in all the
languages and nice thing about Peggy's
indeed that by properly ordering kultur
natives we easily can solve such a
problem let's move on and let's talk
about Java Java is awesome so another
crease given that there is some Java
code and I just hide it everything
except of five characters can you tell
me what this is you can find a team in
general program oh come on your Java
developers this should be fairly easy
and as I did yeah I did no that's not
right here the question is there is a
java program I hide it everything except
of five characters what those five
characters representing this a big
program
okay the Dukakis cast of what there is
no construction in Java which starts
from a star but multiplication yeah it's
correct it's it is a multiplication
there is no ambiguity Java it couldn't
be enjoy it couldn't be something else
it is a multiplication a case there is
redundant parenthesis just because this
code was written by Nicola but but
that's fine I did that so job is really
awesome except of dangling cows problem
which is easily solvable there is no
other examples of misinterpretations or
ambiguity and C++ on the other hand it's
all the pains of the world indeed exact
same expression in different contexts it
it can either be a multiplication like
in Java but if a is the types and it
actually can be a cast so you was right
you just forgot to mention about which
one we should talk and so yeah in C++ or
in see if a is the type then we can have
a cast to type a of something which is
the reference of a pointer and pointer
is being and this introduces a problem
Nicola maybe you can try to write a
parser and show what the problem is
actually if he for you this SLR it small
dsl then in fact no matter how i will
order the alternatives i count actually
parse the other one I will always parse
the first one and won't be able to reach
the over alternative like i mean if i
have the typecast at first we always
pass wings of the podcast and wouldn't
be able to pass notification and in the
other side i have put multiplication at
first i will be able to parse that cast
so here we take parsing i don't see how
I could overcome this yeah so for none
of not for ll 1 not for peg not for a
handwritten parser you can't actually
imagine an order in which you should put
two productions to get the correct
result so that's why C C++ is ultimately
hard to parse because there is a chicken
and egg problem in order to parse some
thinking you need to have a knowledge
whether in this particular case where a
is a type or not and to get this
knowledge we know that we need to run a
semantic analysis semantic analysis
already requires that you parse it a
part of your program so we end up with
the fact that in order to parse you need
to parse which is which is tricky but
but in fact this is also a solid problem
and this was forgotten actually so
called generalized parsers that can cut
with with ambiguous grammars they do
exist for a very long time I first known
such parser called early back to
nineteen sixty-eight it well it existed
not usable at all practically because it
has awful performances then in 84 there
was a parents of so called generalized
allure it's way faster than early but on
practice it's way more complex to
implement it gives you a completely non
understandable your messages and it's
hard to the back because it's complex
and then somewhat quite written to
generalize it ll back to 2010 they exist
something like five papers about gll it
is fast it is not that complex to
understand and it gives practically
usable your messages and in case
something goes fog and so a little
explanation of how generalized parsers
work in particular GL essent eggs they
try to
bars all the possible alternatives they
do this let's say in parallel and using
a technique to minimize the results and
using a special three which is actually
not a tree but the first of all possible
interpretations of over text how they
could be parsad innocent extreme they
did they build for you all the possible
interpretations and given access for
such a crazy trip so they have an
advantage that they can deal with
ambiguous grammars giving you all the
possible alternatives and at the same
time this also a disadvantage because
afterwards you need to deal with that
for example the problem that is easily
solvable with the back which is dangling
cause problem it appears again you need
to solve it after you get the parts
first but on the other side we do think
that for heavy land big use grammar such
as C C++ this is the only clean choice
because you can clearly separate your
stages you can clearly separate semantic
analysis from a person you do a person
you get a forest of all possible
interpretations and then you just need
to annotate this forest with the type of
information and decide which
alternatives are really correct and
which ones are not correct so this
doesn't leave any grammar behind it
accepts it doesn't require any tricks
any modifications and grammar to support
left recursive rules it had septs
ambiguous grammars as was already said
it gives a reasonable performance on
practice we use this for C C++ and
compare it to a real-life compilers we
don't see a big performance degradation
unfortunately as of today there is only
academic tools to use it we do have our
two but it's
unfortunately not yet open sourced um
but yeah definitely if if you need to
deal with ambiguous grammars you can
pick up those papers and and get the
parser done so a little recap of what
was said unfortunately even Zeus bar
sink is studied in universities and then
successfully forgotten unfortunately it
is problems that is well known but not
really well solved there is no silver
bullet depending on what your goals are
you might choose a different approach if
you goal is to write a real compiler for
real programming language then you
probably want a good year recovery a
good your messages and speed so you'd
better go with something like ll one or
handwritten if you can sacrifice
performance like we are on a speed of
development and on ease of maintenance
like we are its owner sirs and you can
go for parsing expression grammars yawns
III for example we are not going to have
any headaches to support java 9 we go
just tune a little bit grammar we hadn't
much headaches support java 8 even those
java compiler has a big comment
explaining which changes are required
and yeah if you need to parse something
heavily ambiguous we do think that there
is no clean choice others and
generalized parcels and that's it so we
hope this talk was useful for you if
you're going to invent a new language
and you will need a compiler for it or
it was useful for you to remind what is
behind the tools which use on a daily
basis ids gel compilers and some and if
you have any questions you're welcome
a little star yes yes sorry let me
repeat the question did we consider it
usage of allows star parser and here I
think you refer to Aunt Eller which I
think for free here switch the
technology and they do provide a little
star bar so we consider this while this
is a good choice for languages like Java
what else may be fussy sharp and so on
so basically this is a good choice for
languages where you don't have fun the
gates again if you have see it was
fastened you have fun beginners a little
star is not going to give you anything
because a little star again produces
hear a single parse tree so you need to
encode a choice into your grammar and
for ambiguous languages it's not
possible other examples of languages
where it's not going to really fit is
Ruby which also ambiguous and some um
yeah what else to say that's pretty much
it
C++ C are not gonna fix it but yellow
star is is a good choice for father
let's say for the good languages and all
the modern languages they learn that
experience of seeds they learn at
experience of suppose faso usually don't
do is the same mistake by introduction
into your language something which is
ambiguous even for a human eyes so yes
for for waste majority I don't know 495
languages in the world a lot of star is
a good chess and the good that we have
until our to this is it that we can use
other questions
oh yeah okay there is a reason at the
time we started developing our analyzers
a lot of star was not in place there was
until our based on previous technology
which is closer letter assemblies what's
becky's but also at the time until ur
had awful performances until are good
decent performances only with a switch
to a little star so at that time we
decided to give a try for parsing
expression grammars and this was even
also also at the time we were writing a
parser for COBOL and somehow parsing
expression grammars are quite good for
languages for which you don't have a
complete specification for a languages
where you need to play a lot of tricks
with with your recovery so for cobalt
back was definitely a good choice more
questions
it's not thank you for your time very
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
