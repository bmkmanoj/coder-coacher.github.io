hello everybody thank you for coming to
our talk my name is Coty ceci I work for
Perot site and this is Antonio Goncalves
and I'm actually an author for
Pluralsight awesome so we're going to be
talking about the pro side experience
and what's involved in it but before we
do that let's talk a bit about Perot
site I was going to ask how many people
here know about polar sides but I do
know the answer to that so we're going
to skip right through it so what is for
a site floor site is an online trading
company we do provide training for
developers creative professionals and IT
professionals as well we have 6,000
courses in our library and we are
present in 153 countries we are
headquartered in Farmington Utah we have
offices in Boston Chicago Oklahoma City
San Diego Orlando Florida Sydney
Australia London here in the UK and
Mumbai in India and that is the own idea
of just how what is the footprint of the
of the of the company now you might be
asking yourself as an author what
exactly is my impact what is the impact
of a typical PROSITE author after I tell
you
Antonio here has five forces in the
PROSITE library Java Eagle kosis Java is
specifically Java EE courses and last
year he reached 8,000 learners in 118
different countries now that should give
you an idea of when we say at float side
when we say we make a positive impact
every single day that's what we mean now
let's get to why we're here
let's let's discover later about the
process so Antonio tell me you have been
a pro site author for for your years for
year that's that's a long time isn't it
yeah and I'm finishing my six schools so
six course in four years awesome well
that's you know because that's a lot of
work so I do Java I mostly do Java EE so
when I was approached by to Laurel site
six years ago four years ago sorry I
thought good you know I'm going to
create hundreds of courses for the
platform and it appeared that the entire
experience of creating a new course
takes slightly longer alright just a few
hours so tell us about your process what
is your process like so the first thing
is the idea of a new course so as I said
I come from a Java background Java EE
background and so I have this idea of
creating a course on JPA
but I also have this idea of a course on
hibernate and I also had this idea of
you know mapping data to so a lot of
ideas in your head as an author that's
when you go back to Pluralsight and
because I'm followed by a by editor so
when you create a new course you are
followed from day one till till the very
end by one add etre so which a contact
point so I go to this guy or girl and
talk about my idea day roadmap you know
what do they have in day in day roadmap
for Java or Java EE in my case so
there's a bit of brainstorming I have
one idea they challenge it I challenge
it back so an idea or the new course can
come from an author me they're pushing
one idea but it can also come from the
company itself so I've been approached a
few times you know Here I am see
in Paris in front of Skype and you know
those guys in Utah and and WeChat and
they go well we have this idea of a new
course what what do you think so the
first step is an idea of a new course
which is quite interesting then we are
beside here I'm going to do a course on
JPA I am the expert so aMDA I'm going to
spend a bit of time writing the outline
that's actually the part I like the most
because I'm gonna have to create a
course on JPA or Java EE creating a
course on Java EE a four or five hour
course on Java EE it's it's quite tricky
because Java EE you could spend days you
know you could do a course in days so
what am I going to talk about the
technology ABC and JP I JP a a CDI and
transaction and then you go yeah but not
this way around the other way around
because if I teach JP a first then
transaction and maybe you know injection
but injection etc etc so you spend a few
weeks creating the outline of your
course again with your editor it
challenges your outline and then you are
ready to go so I have my outline now I'm
going to start creating the content so I
create one slide and the second slide
the third slide I put a section I move
the section around because I'm changing
the outline you know at the same time so
this process is much much longer than
the outline you can take literally
months if you only work like me over the
weekends or day in day out so developing
slides you know a course can be four
hundred five hundred slides
again I'm followed by my editor who
tells me there's too much slaw a text on
this slide this animation is not good
the color is not proper while I'm
creating these 400 slides what I like
were to do is write down my transcript
so I have one slide what am I going to
say in this slide some people in you
know we improvise on the slide I tend to
write every single sentence so I'm
creating the slides creating the
transcripts in these animations slide
that on the text is written that's when
I start rehearsing so for a few weeks I
reuse in real scenarios so I have my
slides in front of me I have written
down my my transcript I press Next Next
Next
I read at the same time a loud loud
voice and again I move things around it
while while I'm speaking it loud I can
see that no this slide should be before
or there's a sentence missing or this
animation is too long then I'm ready I'm
ready to record that's a tricky part I
would say that's the most stressful part
Here I am in my office I fix pillows all
over I don't know when where I've heard
that corners are not good for the sounds
all right you know I put things on the
wall because it's going to absorb sound
yeah hopefully again the company created
a few movies too to explain you things
what microphone you should be using
what's the distance between the
microphone and your voice
tips drink water because when you're
thirsty you tend to create noises so
they have all these tips you know it's
like a checklist make sure the
microphone is on make sure these make
sure you have a bottle of water make
sure this and that and and I records
module per module and each time it's
finished I I post proverb product it I
what I do now is I have my slides I have
my my voice I recorded everything then
I'm going to a tool so I use Camtasia
and I cut bits I change things I
decrease the sound of the voice if it's
too low or too high if I hear my mouth
clicking I cut it you know so that stick
takes a lot of time I have my mp4 video
file it's finally done and now I push it
back to those guys so that is a it's a
very involved process obviously there is
a age I won't say painful but it it
demands a domestic patience to edit the
video to a point where someone you don't
know from somewhere would sit and watch
it and make sense out of it but then
when he is done he sent a video over to
ask what exactly happened behind the
scenes great question the first step is
the QA review and that what we mean by
peer review is somebody is going to sit
in Prague Rafi and editing system with I
Adobe Premiere or Camtasia and watch
every second of the videos submitted
we're doing this because we want to we
are we we made a promise to our audience
when they come to plot site to learn
they expect a certain level of quality
and we hold our our
authors to that quality they have to
deliver that so somebody has to sit down
and watch every minute of that submitted
video and then that is just the first
step once that video has been vetted
that in terms of audio quality in terms
of video quality in terms of
storytelling
everything is there now we go ahead to
the next step which is validating the
tech we have to have a peer reviewer
review the entire video to make sure
that you are not saying anything that is
practically untrue technically true but
practically untrue right or practically
true but technically untrue either way
we need to have someone with the
knowledge with a technical knowledge to
to vet that video after that validation
process there may be feedback or
there'll be no feedback if there is a
feedback then the editor is going to get
that feedback and set it over to Antonio
and I tell you have either sometimes
just do some quick fixes or have to go
back to the drawing board and we record
the entire module now needless to tell
you that that is not my favorite part
having to tell someone that hey by the
way you just spent four hours working on
this module the whole thing is crap you
have to redo it again it's not a fun
conversation I have to have that
conversation a few times and I don't
like them I don't like them so now if
there are no feedback then that you know
that module is validated and then we
move on to the next step the next step
is prepping for publication now this
includes the little you know as a little
bit of work there are some scripts to
prepare some some things to run make
sure for example when you're looking at
a course and you're looking at the
description of that course is the
description accurate enough when you go
watch the video somebody has to marry
the two right and then we also have to
look at tags how people can find your
course once it's in the library when you
come to library tab you type jax-rs and
you're looking for just just is are you
going to find something now if the
course has jack
rs content but it's not tagged then you
are not going to find it which is not
good then once all of that has been done
we push it over to s3 which is among
Amazon which is what we use to publish
the course and now the course is on the
website what happened next
next is the public Asia is a promotion
we have to send out newsletters we have
to push the course in many many
different ways we have a whole
department whose job is to make sure we
put your course in turn of learners we
push with put your course in front of
companies who are asking us for it or we
push it in front of you know we come to
conferences like Java where we expose
what we have demyx or we go to other
conferences we do I mean you guys have
seen me around quite a bit for those of
you who know me that's that's what I'm
doing but we also at the same time make
trying to make sure we get a new content
in because Java is a vast technology
stack and we have a lot but we still
need a lot more right so at the same
time what we're selling what we already
have we'll also need to getting some
some some new some some new content and
that is how the process work from both
the authors and of things and our end of
things now
here's what I'm going to ask you now
that you know how the process works how
about joining us and start creating
adding some of your own content to the
library right if you think about it here
reaching 2016 here is over 8,000 people
now if you break that down into
concurrent sessions I'm assuming for
every session you have about 200 people
right now that is over 40 sessions you
have to do over 40 sessions at a
conference to reach that number I'd say
it's not exclusive but you are reaching
more people thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
