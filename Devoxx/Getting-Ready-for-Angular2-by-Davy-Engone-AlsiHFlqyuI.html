don't know this guy over there 60 minute
left okay good afternoon again thank you
for all all of you for coming today and
you can see I'm shaking and that's
normal you guys are scaring the out
of me so here's the thing and we gotta
have fun today we're going to have fun
for an hour and trust me is going to be
just great and but I want to start with
something really simple how many people
here use JavaScript well okay I should
record that everyone how many people use
typescript so by the end of this talk I
hope when I say how many people will be
using typescript I want to see this we
have a deal great so let's start and my
name is Davy and going I'm a software
engineer at Phyllis lab and Sheila's lab
is just a JavaScript lab based in Berlin
belgium and we also do some activities
in Paris and and and amsterdam and soon
london so we love javascript and we do
that all day i mean at least 15 hours
per day and that is true guys you guys
do java all day at least eight hours
minimum so 15 hour is not that far so
and some people expect to have an agenda
here but i'm not going to give you an
agenda i'm going to give you a few goals
and one of them is of usually the type
scripting but the first one will be you
guys heard stories about angular a year
ago and i'm here to tell you that your
angular 1 skills are not going angular 2
is coming but your skills you build over
years or the last 23 years for those who
start using angular 1 hour still will
still be useful and I will just show you
few tricks that you can apply today that
will make you even more relevant in the
coming month second one is basically try
to understand which problem angular 2 is
trying to solve because of usually what
people forgot a year ago was like
angular has been around for like 2009 I
started using data 2011 so 2000 9 2014
makes five years hey guys five years in
the software engineering world it's just
too long and there are a lot of problems
that came by and a new tools is there to
solve those issues so I'm gonna try to
show you which problem they're trying to
solve and the last one will just be how
I guys going to get ready for angular 2
those are the three points and by the
end of this talk I just hope that you
guys feel like I was able to fulfill
them so um a little bit of history a
year ago was basically in October 2014
we saw this angular the angular team
announced that angular 2 will be a
complete rewrite and all the stuff and I
can see people in the rooms sending
tweets hate tweets like what the hell
have been using angular 1 and you guys
going to be writing everything from
scratch those are the things Ruby guys I
mean they're not even in the room saying
like okay it's making fun of angular you
saw those kind of tweets angular 2
migration has no migration path to Tori
right and stuff like that and this was
the best one like it just killed that
guy said and that guy is a well-known
guy or out there he just said remove
angular install react and I bet okay
raise your hand if you did that
okay two three four so I can understand
the fear at that moment right but I'm
here to tell you that we are human and
um we all have we wrote we write code
where we feel like okay that was okay
yesterday and the day after you just
feel like who wrote that thing and you
want to rewrite that from scratch so I
want to ask you a question quickly how
many people here I mean who doesn't
change is good who like the last few
days who wrote code like last week and
this week didn't think about let's
refactor that thing like someone who did
that actually you refactor is could this
week or just even the last five days why
did you do that because you had some you
realize that things were not the way
they're not the same as you are the
first time you write the thing so this
is what's happening with angular 2
because there is a problem so we gotta
solve those problems and move on so
angular 1 isn't going anywhere anytime
soon google has up to 1,600 applications
writing in angular 1 and by the time
angular 2 becomes mainstream we're in
Belgium right okay I have to win belgium
by the time angular 2 becomes mainstream
we still have at least two years so you
guys are fine but my goal is not to tell
you that you should you should wear two
years my girl she is to tell you that
you can start now so those are the
things that you saw the internet few
weeks ago Google telling the world that
we're here we going to support that
thing for a long time and the second one
is what everyone felt like oh there is
no migration path let me tell you
something there is one and it's super
easy
just before my talk and this is really
funny I went to this room how many
people went to the angular talk right
there so I heard like oh the migration
would be difficult and those kind of
stuff yeah there's some fear i can
understand developers when they see this
kind of stuff but trust me it is very
simple it is just like having fun and
realizing like you're going toward the
future now so this is the reality
angular 2 is this coming soon and
angular 1 isn't going anywhere and you
approve that so you should so um now I'm
just going to focus on one second I'm
going to focus on things you know or you
should know in 2015 and while using your
angular application and things you
should apply today that's going to make
you more relevant tomorrow but when I
said tomorrow by the end of the distal
you realize that actually tomorrow is
the mint immunity after my talk so one
of them is everything is a component the
web is turning itself as a set of
components who heard about web web
components here damn you guys don't
sleep at night sure you should be
cutting Java or I don't know you're
watching web components it's perfect and
react everyone heard about react here
like everything is a component and stuff
like that in angular there is this thing
called directive but directive
components when I said everything is a
component you should think about writing
your application as I start with a
component definition what I wanted to
look like and the nurse i implement this
behavior the second thing is use
controller as
who knows controller as in the room a
lot of NC space in the middle right
there and this this room is for okay so
okay we cannot fix that right now the
third one is I mean just to make sure
that the dollar scope controller as is
tied to dollar scope in angular that
deck leader service that was useful a
few years ago there is not any more and
he shouldn't exist in your code at all
so I'm saying that right now again if
you have dollar scope in your your could
buy for this afternoon pull your coat
remove that I mean it's just a reg ex
and you remove that and you inject
something else and you're good to go and
I explain you why you should be doing
that using it to use the module system
to turn your application into small
packages and I use the word packages in
that case because someone told me to Sky
java badass you should not talk about
modules then no packages so okay let's
put it packages because actually if you
can think of in terms of packages your
application becomes really modular and
the last one is the is the fact that you
can optionally a great your application
to the next version of JavaScript which
is called Essex or yes to 20 feet you
say that I mean they said to a TS 2015
but we use two thousand yes is es6 it's
simpler or you use typescript and I
would really recommend that so those are
I just list four steps for their more
than that if you go on internet you're
going to find more options but I'm just
focusing on those four for now because
we only have one hour so everything is a
component let's take this component it's
a simple one right when you see it you
know that well I have a card which has
a title and the kind of a date and you
can basically click there and get a
register for this event for example so
how would you define this component
first option it's a car topic okay I
know people will say but this is not
HTML well you guys know about web
component so this is HTML right but this
could be anything this could be angular
this could be react I'm not I'm not
putting any assumption on what this is
about I'm just saying like this is a
component which means that the the
mechanism behind the scene could be
whatever you want but we're talking
about angular here so when you have this
component you start thinking about
what's the template behind these
components and you get this a lot of
information here and but you guys
understand what's going on here the
third the third one will be well let's
define the the mechanism behind this
component so everyone understand the
code here restrict scope okay how many
people feel like this code is basically
what they've been writing for a while
okay you guys are pretty good so when
you see this code here you're basically
thinking about isolate scope I have a
template i have a restrict and it's a
simple one but um okay that was the
first thing everything as a component
everything is a component now the second
rule was used use controller as you see
this code it is just a simple controller
right but as you can see i call it
topics controller with capital t means
that in the java where you will call it
a class some people were circuits a
function or whatever but actually if you
want to mimic the two you would think if
you think about it as a class you will
say but
what is cope topic topics here it's
supposed to be your kind of model you're
going to bind to the view but you're
assigning that to a dollar scope and
that's because you read the
documentation on angular org and it was
fantastic and you did that and you saw
everything updating in real time but
that was a lie but that's that's a thing
that caused you a lot of lot of issues
the more your application grows the more
you start realizing that you don't have
control on your dollars cope anymore so
get rid of that and use something
simpler so as you can see here Wow I
mean I think everyone in this room likes
loves removing code that's not
necessarily like you see or your source
code shrinking like that let's do that I
go from there and I hand up with this
this topic but this is just when I have
when I reach this point I can start
using a controller as and inside my
templates and it makes really my code
more a namespace each way of working but
then I still have an issue here but I'm
going to explain a little bit later the
next one is use module system to turn
your application into small packages
what do I mean by that let's get back to
the controller we had the controller is
still dysfunction and now we have the
beautiful context this where we put our
topics and we get these data service
retrieving all the all the component all
the topics by the way sorry so but there
is an issue what is this angular dot
module on top of the page anyone knows
anyone can tell me like just screamed
like what is this thing on top just said
sorry package name whoa okay as I said
the java developer so they use package
anyone else
come on guys don't be shy okay so
basically you're saying like this is
what you call a package or module right
that's where you are uncap slate and
your you busy I mean a kind of module
rights but what I'm saying here is when
you create a package topic dots
controller is just that function that
I'm basically where you put all your
view model but in this in this page if
you think about a huge application which
has 120 services controller so 120 files
on every single file every single file
you're going to have these those two
lines on top on every single file okay
probably you don't see the problem we're
having here but what I'm saying is the
fact that we can turn that into
something way simpler but the question
will be what is this export right here
that's the module system I'm talking
about if you turn your code from here to
the next one your code becomes this one
becomes is easily testable it's just a
function if you want to test that you
just import it somewhere else and you
hand up with something that looks like
this okay now if everyone in the room
should be like this look like Java
import no not yet almost but let let me
revert that quickly see this the
question I always ask okay abeba I'd
philos we we went through many companies
out there in Belgium and Nitin and one
of the thing I realized that I don't
know how we hand up in companies using
Java and their back-end most of them
they actually in the room I can see few
of them so whenever they say okay we
move
our application to angular and they show
me this code and ask them is this look
like Java thing you use most of the time
they said no I mean it just doesn't but
if you trance trance ition to this
you're already into okay i'm importing a
module I use that inside my file which
means that you can see the second the
import topics controller from
controllers topics you clearly saying
that I'm just going to get that file to
build my module here i'm importing that
file inside here and then if tomorrow
you want to use another another
technology with the same function you
can still import that inside that that
application whether it's angular or net
or react or backbone you can just import
the same thing which has nothing to
really tie to ank to angular in the way
you build that that's my point here so
this the previous one can become clearly
a simple class that has all the behavior
you want it basically mimic a model
inside your application and then you can
reuse that for any type of application
and not only angular application you
guys understand my point here you're
good with that or you feel like okay
that's not there yet okay I can see that
people are just wondering but my point
is you can reach that level of
modularity and make your code more
readable so and so you hand up with this
thing you create a function and then you
export that and the function is called
topics controller and you can now import
that in the entry point that I call an
Dexter ji hee so before moving and to
something else I have can you see the
code here is it big enough
yeah or you are this way no okay I think
you can see it clearly so um I have a
simple example here this was probably
abstract but let's let's check this card
and okay it's obviously so I have my
entry point which is just a simple fire
and as I said everything is a component
this is a component I just defined a
component which is I mean you guys can
see how small is this index dot HTML
file I don't have all the script and
stuff like that I only have one script
but and what this allows me to do is the
fact that I have a module list of
modules here and you can see I have a
book and a core module for my
application but if if I go inside my
index yes see how my code looks like i'm
importing unclear clearly and porting
angular it doesn't come from somewhere
in the global scope i'm importing it
inside my file then i import the modules
i'm going to be using inside my file so
it's not really a random thing like okay
let's put those files in a certain order
to make sure that this one load before
these are the one I can see people in
the room who understand that that thing
like okay let's put this script I know
but this one loads before this other one
no that's not what you want to do you
want to make sure that you have one
entry point and your entry point here is
just this index 30s and then from that
point on you can decide do I want and
the core module no I don't want that I
can switch that with something else
that's basically core core common model
because one day you decide to rewrite
your application just that model and you
can clearly see how here you can turn a
component from one to another without
having to destroy anything else so now
let's let's clearly see what is inside
this
app module for example book let's take
the book the book here as an index dot
J's this is the entry point of my app
this is the entry point of this module
but if I open here you can clearly see
that here i'm importing all the rest i
need a service i need a controller i
need all the stuff i import that inside
the index that jay is here what's
happened with the rest is the fact that
you here i can clearly say that now if
you go inside let's take service or
controller will be just fine there is
clearly no we're here where you can say
oh this is really angular related sorry
just going to get that of the chart so
this is just a simple class as you can
see it's just a simple class and what I
do is I export it clearly here so by the
end of the at the end of the day you
just take this this file and you can
test it any somewhere else without
having to remove the angular things okay
obviously line for here is angular if
but you can remove that and you can do
all those injection inside your your
index GS to really isolate your
component from angular as as all you
guys you guys understand what I'm saying
here so i'm using export or just classes
those are the thing you guys know there
is no a function inside the if he and
orders that there is no such a thing so
if you reach that level of modularity
I can guarantee you that angular to the
transition from one to two is just a
mirror of well we don't need these
indexes index here but also you come
here and you change instead of okay you
don't have these in Port here anymore so
you don't even need that this one for
example and so if I go tell if we remove
all do all of this you don't need F all
the stuff and you can directly import so
let's just go at the end here and you
can say I want to import angular 2 from
angular 2 so you import that you still
have the module you still have the
bootstrap and you hand up just
transitioning to angular 2 in few
keystrokes and yes it is easy and by the
way this repo you have access to that
and I put it under that the end of the
slide you can you can check it out and
and see if it fits your needs and give
me some comments there but my goal here
is basically to give you a starting
point where you feel like well I can
transition from vania JavaScript today
to ESX or typescript so let's back to
the slides so this is where we left and
now are we going to migrate this
component from angular 1 to angular 2 so
and some people will say it's just a
mirror of switching it's just a matter
of switching board and yes my friend
Bart's as a knows how to do that just
step back and let those guy plug their
new framework and now let's get back to
work so it's the same component
see this the same guy achieve definition
and I'm actually talking about angular 2
here so there is no angular 1 but there
is probably one thing you can clearly
see the difference between one and two
anyone spot that okay people are
sleeping come on wake up their brackets
there what the hell is what the hell are
those brackets so now let's define the
components you're really simple a
selector steel car topic you can clearly
see the the link here I got a directive
definition here a template but this code
is probably like what the hell is this
energy component the class thing but i'm
using vania javascript here no time
scrape no es 6 is just JavaScript
without all those super sets although
es6 is actually JavaScript and then add
okay this one is probably a bit awkward
but I try to bring that to something you
know i have a function car topic i have
property inside but if you can see you
can see on energy component so I have
these cars topic that annotations how
many people use annotations or
decorators you have that in Java right
so how many people use that on daily
basis so you know what what they're all
about and you're going to get that for
free the same thing in the way you build
your component but now i'm still using
van a venir javascript so there is no
ESX or typescript so the template looks
like this by the way it's exactly the
same template we had in angular 1 you
guys can see that can spot that or there
are some
stuff you feel like sorry the star yeah
bracket okay I'm gonna tell you
something when you saw the first the
first time and the slides for angular 1
were you able to spot anything that was
different and would like to realize that
this thing is a start so it should be it
means probably this this is a bracket it
probably means this no I think you
probably have one slide one template and
you're the one we should know oh this
one is ng if so it should probably be a
template with two-way bindings or it's
probably one way bindings and all that
stuff so I'm going to explain the
meaning of this thing here but I can
clearly see people in the room like what
the hell are those syntax so and I said
angular 2 is coming and we can't covert
angular 2 in 31 minutes but now for the
next 10 minutes I'm going to cover
something which is if you want to
remember what is angular 2 by the end of
today it's just focus let's focus just
on the syntax the templates in that
close to me when I see angular 2 versus
having angular 1 versus angular 2 the
first thing that makes sense right away
and my friends there we're saying like
debuggers ids they don't understand what
this thing is about so they cannot help
you while you're typing why are you
typing they cannot help you like oh
you're typing the model your your bind
to is this so i can automatically fetch
the functions and you can just type the
name the first letter of the function
and it just you have a tow completion
you don't have that because you know
it's it's it's not that well designed in
angular 1 but we learn with years that
he wasn't so let's get back to this
template I can clearly see people in the
room saying like the before that's
that's what you have in angular 1 but
the template as shown before I had
brackets parentheses and all the stuff
but here how could you spot topic that
image on Angie if is it to weigh
bindings and resource topic why do I put
a curly braces around that and I didn't
put it on topic image ng-click what is
entry click by now you all know that
ng-click is probably dating when you
click it fetch that it raised that event
but that's because you learn that so my
point here is like when I read these
templates it's because I know angular 1
that I can spot directly oh this is a
two-way binding and the second one is
probably one way just a one-way binding
and oh this what this one is ng-click
and register should probably be inside
the directive definition that's because
I know angular but my point here is when
you see this this is angular 1 in the
one green one it's angular 1 you see
this and you say okay that I I I
understand what is topic is it an
attribute is it a property if you
transition the way to know if topic is a
two-way bindings or not is to open the
definition so you're in front of your
template and you need you have to open
the definition to see that oh there is
an isolate scope and there is two way
bindings but he could have just been at
which is say okay this string just pass
me the string or pass me whatever you
have there and i will just bind that to
my template so you had you had to open
this but what I'm saying here is if you
had to just read it right inside the
template without having to open the
definition so by reading this I know
that well this is one way binding
second one if people think that topic
between bracket is weird okay I agree
with you like the first time I saw that
that was like huh but you can still use
binding topic it's actually the same
thing literally but I bet that the more
people use angular to the more they will
use with the bracket so the next one is
this mg if an energy source and
resources of usually as you can see a
thing that's bind to the the property
the attribute image source but you can
write you can write yourself disown
directive why do you need another
directive if you can bind directly to
the source it's a property if you can
directly bind to the source then your
your your things becomes easier to read
so we can transition from that to the
second one so what I'm saying the
Energy's the start is clearly saying
that this should be a directive that
someone has imported inside this
template someone has built that this is
what you call a structural component it
doesn't a beer it basically give some
behavior to do to your component but
it's not a directive component you can
make the difference in angular 1 so you
still have one way binding here the next
one will be entry click I have this
function but actually ng-click is one of
those directive when you see them you
like oh I know what what it does but you
have ng-click mg keypress ng but they're
all over on top of the native one so
this
second syntax is basically saying this
is an event this is an event period then
you're the one who decide oh it's an
event so i can put kia i can put key
press directly here without having to
write their own directive doing this or
having to load the entire angular source
code that's going to bring you all those
directs if you don't even need when you
use your application so ng model that
everyone knows everyone knows it as a no
angular ng model who doesn't security
there's someone here who doesn't know ng
model that is not possible you use that
every day and that's the thing one
people so we tap inside an input and
then you see everything update in real
time you feel like angular is Magic that
entry model that's the thing you use as
an example but I don't know if it's a
two-way bindings once again so the
syntax here okay we're with me I can I
can I know I know you I'll let you
digest that for a few seconds and
someone was going to help me explain
after what we saw before someone can I
help me explain what is this doing we
already know that it's the two-way
bindings I can see someone here
explaining can you can you help us with
that yeah i spurred human yep
not that that was fantastic that that
was just fantastic you nailed that okay
I can move to the next slide because
that's the explanation so simple so once
again what my goal here is to say that
when you're going to see the okay
obviously your explanation is pretty
clear here you can write that this way
if the syntax doesn't fit your luck in
your test you can write ng-model its
binding here and then ng model change to
raise the event here so now when you
read this template you should people who
set out there is a start there is now
you know what did the mean but not only
you you know but your IDE will know
which means that your ID will be able to
spot the fact that and image here if you
tap it wrong it knows that you're
passing something that doesn't work you
won't just display something randomly
know so this is good for a team like if
you're at you work in a company ten
developers working on the same code base
when you read this you know clearly
what's going on and you don't assume
that people know angular okay so um few
things in angular are gone completely
angular 1 but they're gone in angular 1
and I hope in anger they're gone in
angular 2 sorry but they actually the
things you don't use most of the time
the first one is the root scope gun
remove it I mean now you can do that
okay don't remove the controllers
they're still you're going to need your
controller because actually your
controller will become the component the
starting point for your component in
angular 2 and
so you saw how we declare the directive
we put a restrict and all the stuff gun
forget about that next one the module
system someone said yeah angular dot
module is going to create the kind of
package if you turn your application
into something I'm if you use module
systems this will be gone in a way you
won't even realize at some point in
angular 2 so the transition with this
point only is really really beneficial
and no more jquery or jQuery lights and
this kind of stuff but there are more
stuff here that I won't have time to
cover but I'm just giving you some stuff
you guys know and use on daily basis
that are basically good in angular 2 so
now let's talk about angular 2 in
nutshell i have twenty-one 21 minutes
and i'm not going to cover everything in
angular 2 of usually but i'm going to
give you some stuff that I even heard
like those are the problems in angular 1
and yes they're the problem because
angular 1 the more your application
grows the more you have the digest loop
that's basically take some time like a
lot of times and then in angular 2 they
basically use a monolithic JavaScript
just just row JavaScript observable and
you can actually write your own
detection tools and yeah it goes way
faster and something which is really
really important a server-side rendering
like companies media's companies using
angular for their angular 1 to build
application that will be available that
can be horrible it wasn't a good idea a
few months ago things improved meddling
in angular 2 you're going to have it for
free the native mobile mobile UI native
scrape or react native get that to
compile at real time it's also it's
something you
get I just you can put together with the
server side rendering at some point
because what we're basically saying
there is well application will after
building my application I can basically
compile it right not at the runtime not
inside the browser right using your
build tools and then you can ship that
build application to your customers we
don't need all those directives ng click
hinges and I mean and resource all the
stuff gone you don't need that and
that's the point I've mentioned before
in terms of IDs I mean you guys use
things like IntelliJ web store room
those Tour will be just really really
happy to see those templates coming the
native lazy loading we had to write
libraries to have native lazy loading
and yes I skip one one point here but
yeah that's basically what i said before
but the next one is native lazy loading
that's one you get it for free too and
di who knows what di is dependency
injection who knows how many dependency
injection you have in angular 1 12 or
you don't even count because for you is
like the same that thing where you
inject something inside an array and
then you make sure that when your
application is minified it doesn't crash
is that all okay and no its you have
things called the link function you know
the link function right link function in
angular right that thing that thing
which is you know you should put first
parameter the first one yeah people are
sleeping come on people
link function the first parameter scope
the second one okay you guys going to
leave the room the second one element
the third one attributes and the last I
mean not the last one but I'm gonna stop
at four and the next one is ok require
controller whatever you want to require
from another directive those are what
you call and dependence dependency
injection by position and you also have
the order dependency injection where you
know you put things inside that array
you make sure that they're there were a
line and one your application runs
angular will go read those parameter and
check that inside your app those are too
many mechanism we're gonna have one
mechanism it's just function you need
what do you need i need those parameter
just inject that there that's it so
typescript and angular 2 this is
basically our last point so touch creep
and angular 2 the thing is like the
question people will ask is why
typescript how many people work on
angular projects here in the room alone
like I'm the only developer on the
source code and I can do whatever I want
oh come on guys okay that's that's
actually not a lot so most of people
work in the team of okay let's set up to
five people in the team that's that's
already yeah and like 100 people okay
like more than 10 people in the team and
you guys use javascript not es6 or
typescript all the stuff so one person
team is something you can manage you
choose whatever you want
when you reach five people already you
start having some guidelines and trying
to make sure that people follow the
rules pretty well but you can hand up
with someone who use a number like a
parameter you call whatever name and
someone put us through a number there
but that's it's your your customer is
going to call you a tree a.m. in the
morning like I wasn't able to get my
money out of your application and that's
because someone played with types so
type scrip is basically and a superset
of JavaScript a tight superset of
JavaScript that compiled to JavaScript
like plain old JavaScript but it brings
you everything like classes types so if
you have a let's say a book you're gonna
have you get you gonna need to have an
interfaces that represent that book and
make sure that everyone will use a
function that requires the book will
pass something that's completely match
that and angular 2 is develop it's
actually used at Google for okay
typescript is used to build angular 2 so
my point here is if one day you decide
to move to angular 2 and you type on
Google oh I want to write this component
in angular 2 ninety percent of the time
the example will be writing in
typescript so tight grip is basically um
it's it's built by cool it's it's
actually built by Microsoft but Google
use that to build their product and so
you should at some point if your team is
already like five to ten I can take that
offline on if people want to me to show
them really the benefit in terms of how
in the team this can be really useful
but we have an example here already but
I can really go further on that it's
really easy to set up really easy and
you have everything about annotation
declaration and that thing does thing
use that already in Java I IDs will be
we'll just use that to help you even
more with your code so if today you
decide to use typescript you can just
start using it without changing your
entire application you can increment
early change your application toward
typescript and once of the thing when
Microsoft build that was to create
something which is scalable and some
people will say scale bar in terms of
what to me the first scalability part I
will see it in terms of a team how your
team grows and how you manage to have
and consistency while your your
application is growing and your team is
growing too so we're gonna we're going
to rebuild the same component now you
guys can read this template pretty well
we're going to rebuild this the same
component in typescript and keep in mind
all this all the tricks are showing you
about angular 1 now you can transition
to angular to keep in mind that part and
let's see how you would do that in
typescript so we have the definition and
this is just the component now we're
done we can go home okay no one wants to
live okay so it's not it's not over so
here is your components in typescript
give you a few seconds to wrap that run
we still have a selector we have a
template URL but we have a class and
class is something you guys know pretty
well and and we using decorators here to
basically annotations and decorators to
basically enhance our class
inputs you see the the act that input
something I have to mention here is the
fact that none of the thing on this
component it this file is coming from a
random place like oh is it available on
the global scope know it is there you
import that you import component view
and input and you use that inside your
your application and the dollar in put
the ad in put down there is basically
the the binding you have on top you're
basically saying what I'm just going to
improve send a topic and how am I
getting that inside my a typescript just
import the input and you get that so um
my point here is like typescript is
really easy to use right still you
cannot still have an alert learning
curve but I always say that for people
who never use things like C sharp or
Java or everything Opie but you guys
know you use interfaces you use generics
and all the stuff in Java moving to our
type grip will give you the benefits of
oh I know that thing you can just use it
to build really really robust
applications and I shown you some stuff
by saying well this is the future this
is what's going to happen in the future
but the relatives the future is now it
is now you can use all those tool now
today to build angular application
oppression with the version 1 still and
really get your team into a way of like
modular is in your application and
really feel more confident refactoring
all the stuff because things like types
creat with coded deter like IntelliJ and
stuff like that or Visual Studio per se
or visual studio
could you get for free a really nice way
to refactor your code and move forward
in term of as a team so this is
basically where I sure hand you get a
list of resources at the end I put a lot
of stuff there if you have questions
after today you can still pick me on
twitter if you want I do sleep at night
but you can still pick me onto in
Terraria I will will answer anyway so um
if you feel like you want to know more
in terms of using all those technology
we have a hacker lab and we call it
hacker lab in Brussels where you can
just randomly come and we have our gems
and things where you can hack on those
technology with a group of people like
just a Saturday afternoon jump into
occurred and learn things together it's
a community our company is basically a
community builder and that's all we do
we hack we do that that's it and I put
the link on the resource here where the
first one is basically where you can get
the example I shown you and yeah that's
basically it for me if you guys have any
questions I get the mic
hello hello will you share the slides
because the links you are giving in the
resources don't point to anything there
you get the slide will you will you
share this oh yes yeah um um Twitter
stairway yeah i can i can share that on
twitter definitely okay in when the I
script is compiling into plain
JavaScript yeah so is it compiling into
yes 50 years cs5 and you can decide you
can decide which version you want to
target obviously entire script okay
thanks any other questions yep
is there something like router you I
already implemented and router you I and
you have a new ok GG probably going to
have another question and there is a
router system in angular 2 which
actually you can already use today in
angular 1 point for one of the benefits
of angular UI was the master detail
right I think everyone realized that at
some point and you can do that with with
the new angular router but many people
use a router you are from github yeah
which is a bit different the angular UI
the angular your team is also working on
the integration of angular 2 so I think
there is a you can adjust have a
continuity over there I mean the
community is just amazing a lot of
people are working here and there on on
helping the angular team moving forward
in terms of shipping that product
questions yeah 1 2 3
question here yeah just a very quick
question what's the difference between
easter eggs in the brackets in the
template showed second the asterisk or
the brackets what's the difference
between youtube because you explain him
as being identical oh i didn't explain
oh I probably yeah it's was I didn't
make it clear I give you this and you
take the next question who was you were
the one but i'm just going to know
they're different as I said the start is
you clearly saying that this is a
directive and i'm going to show you on
the slide because it's actually of using
if i roll back here you see that when i
create when i create my directives we're
using you can see here I have directive
ng if i'm importing energy if and this
could be whatever directive you want to
build but in angular 2 you're going to
have to act with import them explicitly
and not just assume that well angular's
load them already like ng if you know
there is no assumption there you need to
import them and you annotate them with a
star inside your template so your idea
is no where to find them and the
brackets just one way binding question
here you said that we must stop using
the scope oh yeah I said I can I say
that again you said it multiple times
yes so the point is there are situations
in which we have for example to watch a
variable or to watch the destroy event
how can we do it without the scope okay
how can we do it without the scope you
know there is a thing called services in
angular 1 right if you have to use
Watchers to basically like
day 2 component here and there then
you're not using services how you should
because services are singleton right if
you can encapsulate most of your thing
there you will end up with an
application which is of which a void
using scope to manage all those eve
event thing ok sometime you will
probably need it agreed but what I'm
basically saying here is avoiding scope
as your view model purdy food like you
have a class called customer and your
class has a name and the first name all
those are properties you cannot bind to
your template right those are the
property you're not you're not going to
put that on the scope per se even though
angular will do that for you but angular
graph is going to create a name which
you're going to give that name to create
the kind of namespace and talking about
transitioning to angular to that you
just going to get the same customer
function and reuse that in angular 2 as
it is instead of having to remove scope
and stuff like that that's basically my
point there may be one last question one
minute how's the browser adaptation for
the new template syntax is it the
problem or can it just work out of the
box with chrome and into explorer and
all the others no once again if an
angular that they're all templating
language so angular is going to read
that interpret that for you 444 inside
before rendering that to the browser so
it just makes your life easier in terms
of writing in serve of the developer
experience it's just got way easier so I
have 30 second not even so probably
another question okay I think I think
I'm good here
that whole yeah that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
