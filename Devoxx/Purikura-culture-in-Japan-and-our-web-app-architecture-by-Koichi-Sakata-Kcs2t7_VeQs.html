Japan kyoto japan today Toki I'm talking
about Japanese culture and the product i
am using in web application where you
japan doing a way I Japan survive here
appear far from here previous I had
yesterday I had 10 Elrod right so I have
a jet rub yeah there are three topics
insufficient Japanese culture pelicula
precure and product that i'm using my
web application mogul methods and spring
crowd contract trapped under today this
is assuring quick efficient so we have
no time for Q&amp;amp;A if you have a question
please feel free to tweet with this
hashtag 3jp a particular employee and GP
is japan ok go on to the main subject
japal today there is no ninjas and no
sun life in japan now japan is famous
for animation and comics anime manga and
pre cool today I talking about pre crew
have you ever heard precure this is
pretty cool machine machine there are
many pelicula machine in Game Center in
Japan in the u.s. it called photo
sticker machine but precure is different
from photo speaker machine any function
oak in the machine you can take a
picture of your face and pulled and in
japan called folding with all your hand
touch with your faith it looks smaller
in your face okay in this messy photos a
process to become more beautiful this is
the original photo our colleague oh yes
before and after it is Professor image
in Japan yeah god sake kawaii when they
feel the image kawaii means cute Oh cute
so after taking a picture in micro
machine photos will be printed sabato
mode right photo sticker and you can get
digital image from our website so both
of them are called pelicula in Japan
photo sticker and digital image pura
cura about our company we producing
reproducing we produce 14 years flickr
machine and in Japan there are 6000
machine about 6,000 machines in Japan
game center and our annual sales of this
is 60 million dollars per year so
quickly is the Japanese culture I read
almost all japanese girls have taken
precure at least once they take pretty
girl whenever they go outside
particularly the special day the girls
are wearing a kimono so they take
precure because of specialty yeah next
topic overview of our system in the
procurement they're a very cell phone so
the photos things to our servers and
towards our database and file system
uses visit our website to watch the
particular photos and download them
our way back of the application we do
with spring boot and mobile effort
pronounces okay mogu mogu rapid mobile
SS is distributed file system and open
source product they have each had three
components so in detail three components
fast tracker tracker is a management
server it communicates with their client
database so are five information and the
Mogu effects configurations strange node
is just five switch files are accessible
with HTTP so we can use HTTP URL in our
web application now we have 15 strange
nodes and tender young pile of pelicula
amodal FS the total file size rated 480
terabytes so I'm certain the mobile
refill it capable of terabyte of data
are you re we have never experienced
this system period for six years in
mobile record okay mobile phase has some
advantages no single point of failure
automatic file replication so files are
replicated between different strange
northridge node so if the server is done
but it's okay we have to replicate
photos photos are three replications
yeah we had three
immigration but I met a problem disk
usage unbalancing to solve this we have
to execute rebalancing c'mon okay here
sample case originally we have two
servers sovereign use a capacity of disk
space sabha to eat same so add server
three we have three servers now so new
server service lee is zero-percent you
files ascended to new server with
priority but some files are sent to all
the servers now server one increases a
from eighty percent to 85,000 sabha to
insane savithri with priority service
religious forty percent of disk space so
this is problem move we don't have you
don't we won't don't want to use several
and servitude because of disk space is
nothing now we execute rebalancing Quan
after reversing sababa radius ten
percent so that will same savithri
increases sixty percent of disk usage is
did so mogra phase is distributed file
system motorists FS is distributed file
system so we often execute reversing
command now we have 15 notes
another problem mobile effort is written
in perl but it doesn't support / 6 yet
only 55 and last committed two years ago
thermography is now isn't active product
now we have two problems and it doesn't
rub so now we in the process of
reviewing the crowd files rage like
amazon s3 now that we have 10 billion
files can we transfer the symbiote files
to the crowd mm-hmm it's possibly
transfer but I wouldn't think about it
now okay Beenie conclusion mobile phase
is capable of managing terrible data but
it's not active now next topic our web
application architecture we did the
monolithic application at first but we
have now built I'm is wrong and it's
difficult to change code and function
running tests again again is very
expensive so we decided we decided to
change it to micro service architecture
yeah
we use netflix OSS eureka rebound hi
Strix service discovery quaint at
Rosings such britta and big boot you
know spring bootie stand up for
standalone application spring
application and spin crowd netflix
provide netflix sources integrations for
spring boot application another problem
are entering test how to test the case
in the exception that case that
exception happened in the microphone
this diagram I want you to I want to
test this diagram case throw an
exception and wither era HTTP status
code source code of change no I'd like
to introduce spring drought contrast the
strap runner very wrong leg wrong name
spin crowd control Savannah so I called
stubbornness repressive microservices
we've stopped the stars are on my work
fire mode is for API MOOC pissed if you
are a so now with we can achieve study
micro fat for micros office how to make
and round stop there are four steps
first maven plugin you add spring crowd
upon that way of improving to pom.xml
second Ruby dsl you right groovy DFL
when we execute maven command package
for intro imbrium package for insult
file is combatted to death on fire for
wiremock the top liquid post you are a
example response status call to over
body if Jason he does content types it's
combated to json file third maven deploy
you in the cute nvm deploy or install it
deploy to local about 30 each party etc
oh la la free-lance table runner we
execute this command stubborn can get
some from repository you're deployed
upholstery so stubborn can use stubs
support sabrina is different from stub
itself so if you learn in low cost you
non stop learn in boca hope you can get
support from this URL subs now we run
sub example subtle example there is a
zero point zero point one support 10 180
sprinkles come spring saab rhonda can
integrate with spring crowd Netflix so
this command something is used to
register in Eureka so we can test with
Sabrina Eureka and your application
ok conclusion more breakfast is capable
of managing terabytes data stream crowd
comprar to savannah sabrina is very
useful even if your micro service is not
Springfield application or Netflix or f
its application it's for stabbing web
application lastly a particular is
Japanese culture so when you visit Japan
please take precure in Game Center and
posing oh this is my first presentation
in English thank you for coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
