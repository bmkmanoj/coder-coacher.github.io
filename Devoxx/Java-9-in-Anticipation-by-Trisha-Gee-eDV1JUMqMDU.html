advocate for jetbrains I like mostly
with IntelliJ IDEA which means that it's
kind of my job to set up date with
what's happening with Java and kind of
figure out what Java developers doing in
their day jobs and so obviously one of
the big topics for this year is going to
be Java lines like is it interesting do
we care what should we know about Java
nine what do we use Java developers what
are we going to get out put it out of
using Java note in this particular talk
I will also cover some of the specifics
around IntelliJ IDEA functionality for
java 9 normally I try not to cover too
much product specific stuff but it is
the thing that most people ask me for so
it is a requested requirement and who is
an intelligent dear user there's an
eclipse person people more than one
netbeans okay and proud of it I can see
that so feel free to tune out during the
IntelliJ IDEA bits but the rest of it is
going to be a general overview of Java
nine functionality for job developers
right so I'm not an Oracle employee so I
don't have to put up a safe harbor
statement like all the Oracle guys do
but I am going to talk a little bit
about some of our plans for the roadmap
and you know plans change and you can't
really rely on it and don't take
anything i say is being a guarantee that
we're definitely going to do something
blah blah blah a java 9 let's just dive
straight in there and take a look at
java mine amazing jigsaw modularity
really excited about that in java nine
right no big mystery looks very excited
about her and we turn people talked
about java knowing you hear about jigsaw
and modularity it's been a long time
coming it's an important thing for the
JDK they want to have a modular code
base that can beat a bit down you want
to be able to deploy like smaller
profile applications but probably for
the day-to-day the developer it's just
not quite as exciting as crap slanders
and streams and there is always this
concern that maybe moving to jigsaw with
some of the changes of that implies our
code might break and and I don't we care
anyway so who maybe I won't use Java
nine maybe I'll just wait until
something more exciting later versions
of job
out and but what I really want to point
out is that Java 9 is a lot more than
just jigsaw obviously you're going to
hear a lot about jigsaw because I have
quite a big impact on what we do is
develop it or it can do but then there
are one or two other things in in the
Java 9 release only like six of those
are related to jig saw a lot of the
others are interesting bits and pieces
some are kind of under the cover stuff
will not going to use but some of them
are features that we as Java developers
are going to use going forward and what
I want to do is I'm not going to cover
all of those because there are other
talks at this conference and other tools
available which cover a broader range of
features what I've try to do is kind of
pick out the features that I think are
interesting for other developers that we
might start using on a day-to-day basis
so the kind of highlights if you like
I'm one of the other reasons to move to
Java nine apart from all these shiny new
features is better everything obviously
that's probably what Oracle would like
us to think but we get better use of
memory improves performance in a bunch
of different areas a lot of work around
some of the graphics side of stuff for a
Java because we all use Java for
graphics programming right you know and
very use of hardware of CPU operations
better documentation so we can create
better documentation but we also can
look as better documentation which I'll
cover a bit later and some better
graphics off faster compilation so
without using any of the features of
Java 9 we will get some improvements and
you'll probably have already seen that
every time you move to a new version of
Java we do get better performance out of
the box so let's just dive straight in
there what I want to do is I want to
sort tackle the elephant in the room
straight away if I compile on my a java
application my job aight application in
java 9 what is going to break how hard
is it going to be so let's just go
straight into that bit there so what I
have is that's compilers what I have is
the application of I was demoing last
year and near the 4th to demo Java 8
features I'm just basically going to
compile it and Java nine and see what
breaks and let's see only one of these
was something I put in there on purpose
to break the rest of it is stuff that is
some genuine in Java 8
the so probably not a lot of people knew
this but under school was a perfectly
valid field me and what people are
starting to realize now that it's going
to go away in Java line if people are
thinking oh that sounds really useful I
might actually start texting that no
don't use eye mask or as a valid field
name because it's going away it was
deprecated in Java 8 it's going away in
Java 9 so what you want to do if you
want to rename to something useful and
then that will go away so that's fine
that's fairly easy you probably weren't
using underscores in the variable names
anyway and then I was using base 64
encoded because i needed to digital
encoding and that seemed to be the right
thing to do even though I knew it was
deprecated and I knew it was going away
and I was doing that thing that
developers do know it works I don't care
i'm just going to carry on using it
because it works and now of course in
java 9 it's not it's not there I can't
use it at all I have to use something
else but it's fairly straightforward the
fix is very easy need to type of a
base64 science jobs that you till basics
before get encoder and in my case I want
to encode your strength so it's not
quite a like-for-like replacement but it
does work get rid of my import that
doesn't work anymore we build everything
and then everything compiles so for
granted this is not a massive enterprise
application it's a fairly small
application but it's a real world
application there are a couple of little
bits and pieces I needed fixed to make
it work in Java 9 and then it started
watching there's a slight caveat to this
the original version this application
did use Gradle and it was a multi-module
project in Gradle and Gradle doesn't
currently work in Java 94 multi-module
projects so I haven't quite figured out
what's going on with that I know they
are on the case they said it's going to
be ready by the time job and I comes out
but currently my grail version of this
project does not build and compile I
also had some problems with Spock and
groovy tests and I don't entirely know
what the problem was there but I did
have some trouble with both groovy and
Gradle so if you are using that you
might not be able to
to use Java 9 right away but they are
they are aware of it I did in Gradle
confident builds and that works fine and
a grade or simple build works as well so
it's just something that they're they're
working on so I'm the latest release of
Java 9 is build 16 one I was using build
160 because I'm not a total idiot and I
didn't update the most recent one this
morning to have my whole demo crash and
die I'm sure it won't I'm sure it would
be fine but I have learnt my lesson in
the past so ho ho if you go you can
download the latest version of Java 9
and start playing with it straight away
this page let me show you what this page
is this has loads of information about
getting started with compiling against
Java nine so the loads of stuff in here
about like some weird things you might
find some educated what to do if you
find bugs and some help support
frequently asked questions that sort of
thing so if you just start playing with
Java line I would highly recommend
looking at this page you know so that
hopefully hopefully it'll give you help
without them you having to bang your
head against the wall so yes your code
might break but the best thing to do in
my opinion is to find that pain sooner
rather than later and there's a number
of reason to this one I well firstly
don't start putting Java nine in
production right now that's not a good
idea okay but it is a good idea to get a
feel for how painful it may be for you
to migrate to Java nine sometime in the
nearish future so it's useful for you to
find out for your applications till it's
very useful for the language developers
if in case you do find a bug because
they really would like you to find a bug
now rather than after it's released so
it's useful for the language guys and
three probably more interestingly the
library developers so all the libraries
that you're working on all the
frameworks that you're working on like
things like greater than groovy they're
working hard to stop catch up with the
changes in Java nine but they don't have
as extensive a test base as like all the
users out there using their libraries so
if you do find that something doesn't
work or something doesn't pays the way
expect it to you really could do with
feeding that back to the library
developers so that you know it helps the
community as a whole and so that
everything is kind of as ready as
possible by the time java night concert
so yes your code might break and because
there's a bunch of stuff that's going
away these are all the jets of things
that are going away so lots of
deprecated stuff going the way obviously
capsule ating the internal AP is that
you're not supposed to use only demos
and samples I hope your production code
isn't dependent upon demos and samples
but you know all these bits and pieces
are going away so these things might
impact the way that terms of your code
works I think probably more
interestingly is there are some jets
which change some behavior which you may
not realize your application is
dependent upon so one of the things that
occurs to me there are some changes
around logging and I'm wondering if
there are some applications out there
that correct log files for particular
things and maybe those things aren't
there anymore so I think that's one area
that might be kind of interesting
probably more likely is the fact that
there's a new version version string
scheme so it's not java 1.8 anymore it's
java 9 it's not 1.9 so i do know for a
fact there are applications out there
that sort of correct the version string
to figure out what version they're
running in order to figure out you know
what to do so if yours is one of those
applications you need to be aware that
the version string is a different format
than it used to be so some little things
like that probably not going to get
caught by the compiler so these are
things that you need to run all your
tests on to make sure that everything is
working the way you expect it to okay so
let's move straight on that was kind of
like what's possibly going to break
that's quite a thing were most afraid of
but let's move on and take a look at
jigsaw because that's the most excited
about all the Oracle people in the room
just staring at me oh you know it's very
exciting for you guys and so I want to
get started on I want to show you how to
get started with a small lightweight
modular application because thanks for
me I've only really started looking at
jigsaw and before I was like well if
you're using modularity you're probably
already using Gradle or something else
or osgi or something to create a modular
system and if you're not using
modularity of some form you probably
don't care but let's take a look at how
you use a jigsaw and java knowing
modularity to create a modular
application so first up i'm going to
create a new IntelliJ IDEA module I'm
going to call it one
and so IntelliJ is created this for me
and create a new a new Java class in
here let's do the simple hello world
type applications if we run that this is
our obviously our simplest hello world
application so that kind of works what's
great let's put it into a package
because it's a good thing to do let's
move it into that package and we run
that so there's nothing magic about that
to a simple hello world application
let's turn this into a Java 9 module and
this is fairly easy so in IntelliJ it is
so correct me a new module info Java it
will create a default module file which
kind of looks the way expected to by
default intellij will pick the IntelliJ
module name to be the same as the jigsaw
module name but I don't think it
necessarily has to be and then when I
rerun my when I rerun my greetings file
it still works kind of under the covers
something you probably don't really care
as much about IntelliJ to figure out
this is a modular system so it's calling
all the right class passing so when you
look at the QuickStart four modules for
example you'll see you have to compile
it from the command line with all these
new flags and things now IntelliJ IDEA
will just take care of that for you and
you've got module path and it knows that
you're compiling it as a module not a
good not using class path and not using
your way of doing stuff so from our
point of view we've just created our
first job online module and was fairly
painless of course what we've got is the
usual complaint of Java boilerplate our
hello world application is seven lines
of code and then we've added another
file to it just because we didn't have
enough code in there to begin with so
let's look at a more complex example
more realistic if you like I've got
something like i have a class which is
using Java util logging to output
something instead so we're not using
system out we get our morning something
happened at the bottom okay so that's
fairly straightforward what we're going
to do
turn this in to make a module info for
this so it's now modular and then what
we'll see is that when we go back to
here now we get strange red slogan of
squiggly the strange red code where r
java.util logging apparently is no
longer valid which seems kind of weird
because as part of the JDK and we're
using the JDK we're not importing any
dependencies and so why won't my code
work anymore everything from pilot see
what happens so it tells me I have an
illegal access error so I cannot access
java.util logging logger in module Java
logging fortunately IntelliJ IDEA with
magic alt enter will fix this for you so
it says and requires java logging
statement to module info java so if we
look at our module info now this module
requires java logging and then
everything will just work the way you
expect it to ok so now we've created our
second module with some dependency on a
jdk module the next thing I want to do
is I want to show you our third module
and here what we're going to be
dependent upon is across another one of
my classes let's minimize that so in
module 4 I have a person it's just a
simple person being really and then a
module 3 I want to print out that person
now I currently don't have access to
that person objects now the first thing
I need to do in IntelliJ is I need to
add the dependency from the IntelliJ
module 3 to the IntelliJ module four so
that's the first thing I need to do and
obviously it will take care of that and
my import and then this is still red
which is next thing I need to do is as I
need for IntelliJ to give me the Verano
I know what anything so I can't access
this I don't have access to the person
what I need to do over in module 4 is I
need to say exports
the package that that person is in so
demo for I need to export that and then
in module three I can add required for
to module info and there and then when i
run this everything works the way
expected to so getting started with
modularity is really it's not that
tricky so it's not quite as complicated
as it was a few months ago and we had to
slip and roll everything there's a few
caveats to be aware of in IntelliJ IDEA
a jigsaw module has to correspond to an
intelligent idea module and vice versa
you need to manage the dependencies
between the modules in IntelliJ IDEA and
in the JDK in module info as well at the
moment so the support inside IntelliJ
IDEA is only available in college I did
20 17.1 which came out yesterday and the
support is quite basic so there's some
code completion there's some quick fixes
but not not everything it doesn't do
everything magically for you but it is
fairly easy to get started with jigsaw
so I highly recommend taking a look at
it it's a it's not quite as scary as I
thought it was kind of pic and so yeah
so in 2017 point 1 which came out
yesterday so this is an intelligent logo
in the bottom so you're not an
intelligent use for coffee minutes is
fine and in 20 17.1 you get the
generation of module info java which you
saw me doing it just generates one for
you with sort of sensible settings you
get syntax support to get highlighting
for requires and exports and opens and
things you get code completion so you
saw me exports and it suggested which
packet which package on my twins might
want to export and it compiles it works
which is a good thing which it doesn't
do in twenty sixteen point three and
those quick fixes to add the correct
sort of requires requires statements in
2017 something we've already covered
automatic generation of module info java
that came in in point one the other
stuff was kind of in 2016 victory but
then the language change didn't build
159 and everything bro
and so coming up in one of the later
versions this year we hope to be able to
import a project which is defined with
jdk nine modules and import that
correctly into IntelliJ modules without
you having to do that manual stuff as
I'll keep those instincts as well and we
want to support jaylene artifacts as
well but we haven't we haven't done that
yet but that's the plan we really could
do with your help because we really do
create the features that are useful to
put to our users so if you want some
particular features or you have some
particularly use cases it's really
important for us to hear about it so
this is the issue number of sort of the
umbrella for jigsaw support in intellij
idea this was set to fixed yesterday so
we have the general basic support for
jigsaw but off here you'll see links to
loads of other features and bug fixes
and issues around jigsaw so if you have
any problems raised an issue and link it
to this preferably if you have any
suggestions raising issues just let us
know because that's how we're going to
be able to evolve the IDE to support you
next up I want to look at the features
which I think are probably going to be
more applicable for us but we're
probably going to use on a day-to-day
basis so like code features which are
useful to us as new methods on the
streams API because streams are really
cool we're starting to get the hang of
it probably we're getting job ate most
of you that's good there's an Android
developer poor you I'm so sorry at home
so we're starting to get the hang of the
streams API the streams API does cover a
lot of the cases that we were kind of
interested in but obviously it's going
to continue to evolve over time and
there are some things which was missing
in Java 8 so let's take a look for
example what I have here is I have a
stream operation which takes a file the
file contains for every line it's like a
JSON representation of a tweet and the
stream iterates over that file and then
publishes the tweet on web sockets it's
a just a little server which is going to
sit there
pretend to be Twitter okay now the
problem with this is that it's very an
infinite stream but it doesn't terminate
until it gets to the end of the file and
there's no way to wake it up and poke it
and say stop now undone so when I call
stop on the service it doesn't actually
stop and just kind of sits there and
carried on forever so I'll show you if I
have a test to prove this so what it
does how much it doesn't stop what have
I done oh yes okay i know i need to
switch much
so what it does is I start the service
I'm supposed to be stopping it and then
I wait 10 seconds for it to stop but you
can see it's still going it's still
ticking along I can't I can't stop the
stream it's just it's just an infinite
stream and then it fails because after
10 seconds it doesn't come out and then
I just kill the whole process okay so
the new methods on streams will help me
with this what I can do might even be a
tiny bit of cheats but it works I can
use the new method take while and then I
give it some I give it some predicate to
test to see whether i should stop or not
so keep doing this until some criteria
is met now normally probably what you do
is test s to be some value and then stop
it want to get to some value but I'm
going to I'm going to use my own things
and we prep field its atomic brilliance
so I'm running so while I'm running keep
taking something from the stream and
then when stop is called i'm going to
say set this to false so keep going
until that pitiful and then when I rerun
we'll see and when i call stop is tops
it's done okay so take Boyle is a really
useful feature for saying right deuce do
this stream thing until from quarter is
Amit it's really useful for ordered
streams as well so like take while I
don't know let's say this an
alphabetical list like take all that
aids while everything begins at eight
keep doing something so and this is the
sort of other side of that is drop while
so don't do it until some criteria is
met so this just kind of adds a really
nice useful feature to to the stream
operations I can imagine you might want
to do drop while and take one combine
them to like get something like in the
middle of a stream as well so what else
we got we have convenience factory
methods for collections which I believe
sure it's going to talk about a bit more
later on so if you're more interested in
this go to Stuart's talk so this is I
think this is kind of one of the really
nice things that we're going to use a
lot of on to start using Java night and
let me show you what I mean let's say
we're trying to set up a list this ism
this is test data in this particular
case obviously in the past we would use
a razor glist now we can say list off
and you're thinking ok big deal you just
saved yourself two characters so Lucas
but it's not just lists we could already
do that with this but what we can do is
we couldn't be set for ok and that's
kind of useful so then we can do things
with sets we can create immutable sets
and do stuff with it and let's look at
the list
and what I think is much more useful is
being able to do with maps because this
is this is genuine code that i heard i
have to initialize a map of string
values to two moods and in order to do
that i have done a synthetic blog and
it's kind of a key and evil and I looked
at loads of different ways of doing it
but this was the best way to do it but
in Java 9 it's not i can say map of
entries get rid of my nasty static box i
can use one of my favorite IntelliJ
things which is column select mode
that's entry
all of that with
this move
and get rid of whatever I did sir ok so
now i can do a map of entries and then i
can just kind of put those in it's a lot
easier it's still a little bit obviously
you can do some static imports to reduce
some of that boilerplate so that's good
if you have fewer than 10 you can do
something even simpler and I can do map
of and then I can get rid of all of that
and then get rid of all of this
okay so it becomes a much i'm going to
rid of spyware this is this is parameter
hints in IntelliJ IDEA go away I don't
want that and so now i can create maps
in a much more succinct way and this
would have been really useful for me
when i worked at MongoDB because
everything at MongoDB is a key value
pair we were always creating maps and
that's actually one of the reasons why
we switched to groovy for our testing
because the way to create maps with a
lot neater so this isn't quite as pretty
as the groovy way of creating maps but
it is a lot better than what we had
before so we don't have to do this nasty
static thing and then put everything
into the map so I think that is one of
the things for me which will make my
life much more productive as a developer
Thank You Stuart fantastic a milling
project coin so Joe talked about this a
lot more in his talk so I really only
want to cover the private methods on
interfaces because this is something
that I think is going to be one I have
found useful for myself so what I had
here is I heard I had an interface with
a couple of methods on I could have put
those methods on a class but the class
didn't really it wasn't me the main
object didn't really have any state so I
just put a couple of functions on an
interface but of course what your motive
is that there's a lot of duplication
here now if you haven't been using loads
of the Java 8 features I think the first
thing that people think is why do I need
private methods or interfaces because
the whole point of an interface is to
define the interface the public API or
something so it seems kind of
counterintuitive to have a private
method but with Java 8 now we have
static methods on interfaces and default
methods and interfaces we have a lot
more behavior on interfaces there are a
lot more chunky so what we want to do is
potentially be able to reduce the
duplication in here so if I extract
listen to a method at field value for
example and previously this would have
had to have been a public method which
is accessible from everybody and I might
not want to do that but now I can just
simply turn into a private message so I
think that's going to be super useful if
you started using things like
taking default methods we can kind of
reduce some of your boiler plate and
make your code a bit easier to manage
updates deprecation so I think maybe not
how many people get excited about
deprecation but I was doing some library
development and when you're a library
developer it's really important to get
duplication right because you really
want to help people migrate from using
some methods or some classes to
something else and merely marking it is
deprecated and putting some
documentation it's not always enough to
kind of poke people into the right
direction so what you can do in Java
nine is you don't just mark something is
deprecated you can also say when it was
deprecated so like I don't know version
those four strings so you can put
whatever value you want in there and
then you can see whether it's going away
or not so I think that's really really
useful because you can say to some of
all your users while is it deprecated
but you know whatever or this is
deprecated and it's going away do
something about it and you'll see this
inside the jdk code so for example
where's my example
so think of this deprecating since 1.24
removal truth so like basically as far
as I'm concerned that's those guys say
don't use this so this is a good thing
it's a good thing for language
developers it's a good thing for us as
users because we can see these things
and figure out like how important it is
for us to migrate our code away from
particular deprecated usages and push
API updates so there's a whole set of
thing so I haven't had much of a chance
to really play with yet and but i'll try
and give you an idea so you can do
things like users process builder to run
things like that LS command to do things
like grips to do things copy this code
from somewhere else i don't really know
what it does okay you know you can use
the nice dreams api to build up various
operations and perform them and and i
think for me it's fun fact the most
stupid thing but the ability to actually
get the pit of your of your process is
really really useful so i think
particularly for people who might be
managing their own services they might
be creating small services and rather
than kind of running in application
servers or relying on some framework
called library a lot of people now are
sort of like deploying tiny services and
they kind of want to manage some of this
stuff themselves and i think the the new
process api's can help them do that so i
think this is really useful for a
particular set of of developers and
multan currency updates is a really
helpfully named chip you just kind of
put a bag of stuff in there so this has
got completed or future in there some
other bits and pieces but for me the
most interesting thing is the flow API
so the support for the reactive API and
if anyone do using any of the reactive
frameworks like Eric's java or reactor
or occur a few of you okay so i think
what's really interesting to me about
this is that in java 9 the the api the
interfaces for these reactive
implementations it's connecting to the
language and to me that suggests that
reactive programming is really here to
stay this idea of being able to listen
to events and
to them rather than be doing like crud
style gettin setter type operations so
there's definitely a sort of a mind
shift towards this event driven type
architecture and now this is kind of as
part of Java nine now none of the
libraries are part of Java nine that the
API is our plan for example if I'm a
library developer I can expose the
reactive API and say I kind of do
reactive type stuff but using the Java 9
interfaces not having to depend on some
other implementations I'll try and give
you a bit of an example I have another
talk which will be available on video in
a couple of months which goes into this
in more detail but I'll just try and
give you an idea so when i created this
code I kind of had in mind though it's
going to be as an event-driven
reactivity type application so i created
an interface called message listener and
anything which was kind of listening to
event is going to listen to messages
implement message listener so if i have
a look at one of these things and then
they all say have to implement on
message but what I might do now in Java
nine is instead of implementing message
listener I might implement floats
subscriber of strength implement those
methods and this our next is the
equivalent of take this appear of my own
message so now I'm so now my own message
is now on next which is implementing
flow dr. describer and also the good
thing is it forces me to think about
these other things which are part of the
reactive API which is what do I do when
I subscribe to something because i am a
subscriber what do i do when i am
subscribed to something what do i do
when i get an error what do i do when
this stream of events has finished so i
have to implement those things as well
and i have been playing a bit more with
this for this other presentation about
java line reactors java 9 I don't really
recommend that you grow your own react
implementation it's a it's not easy but
I would recommend that perhaps if you
have some boundaries between services
for example you might want to use the
Java 9 flow API and then you can be
implementing between those services you
can be implementing in RX Java you can
be implementing it in like the spring
reactive or whatever and the
implementations don't matter you can use
the Java 9 flow API to define those
boundaries between your reactive
services so then this is really
interesting in terms of embracing
reactive is like a really important
programming paradigm that were going to
be using going forward if you were not
already using it MJ show okay so let's
talk a little bit about the repple
there's another talk later on which I
think goes into the replimat it more
detail so I'm not going to cover it too
much and let's have a look so IntelliJ
IDEA doesn't have like an implementation
of the repple yet it's kind of on the on
the agenda but it's not what we've done
that's very sure what i'm doing is i'm
using the terminal inside intellij idea
because this is windows and the command
is windows command misguided so so I'm
using the terminal inside IntelliJ
because it's a little bit easier because
I can do things like I don't know
copying and pasting which is useful and
I can have it near my code so i can
easily move stuff inside my IDE so this
is jay shell is a ripple i can do simple
things like i can type hello and outputs
hello and assigns it to some temporary
variable i can say 2+2 gives me the
answer and assigns it to the template
variable now I've been doing java
programming for about 20 years i haven't
used a lot of other languages i haven't
used any languages that use ripples so
this is like oh isn't it exciting I
don't know anything about ruffles and
it's not part of my usual workflow so my
demo is aimed at people who don't really
use ripples so if you are a record
person you know all this stuff you know
how it works one of the things to notice
is that there's like a lot less ceremony
than normal Java code there's no
semicolons there's no assignment to a
variable if you want to you can so i can
say int age equals 20
and now I have a variable called age I
can create methods so I can say it
strange names and if I haven't finished
my statement it will just kind of expect
me can you see that it will just kind of
expect me to carry on my statement and
like you would with a sequel terminal so
I can return Tricia now I need a
semicolon clothes off my statement and
then I have a method called lame I can
call that one of the things which I was
really excited about in a really silly
way is I get tab completion inside the
ripple so I don't have to type
everything like you know a real ide and
so that's kind of that's quite cool and
what else and if I've done something
wrong like then it'll give me a familiar
ish compile type error okay so that's
quite cute for anything else interesting
oh yes and there's the repple has sort
of command of its own so if i type / and
type tab you can see i hope you can see
all these different commands so i can do
things like I concede bars so that's all
the variables I've defined so far these
including the temporary ones and my yeah
the temple want only ones that i define
with the name and I can do history and
that will show me everything I've typed
and I can imagine this being really
useful for taking a look at all the
operations are trying to perform and
maybe turning them into a script or into
a more useful real classic somewhere
else so that's kind of that's the record
and IntelliJ IDEA doesn't it doesn't
support it beyond kind of this level for
the time being but our vision is it will
be very much like to the sequel console
and the groovy console so the groovy
console for example you can do the same
sorts of think so you say hello run it
you get the results you can say 2+2 and
you run it and you get the results so
the advantage is that might not seem
like super exciting but the advantages I
can use my life templates inside my
groovy console so all the stuff that I'm
used to using inside IntelliJ my code
completion my life template
red squiggly lines and so forth I can
get them inside the degree we consult
and the plan is to do something similar
for the Java repple as well and the
referal has an API so we should be able
to plug into that and we should be able
to provide that functionality and we
intend to at some point and the other
thing from an intelligible point of view
is we have this idea of scratch files so
we can create a Java scratch file and
the idea is that obviously for other
languages that aren't Java you can kind
of like play with it and run it and
output it if you try to do that with
Java let's say we do that and goes all
know you can't do that we're expecting a
class like okay so I have to do a class
with all of the ceremony I have to do a
method and have to do all of this and
you're like I'm not entirely sure why
I've got a Java scratch file and
basically what I've just created is a
class file so and even if i run this
it's a it doesn't work i think oh that's
because I've got a compiler errors and
wealth but it doesn't work because it's
not in a file called scratch so it's
that it did work I think this might be
some of the Java line changes and so our
goal is to plug the Java scratch files
into the repple as well so that we can
minimize a lot of the spoiler plate and
be able to run it and via the repple
that's kind of the plan so some of the
examples that I was showing there are
from the ruffle tutorial from the
OpenJDK this is really useful actually
there's loads of stuff in there that
kind of opened my eyes to what the
repple can do because it is kind of one
of those flashing command-line things so
it's not obvious what is available to
you so this gives you some hints as to
what you can do from an intelligent of
view we'd really like your help around
the ripple if people are using it if
people have used rebels previously and
want to see the same sorts of features
in the support in IntelliJ IDEA this is
the the issue and for what we're going
to do with the ruffle I believe it just
says we should implement some things
that supports the report
so any ideas welcome and any upvotes if
you think it's really important also
welcome from other interesting bits and
pieces around Java nine alright so jet
263 high DPI graphics on Windows this is
particularly interesting to me because
this is the surface it has a high DPI
display IntelliJ IDEA has had to do an
awful lot of developers have done a lot
to try and get it to be high DPI given
that was code in Java on Windows and
with Java nine we're going to use jet
263 to be able to display until the day
in a nice high definition way on Windows
and html5 javadoc so you can generate
html5 javadoc that's cool right because
everyone wants to do html5 javadocs I
shoot and that's not by default by the
way you have to pass in a flag to do
that so it just won't magically turn
your java docking something amazing and
pretty and javadoc search this is
actually one of my favorite features as
well there were a lot of favorite
features in java nine and because
there's lots of really nice little
things which make life easier so now
this is the java nine javadoc and i have
a little search box in the corner who
knew that this sort of thing would be
really useful so i can type something
and you know i can actually search and
go to stuff oh yeah I turned off my
Wi-Fi because I don't trust my friend
and so I think that's that's really
really useful especially for looking up
things in the Java nine javadoc and and
finally I can't have mentioned this
right at the beginning as well but the
default garbage collector is now g one
so i think people who really care about
the performance of the details of the
performance of their garbage collector
have probably already tuned third by
default said probably don't really care
about this so people who don't care
about garbage collection the fact that
is now g one they probably don't really
care about that either but it is a
change in default behavior so it's worth
checking out and just making sure that
nothing weird is going on with your
application and so yes oh well I've
actually finished with a reasonable time
in summary jerilyn is more than jigsaw
and I personally think there are lots of
really nice small features which just
make our lives as developers really easy
move stuff on the streams API the
actions factory methods the process API
all of these little bits and pieces are
just going to make our lives a little
bit easier and there's quite a lot to
gain so all those little tiny things
from our productivity performance
improvements and I think modularity is
going to be really good at helping us to
think about encapsulation good design
principles and things like that as well
and there was potentially going to be
some time moving towards Java nine so
it's a good idea to find that sooner
rather than later I really think it's
now is a good time to start playing it's
much more the EA is much more stable and
it's a good time to figure out like
before it's far too late what could
potentially go wrong with your coat all
of the links that I've posted the slides
other bits and pieces are all available
at this at this URL and of course if you
have any questions and stuff you can
always a ping me on Twitter and I
actually have time for questions any
questions yes
ok
so the question is other plans in
IntelliJ to show when you're using a
deprecated things that's for removal
slightly differently more importantly
than a deprecation that's like are you
probably shouldn't use this and I
actually don't know about that but I
think that's a really good idea I think
that's something that we could probably
add quite easily and i will make a note
of that that's a good idea more
questions okay
yeah so the question is how do i think
in Tel Aviv specifically but probably
other tools will really handle modules
defined in Gradle / maven IntelliJ and
JDK that is such an excellent question
that's a very first question that I
heard I don't know I'm a little bit
scared about how you get the interaction
if you're using three different module
systems how are they going to interact
and you're going to want them because
you're going to want Gradle or maven to
manage your dependencies to do your
build you're going to obviously you're
going to want IntelliJ to understand
what those modules are and we're
probably going to start using jigsaw
modules as well so yeah I don't know the
answer to that and it's definitely
something that that concerns me but at
the moment from Thursday point of view
our policy at the moment is the when
you're working within the IDE the master
is the IntelliJ module system so what we
do is we take all those other module
systems and sort convert them into
IntelliJ modules and try and keep them
in sync as much as possible any more
questions you've been a great audience
