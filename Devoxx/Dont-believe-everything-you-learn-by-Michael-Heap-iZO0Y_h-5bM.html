seen it's got the most time slot I will
warn you there is audience participation
in this and I will wait till you just
put a photo of food in your mouth to ask
so I'll be ready for that you're here to
learn about things so you shouldn't
believe everything that you learn
because there are a lot of things that
we believe it true and they're not this
is a light-hearted talk it's inspired by
the falsehoods programmers believe about
X series of costs these exits Floyd time
names maps networks addresses all kinds
of things I'm Michael and I've made a
lot of mistakes in the past I've been
I've done everything from being
developed to assist up made developer
advocate and well everything here won't
be applicable to your day-to-day job
hopefully will make you think because
through a lot of assumptions that we
make in our day-to-day life that just
aren't true then we all have 15 minutes
so we're going to race through some of
these I'm going to start with everyone's
favorite time what's so neat you won the
number of days in every month starts
with a three so 30 or 31 true or false
what's the exception February 28 good
but each month has the same number of
days in it every year like false
what's the exception February 29 you are
awake
this is good but we can calculate that
there every four years that always holds
mate but you are not my target audience
why why is this false
it's a leap year unless it's divisible
by a hundred and not 400 but surely
surely that rule holds true all of the
time right
No
no one thought uncommon did that this
holds unless your Sweden because Sweden
changed in the jail into the Gregorian
calendar in seventeen hundreds instead
of just skipping the eleven days like
everyone else decided they were going to
do it over the period of 40 years by
just skipping leap years they were just
going to skip ten leap years and that
will give them sorry eleven leap years
no give them the eleven days they needed
I'm in there for forty years
the Swedish calendar will be out of step
with both the Gregorian and the Julian
calendar what we agreed it will always
be 28 or 29 what it will happen at some
point sometimes not if you Sweden but 28
or 29 days in February we can never have
the 30th yeah and let's just Whedon
because King Charles the 12th of Sweden
decided that the system of skip and leap
years wasn't really working but instead
of going to the Gregorian calendar she
went back to the Julian one I don't know
why but to do this they added an extra
dates in February in 1712 so 1712
the thirtieth of February existed in
Sweden let me think this is an isolated
incident it also happened in the Soviet
Union in 1930 and 1931 where they wanted
to change the weeks to have five days
and they wanted every month to have 30
days that's not that long ago 1930 but
only small companies get affected by
things like leap here's why they forget
their happens right I mean companies the
size of say in Microsoft the entire shoe
workload going down definitely not going
to happen but it did back in 2012 which
was Active Directory went down because
of a leap year bug
time always calls for words excluding
their life savings time people always
show that one out true or false yes
unless you're in Shanghai in 1927 it
went back five minutes and 52 seconds
this time actually happened twice and
chunk out that year how about the fact
that a month starts and ends in the same
year always yet if you of I should say
yes doesn't it unless you an ancient
Roman X invention wrong the year started
when the Consul took office and between
222 BC and 153 b.c those 15th of March
so the Roman year started in the middle
of March 14th was one year the 16th was
another but without ancient Romans like
we're living in the year 2017 but if
you're living in Ethiopia they have
their own calendar the Ethiopian year
for the years 1900 to 2099 inclusive the
first of masculine the first day of
their year is actually the 11th of
September today in Ethiopia a month
starts in one year and ends in another
most of those examples from the
seventeen hundreds engine bomb what
about today were programmers or well
started on the first of January 1970 the
offsets between two time zones will
remain constant true or false false with
ten changes last year ten and avoided
being two changes this year we think
it's just small countries thinking hey I
want easy revelations the United States
changed their DST times in 2005 2005 the
United States is not a small country
if they do change them the replenish
notice except the North Korea gave 8
days notice of a 30-minute time zone
change in 2015 and if we're including
DST changes here to get a whopping one
day's notice there was counseling DST
one there imagine being the developer
got that phone call saying our systems
have to change now this okay because we
can make some assumptions with time
zones like they're always plus or minus
an integer number of hours at sea
shaking head what's the minimum 15
minutes Afghanistan is four and a half
hours ahead North Korea is eight and a
half hours ahead and the Chatham Islands
in New Zealand or twelve hours and
forty-five minutes ahead so fifty
minutes a surf is it how confident are
you today you can be confident it is 15
minutes today but from 1880 to 1912
Dublin had its own time zone called
doubling mean time and doubling mean
time was 25 minutes and 21 seconds
before GMT only the Irish audience
participation time you've been pretty
good so forth but we look and ask you
know when are the more the less than 24
hours in the day
share the load yes their life savings
time the day will be 23 or 25 hours it's
the time 23 59 60 invalid why not leave
seconds yes
leave seconds a minute will be 61
seconds long today before Saturday is
always flatter true or false I hope you
get the feeling that most of these
aren't true right now like I'll tell you
why Samoa anyone being smaller well in
2011 on the 29th of November they
decided that they would jump off the
International Dateline so they went to
bed on Thursday and woke up on Saturday
not Friday
addresses not much from this time is
still pretty interesting if there is
building number it will always be
numeric no I want one a no buildings a
numbered zero if you've got a couple of
doors down from one there you actually
get to number zero Eggman world in
Middlesbrough but at least zeros aren't
important if it's not number zero you
can omit the leading zeros on normal
numbers unless you go to an appointment
in Elm Street Palo Alto where apartments
1 and 0 0 1 I'm in the same building but
on different floors it's treating them
one including number nope you can live
at number 8 7 gardens burger and this is
the UK example in the Netherlands they
actually have streets which are numbers
but the very least one your name is
herion streets would yeah we words there
is a town called Street in Somerset in
the UK you can't have two cities with
the same name in the same country true
false false the UK has 3 called Newport
and in all of them you can go to number
10 High Street this has been great from
since the advent of Sat Navs
people in number 10 highest rate Newport
and they got the one hell of a drive but
you don't get multiple poor scores per
building right a poor squad these inner
via you do if you got to the DVLA in
Swansea I mean it's huge but their
postcards actually direct mail to the
right Department b5 CSRs a 99 1 ba
driving licences I say 99 1 air B so on
street names will be reasonably short we
design a database we set 50 characters
for the street man that's got to be
enough for anyone right unless you got
to Bosnia and this is an 89 character
street name Bosnia lovely place I will
recommend it but they're just the make
our life difficult
I like this one addresses
fixed points in space true or false
false why yes no-one's got that before
well the BF one for FB is the postal
address of the HMS example but surely
concrete buildings concrete buildings
don't move they have a fixed point in
space were excluding earthquakes and
centimetres and things like that
here in the UK we have milk we have
moved buildings there is a lighthouse in
Sussex that removed 70 metres in 1999
because of costal erosion it was going
to fall into the sea so we lifted it up
hole and moved it that one was about 800
tons I think not like Ben Zurich Zurich
moved to 6,200 ton building fully
constructed they moved it 60 metres so
that their codes lesson Bill where lines
thank you again to all can't do all
countries have capital city
no they do not switzerland does not the
government is based in Bern
but that is not the capital of
Switzerland four minutes left
let's fly names a child will have the
same surname as either their mother or
their father true or false false example
Iceland
you don't take surname you are the son
or the daughter of your father I had the
doctor cough layer two a bit Fletcher
Mackel dear people have at least two
names shaking heads false teller of Penn
&amp;amp; Teller fen holder u.s. issue passport
with just the mental in it and a key he
taught the Emperor of Japan in Japan is
commonly thought that the state gives
you your surname and as the Emperor of
Japan there is no state to give you a
familya name so he's just not as Akihito
but most names don't contain numbers
right we've got John five fantastic
guitarists
but that's a stage name
how about Kaitlyn you're laughing do you
think this is true is this is false it's
false no one entered the doctor Calum
intimated it was even worse they thought
the H was too much so they changed into
the Roman numeral actually happens so
every will you come up with to a
guaranteed to be hundreds of exceptions
no spaces only letters one capital
letter
the only value of regex
through a name is dots toy audience
participation and then must contain one
or more alphanumeric characters true or
false false example okay I was at actual
thinking I should have said Unicode
there yeah okay one more unicode
characters the artist formerly known as
Prince give that man a cookie but I can
safely assume that this dictionary of
bad words contains no names in it I mean
have you ever been to Middlesex by
eating shiitake mushrooms perhaps you
were called clay Cogburn and couldn't
register your name at hotmail comm back
in 2004 I may be your Linda Callaghan
and couldn't register with Yahoo in 2006
well there's the less obvious ones
marketing for the Superbowl xxx was
horrible and even Planning Commission
email started bouncing because he was
talking about erecting the structure and
the castles whitelist was rejecting that
nothing is safe and then there's the sad
story of Christopher null he's a
technology journalist and he's currently
fighting the Bank of America because his
email addresses know at smell Mediacom
and they just won't accept it final
section commerce a product has a price
true or false
this includes zero it's multi question
false a products or the auction only has
a place when it's sold and at that point
it's no longer available currency
symbols uniquely identify a currency
true or false false the dollar sign is
used in the US Canada Australia Brunei
Namibia currencies have a Unicode symbol
that represents them
the Swiss Lang does not which currency
doesn't have a three-letter identifier
like USD GBP Canadian dollar so just
take a dollar on the ends because we say
it must be three letters in our systems
but it is actually just CA with a dollar
which brings us on to computers we're
all here because we're developers or we
work in tech we'll look it we don't have
to worry about time my name's I couldn't
say those are business decisions we just
have to worry about bits and bytes and
my computer's that's easy because the
network is reliable latency is zero
bandwidth is infinite the network is
secure
topology doesn't change there is one
administrator transport cost is zero and
the network is homogeneous I'm not
kidding none of this is true I mean we
can't even validate an email address
with that computers are hard humans make
assumptions and things are never as
simple as they seem
ask questions find out more it will make
your life easier in the long run one
minute all the time but I've been
Michael you can find me at M heap and
hopefully this will just make you think
a little bit more when you starting to
design systems Cheers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
