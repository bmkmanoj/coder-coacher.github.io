welcome everyone to this talk on fast
reliable swift builds with buck and
thank you all for coming it's quite late
in the evening and I know this is a
pretty Java and JVM focused conference
but I hope that this talk will show you
that there are some similarities in the
way these tools built and some of the
learnings that we got that we applied
here actually we took from the Android
development in work so even though this
will mostly be swift and iris related
examples I hope that you can take
something away from the ideas behind
this talk so my name is Robert Feng
dinkle I'm a software engineer at uber
engineering in Amsterdam and I work on
our mobile developer platform team
they're the mobile developer platform
team is a team that supports basically
all of our mobile engineers in being as
productive as possible with at their
tooling so during my tenure in uber we
scaled from around 20 to 30 engineers
for platform the over 200 engineer's for
platform and while doing that we sort of
ran into issues where the existing
tooling just wasn't enough wasn't
productive anymore people spend a lot of
time fighting their tools instead of
actually building and being productive
so that's why we started these mobile
developer platform teams and today I'm
going to talk about a very large project
that we did on iOS it's mostly got to do
with Swift and back surf being the new
language that we chose at the beginning
of 2016 the basically rewrite our apps
in and but is basically the tool that we
use to achieve that at a decent speed
so let's look at an overview of what
were you're going to talk about in this
look so first I'll give you an oversized
view of swift see the swift compiler
we'll talk a little bit about what makes
where see different from other tools
that you might have used before as an
iOS engineer and how the compilation
model slightly differs but also how it's
interesting the a little bit closer than
Java and codling compared to and a
client based language such as C and C++
then we'll look at bug a build tool
which is very useful when you have a lot
of source code in a single repository
and then in the end of this book will
look a little bit about at how the
implementation of 50 buck or 15 buck
helped uber and made us more productive
so first Swift Swift was introduced in
2014 by Apple as basically their new
defect the language for the platform
Swift is currently a version 4 it's gone
to a couple of iterations and it is a
compiled language based on the LVN
back-end it's kind of different compared
to most languages we see at this
conference which are pretty much always
based on the JVM that there are
definitely similarities in how they work
so let's look at a very simple Swift
example and I hope everyone is able to
follow this we we have three files
basically a point align in the main file
the point file defines a data structure
of that which we will call point it
contains an X and the y variable which
are two integers we also have a line
structure which basically contains two
points a start and an end and there is a
lazy computed variable what is the line
length then to make this a very simple
binary that we can actually run we'll
just instantiate one of these lines give
it two points for the start in the end
and then we'll print the line length
when we do this one thing you might
notice here is that we have multiple
files but there are no import statements
and this is a completely legit way of
writing Swift and there is a very like
you can structure your code this way and
then we'll actually compile
in larger projects it's probably not
such a good idea because you can have
issues with namespace collusion
basically everything and every file is
included in everything from every other
file so this is not the only way to
compile Swift this one point there's
also no explicit main so if knows that
if you have a mangled Swift file you can
have top-level declarations in there or
statements that will actually execute it
small side note not super important for
this example the more important thing
for project structure is we don't have
to have everything in Swift files that
we can file together we can actually
apply a little bit of structure to our
code base so say for example we want to
structure our code based more we could
put the swift or the point and the line
structs into a geometry module and
module is very comparable to sort of the
package in Java and basically
encapsulates a piece of functionality we
can then import this module and to our
main module and now we do need explicit
imports and basically the structure a
large code base such as the code base we
have a duper this is the way to go
because otherwise enjoy and it will be
very hard to compile so you can take
this even further you can make the line
it's our module you can make the point
its own module make sure you have
explicit imports between all of these
and what you see now is that project
structure is actually quite important
when compiling Swift so when we look at
project structure we need to define a
good way of a good relationship between
all of these modules another something
that book will help us a lot but before
we actually go look at buck and how it
does implement things I want to thank
you through the simple steps that you
would take to actually compile Swift
manually on the command line so it makes
a little bit more sense how you could
automate this into a system
so first let's look at the simple hell
page for the swift compiler what you'll
notice here is that swift takes a set of
files which are the inputs and these are
all the inputs that know about each
other so if you use or if you define a
type in one file you can automatically
use it in the other file as long as you
group those into the same cone violation
command you can then use the Swift
compiler to either omit object files or
even go further and make this with
compiler I'll give you a library or an
executable executable that's ready to go
so there is a small new ones in the
Swift compiler that is that it's
basically structured into a compiler
driver and a front-end and the compiler
driver is basically what will think
about the relationship between if I
compile this file first I need to
compile that file as well then I need to
merge some things in the end and maybe
link it if you want an executable and
library so that's sort of the task of
the compiler driver then we have the
compiler front end and the front end
will actually take a source file look at
it analyze it create the abstract syntax
tree type check it and do everything
which is necessary for actually
compiling it so then besides getting an
output like an object file from the
source compiler it also has this option
called email module quite an important
option these module files which the
compiler can emit are basically a
serialized version of the interface that
a library exposes so it can be imported
into other modules so let's look at a
little bit more concrete example of this
so we go back to your super simple
example of the point aligned in the main
Swift file if we compile all of these
together we can ask the Swift inviter to
give us the object files and Link all of
this together so these three files go
into this wave compiler at once the
Swift compiler will give us all the
object files for all the Swift files and
then link them together into a main XQ
we can also do it a little bit
differently so as such as we explored
before we drooped the plain and the
lines will file into the geometry module
and then we have a main module that just
imports that in this case we only need
to start with two square files we can
pass these two straight files to the
compiler and ask it for the object file
associated with it as well as the
importa Balma duel so we now also have a
geometry that's with mojo artifact which
combined with the main module we can
give this 50 again this will give us
more object files which we can then
combine linked together and make into a
real executable the Swift module file is
what enables the import geometry module
or import geometry statement in the main
notes without the work and these are
basically the steps you have to take in
order to compile Swift in a reasonable
way so this is a very simple example
that imagine that a code base like
goobers where we share a lot of our code
between the four apps we have in
production free apps my bad
we have on iOS more than 300 of these
separate modules on Android we have over
a thousand so you need to have a very
good in structured way of building those
and but really how CIL's with that so
that's a good buck buck is a tool that
was developed at Facebook that helps
them build large code bases really fast
it has a declarative build language
which basically means that buck knows
very well how to compile certain rules
whether it's how to make a Java jar how
to make an executable for an iPhone how
to make a apk that you can send to the
Android or to the Google Play Store buck
has rules about all these things that
exactly define their inputs and their
outputs and this makes puck a very
opinionated build system which is not
always easy to customize but when you
get back for this is correct incremental
builds
and that's a very big thing because buck
knows very well what goes into your
application and what comes out of the
source and how I can combine these
things together but we'll always build
correct increment incrementally and this
is huge if you have a large code base
what's even better is because it knows
this so well and it knows how to make
the artifacts that it produces basically
machine-independent
you can actually share your cache and
you can actually share your intermediate
build artifacts between a lot of
machines which has the result that if I
build some code with buck and we have a
distributor cache that I share in the
office with my co-workers they will
never have to build that code again
because buck will know that basically
there is a specific input that produces
a specific output and if you didn't
change any of the input files and
someone else already did the compilation
you don't have to do it again so it's
very useful especially on CI builds and
Buck is a command line tool even though
maybe not everyone is as comfortable in
like programming in vim and then writing
something on their command line to build
that's why book has IDE integration
through project generation so does the
creative build language helps you very
much in defining a structure for your
project but from this structure it can
actually generate project files so
there's no need to commit any insightly
J or X code or other project files into
your repo anymore there won't be anymore
conflicts there's just a very nice
declarative language that sort of
explains how your project should be
built and we can also generate projects
with that then the last great thing
bucks open-source face book produce it
it's out there in the world it's super
useful for us because we can play around
with it we can customize it however we
want and we definitely recommend you
take a look at it so let's go back to
our example and make everything a little
bit more concrete
we again look at the geometry and the
main modules and sort of look at how
they would fit in the buck file so the
buck file is what defines the project
structure in a buck and in this case we
say we have a library that we named
geometry and it contains these two
source files we also have a binary names
name it has one source file the main
Swift file but it also has a dependency
and it has the dependency on this
geometry file or on the geometry module
so this is a very simple example but
Buck has rules for everything from
libraries by knees the app bundles the
things you would send to your customers
if you want to sign them in specific
ways you can configure all of this so
this gives you a really nice way to
structure your project what's even
better about that is because Buck knows
this project structure so well there is
a very great query language in buck and
you can look at how your dependencies
are structured you can find all the bass
from one Benton C to another you can
basically visualize your tree if you
visit or ask buck to produce a dot file
which you can then visualize with graph
is so you've got a very neat
representation of all your elements it's
even better about this query language is
that it allows you to understand how
your codebase changed so using this you
can for example find the differences in
your codebase between one state commit
and another and if you know what changed
between those things you can know
exactly which subset of your codebase
you should be testing and this is
something that is usually useful for us
on CI so we have this rather abstract
structure is the finding sets of targets
so this is a very high level conceptual
idea of okay I have a main binary it
depends in some other library and it's
not it doesn't tell you anything about
how buck would execute this so this is a
very high-level concept which is called
a target graph in buck
then look at how buck will actually take
this information and create a way of
executing this is the process which
transforms the target graph into
something we call the action graph and I
have an example of an action graph here
I'm gonna have to break this down a
little bit because it's hard to really
visualize and explain this but I hope
this helps so if we look at this top
down we see that there is a rule for
creating the main binary the rule
contains some steps it will link and
strip to produce a binary the rule also
has the specific hasis hash associated
with it and that's what we call the
rookie the rookie can be calculated in
different ways mostly through the
dependencies but I'll talk about that a
little bit later after I explain the
rest so to create the main binary which
is linking and stripping we need the
object file from both the main Swift and
the geometry Swift compiler
so these are two dependencies that are
steps that we have to take first before
we can actually construct the main
binary in the same way the main Swift
compile rule depends on the Swift file
as well as the Swift compiler because
also if our tools changed or if the
version of the compiler changes we would
want to recompile it so that's why tools
such as a compiler will also be in
dependency then it also depends on the
output and specifically the Swift module
file of the geometry Swift compiled
group so that's what the other
relationship is about so to sort of like
explain what these cash blue keys do we
can look at how this changes when we
change the main file so now you see that
here we changed the main Swift file and
we can see that the rookie's for the
main swift and power rule and the main
binary rule have changed so what we can
see here is basically that when buck
goes and creates this graph and
and execute step by step based on
everything that's available in this case
if you would do a clean build while in
the left state it would have to execute
all the rules because there is nothing
but then it will have a cache artifact
for the rule associated with the three
five zero serf compile rule so then when
we would edit the main swift file it
would construct this graph again see
that part of what it's already part of
what it has to build was already built
so we'll never actually execute that and
we'll just use the artifact that you
used before or that you created before
then what's even better about this is
that these cache keys are calculated in
such a way that they are machine
independent so what I just mentioned
before is like if I already compile this
this will already be in a cache that me
and my co-workers can use which has to
be big advantage that if you just
changed the main file then you only have
to do part of the combining and this is
what makes buck so powerful for us so
let's look at how powerful it actually
is so in looking at how we'd rolled out
buck and Swift that you were um we're
going to look a little bit about what
happened when we rolled that cache out
compared to the build times we had
before we look a little bit in the
performance analysis that bug gave us
which was really easy to look at and
then how we customized the build to make
it even better so this is a graph that
shows basically the Bill times that we
had on our CI systems for a while the
Green Line is a set of line the orange
line is what the actual bill time was
and then the red line is the actual
testing time in addition to the build
time so then when we actually deployed
our distributed cache we saw a
significant drop in most of our build
times not every of our bill times and
there is good reasons for that but most
of our builds were actually getting a
lot faster when you see the pretty high
peaks in this it's because even though
you create this cache in such a way if
developers update something which is
very low
in the graph of stuff you have to
execute basically everything will have
to be rebuilt so um you can still have a
correct build so if someone changes a
very low-level logging miry for example
which is included basically everywhere
this will trigger a rebuild of the whole
code base which is expected but they'll
still take a long time by having this
cache and being able to share these
things across machines what we were able
to do in a very easy way is basically
parallelized our testing because we
could just build on one machine and then
as soon as it was building we could test
it on every other machine because when
you would just ask it to build it it
would download it from the cache and we
don't have to go through a difficult
process of sending test artifacts from
one machine to another but it became
pretty easy to just paralyze testing so
as I mentioned isn't a silver bullet
depending on what you change in the
codebase you'll still have to do a lot
of building but it does help and we did
have to tweak our cache a little bit
make sure we weren't caching the
incorrect things this is these are
things that buck allows you to do so
it's actually pretty easy to get in a
good working state so what we actually
want to do in the future is make sure
that people can locally use the cache we
create on CI and this is quite difficult
for us on iOS because our IDE
integration isn't as top of notch as on
Android but our Android developers are
actually able to locally use the cache
on CI and this makes it our builds even
locally quite fast so then we thought
about if our clean bills aren't so fast
are there ways we can even optimize
those further and park was a pretty good
choice there because it turns out the
buck is a very good way of sort of
analyzing your build process and
identifying the bottlenecks so what bug
does in every build is it generates a
trace file very much similar to a chrome
tracing format you can actually just
open it in chrome so when we did that
for one of our builds it became pretty
obvious that we had a problem even
though we had
a threats to execute our bills on for a
very big percentage of the build the
built was executed or was stalling on
one thread and one we investigated
further why that was the case it turned
out that it's related to the way we
build so if you look at the planed
simple line example and this is where
the boxes are drawn around the Swift C
Swift module and object file is that is
an atomic operation when you invoke
Swift C with a swift file it will give
you this fifth module and the object
file but if you look at the graph of how
the dependencies are structured we
actually only need this fifth module
file to start working on our next rule
and the object file we don't need until
linking so what we looked at here is
like can we break this up and make it so
that we can continue with other rules
and paralyze better by just having this
fifth module file a lot earlier than we
have the object file so a quick
introduction the Swift compiler Swift is
an LVN bat conveyor so if you look at
the major stages it goes through from
source code actual assembly which your
computer right executes it will take the
source transformed into naps likes
injects the type decade and then the
next major step is to create the first
intermediate language representation of
your program this is a representation in
which you are in which v applies a lot
of the optimizations regarding speed in
size and it still contains a lot of
specific information then after that
it's lowered in the oil into the LLVM
intermediate representation this is an
and this is a representation that the
LVM back-end compiler can actually turn
in the object files so looking at this
the Swift module is actually available
after the sale stage this with
intermediate language stage and we
didn't really need to wait for the
object
this was just how it was implemented by
default this is what we sort of like
when with whom we implemented it as well
but then we thought hey we can actually
optimize this so he did and then here's
a before and after picture of what
happened because we could use our
threats in such a better way compared to
what we had before we were actually able
to reduce the time spent combining Swift
- by 35%
just because we weren't waiting for a
big bottleneck in the way our
dependencies are structured so that was
pretty powerful for us as well so let's
recap that a little bit so it does
definitely compile very different from
objective-c but in some ways actually
close to the Java where it doesn't have
this defined interface which would have
an header files it's just a bunch of
source which you need to compile into
some form to be able to use it in
dependency so it compiles per module and
yeah it has this generated interface I
mentioned before so project structure is
very important is something that we we
figured out project structure realistic
they'd say it's how easy it is to build
your program how easy it is to
incrementally build your program and
having a good project structure or
something that can be helped and you can
help keep your code base healthy and in
a good project structure if you have the
tool like Bach that makes it very easy
to sort of analyze your project
structure then for us at scale but
really had good advantages over the
default tools that we used the fact that
we could generate projects that we could
just have a new chef everyone generate
the projects that they want out of the
huge code base the fact that we have a
distributed cache that makes compiling
so much faster on our CI and the fact
that we had a completely custom built
system which is open source where we
could compile or we could add anything
we want was something that was super
useful for us and much better than
relying on the custom tools that vendor
supply
it did have some challenges though so
the detail about Swift is that Apple
made it in such a way that it's very
intraoperative with Objective C it is
however very hard the slides that I
showed are very simple examples of just
Swift but once you start to mix that in
one of those single targets that graph
becomes quite complicated another issue
we had when we started doing this is
that Swift is not designed for remote
cacheable artifacts the Swift modules
are not in a stable state it's a binary
format that can still change between
every swift release so until there is
ABI stability there might still
occasionally be a bug in actually
cashing these Swift modules because they
might be dependent on some flower which
is in the developers local computer we
haven't seen a lot of issues with this
but this is something that Facebook
encountered when they were using your
project then a last challenge and which
we want to work on is ABI based caching
in Swift we're currently the rookies are
computed based in this first file we
could because this horse might not
actually change the API of the resulting
binary if you're changing private
implementation details you don't
actually have to recompile a lot so this
is something you see as a potential win
so I would definitely encourage you to
look at Facebook bug repo and get up and
give it a give it a try this is my talk
thank you very much and are there any
questions ok thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
