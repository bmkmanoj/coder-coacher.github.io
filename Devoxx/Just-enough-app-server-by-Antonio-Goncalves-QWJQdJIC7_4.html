being here on the last talked before the
beer I'm gonna give you talk about
application service who use application
servers okay me so everybody knows a
little bit of java ee heard that it was
dead but i've heard its back okay so my
name is antonio gonçalves i'm a
developer I'm a contractor so I'm my own
boss and i discovered java a long time
ago and java ee also a long time ago
because it used to be called j to eat
1.2 i was working for be a systems and i
was doing ejb 110 i was doing clustering
with failover stateful DJ bees and i
became so good at that i needed to
express myself and write books so i
wrote plenty of books about java ee + +
ib and then I became a chapel champion
so I've been doing java ee for a long
long time and today i am going to talk
again about java java ee is nearly 20
years old you know 17 things a move on
but not a human being sometimes
a lot of people think that Java is
bloated an application servers a huge
and so I'm just this talk is about Java
EE and application service I'm gonna
mostly focus on job on java ee
application service in 2016 how do we
see java ee application service bang one
big book one monolith you know an
application server something big and
it's slow its fat all boring every way
that's something you know we took for
many many years about light way in a V
way and not sexy so that's the way we
see java application service so let's
take some of these know ejectives so
application servers are monolithic this
is the java ee application servers I'm
talking here about weblogic glassfish
pyara websphere while fly jboss so these
guys implement the food java ee 7
specification but if you have followed
the easter e of java ee you know that in
java ee 6 i'm talking 2009 in java ee 6
we created the web profile all these
guys weblogic glassfish x alla implement
both the full java ee e plus the web
profile they must and then there's other
guys that only implement the web profile
apache Tommy the most famous one
cultural with rate regime see us so
these guys only implement the
profile there's something else there's
also the servlet containers so in Java
EE we have the full profile we have the
web profile and that's it but for a long
long time we had jetty tomcat and an
undertow that would implement sir
servlet containers so Java EE
application servers are not monolithic
there are three models but even that you
know it's not true you know because Java
EE is the genesis of java ee is bit
synthesis so the servlet containers they
mostly implement the servlet
specification plus expression language
lesbian so on this specification of
their own life they live you know they
released differently the expert group
are different so these four pieces
actually do not bundle you know it's not
a model it's for specifications with
different implementations same thing for
the web profile that's where we find CDI
jph ATA and java ee is that java ee 7
has all these bits and pieces that have
different versions they evil other at a
different pace so application servers by
the genesis of application service is
bundle trying to bundle all these bits
and pieces so Java EE is only good
synthesis so application servers are an
aggregation of bits and pieces they run
on the JVM the JV
one day will be split into bits and
pieces if jigsaw comes and this is what
we do so this is our business code we
asked maven to bring what's missing and
NPM we end up doing this kind of work so
if you leave in the Java EE world and
the application server world that's what
we do you know we have Java bits and
pieces at the bottom we have these java
ee bits and pieces in the middle and we
depend on vintage pieces so application
service by design cannot be monolithic
but things happen in the history but by
design they aggregate bit synthesis and
we will see that later that we can take
some bits and pieces out when we don't
need them ok so application servers by
design and not monolithic but what we
say is that they are slow application
servers are slow so here I hope you can
see yep it's fine um during winter oh I
downloaded most of the application
servers on this planet full java ee web
profile and servlet containers and what
I did on my Mac 16 gigs of ram no docker
no VirtualBox just on this machine here
I downloaded them all and asked I
started them up and shut them down and I
did that a few times and I measured so
here you have the startup time of all
the application servers so again no
twist same jvm no optimization
no I didn't want to dig into XML files
or you know just you download startup
stop do that a few times and measure
check the logs and you see that yes
indeed tomcat starts up in half a second
under on the right side there on the
green bar and the tome starts up in one
point something seconds but those guys
in the green bar only implement the
servlet easy easy if you move to the to
the orange that's where we have the web
profile the web profile is roughly 20
specifications something like that that
stopped counting java ee 7 is 34 and the
web profile is something around 20 here
it's quite quite interesting because
Tommy starts up in half a second Tommy
is Bay Don's based on on tomcat and when
you start it up he does some nice tricks
to bootstrap quickly instead of
implementing for specifications Toby
implements 20 specifications and it will
you move to the blue side that's full
Java EE so if you take the you know the
best of the best let's say wildfly 10
start stop start stop two seconds while
flying and now show you a funny slide
later boots 2034 specifications plus
admin console plus plus plus plus in two
seconds weblogic is slightly slower than
the others websphere liberty is not bad
at all so the first thing after two
hours of looking on the entire internet
i discovered that i couldn't i couldn't
have websphere full on my macintosh as
doesn't work so I don't have these
number here I would say that weblogic
websphere foo is also you know slightly
higher but websphere liberty is a funny
beast because it has the same base code
of the full websphere except it has less
things so it's the same code with less
things and it boots in 3 seconds and
here i was using Liberty 15 something
and the latest it's slightly faster just
under 33 seconds so it's quite
interesting to see that on the green
side servlet container tho those guys
boots in half second one second but on
the opposite side the full Java EE they
put in two seconds no and they implement
many many more things this is another of
exercise slightly different because I
had to use a virtual box with windows so
I virtualize etc etc so here it's not
just the startup time what I did is I
did into history and I managed to find a
JBoss 3.2 I managed to find a JBoss 4.2
jboss 5 jboss 607 so on the green line
sorry yellow line on the yellow line you
have all the java ee of specifications
meaning the first point we are in j2ee
1.3 it implements 12 specs the second
point we are in j2ee at one point for it
implements 16 specifications and it goes
up and up and up till java ee 7 which is
implements 34 specifications
so the yellow is java ee getting bigger
and bigger and bigger doing more and
more things now the red line is the same
thing that I've done you know except
it's on a virtual box so of course it's
slower but it's quite interesting to see
that many years ago jboss was starting
in less than five seconds but jboss was
only implementing 12 specifications and
today jboss starts in four seconds on a
virtual box but implements 34
specifications so no application
services are not slow and i will show
you something later application servers
are huge and they consume a lot of
resources mostly hard drive and memory I
did the same thing that was a bit more
tricky but I took all these application
servers I've studied an application
server I measured it with jconsole and
you know left it for a few seconds and i
triggered the GC and roughly to seeing
how an empty you know this is a
completely empty an empty application
server but consumes in memory min and
Max a blue and red again if you go to
the extreme right you see the Tomcat and
consumes 50 megs at the most in memory
but you know wildfly 9 consumes 100
jboss 7 EAP consumes 350 but they've
realized the new release so I think
they've improved that because i was
talking to them many months ago even
weblogic is not that bad in terms of
memory e so you know again there was all
this thing of lightweight avia in a
webby way I don't really know what that
means I just know that Tomcat compared
to a JBoss or PR
or glassfish consumes less but not that
less you know so no application service
do not consume a lot of resources now
it's a topic where I'm going to spend a
bit of time application servers use
updating packaging this is what we've
been doing for the last 17 years so this
is our application java ee java SE and
what we do to package our application is
the skinny one approach so we're talking
about Java EE put your code and your
dependencies in a war file and deploy
this war file on on a running
application server skinny wall because
we just have our code and the
dependencies on the web and flip there's
the spring approach the fatwa so spring
is I package my code with my
dependencies now I have to depend on
hibernate so I package it I need to
depend on Jack's arrest so I need to
package it so we always add to deal with
a skinny wha inside let's say yeah heavy
way java ee application server or a
fatwa deployed into a lightweight java
ee application server mainly namely
servlet container so spring will package
everything and run on tomcat or jetty so
now i'm going to show you a demo and i
will i will use this demo true
throughout the throughout the talk to
show you bits and pieces
okay so what do we do in in Java EE so
here i have three applications top CD
gives me a list of cities top books give
me a list of books and CD bookstore so
that's a shopping e ecommerce shopping
app where you can buy books and cities
so what we do is we ask our friend maven
please i caddied these applications and
maven he is going to create three skinny
was so if i look at top CD target i have
a war that is 5ks and the others are
slightly bigger and i will explain you
why and now i have wildfly so i do i
start it up completely empty I hope it's
empty I hope I didn't leave things
inside doing the demo so i can i can
check that by going to to the console
unfortunately you know you see i add
deploy things so here i have a script
and i can go under ploy so that
undeposited 31 files here it is I can
see the logs here I can go to the
console we will refresh it the three web
apps are not there and if i go back i
have a little script going to deploy and
that's going to deploy my three web apps
that's what we do when we work with java
ee so i'm going to show you what it does
you know this is a jsf application it's
not dead yet
with fancy Ajax and I can search from
java ebooks i can connect so i can
connect as an administrator will
remember me and so on admin admin when
I'm an administrator I can browse all
the cds in the database I can do crud
operations a book as a jar the sorry a
CD blues so here it's just basic crud
crud application but only for
administrators so this application here
is using ejbs JTA the full monty if i
log out and if i log in as a user and
akin i can buy books ok so here i am i
buy a book and guess what i have a
shopping cart and if i do check out it
has created an order this list here of
top-rated books and top-rated cities
it's actually the other two web
applications so here i have let's call
it a micro service that gives me a list
of top rated books in Jesus okay and I
have another micro service that does the
same thing for gives me a list of top
books so now if something goes bad in my
top CD player let's say I remove it so I
don't have CDs anymore here on the main
page I will lose my CDs because they
communicate with one another ok so here
up
undeployed to a book stop CD and on the
webpage on the front page I do not have
the top rated books just to show you
that this application needs the two
other microservices so here is the demo
ok I've I've shown you the context then
I will do three these three applications
are three completely different needs the
CD bookstore so the one with the
ecommerce etc etc uses most of java ee i
use jsf web pages ejbs with JT a CD I I
do not use and JMS or batch but mostly i
use all most of the java ee
specifications the top books the one
that returns the five top rated books
also a bit complex i do not use jsf of
ejb but i actually I do have a database
so i'm using jpa and JTA and because it
produces jason i'm using geez NP so i
use less specifications top CD top CD i
wanted to make the smallest possible
thing ever so it's just a servlet you
know the jesus is made by hand there's
no database is just a dumb list with
random numbers so top cities is one
servlet what a waste isn't it we have
three different web applications i'm not
even talking that they are deployed in
the same wildfly I could have deployed
them into three different observers okay
but each one is running on a full java
ee application server why waste why what
about
only what we need in a uber job so
that's something new that's you know
appearing is let's have fat jazz so we
went from skinny was too fat was now we
are talking about fat jars so let's
bundle the CD bookstore with only what
we need we don't need patch with on each
ms let's package the top books with only
what we need jpa angie's in P and the
best of the best is the top CD because
it's only a servant we can already do
that in Java EE there's all these
frameworks here i'll be using wildfly
swamp but we have a Yara micro Tommy
yaku mu lu z we can do that we've been
into doing that for more than a year now
and we can take because application
servers are made of bits and pieces let
only take the bits and pieces that we
need package that into a jar file with
our code in it you might have heard a
spring boot which is sort of Java EE
they rely a lot on java ee like servlet
in jp-a but they also do other things
and there's others you know drop with it
and legume and we know there's there's
other things up needing on the micro
cervix microservice world and here I i
want to point at the ones that are able
to package our entire application plus
runtime into a neck secure table job so
i'm going to do a live demo of one flies
one i'm going to show you a bit of code
top CD top CD is a servlet berms
that produces jeez and but the Jason is
done by hand and it's random numbers I
do not have anything else not even an
XML file um so if i stop jboss now jboss
is over let's go to top cities top
cities it's a war file of 5 k's running
on a full wildfly and so to use wild
flies one the only thing I do i do not
touch my coat on its I I just play with
maven so here i have a swamp profile
that says i'm using the wildfly swan
plugging the one flies one plug-in waits
for maven to create your war file and
then it's going to package it into a jar
file with all the boot system of wild
fly Plus what we call a fraction
fraction is what do you need this
servlet only needs undertow which is the
servlet container so here I'm saying if
I package my code with the swamp profile
take my code package it in a while take
the wall put it in a jar with all the
needed bits and pieces so here if I do
Maden Kling package and profile swamp
it's going to trigger compile a war so
the wall has been created and the swamp
plug-in creates a jar file here I went
from a 5k Wow to a 32 mex java java dash
charm if you work with chivas
this is just the chaebols logs okay so
wildfly swamp uses the day at the jboss
colonel and the modules and so on so
here I I told swamp to use the port 8081
because I'm going to trigger several
services so now I can go so that was top
books 8081 works the same will happen
will top books so if i show you just
just the structure yes there is an
entity so i'm using jpa there is a
jax-rs endpoint so i'm not using a
servlet and there's even bins xml so
there's a bit of CDI and if you look at
the xml I've done the same exercise I
have a swamp profile and here I'm saying
you need the undertow fraction because I
need a web container plus jax-rs in C
and C D I plus J PA okay so if i go to
top books i have a 10k war file and if i
do a clean package using the swamp
profile again wildfly swamp will put my
code plus all the fractions plus
everything into a bigger jar so we went
from 10 KS to 100 megabytes Java does
char here i am with top books port 8080
too and yes believe it or not i'm gonna
do the same thing with top the CD
bookstore which is slightly bigger
because i'm using a jsf components and
jquery and so on and i'm going to do the
same thing between install swamp and yes
this time I'm packaging EJ
SF and so on into a fat executable jar
so if i look at the target i went from a
five megs war to a 114 and let's do the
same so here I'm starting this 3 micro
service well one is a big big but what
is a micro service anyway so here it
works you know it's going to contact the
other services so it works with wildfly
suam and in the other frameworks that
I've mentioned we we can do now that
with Java EE and what about multiple
apps you know we have these micro
services that are so tiny tiny tiny tiny
that instead of having one we can have
dozens that's the entire idea of micro
services while fly swamp pushed the
packaging further and I wanted to show
you what we can do here you see a lot of
blue it's servlets let's take it out
let's leave it where it is in the maven
repository and point to it that's
another packaging you know I never
thought about that you know but we can
do that I don't know if I will do that
in real life but just to show you the
packaging is moving so i'm going to
switch off everything and just play with
top CD because it's the smallest so top
CD I've created a second profile that
looks exactly the same it's called swamp
em to repo I say exactly the same thing
the top CD needs undertow fraction he
chooses the swamp plugging the only
difference comes from here bundle
dependencies false I do not want you to
put all the fractions inside the fat cha
they are here in the in the Maven ripple
so I'm going to build top CD using this
mavin profile so again top cd32 Meg's
jar and if i go mavin clean package swab
and to repo swamis going to do a bit of
magic and it's not a 5k war file like we
used to be it's slightly bigger because
there's the bootstrapping of a wild fly
swamp plus all the Maven tricks but if i
do java jar here when it start up there
was this log dependency not bundle will
resolve from local em to repo and it
works I go back to top books and refresh
it works if I look so let's unzip into
target structure if I unzip that it's
quite interesting because let's do a
tree target structure what's inside its
oh I go up up up there's only first of
all there's some unfortunate acts
because of XML XML being on the JDK look
at that there's the war file inside the
jar file and then you just the jboss
module system pointing at em to repo and
you know the module system of jboss and
blah blah blah so if you look inside it
the difference is on one side it bundles
the jars in
side the fat jar and on the other it
just pointers to em to repo so i thought
i don't know if i'll be using that in
production one day but I i found
interesting to push the packaging a bit
further of what we what we used to some
metrics about what I've just done so in
green okay the green bar is you go to
internet and you download wild fly
zipped so while fly is 140 max before
the full monty and if you go to the far
right top CD and only uses the undertow
fraction and when we package that into
our fat jar the fudge is 30 30 max so in
in this aspect we gain a lot of disk
space and as you can see that because
the CD bookstore uses most of Java EE
when you zip it it's more or less the
same size of wild fly because it uses
ejb fraction and so on startup time so
that's interesting in green it's while
wildfly starting up empty so you you
know start stop start stop wildfly boots
in two seconds top CD at the very top
package in a jar file starts in one
second makes sense you notice we just
have the undertow fraction so while fly
doesn't need to start up all the other
bits and pieces so the top jar when we
go java job being it puts in one second
the undertow fraction plus our code the
top boob job boots in 3.5 seconds and as
you can guess the CD bookstore jar so
I'm talking about the yellow bars here
boots in nearly six seconds because
it puts most of java ee + our big
application what's interesting it's the
blue bars look at the blue bars okay so
wildfly empty starts up in two seconds
so of course if we put a war file it's
going to always take longer while fly NT
two seconds put the top CD war file and
it takes 2.5 seconds logic the Baker the
longest so the CD bookstore takes eight
seconds but to look at the blue bar
called while flight n three apps that's
what I've done deploying the three wire
files into one wild fly and this is
funny here I'm saying that I've deployed
the three wars and wildfly jboss boots
faster than just with the city bookstore
so I did that a few times and I wasn't
sure about this matrix so I contacted my
friends at reddit and I say how come
starting up a wild fly with free Reb web
apps is faster than only one and jboss
is more than 15 years old he did you
know it's a funny machine very robust
and it comes with a lot of tricks so the
way that is when you deploy top CD he
goes oh I need the I need undertow so
I'm gonna put strap it and then you
arrive with top books you need jpa so it
bootstraps it and when CD bookstore
arrives at the end everything is
bootstrapped me leave everything so it
takes less time funny so what you can
see application servers are funny beasts
and you know Here I just talked about
wildfly and jboss but others do other
tricks
ok cool so I've put everything into a
jar file the good thing is i take this
jar file I give it to Peru production
and go java-jar you know and the the guy
in production will say yes and I how do
i configure my datasource how do i
configure my JJ ms factory how do i put
my database you a user and password it's
inside the jar so there's different ways
of doing it you can put code so if you
want to configure your your fat jar you
put a main class so here I'm talking
about well fly but the others do more or
less the same thing and you say a
container when you start please put J a
JDBC driver and a data source with user
and password that's one way of doing
using Java code of course it can read
property files and so on so you can put
a bit of Java code inside the jar and
the go and checks properties in your
file system so we can either do it by by
code oh and while while flies worms
comes with a management fraction jboss
as a console but it also has a clear
command this click amount is actually a
fraction so we just bundle it inside our
jar file and you will here we go so I'm
going to give you a demo now um I'll you
know else i'll stick to the top cities
because it's small so now i'm going to
build it with another maven pro profile
calls from management and i have two
fractions undertow and management
let's do that maven and now management
same thing it's going to package all the
needed fractions plus my code into a fat
jar I put strap it here it goes I can
show you that it's still up and running
but now the good thing is uh because
I've added the management fraction I can
go jboss clean so you know the operation
guys they don't use the console they
have all these scripts to configure the
application server i connect to it and
voila I know I can go a deployment info
and that's quite funny inside my jar
there's a wall so the war is deployed
and there I have the cliq console so i
can go subsystems and ruto read resource
so for people who are used to add mr.
jboss like that it's the same it's
exactly the same management fraction
that's why I like one fly swamp because
it's it's really close to what my
customers do with jboss okay and what
about docker well easy peasy you take a
docker file you just use openjdk so here
I'm using the JDK but I think in my
image it's the chart je r e which is
better I expose a port and then I just
add my fat jar and I just go java-jar no
simple as that so here I'm going to show
you a demo because i want to show you
something so let's stop that
docker image let's make sure I don't
have all the images no okay now the top
CD the fat jar approach I as i said i'm
using a just java plain java and adding
my fat jar and executing it i'm i'm
using maven I love maven so I do please
use the swamp profile to create this fat
job and I've created another profile
that's going to create a doc image and
that will package the wall put the war
into the jar and ask docker to build
this image docker image here it is and
just to show you that I'm not cheating I
can run this image and it will run what
I want to show you is again between this
war of fat jar and thin war and skinny
war and skinny this and for that if I
build the docker image again it's going
to take time to build my fat jar and
this fat jar is only 39 mix and you
imagine the 140 and then it's gonna
docker will spend a lot of time Adi my
jar into the right layer doctor goes ma
this I have it so it takes peanuts that
costs a lot so to build my dog image it
takes me eight seconds so each time i
boot I'm if I change some code if I
build it it takes eight seconds in the
meantime that meanwhile sorry
if I go the other way so here I have
another image and this one doesn't inner
it from Java image but from wildfly so
here I'm using wildfly plus a JVM plus
an operating system I'm copying my
skinny wall so if I do that for a second
you know if I'll do it again it will be
even slightly less if I do that on CD
bookstore it's much much much longer
because maven uses a lot of time you
know a lot of cpu to package this 150
Meg's jar + docker spends a lot of CPU
adding this layer on on its right layer
so you know fatwa skin you are fat these
etc etc there's now we've been for for
the last cup you know a couple of years
we've been following this trend of fatwa
you know I love Josh long when he says
make ja not war I love that but you can
see that on your build system it's going
to take a lot of time you know if you
have all these micro services and your
build chain will will suffer if you have
a hundreds of micro services to build at
the end of the day if you do docker
images of course my top CD war is 500
megabytes because it has an operating
system jvm wildfly and my war on the
other hand the jar is only 140 megs so
yes my docker image is bigger but we
know with docker we don't care because
my wildfly image is already
my hard drive once and only once so it
doesn't take you know the wildfly layer
and the Java layer and the operating
system layer only costs once so you know
fat jaw skinny wah still still not
settled and now um you need a you always
need a bit of fun demo you know I've
seen people running oh I've seen the
people doing funny demos with them with
drones and everything so I thought what
can I do funny with Java EE you know
Java EE and fun it's really not easy so
I thought because everybody looks like
they use Raspberry Pi in production I
thought let's do the same let's use a
raspberry pi so that's why I took a bit
of time but if i unplug this and plug
that ladies and gentlemen this is a
Raspberry Pi here I have my three
microservices and they surely are micro
because they run on a raspberry pi what
else I mean here I have top CD a servlet
here I have CD bookstore ejb is running
on a Raspberry Pi and ear i have jsf
with no images because i don't have
internet but that's the exact same
responsive application and so it's at
this moment of the talk everybody claps
because you've all seen an ejb running
on a raspberry pi
and we all do that in the production
anyway so just finish nearly good on
time just to finish what i like about
wildfly swarm have been talking a lot of
wild flights one but i've used koo
Muluzi the little bit i played with the
pariah pyara micro but what I like about
wildlife swamp is is based on the good
old jboss so for your operation guys
it's easy the logs are the same and
everything so that's quite I like about
it worth like suam comes with a lot of
fractions here I've just used java ee
fractions but oh sorry i haven't
switched back to them oh sorry what last
one comes with java ee fractions i was
just so the management fraction that i
showed you which is a bit special but it
comes with many many many other
fractions there's even spring logstash
etc so you know again you just add the
fractions you need into your palm job
done so what I wanted to say with this
talk is there's a lot of I about plenty
of things actually and when you work on
a day-to-day basis on the Java EE space
you feel that the hype is not you is not
with you anymore the hype is with
angular and react and all these things
and spring boot her staying in in the
Java world but you know I've been saying
that for a few time but yes I want to
show you the application service I've
changed I know plenty of you use
websphere 56 websphere 60
that hurts but one day it will get
better when you move to no actually I
last week I was at a customer working
they do like most of us have been doing
websphere in production and in
development mode they use tomcat so
because of that day you spring well you
know the entire thing and now they are
starting to move to websphere liberty in
development and websphere in production
to stay closer Ne in Liberty as I showed
you bootstraps like that so no
application servers are not monolithic
there were never you know as I said the
Genesis is packaging several
specification so I don't know how come
we ended up with you know websphere 6 in
weblogic 10 with all these fat things
because the specifications Eve over
their own pace package the way you want
you know I I can't tell you what to do
anymore because we went from skinny waar
to fatwa now there's this new fad jar
trend but as I showed you with this
docker example with we also lose a lot
of time in our build chain the bigger
the bill chain is the more time you will
lose here i just lost a few seconds on
city bookstore I lose about 15 seconds
on big applications you use a lot of you
know a lot of time and you know let's
reuse what we know you know I'm um I
like to go out outside my comfort zone
and do other things I'm a new angular 2
developer so I can call myself full
stack developer so happy about that but
I'm but I'm also happy to be able to
reuse my java ee you know expertise that
I've had throughout the years and do
other things like wildfly swamp for
example
so yes you know I wanted to show you
that yeah there's microservices inside
this raspberry pi because everybody
talks about microservices so I had to
but you know if you do a monolith
something centralized you know it's fine
fine sometimes I think we're a bit
fashionably teams and there's something
happening in this space I don't know if
you're followed or not but Java EE 34
specifications a web profile 20 we want
to shrink that so there's red at IBM
pyara other people you know me you while
working in this idea of micro profile
let's take jax-rs CD iso jax-rs for the
rest stuff CDI for the extension so
because it's so small that we could
extend it and G's in P because you know
you can do Jeezy if you want to know
more about micro profile there's above
this evening at eight come it's really
the idea of G you know everybody is
doing micro profile and nobody's doing
it with Java EE yes a lot of people are
doing that with job e but we can go
further and do better things you know
because jax-rs and CDI and GMP are not
enough in the micro service world we
want to add other things and not just
specifications but maybe new ones you
know patents circuit breakers and so on
maybe that could go into the micro
profile so the microprobe profile 1.0
was released in September we are working
on the 1.1 it goes very very quickly so
please if you want to know more about
that come tonight at the buff at eight
and if you want to know more by my book
please buy my book if there's 100 people
buying my book I get 200 bucks I'm paid
in dollars so with what happened this
morning is going to be of
few euros in my pocket so please buy a
book for you your mom kids and also I've
been doing a lot of Pluralsight courses
on Java EE and guess what you have here
stickers grab one please and you can
have a free unlimited month of courses
and you can watch plenty of very good IT
courses on this platform ladies and
gentlemen thank you I'll be around ask
me question if you want let's meet at
the buff and I can hear the beer flowing
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
