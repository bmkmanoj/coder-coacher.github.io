I'm here with Heather downing who gave a
talk a workshop sorry earlier about the
Alexus skills kits yes so I haven't done
any kind of development before the
Alexus skills kit or Alexis all I've
done is watch my mum get really
irritated when Alexa picks the wrong
option so could you tell me some
something about it
absolutely so part of the reason your
mother probably feels irritated is that
perhaps the developer that created the
skill she was using was a little bit
lazy about handling just the happy path
and not the rest of it and so a good
amount of the time that I spent today
was educating in voice design because
that impacts our code it impacts the way
that we structure all of our functions
and the entire infrastructure so I got
to spend a few hours talking about why
we do this how it's best to design a
conversation and then we actually built
a few different skills with a basic one
one that also is allows us to kind of
play with her voice itself slow her down
speed her up make her go louder softer
and then we did a more practical skill
as well so that's what we got to do this
morning nice and then we talked a little
bit earlier about visual learning and
about how you got into programming and I
wondered if you could talk a little bit
about that because I personally find it
very interesting about people who maybe
wouldn't go down the path most traveled
so for a long time I had waited to get
into computer science because I honestly
thought that I wasn't intelligent enough
to do it but it turns out that the way I
was learning was just not the fastest
way to set my synapses go
so I have I actually discovered that I
really liked doing science because I
watched Mythbusters are you familiar
with the time I had up so I was watching
these two hosts explain how they put
together a rocket and they did it with
the drawings and the my animations and
I'm like oh I understand that and then I
kind of went off on my own and I decided
that I wanted to try to make it and it
worked and then I kind of got excited
because I don't know it didn't spark all
of my problem-solving the same way and
so I because I had watched that show I
decided to try my hand at programming
and I love it now and but I find that
there isn't a whole lot of visual cues
we like to talk a lot about theories and
I'm not very good at lectures I'm much
better at hands-on or if you show me
what you've done and once you show me
then a pattern starts getting set in
place and then I can start seeing
patterns almost before they happen and
visual learning is a very powerful way
for someone to learn who maybe is
culturally challenged so I have a lot of
people in the Midwest where I'm from
that are also from other countries that
come and we have a really big language
barrier but if I can show them what I'm
doing they almost always pick it up just
as fast as a native speaker so that's
when I started really spending a lot
more time with trying to bring a more
visual tool to people in
the tech community and now I do a
YouTube channel as well to try to
interview amazing masters of their craft
where they have to teach us something
like on a whiteboard or in an IDE or
maybe a slide deck but something that
has to be visual so that it can really
help additional people like me and do
you think that and with technology like
Alexa and more tools we're getting a
better a better suite of Technology
that's accessible for everyone so with
the lexer for example its voice command
so you don't have to type anything in
you can start opening things up to more
people yes absolutely accessibility is
one of the first things you think of but
it's also I like to call it the shortcut
technology for two reasons it's a
shortcut for us as developers because
it's an ecosystem that has already built
so we don't have to mess around deeply
in the natural language processing we
can get right to all of the business
logic and serve that up faster so it
really goes hand in hand with agile
development but also you don't have to
train your users we already know how to
talk we already know what a conversation
is supposed to be like even if it is
culturally based and it is faster for me
to say answer this question than it is
for me to pull out my phone and look at
an app and get to it I save tons of time
just asking a question and having her
answer it for me especially if my hands
are full or I can't devote my eyes on
something it's a powerful tool and isn't
just Alexis any of the voice AI
platforms are really amazing I think and
I predict it's in the next three years
that's just going to be part of an
expected toolset that almost all
developers have because it's service
driven so it's just like adding an
endpoint to your API but for voice
face actually it is exciting I think
everybody should be able to do it you
can build an Alexa scale in about an
hour or less that's actually pretty
decent
and you can use it right away so you
don't have to wait to deploy it because
it's available to you right away with
whatever account you logged in with as
developer so if you want to you could
never publish the skill and just use it
in some fun thing just for your house
thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
