no-brainer
actually that's false doing open source
well and growing a successful ecosystem
around it
it requires trust me it requires a lot
of brainpower it's hard and it does not
come for free responding the questions
reviewing issues and code changes
organizing events motivating people it's
it's a daily Duty and it does it takes
investment time money you name it
but with all things that produce value
especially in this case tremendous value
it's totally worth doing so open source
we know it's the best model that we've
come up with for producing software do
it poorly though and what you unleash
under the world amounts to little more
than a code dump do it well and your
project it develops a life and a culture
of its own so how do you do it how do
you grow you know how do you give the
project spark how do you grow it 2,000
10,000 users many many contributors so
I've cultivated very successful open
source communities on sparse budgets in
some case no budgets each experience has
taught me lessons and I'm here today to
share them with you and I'm really
excited because I've waited a long time
to tell this story so I hope you'll be
able to use this advice to make any type
of community building efforts you're
doing wildly successful and for you to
stand out from the crowd the crowd that
doesn't do this so well so perhaps it
kind of goes without saying but if you
want to grow you you got to have an
effort that is worth joining you know
how many projects have you come across
and you just make you think what in the
heck are they trying to accomplish here
what is this for I don't see the point
so don't be that project you need to
know your own purpose find your purpose
and why do you exist because you're not
going to build a community unless you
really have a reason to do it people
need to know where you're headed
they need to they need to have a vision
that they can believe in you know they
need to get a sense of purpose a rally
call we can say a reson Dutch d'etre
they want to be able to achieve
something you know that's bigger than
themselves something they can they can't
achieve when themselves alone so they
join into a community so you have to
know what that is
the other thing you have to remember is
that open source is created by people
individuals so to grow open source you
have to understand what motivates people
you need to amp them up so to speak and
in his book Drive Dan pink identifies
three key factors that basically drive
people and those are autonomy mastery
and purpose
hence amp so participation an open
source relies on this because it's
voluntary so you always have to remember
and respect that aspect but don't think
that people working for free because
that would be naive they just aren't
working for direct financial gain in the
traditional model you Tet you gave them
money and you told them to go do
something is they're driven by something
else other purposes people participate
to do what they enjoy what they love far
away from the crap that they don't they
participate to learn from each other and
they value each other's knowledge and to
grow together so that sense of growing
up in in a group and they value the
exchange of the ideas themselves that
they're passing back and forth from each
other it's very important but ultimately
all this stuff comes down to is they
they work for personal fulfillment at
least your audience does in open source
so in order to kind of tap into that you
have to craft a call to adventure for
the community who becomes your hero you
want them to come and show up and he'll
go on an adventure and your mission then
becomes a story it becomes your story
your project story it shapes the culture
of your community it serves as a filter
to help you decide ok what are we gonna
do what's out of scope and who are these
people that are showing up you know what
what makes them get up in the morning so
dogfish Head the Brewing Company and one
of my favorites has this fantastic
tagline because it's so concise
off-centered ales for off-centered
people so that's something that people
can really rally around think about it
it has what they want to achieve they
don't want to create regular beers at
everyone else creates they want to
create unique beers they have a purpose
and it's an identity of the people that
show up
they're off-centered people what does
that say it sort of says hey listen we
get you we know that you're not like
everyone else we see you as an
individual so that's the stuff that gets
people behind you
so don't let people pass you by because
you lack a purpose you know get noticed
have a purpose have a reson d'etre and
then communicate it but the thing to
keep in mind about this is that
brilliant software alone is not enough
to get people to act you know often
times this you know engineers kind of
get stuck in this thinking and say
myself are so brilliant that people are
going to show up and they're gonna love
it no they're not they don't care
because they don't know so to build a
great community you need to communicate
so community notice communicate your
idea is gonna be judged initially based
on how well you said what it is that
your idea was there's this great quote
that I came across by Carmen gallo it
says in a society that values speech
free from income esoteric
incomprehensible okay they are
going to hear the jargon coming out of
your mouth so when you say when I say
communicate what I'm really saying is
your message needs to be organized
authentic and empathetic so as you when
you create a new project on github
you're you get this pop-up of this
dialog box and it says help people
interested in this repository so
interested in your project understand
why should they be there why do they
need to know what do they need to know
about the readme isn't necessarily about
all the technical things that does it's
supposed to be your chance to motivate
them and then the user manual or
whatever else can give them those
details beyond that but the readme is
about planning an idea an idea in their
hearts of something that doesn't exist
and now they want to be a part of it so
help them understand because only ideas
that spread only idea is to get
understood or ideas that really have any
legs so to bring them on in you need to
show up so you need to communicate but
you have to be a person behind that
those words so every project starts out
as a ghost town and you're you have to
ask yourself you know are you going to
be a project that never picks up any
activity and gets people behind it or
are you going to kind of flatline so no
activity to people that signals a dead
project I mean almost nowadays it's kind
of a stigma that if you go to github and
you see last activity and okay this
projects probably dead one year ago
that's probably dead
so activities in a very very very
important part of communicating that
you're alive and you're doing something
because people tend to get kind of
aggressive when they notice that
something is dead it's sort of a natural
human reaction sort of kicked something
that isn't alive because humans only
know to respond to things that are alive
and they want to see that something you
know it responds to external forces so
that can often be a problem for for
growing a new community if you don't
have activity people get aggressive
right away so what you want is instead
of flatlining we want to have regular
steady intervals of activity whatever it
is we'll talk about a little bit later
but you want to communicate with the
community through this activity beyond
be everywhere you know communicate
openly to a fault so a great way to get
information out there is to say hey I
need to make a decision so just start
talking about it online you know use
everything open because if you're open
it generates activity so that's a very
important thing but also take the time
to meet with the community get to know
the individuals you know make them feel
like you have all the time in the world
for every single one of them the best
manager I ever had did this exactly for
me it didn't matter if we were in the
middle of a production fire if I said oh
hey I needed to talk to you he would say
production fire can be dealt with later
what do you need to talk about that's
very very important message and I
respected that too and that I didn't
spend too much time with him because I
knew there were other things too to do
so you want to make each person the
center of attention because in the end
communication is the water the synopsis
that make up the the life the the
activity in your project and they make
that communication flowing readily
through your project is healthy for your
project but also remember the
communication is too wet so it's not
always you talking I mean okay
so today it's just I'm talking to you
but I'm going to go home and listen
because really in an open source we're
taking advantage of this idea that hey
there are a lot of people here
collective thinking power and numbers
you can't
Everage power numbers if you aren't
listening they have the secret to what
can make you great so to realize that
power make communication extremely easy
one of the main reasons I really love
github issues is because it's so easy to
just get my thoughts out there in a very
contextual way without blasting out an
entire mailing list and so each of the
issues have their own channel so to
speak and I can work on that one channel
and we can be in close contact so Matt
Ridley actually has this very great
quote in this TED talk he gave was
what's relevant to a community and think
about this for a second is how well
people are communicating their ideas not
how clever any individual is okay the
the clever individual thing that's
proprietary software we're not
interested in that what we're interested
in is the collective of all the great
ideas that are out there and but we're
not going to get any of those ideas if
we're not communicating so I think that
part of getting them to speak you know
sorry getting them to come forward with
these ideas because if we're gonna build
on ideas we need to hear them is that
you want to show them that you want them
there show them that you actually want
to grow that it's not just you and
you're kind of annoyed when people come
by like oh don't bother me you know
because I've had that experience in open
source projects you want to make the
communication personal and respect this
is a very important thing think about
this respect that they came and they
shared what is now an irretrievable
slice of their life with your project
they can never have that part of their
life back so when you when that's met
with hostility that can be a very very
damaging thing so we'll get into more of
that imbed now communication doesn't
necessarily have to mean a lot of words
okay so I've talked about being
listening but when you're talking back
hey listen there's only so much energy
all of us have during a day so plus one
says hey I'm present and support this
and it also provides encouragement which
we'll talk about a bit later you can
also communicate simply through like
commits of daxing code I've talked about
this before like you committing is
actually you talking I mean you don't
think of it that way but it really is
because they come from the other side
and they see that activity behind the
the project and they know this project
is being maintained
so be transparent that's the other thing
trance this is probably the most
important in my mind is the most
important thing an open source
especially if your company or your large
organization running a project be honest
transparent and frank share everything
communicate transparently just be real
and human okay because because humans
have an unbelievable ability to
recognize
fake behavior words non authentic things
and frankly if you're that you're dead
to them they don't care they want to
connect to a human even if you're a
large company they want to find a human
within the company to connect to so
leave discussions about your product out
of the community if it's not related to
the community leave it out of the
community contribution should be good
for the good of the project and you
should be focused on the project not
self-centered on your needs when you're
doing community do what community 100%
don't don't do this halfway crap okay
because the thing is then don't do it
because you're not going to get any
success so you're working for a company
that that sponsors an open-source
project for instance be very aware that
when you get caught on the inside so you
they don't hear from you for a while
like they hear from you to hear from you
they love your project then all of a
sudden nothing for a while like that
that speaks volumes even though you're
saying nothing it's the quickest way for
people to disassociate so in the end for
this section show up and communicate
because when you show up you're there
and they're there and you get to know
them and they cease to be outsiders and
instead you're drawing them in now
speaking of drawing the men you always
want to make sure that you're making
people feel welcome be all inclusive all
inclusive to anyone that really wants to
come and join your project you want to
create what you want to create is a safe
space for people with ideas and there's
these budding ideas that are very
delicate like little flames you know in
the beginning that you're trying to make
a flame with sticks you know it's very
delicate in beginning kind of have to
give it encouragement so you you want to
make sure that in the beginning that's
easy to get into now on the other side
of things remember this the very first
touch that a person has in a project
that's them testing you okay you have to
realize that you're being tested as soon
as you see something for the very first
time they have a question whatever it is
they want to see how you respond
they're testing they're going to
if this response is good I'll consider
this community if it's bad I'm out I
have I can go anywhere else okay they
don't have to be in your community so
and people are gonna have tons and tons
of questions lots of them questions are
interest this is great okay think about
this
even the questions that seem like the
dumbest questions mean hey I'm kind of
interested in your project I didn't know
exactly how to ask a good question but
I'm answering I'm here right
that irretrievable slice of their life
again no matter how silly that first
question is or how trivial to come the
contribution just remember something the
leader the next leader of the project
will be one of those people because
every single leader of the project that
came to replace a previous leader
started right there was a day that they
did their first thing my contribution
should they ask a doctor project was
that I fixed the typo but I'm now been
leading it for three years so I started
out that way too in the projects now how
many times you can come into a project
and you've been told yeah can you use
the other front door please this is the
wrong place to start never do that to
your community okay be very careful
about telling them they did something
wrong from the very beginning the issue
tracker this is the home page for most
people for your project okay they don't
even see your your your glorious
designed home pray page which you had a
designer do or WordPress or whatever it
is they don't even see it they don't
care because they have they have a need
and they say hey look I tried to use
your project I have something I'm
getting right into it so what you do is
they file an issue and they're the very
first time and you recognize hey I've
never seen that user name before hey
welcome thanks for coming yeah we'll get
to the issue in a second but thank you
for being here so what you want to do is
is you want to optimize for that first
touch because you never get a chance to
make a set second approach you know the
first impression as they always say so
you want optimized for that you want to
always be welcoming newcomers I mean
growth if we're really what are we
talking about today we're talking about
growth growth is more people coming in
then leaving well you can't have growth
if you're not always trying to grow so
that first touch that's why it's so
critical because it is in essence it is
the lifeblood of growth
you have to keep having that happen now
those are all the kind of positive well
sort of I've talked about the normal way
that people come into projects there's
another way that they come into projects
too and they come in very passionate you
have to understand that formation and
growth is a violent thing okay we are
we're in the business of passion and
passion means that people come in hot
okay the earth as this depicts was once
created by a tremendous collision in
space and our Moon sort of came from it
but but the idea was that we wouldn't be
what we are today if the earth wasn't
bombarded with all kinds of comets and
other you know celestial bodies that's
what brought life to earth well these
people that come in hot or bringing life
into your project
okay so yes it's dirty in the beginning
but creativity is that way they're
probably though more frustrated than
they are mad keep that in mind and what
you want to do as a project leader so
you say okay I'm seeing the situation
what do I do you need to give them
outlets right you need to give them you
don't know what channel that passion
turn it into productivity challenge them
to do something because your
responsibility is to make them
productive if you want to grow you need
to make them productive you don't you
failed them okay this this is absolutely
the truth you failed them if they if
they didn't become productive now the
other thing is you'll have dissenters
now dissenters don't alienate in chess
them chastise them okay don't don't
don't be a jerk to them be smart
assimilate them assimilate their ideas
because if they're saying hey that what
you do sucks I have a much better way of
doing it you go oh that's cool that's an
idea can I take that idea we can make
our project better okay be smart about
it because it's just a waste of breath
to you know try to fight with them when
you're interacting with people whether
they're dissenters passionate people or
kind of you know more shy newcomers you
never lose points for professionalism
here not sure what to do just don't be
an ass okay because the this is the
quickest way to build a toxic community
and a build is sort of an oxymoron there
because he you don't build if you're
talking
okay so just always be professional be
professional to a fault treat everyone
with respect employees especially if you
have open source company I don't
I absolutely think that there's
absolutely no excuse that an employee
that's working on an open source project
treats anybody poorly III if I were was
running that company they'd be gone that
next day I don't care that that's a
zero-tolerance policy for me there's no
reason not to be awesome to your
community members so communication like
at the at the worst like if you have a
person who's like very very technically
brutal that's okay as long as they're
personally respectful so criticize the
ideas not the person and I'm talking
about the when you criticize the person
that's zero tolerance for me because if
the environment is closed or hostile
they're out and if they're out your
community's gonna die
so promote diversity in all all always
so when I was living in Maryland there
was this bumper sticker now I've
modified here but it says chew civility
in Howard County that was what it
originally said and I and I used to
think to myself like but that that seems
like a pretty low expectation that you
can just be civil like couldn't you be
like nice like couldn't you be you know
what does that mean so actually as it
turns out being civil is actually a
little bit more than just not being an
ass it's actually a little bit more than
that and it sort of comes down to being
inclusive acknowledging people and you
know assuming the best in people being
constructive okay they're these things
that make up civility if you go to the
website choose civility you can read all
about it but what's interesting is that
that is exactly what we need to do to
grow open source is that we need to be
civil we need to do all the things that
are in their in their principles because
that's they're building a community
we're building a community too so the
tone you set for your community it's
going to determine its fate that let's
be honest I mean they always say well
that project leads set a nice tone and
if he didn't set a nice tone well he
might as well just quit because the
community's not going to grow so put
your piss attitude forward and when in
doubt choose civility now once you
receive a contribution acknowledge it
being thanked feels good every single
damn time
people do never
don't fill up on gratitude they don't go
I'm good actually I'm kind of full and
gratitude today like I'm good I don't
need to be thanks anymore
kind of Hawaii ate a little bit too much
thanks know people love it it feels
really good but you have to be you have
to do it generously and you have to do
it sincerely you should be doing it so
much that you might as well put a key on
your keyboard and if you you know you're
doing it right when you practically know
the usernames of all your community
members by heart you know you or
everyone collectively in your modules
and you you're mentioning them on
Twitter you're mentioning them on github
you're mentioning when the release notes
mentioned mention mention but what this
does is it says hey contributors I see
you I appreciate your work I value your
contribution and you have ownership
which we're gonna get to but what you
have ownership and what's funny is that
there's no secrets here like I could say
this I could say this to a group of
people and then I could do it and the
fact that I said it doesn't make it any
less in meaningful to them okay this is
because this is just how we work as
humans and it also keeps them motivated
right if you want to sort of motivate
someone to go to the next level you say
thank you and then they and they they
sort of have this reaction of okay cool
I was thank now I'll do the next step so
instead of saying please do this please
do that you say thank you and you don't
necessarily ask him what to do next
because they'll bring that going back to
the autonomy mastery purpose they'll
bring their own reason for keeping going
so now I want to tell you a little story
and and hopefully if you remember
nothing from this talk what I really
hope is this story sticks with you so
I've been working in open source
communities for a long time but I can
never quite put my finger on why why a
community worked you know why one worked
why one didn't what made it tick and
until right here in Antwerp in 2013 so
two years earlier ours like notes in the
the lead of their killing project to
myself we were walking with a newcomer
to the arquillian community were just
walking down the kaiser ley heading
towards a restaurant and we kind of got
to the restroom we said hey we're gonna
go eat dinner here would you like to
join us and he said no no I know I have
to go I'm not speaker like you guys and
I probably I probably shouldn't join you
I probably can't and then he kind of
walked off and I was like and I looked
at each other kind of bewildered for a
second what's going on
instinctually we agreed go get him go
get him like a nods like ran off and
pulled him back
Bart Oz was just as much a part of our
Killian is either one of us his interest
that day you know that month or whatever
to get involved in our Killian made him
just as much of this community as anyone
who'd been working on it for years so
you fast forward to two years later
bartosh had become a speaker dead box he
was a dev ox Ian he was speaking in fact
about getting involved in open source so
that year we were actually all rooming
together in an apartment and we left the
apartment four different times the
morning of his talk for reasons that I
can share with you that's a story for
beer central ok but we anyway we
attended is another talk I was over it
in one of the other rooms before bar
Taj's so I and I was chatting with
someone in the corridor afterwards I
gotta get held up and so I ended up
being a few minutes late getting to par
Tasha's talk as I entered into the room
the room under shaking her head at me
going uh mm-hmm and I'm practically I
mean stepping over people you know just
to kind of get you know these quarters
just to get up enough to see bartosh
standing down on the stage and the room
was completely packed to the backs of
the rooms and there were no seats at all
so two years earlier bar Taj viewed
himself as I'm just another person in
the crowd and I'm not worthy of note and
now as one of the leadership in the era
Killian project I can't even get into
the room to see my community member
speaking you know we we believed in him
before he was ready to believe in
himself I mean we never even questioned
it and now he's a celebrity I can't even
go go in to see him but that is not the
amazing part of this story that's just
the intro right because the focus of his
talk was to encourage other people to
get involved in open source because it
had changed his life so much in those
two years so about halfway through the
talk he puts up this slide and it's the
names and faces of other open source
contributors and he said these are the
people that inspire me but they weren't
the project leaders they were they were
other community members
they were other people like him that had
come in and joined the project and he
was talking about projects that they
worked on but then he went a step
further despite only having a quickie so
he's only got a 15 minute talk here okay
he he decides well I'm gonna give up
five minutes at the end of my talk so
leaving him only ten minutes because
there was this guy in the hacker garden
that he was that he was working with who
was working on this open source project
and the open source project really
inspired him so he gave him the stage
and allowed him to talk about what he
was doing his project and said this is
this is the type of thing that I think
that you know is really amazing about
open source is people that do work like
this guy so at this moment I realized
what it is that makes community work
this is what makes it grow you're
directing the limelight on other people
that should be recognized but aren't
being recognized yet you're making
opportunities for the other people in
the group and he and bartosh had
responded to the call the community to
kind of follow in the in the culture
that Isaac and I had sort of started of
passing on and helping these people
become successful then he was doing that
for others so in 2012 Bartos received a
JBoss Community Award for his work on
our Killian and now he's the community
manager for killing remember that first
touch thing you know so now today
Alec Soto who was one of the people on
the slide and you can now see in this
picture is the lead of their killing
cube project which is a very critical
sub-module to our Killian and he's also
the co-author of our Killian action and
he's a dev ox Ian and he spoke this year
more times than I've ever spoken at any
conference okay
so what's good for the community members
is amazing for the project what's
amazing for the project is amazing for
the community members by passing these
opportunities you you you're investing
in the project's future and what you
build is not just a community because
we're talking about growing no no okay
growing community that's uninteresting
we grow a devoted community we grow a
community that is bound basically for
life okay these people are not only
working together they're extremely close
friends and they help each other have
new ideas all the time like our Killian
cube so recognition is something to be
passed all
each leader has recognition to share
leaders are gonna get attention because
their names on the project Alex now gets
attention because he's working on her
Killian Cuban his name is on the the the
the module and now he's a mirror he
passes on that to other people who
deserve the light and you orchestrate
the growth of the community through this
but this is how the community scales you
see because I said before being personal
knowing every individual yes and you're
gonna say to me hey after a hundred
people how can you keep track of all
those people you don't you live on
through the other contributors and the
other contributors do it and they do it
to other contributors and that's how it
is is that you basically get to be
everywhere and the project through the
culture that you built and Thomas
Jefferson has this famous quote to say
you know though that person who receives
an idea for me that they receive that
idea and I don't lose anything it's sort
of like a person who lights someone
else's candle your candle doesn't become
more dim because their candles now lit
and that's exactly what we're talking
about you know once the community's
committed to grow this is the key so the
other thing that you have to think about
is that open source is about you not
doing it alone so you're never gonna get
to that if it at some point you you you
realize you're a Wallflower project
you're stuck to the wall you're always
confined to the edges of the pool so to
speak there are ways to make this less
scary you automate liberally but in the
end you want to empower people because
that's really what allows your community
to have this for that ownership to scale
out and you and you aren't limited by
your own time and abilities but you pass
it on but you can't pass it on if you
don't give them leadership so notice I
be saying that Alex Soto had become the
the lead of the of this module this is a
very important thing in our community
building is that we we pass on the
ownership of segments of the project to
newcomers that come in and show interest
and it's a great way to get lots of
leadership so it's not just one person
each person has their thing that they
maintain and then they have these many
communities within the community so what
we're doing here is we're promoting
contributors into leaders because Trust
creates leaders and leaders become the
heroes of your project
so it's about empowerment I mean if you
think about every athlete is old that
it's ever existed is it has had a coach
at some point and coaches helped us
believe in ourselves before we're ready
to believe in ourselves you know there
are mentor and so those are what the
community leaders are they're the
coaches they guide in nudge and they
help the people become productive
members of the community and then they
show them hey what you do matters and it
matters so much that I want you to be
the lead of that thing so no other ways
sustainable so growing a community isn't
something that you want to do it's
really something that you have to do or
else your project will never get off the
wall of the pole it'll always be
confined to that and success you know is
is something that that's the business
you're in right you're in the business
of success I say no you're in the
business of success for your community
because success is infectious when
people see their peers being celebrated
Hey and they achieve success for being
part of a project where do you think
they want to be in that project the
success of the community it translates
in this has got success of the project
and that translates into success of the
business but all that success that comes
to the business that's because you did
the main thing well so if you're not
focused on that you're not doing that
well you're not going to get all those
other benefits you know we recently
celebrated the the Back to the Future
day and one of the things I thought was
interesting about Back to the Future II
and we think of the car but the other
thing was this picture every time that
he that the the protagonist made
mistakes in going back in the past then
the future picture started to fade don't
let this happen to your community you
may start out with you know that energy
and then you sort of say well we've had
success so now I'm kind of I'm kind of
pulling back a little bit and as you
pull back what you're gonna notice is
your community members are gonna start
fading away okay they were devoted
before they were interested the activity
or project was good
you show less interest it fades away so
it's gonna be very easy to forget about
your community as you start having
success and that's the death now of your
project do not let that happen you
almost want to treat every every phase
of
project as the first phase you know in
terms of how much passion you put into
it one of the ways we do that is we put
up faces faces faces of all the
contributors that have been a part of
the project on on the project pages I
don't think there's a reason that
there's a project that exists an
open-source it shouldn't be doing this
every project should do this okay
there's no reason not to first of all
it's easy to do it but it's also very
important it's about sharing that
prosperity because sharing the
prosperity is what builds the ethos of
the project and it's what allows it to
be sustained long-term so look social
events like this one are you getting
together with just people in your
company and you sort of leave the the
community members out or are you saying
hey community members what are you doing
for dinner let's let's get together okay
so you you don't want to be above them
you're not above them just like we
weren't above bartosh even though he was
just starting out so he came up with
this this chart that I'll finish up with
this is basically what I think if we put
it to sort of a chart this is our secret
for growing communities is that first
you need to inspire them there's a
reason that they're there and then
immediately as soon as they show up
because you inspire them and there's
like cool this thing is awesome I want
to be part of it recognize them hello
welcome them recognize their
contribution but then that's not enough
you need to encourage them can you can
you do a little bit more in the project
you know I read I see you I want you to
be part of it do you want to do a talk
on it can I help you do your talk
etcetera there's things you can do and
then empower them they become eventually
leaders and then finally the most
important thing is that when once you
make them leaders and they do this for
the next generation then your project is
able to become sustainable you want
contributors to be successful because
they chose to join your community and
you want other peoples to see that right
because if you make them successful then
other people will want to be successful
and that's how you gain devotion that's
how you grow you care about the
individuals thank you and good luck
