name is the turn I'm going to talk to
you today about flame graphs and how we
can use them to gain a bit of a
different perspective on our code and on
the JVM there's two slides there's the
one with how great it's going to be
Morgan I love it and there's this one
where things work out differently for us
hopefully we choose the first right I'm
a programmer I work on performance I'm
currently working on on Aaron with
Martin Thompson used to work for us all
and I still love us all we broke up
Amica Blee and they make a very good JVM
you should all cry out thing has anybody
heard of zinc yeah awesome this is it
used to be like three people now it's
half the room great I have a blog I
don't know if anybody does anybody read
the blog a lot less people excellent the
rest of you should read my blog it's
excellent and I contribute to a bunch of
open source projects the only ones that
are sort of relevant to this talk it's
honest profiler and person app agent
so we'll mention them just now I'm also
a jug organizer so if any of you are
ever in Cape Town and you feel like
you've had enough of your holiday and
you drank enough mine and you want to
talk to the local community
give me a shout and we can sort
something out or you can come join us
and it's always nice right
what is the root of all evil I I feel as
an industry where we're fortunate that
we have an answer to this question I
think a lot of other people are very
confused they think it's Marxism they
think it's violence or capitalism
alternatively but we know that there's a
truth there's a real root to all evil
and this man has told us what the root
to all evil is and basically what he's
saying is that you know in the age of
writing assembly and even in this day
and age when we write the system we
write a lot of code and most of the time
when we rather write that code we should
forget about smaller
it doesn't matter if you can concatenate
in strings or you know allocating a lot
when you're dealing with the code that
might never run or Migron once and then
be forgotten about this important code
and there's less important curve and
prematurely choosing the wrong codes is
obviously the wrong thing because
premature as we all know is a bad thing
but where are the big efficiencies how
can we find the right time to optimize
how do we know what to optimize right
and this boils down to this lovely
confusing phrase in performance often
the problem is not the problem the
problem is phrased by your clients who
come back and say this page is terribly
slow this application sucks every time I
use your code I want to hang myself that
is you know obviously not helpful right
you want to know where the problem is
and then you have to use some tools and
they present a bunch of symptoms and
from those symptoms you need to find out
if it's a configuration problem or a
problem with your code or actually maybe
there's no problem it's all perception
and that your client is just having a
bad day all right so what do we do and
if anybody's have been to Martins code
he mentioned some of this so this is a
brief summary of my view on it first of
all you have to have requirements if
someone comes to you and say I want a
fast application that doesn't mean
anything more it means many things you
want to know what they mean when they
say fast they but what do they mean -
put low latency do they mean you know a
thousand requests and hundred
millisecond latencies do they mean a
million quotes per second and sub
microsecond the kind of latencies okay
so you get requirement and then you
measure at the level of those
requirements measuring as some people do
we won't point fingers measuring the
internal latency
a particular bit of code in your
application it's not that it's useless
so much as often does not reflect what
your client see so you need to measure
at a level that is meaningful to the
requirements that you've collected okay
and once we've done measurements once
we've established that the problem we
have is one that can be fixed by
improving the CPU utilization in
particular then we profile and we use a
profiler has anyone in this room never
used a profiler before don't be shy
everybody's use the profiler profilers
are not part of the syllabus at
university apparently and many people
haven't used the profile but all of you
have which is great or maybe you're just
lying that happens too right you've
profound you've improved the curl'd
you've done your bit now you measure
again the reason you measure is because
if you've improved the profile and it
didn't fix the problem then you're not
helping anyone so there's a cycle here
you've changed something you see the
effect you hopefully find the right spot
to improve you improve it then you
measure again if you don't measure it
again then you know you're just doing it
for your own enjoyment which is bad
obviously right everybody here knows
about Java right we're not going to have
to explain Java great anybody here used
flame graphs knows what flame graphs are
right everybody knows a little bit
anybody here used perfect before even
less people those of you who have good
on you right this story starts with
Brendan Greg Brendan is the performance
Superman for Netflix and he looks at
huge clusters of machines lots of
applications and when things go wrong
they go to two mr. Brendan and he
invented all developed flame graphs not
just as Netflix also elsewhere and this
is a tool he uses and I think it's
important to understand his motivation
here as the the man behind the tool and
this is what how he describes
he says flem grafts are a visualization
of profile software allowing the most
frequent code path to be identified
quickly and accurately this is a man who
looks at applications that he didn't
write he needs to make sense of complex
applications now you know a benchmark
where you have twenty lines of code you
know a genuine web app with different
kinds of requests different code paths
he doesn't know the application and he
wants to make decisions quickly and find
out what the hell is going on so this is
his focus when he looks at flame graphs
and and what flame graphs look like is
something like this if you've never seen
a flame graph you can admire the colors
and the fact that it does sort of kind
of look like a flame so we're going to
look at flame graphs and what they mean
how to interpret them and in particular
the context of Java how do we get flame
graphs there's different inputs you can
feed in the ones the one input we care
about is sampling profilers and sampling
profilers all work along these lines
roughly you collect stacks which means
that as if you were to put a thread pen
stack trace everywhere in your code and
then you know wherever you collect that
you throw it into a file and then later
on your processor and you'll collect the
stacks every once in a while maybe ten
times a second maybe a hundred times a
second maybe once a minute doesn't
really matter you'll collect lots and
lots and lots of snacks okay you have
all this data if you were to read
through it visually you will take a very
long time you want to present this in a
concise way by the way some people and
they have success with that they look at
an application say it's very busy I'm
going to call Jay stack which is a
command line tool to pump out all the
stacks for the application and they'll
do that two or three times I say half
this is where my application is spending
its time sometimes you're right and
sometimes three samples are really not
enough
so it's for sort of broad observations
it can work out I wouldn't recommend
that is common practice okay how do we
present the data the data is presented
in one of three ways that there's
probably other presentations but three
is a nice number for everybody to think
about there's a slice view which is
usually the list of hot methods in your
application so you see a list of methods
you don't bother drilling into where
they came from but maybe there's one
method that is the top of your you list
maybe you're spending all your time in
hashmap kit and then you know I need a
new hash map or you're spending all the
time you know method you know is
inefficient and then you go and optimize
death method often that list is lacking
in context because spending all your
time in hash map get doesn't mean
there's one call to hash map get that is
you know the problem your application is
probably calling hash map get from a
bazillion different places so where is
that that you care and where don't you
care you don't need to replace all the
hash maps in your application maybe
there's just one that you care about so
getting that context is important the
other traditional view is the tree view
and then the tree view those of you
who've used profilers know that clickety
click experience where you go down and
down and down the stack and you drill
through old photo Joe and it's all about
the context you start from the top and
you drill all the way in to find that
one hot method at the top and then we
have link graphs this is what the flat
view looks like so here we have some
default headers in it at the top this is
this is Java Mission Control and since
everybody said they use the profiler you
all know this view and this is a preview
and this is a demonstration of why it
sucks because I opened one sort of thing
here and the rest of my application
disappeared from my screen because I
click click click my screen is full also
method names and and class names fill up
the screen very very quickly so I have
to scroll sideways I have to scroll up
and down I have to
was different cloud and scroll up and
open different nodes and it becomes a
very frustrating experience if you've
ever done this then you know what I mean
especially again in real life
applications ok and then we have this
and you probably think how can I get one
how can I get one of those flamey things
you use a profiler you collect all the
snacks you can ok you can use a visual
VM you can use JFR you collect a file
full of stacks ok you take those tags
and you convert them to a unified format
which is the collapsed leg it's just a
text file we'll have a look at the
format just now you take that and you
can hack on it you can improve it you
can grep through it you can do whatever
you like at this point we're looking at
a text file that I think most of us
who's ever ever had to do scrape through
logs can do some nifty things with logs
think of it as a log we take the
collapse next we shove them through a
Perl script
anybody here knows Perl good on you I
have to spend an afternoon learning it
it's a scripting language it's not like
the end of the world it's a very short
script and that produces an SVG which is
an animated graphic which is the flame
graph again this is sort of a text
transformation from lots of frames to
lots of squares on the screen but you
can just jump in there because it's just
500 lines of code it's Perl it's not you
know the most accessible language in the
world but it's still we're not talking
about a massive dive into something like
J visual VM which is a complex project
with lots and lots of code that you
would need to set up your IDE and a
whole development process you're not
going to do it nobody's going to dive
into J visual VM and add a feature or
very few people whereas if you spend 30
minutes you can maybe add a feature you
are interested in to flying laughs ok so
this is a flame graph we've seen it
three times what does it mean ok and
this young fella here thinking the same
thing right
this is a dry explanation of what it
means the height the y-axis is the stack
that's and you have one method calling
into the other and the flames range
higher as you stack goes deeper or
longer
whichever way you want to look at a
stack really the x-axis is a
representation of the number of samples
it's not the representation of time so
when you're looking along the x-axis
it's not the progression of time the
wider the frame is the more samples fell
into that frame okay and the frames are
sorted alphabetically the one thing left
to explain is really the colors the
colors we've seen before are just
basically random colors from the pallet
red that's Brendan's
choice of user experience I'm not sure
it's everybody's idea of usable
interface but it helps distinguish the
frames which is what he was aiming for
when we're looking at the Java flame
graphs we'll see different colors and
frames and the different colors will
mean something but still within a shade
like all the green shades of green
frames will be the same meaning okay now
I'm going to switch to my browser
because none of the presentation tools
I've tried actually work for this VG's
so here we go right I mentioned the
collapsed Stax format this is what it
looks like it's very simple we have a
semicolon delimited string and each sub
you know part of that is method so we
have main calling in 2:01 blah blah blah
blah blah and at the end I have a space
and the number of samples in this
collapsed egg okay this is the simplest
view of this format and this is what the
flame graphs we produce from it would
look like there's only one sample so it
catches the whole width of the screen
100% is spent in that and we can see
that you know we could click through but
it wouldn't actually do anything because
that's just one sample there's one stack
okay one sample is not a very scientific
thing greater we want lots of samples
what would this look like with a million
samples okay
it would look exactly the same because
it's the same stack it's just a million
times the same thing it's the same data
it's a hundred percent of the time spent
at the same place okay there's nothing
to drill into it's not particularly
interesting but since it's a hundred
percent of the weight in that you know
those frames that's why we get the same
picture right this is a step forward we
have everything all the stacks here are
they start from the five method okay
everybody goes to five and then cause
something we have some sub methods that
have some time spent in them some
samples collected in them and this is
going to look slightly different this is
how it looks okay I've zoomed into five
unhelpful though it may seem this is the
full view and this is what zooming into
five looks like exactly the same I can
zoom in to seven and then seven will
expand to fill up my view and then I can
see that seven takes up eighty percent
of the sample one five appears in one
hundred percent of the samples this is a
good time to realize that the number of
samples in the collapse tax file is the
self time it's the self samples okay
whereas what we see here the number of
samples we report in this view is the
total time if you've used the profiler
before you know this distinction the
self time is the amount of time spent in
the method itself the total time is the
amount of time spent in the method
itself and all the methods it called
okay so here a frame went it's the is
affected by this total time okay and
then we'll go to one last example here
again the colors mean nothing here but
the important thing to see here is that
things are sorted alphabetically so a is
to the left and B is to the right we
have the method seven appearing in
different places and we may think this
is you know I want to know how much time
I'm spending in
than seven so I can search and I'll look
for seven and I'm spending 41% of my
time in seven which is kind of handy and
we'll see this in use just now and I can
drill into you you know six and see that
it's got three coolies and so on
okay that was a nice gentle introduction
to the topic I didn't put the delimiter
slide in this one we'll get to the limit
the limit of slides is now okay right so
we know all about line graphs what can
we feed this presentation method well
these are the tools we use for profiling
apparently this is a survey done by Jay
rebel a couple years ago they do a bunch
of what are they call surveys every once
in a while they publish a nice report
anybody here used JB's ovm okay anybody
here used any tool on this except for
Java Mission Control okay anybody use
Java Mission Control fewer people double
Mission Control has been with us for a
bit and it's worth trying out that's
been with us since Java 7 and a bit and
it's definitely a better class of
profiler than a visual VM it's
misleading here because all the
profilers I don't know about the custom
in-house tools but I'm guessing except
with Java Mission Control are using the
same API and all of them fall under this
category will rush through because I
can't spend the whole time talking about
safe points who here knows what a safe
point is right safe points are places
you know throwing around your code where
the JVM can stop and safely collect the
garbage safely inject new code safely do
all sorts of things the flate monitors
also all kinds of things happen in a
safe point and the JVM can't just stop
your code wherever it is and do its
thing it has to
ask your code to voluntarily stop so
your code has lots of little safe point
pawns and because we wouldn't want to
spend all our time during safe point
pawns there are few and far between so
if I'm only sampling at a safe point I
can only see you at a safe point in any
code that is between 2 save points
you're not going to be able to see in
this profile ok now this is pretty bad
often by itself it doesn't help that
every time I sample I have to have
effectively safe during the operation
which is a stop the world operation
which means I'm profiling applica your
application when it's not working I've
stopped it it's no longer working I'm
taking a picture it's as if I had to
take a picture of this room with
everybody not blinking and we'd have to
all sit around wait for everybody to not
blink I'll take the picture then you can
go about your lives ok and the last
thing is each sample collects from all
the threads this means this is a stop
the world unbounded operation and I say
unbounded because the more threads you
have the longer it's going to take to
deeper your stacks the longer it's going
to take multiple multiply those two
factors and it's all your threads the
threads you started and blocked your
thread pool with a hundred threads in it
you're going to go through those 100
threads every time and collect all of
these samples but hey it works on
everyday vm because it's part of the JVM
Ti it's part of your your guaranteed API
for every JVM and it's been there
forever so all the commercial tools use
this because it's the lowest common
denominator you can produce flame graphs
from this data I wouldn't necessarily
recommend it but sometimes that's what
you have and that's what you can use ok
next level up is honest profile and Java
Mission Control they both use a very
similar internal API that allows you to
sample the stack at an interrupt you
basically enter up the threads wherever
it is and you collect the stack this is
great because you don't have the safe
point by insertion
but there are certain places where your
collection would fail using this API and
this in particular a lot of run time
stubs that you can't see using this tool
and we'll see what what we're missing
out you know that but all of these are
also blind to GC threads because this we
were only caring about the Java profile
here or any compiler threads native
threads etc these work so you can have
honest profile of work from Java 6 you
can have Java mission control since Java
7 and you can generate flame graphs from
this data again if this is where you are
this is what you can do exactly a better
place to be than what just a visual VM
family ok so Java profilers work most of
the time when when I say they work most
of the time sounds pessimistic we've
used these tools for ages they do work
they do highlight some some hotspots and
they do help us find places in our code
that can be improved it's not that
they're completely useless but we can we
can do better and before we dive into
what it means to do better we need to
remember what the scope is of an
application doesn't do well there's the
OS that we're using maybe there's an OS
configuration issue maybe we are in OS
code somewhere in the kernel ok maybe
the JVM is eaten all of the CPU time
we're running back-to-back GCS we're
compiling maybe there's a compiler issue
then the compiler is spinning maybe
we've called in to some native library
where we're spending all our time and it
allocated some background thread that's
consuming a CPU this can happen with
messaging libraries for instance and
maybe it's in your code this does happen
the problem is the JVM doesn't run your
code the JVM doesn't run Java doesn't
run Scarlett runs bytecode
and that bytecode goes through the magic
that is the jvm machine to actually run
native instructions on your cpu so your
bytecode start in the interpreter and
that's where things are slow this is it
stepped through your your bytecode this
fancy state machine that's as fast as it
can be but it's still an interpreter and
being an interpreted language is not
that great for speed so once we've
determined that your code is really hot
really important you run it around we're
going to compile it the world is
slightly more complex these days than it
used to be it used to be that you just
have the client compiler and server
compiler now you have tiered compilation
so you have code going from different
levels of combination but once it's been
compiled its native code that's its
assembly and it is far more efficient
than it can be in the interpreter and
finally we have inline
compiled code once we hit in learning
things get a bit mushy and in in the
real world because if you have a method
that calls three other methods and now
I've compiled all of them into one
what's called a code block which is
animal Gatien of all this code and I've
reordered it to be efficient it's kind
of hard to say which method is which so
when when profiling inline code we can
have quite a lot of inaccuracy and
there's really no great way to fix that
but it's it's worthwhile being aware of
these limitations and failure to inline
code is also a big thing so it would be
good you know about inline and to see
which code is inline which isn't in to
surf the Linux profiler perfect a system
profiler it can see user code it can see
kernel code you can see everything and
it's truly a multi-tool of many many
many uses at the standard so it's not
it's not installed by default on every
machine you 11th
but it's a reasonable request to ask
your ops person to install it it's not
beyond the width of anyone and it's the
safe thoughts consider the reasonable
tool to have okay
and it now works with Java didn't use
the work with Java if you look up on
Stack Overflow say I want to make
perfect work with Java uh it's really
complicated it's not complicated anymore
okay do you make perf work with Java a
lot of people contributed I contributed
a tiny bit but the the big contribution
here was two main forces there's person
map agent which was developed by
johannes rudolph and brendan greg has
poked the open JDK people until they
decided to to allow us to walk the stack
in a native profiler that they've
implemented the feature that's been
around for C for many years which is
keeping the frame pointer around so you
can walk the stack so the open JDK took
his patch productize it and I've
contributed a tiny bit to person up
agent to make a deal with inlining and T
Jake made that visualization work in
flame graphs and now we can have Java
flame graphs with us do you make this
work there's a long list of requirements
but basically you need drilling you need
a recent JDK you need to enable some
options
only the possess frame pointer is really
required and you will need some
permissions to profile to use first
you'll need perf installed and so on
there's a blog post there to help you
make this work and there's a bunch of
them actually it's quite straightforward
okay what do we get for all of this
effort there we can see Java we can see
native we can see the kernel perf like I
said as a multi-tool we'll only be
looking at cycle kind of profiles but
you can use it to look at page faults at
cache misses at anything really you can
suck out of the counters available to
you it's low overhead doesn't have a
safe point bias what do we lose we lose
a register and we have increased
overhead so when we call methods we will
now have to have some prefix postfix to
manage that register shouldn't make a
difference if your methods are
reasonable but if you're you've got like
a thousand method stack deep of all tiny
tiny message that you climb up and down
manically you're going to see an issue
so it
normally we're talking about between
zero to three percent loss I've usually
seen it at close to zero but in in edge
cases it can be worse than that we can't
see interpreter frames anymore in Perth
because the interpreter all looks like
one big blob to Perth and we get broken
snacks and and they might be fine with
Java and they might not show up at all
in Java but it's it's a reality and as
the tool evolved it will probably
improve on that we have limited stack
that on all the First's on newer Linux
kernels which not everybody has you can
have a larger stack that's okay finally
we have a lot of intonation and we have
a lot of new information and in the 20
minutes remaining we will try and
understand what is that information
a-okay
now now the fun begins okay what is this
this is a lot of Java code and we see
the can people read this font or do I
need to zoom in further can people at
the back read this
yes now okay this better okay cool
lovely stop complaining right this is
what the profile would look like if we
were using a an async it call trace can
profile the main point here is that we
can now see in lining what do I mean we
can see in lining the so we need to
understand the caller color scheme here
these yellow we muster the kind of
things these are C++ calls the red ones
are native so the interpreter
a bunch of unknown frames here the green
ones are real frames their actual code
blobs their actual methods on the stack
the Theo bluish kind of frames are
completely a figment of our imagination
they are inline methods so this method
in this method have basically
disappeared so that we can call this
method okay and we can now see some
interesting things even without the
extra data that we will get to in a
minute we can see for instance that this
method looks like it's got a lot of self
time and we can see that it's in line
already quite a few methods so for
instance it's in line char apt if you
have a used Chara it's a good thing that
it gets aligned because if it didn't get
in line you would have to reload the
string or HRA every time you call it but
because it gets in line it means your
your char array can be hoisted out of
the presumed glute that it's in and so
on so this is great that we can see in
lining but how is that helpful right if
we look at this method so I'm going to
zoom out just for a second here right we
can see that this method got in lined
into this method okay but the coolies
didn't get in line now this is the hot
method obviously why didn't we align the
coolies and what we can see here is that
there's this right method and is this
right method which is another type
adapter and there's this right method so
we have three different types here all
implementing the same method right in
Java where you have a wherever you have
a method call it's a virtual method call
all the method calls in Java are virtual
and this used to be like a big hack link
point for C++ developers and C
developers
because virtual method calls are bad now
the JVM goes to great lengths to convert
all the virtual method calls into static
static call sites so we know who we're
calling once we know who we're calling
we can inline them we can do that
through interfaces and we can do that
through just no more class code cause
even if the class isn't final or the
method isn't final maybe the compiler
knows there's no other implementations
of that method and can then inline it
and inlining is really a great
improvement because once we've in line
we can you know mangle the code and
eliminate most of it maybe or just
optimize around it in ways that we can't
do if we have to actually call into that
code so it didn't happen here my guess
would be because we have three different
types implementing the same method
they're all getting called and that
means the call site is what we call mega
morphix mega as in slots if it was
monomorphic it would get in line if it
was biomorphic it would have a little F
and it would still get in line but in
the JVM case it's a case of one too many
lots so too will get in line three no
there's now an extension full thing
where it does in line two three case but
there's some arbitrary sort of point at
which inlining would stop now maybe
there's an optimization sort of
opportunity here maybe there isn't it's
kind of hard to say but hey at least we
have some new information and if we were
to look at this profile and this was all
we had we would probably think okay this
jason write a string method is going to
need some work I'm going to have a look
at that and see if I can improve my code
now that would be stupid okay let's not
do that okay let's look at what we're
missing when we using the async it call
trace profilers and this is the slightly
wider picture because now we can see run
time stubs
and runtime stubs are a funny thing
runtime stubs are generated code their
native code that we call into from Java
but we don't know that we're doing it
when you're calling system array copy
you'll end up in a runtime stub but also
when you're calling system index so
string index or a lot of the string
methods get aligned into some sort of
runtimes that some of the zip methods
get in line there's a lot of places in
the JDK where the team went to a lot of
effort to optimize obviously this is a
hotspot that used to be a problem
I run a claim once it has been improved
it also became invisible to anybody
profiling a job application so they can
no longer see it and one of the things
we can see and we should see is array
copies so if we look at this code that
is all about strings allocating strings
and concatenating them and forming
Jason's because Jason's are all the rage
right and we look for array copy now
that we can see it we'll see here at the
bottom that it's 17% of the profile that
we've been missing
but 17% that's been sweep under the rug
that you can see before and it is
phenomenal that you can see because very
copies are a huge thing if you look at
any optimization manual the Intel
optimization many more like there's a
short essay on the topic of array copies
and memset any compiler optimizes
heavily for mem copy and memset you
should see them otherwise they wouldn't
be important if the if your code never
did that why would people invest their
time in improving it your code is doing
it you just can't see it so try this new
tool you can see it now ok another thing
we couldn't see before is this little
friend here this is
this is the same bit of code we were
looking at before I've gone back to like
really really tiny font to you I'm
really sorry okay so this is the right
method calling into three
implementations of the right method and
I see some new friends here one is mr. I
table stump which is the interface table
stub it's going to look up the interface
which interfaces which implementer is
which and the other one is the V table
stub these put together are like five
percent this is five percent I'm paying
that I didn't know about before this is
five percent that I'm paying for not in
lining in this particular case even
before I got any benefit out of in
lining as an optimization this is just
the price I pay for a mega morph ecocide
so was there more of that now that we've
seen it let's go back to the full scrub
look for table and we'll see that
there's like seven percent here so put
together that's 25 percent of the
profile that was just invisible to us up
until the point where we rediscovered it
just bought a lot one other thing here
which is perhaps telling is that we can
see an allocation we can't see
allocations normally you can't see
allocations the profile of the reason
you can't see them without looking at
assembly code it's because there's no
debug information for them and they get
in line so once they've gone through
that amount of processing they're just
invisible they're part of a larger sort
of code blob with no metadata to tell
you that they're there this is where the
sort of idea that allocation is free
comes from again you can't see it so how
would you ever know how much it costs
it's actually very hard to put a finger
on how much allocation costs in in over
your application how much time you're
spending in allocating and zeroing
member
but here we can see this guy
n'yar a non-0 how come we can see it the
reason we can see it is that as we can
see it ended up in some GC code and the
reason it ended up in some GC code is
because allocations sometimes exhaust
the heap when we've exhausted the heap
we have to ask the GC to clean up our
 so that we can have some new heap
we can trash so that's what happened
here which sort of begs the question
where is all the GC CPU at and it is
elsewhere and we'll get to it in a tiny
bit before we move on to sort of larger
scope this is a very confusing picture
this is nettie code nettie in particular
this is the net event loop anybody here
uses netting you're using that even if
you don't know it everybody's using
netting because pretty much every
framework if you're using spring it's
using that if you're using Cassandra
using a neti pretty much it everywhere
and the neti code calls into native code
and this is where we can see here all
these orange frames of Colonel Club now
I think for most of us looking at
Colonel sort of stacked are not like
it's not hugely intuitive were
informative but for someone like Norman
Maura who's the lead developer or natty
looking at kernel code can lead him or
looking at profile data for Keanu code
can leave him - perhaps deciding to
re-implement a bit of niÃ±o so that he
can use different OS cost which he has
so if you're using nathie and you're on
Linux you can now use the native app or
implementation and you'll get better
performance for it and again this is a
tool that enables Norman to make those
sort of decisions and perhaps you
require that sort of insight as well
most people don't which is fine
another thing we see here is the
and stacks issue so we see all these
facts they don't really start the Java
they started some unknown frame and this
is part of the shortcomings of the tool
so this is something you'll have to
contend with if you're using this data
it's not impossible to live with but
it's there finally there's this bit of
code which oh right this is a Java
profile for Cassandra server and what I
wanted to show here is that with a bit
of search and replace
I took a flame graph that looked very
much like the Metis one with a lot of
confused stuff you go into the collapse
neckline you look for all the
interpretive frames and you collapse
them because you don't really care that
they'd spend time the interpreter you
bunch together all the broken stacks and
you put them in one place etc etc and
you end up with something that is a lot
more usable and in particular you can
see here a familiar friend to those of
us and use profiles which is unsafe Park
if you used a visual VM or J stack or
whatever Park threads are in the state
running which is very confusing because
they're parked so what are they
parking is rather than on parking is red
costs you something it cost you CPU
cycles to do that operation what you
think here is that cost expressed and
when we look at this profile one thing
that jumps out is that lalalala it's a
big profile it takes a while actually
cassandra is spending an awful lot of
time parking threads maybe there's too
many worker threads in the worker pool
maybe there's a bit of thrashing the
tasks are not getting distributed such
that you wouldn't have to put threads to
sleep and wake them up all the time if
you think that sort of thing
consider rebalancing your thread pause
or find
a more efficient implementation that's
it's I think that's it here right okay
so we looked at the Java portion of a
profile we looked at inlining this is
data that's not really available to you
unless you're looking at inlining lungs
from the JVM so most people don't look
at it it's valuable we look at runtime
stubs which amount I think in most
applications to quite a lot of code that
you can't see usually and is close to
native and as the park costs element and
I would really like to encourage people
to dive into the the collapse tax
processing opportunity and make up their
own tools and and we can really gain
something from this we can trim
coordinator to only get the bits we want
we can collect the broken frames
automatically and finally if anybody
wants to spend an afternoon on flame
graphs I'm pretty sure they can produce
a color mapping scheme that would color
the JDK classes differently and
different frameworks differently so when
we look at profiles these things can
jump out at us and we can identify more
opportunities this is not something that
is readily eating easy to do with other
tool chains shall we say and I really
think we can and should do something
towards this now last but not least so
we were looking at this benchmark just
shortly short time ago but we were only
looking at the Java cost and as you can
see the bottom here that's hidden by a
desk and it's really small it's 62
percent of everything here we're only
looking at 62% and if we wake up from
that dream that Java is everything that
happens we'll be able to see that in
this particular benchmark looking at the
java code is highly misleading because
40% of the time is actually spent in GC
i say 40% of the time perhaps I
exaggerate so I can look at
the GC task and see it's 26% there's
this other stuff happening looking at
the wider picture can now give you an
idea of the CPU utilization that goes to
the JVM in particular two GC a lot of
people when they talk about Java
performance they talk about the GC costs
but it's very hard to put a figure to it
and this gives you a profile that
enables that observation also enables
you to look into what is the GC doing
maybe you can learn from that maybe you
can look up particular bits of code that
looks suspicious to you and find out
exactly the activity you should be
tuning for finally looking at this one
thing that is confusing when you're
looking at GC is that this is a young GC
at stop the world so these four threads
that used up between them 25% in that
set of all it's running concurrently so
they probably ran for just 5% of the
time but in that 5% of the time they
were blocking my code from executing so
it's kind of hard to do the maths when
you're looking at multi-threading I
don't have a really good solution I
think with a bit of tooling we can make
utilization problems a bit easier to
solve here but at the very least you
have the data to start playing with it
the next thing I wanted to look at is
what happens when you use a different
profiler and this is sort of a meta
exercise of profiling the profilers so
we have this benchmark but we just
looked at and we can see and this is one
of the nice things about language you
can see immediately that this is a
different profile it's the same
application something has changed and if
we look here again I apologize to the
people in the back about the font size
we can see that this is the compiler
thread jumping in and sucking got some
of the CPU okay we can also see that our
code looks very very different when you
enable an interpreter and
and sir not an interpreter an
instrumenting profiler
it changes your code that injects a lot
of timestamps everywhere and two things
happen
one all your code goes back to being
recompiled reinterpreted being slow and
getting fast again all that cycle starts
from scratch the compiler has to do a
lot of work to get it back to being fast
your code is no longer your code though
it's got a lot of new code injected into
it so what you're measuring has now
changed significantly and you're
spending quite a lot of time calling
clock get time everywhere because you've
injected all those timestamps so instead
of running your code you're now paying a
significant percentage to just measuring
it it's a classic management problem
between actually doing any work and
reporting the work that you've done and
it's it's just a machine example of it
so this is what happens when you use the
instrumenting profiler and this is what
happens when you profile with Jay visual
VM again this profile looks different
one of the things that it's perhaps hard
to perceive but if you have a good sort
of visual memory you will note that this
hump on the on the right it looks very
similar to the benchmark we were seeing
before the code hasn't changed its shape
hasn't changed but it's getting a lot
less CPU it's getting a lot less samples
collecting the stacks doesn't actually
take that much time if we dig in and
find that method call we'll see that
it's marginal but it stops your code
every time it happens so this is what
we're seeing here right I'm nearly out
of time so that was the sort of meta
profile larger profile view you can get
CPU utilization info on JVM threads you
can get an idea of what's happening
internally in the JVM without resorting
to looking in sort of obscure other logs
without the context of where does this
fit with my application there is
multi-threading there is confusing
blocking behavior to contend with but
it's part of you
using a new tool and perhaps you'll get
used to it there's a lot more you can do
with perf and there's a lot more you can
do with this tool chain in particular
you can take these text files and
concatenate them and get a cluster wide
profile you can profile using perf on
the whole machine level and get a view
of what other applications are doing or
how multiple applications behaves
together and you can use all the other
per features too to enable your
investigation finally I know I'm out of
time but I would really like to
encourage people to jump in and add
whatever features come to their minds
and this is just a few suggestions all
of these should be relatively small
projects that require very little
upfront knowledge we're just doing some
text processing and we get new insights
out of it in summary this is a new set
of tools for you to use they're not
particularly hard to pick up and they
give you a lot of new insights you can
tweak and hack and share and I think
that's a great thing to have and you can
gain both a wider understanding and you
know perhaps even solve some problems
using these tools have fun thank you for
listening and we don't have time for
questions but if you have questions I'm
sure the people outside would love to
wait while you ask them so go ahead
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
