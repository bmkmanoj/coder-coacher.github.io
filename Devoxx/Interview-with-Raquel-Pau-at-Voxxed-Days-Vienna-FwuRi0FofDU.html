with Raquel he's giving a chastening
about controlling technical debt with
continuous delivery exactly yes my talk
is about which kind of automatic
processes we can configure and use to
reduce a technical depth and especially
in the context of micro services because
many companies are moving their their
whole applications because big
applications into small pieces that is
what we call Micro services and it's a
new opportunity to make things cleaner
and automatics to reducing the amount of
time that we spend in well in things
that are not directly related with the
window may know for application right
highly magic technical debt well let me
tell that includes a lot of things but
currently there are two main measures
that it's test coverage and also coding
a stye relations or the amount of time
that you need to fix them that in the
context of Java they are well 45
solutions open source all of them and
they are easily integrated into into
sinking sink or workflow pipeline and
this this talk mainly what discusses is
currently the only solution to integrate
this kind of tools is wait to know if
there are new relations on our code base
and then after that we need to spend
time fixing one by one manually so since
few years ago I was spending time in an
open source solution that it's called a
woman that instead of just waiting for
your own manual solution because most of
them can be automatically fix it yeah
the distance is seated on a for you okay
so most of well the most common
automatics quick
but we all know is they organize input
yes that we are on a you're in your own
later but there are many more that you
can automatically fix and well when you
learn how to do this it's it's better to
apply their border with yourself and and
run out of attic approach so we will see
how we can modify or Jenkins pipeline
with this kind of 16 tools okay so I've
come across that before where maybe
before you can commit your courage
double know this is the right word like
a lint test check amiko standard yeah
you can also check your to your gold
style before committing that's that's
right in fact it's what you need to do
but when we have a strong bed light we
usually remove this kind of tools all
this kind of checking because we don't
have time and in fact when we are in a
kind of MVP or starting a new product
and we need to validate as fast as
possible if the software its response to
a real need we need to spend our time
just validating instead of doing clean
code yeah and well if we start using
this kind of 16 schools from the
beginning becomes easier to maintain the
code afterwards if their solution is
it's good enough if anything you can be
back codexis slightly more complicated
like they have technical debt to upgrade
library yeah of course um well upgrade a
library in fact if depending on the
amount of changes then also we are
automatically performed em but for me
the the critical part when we have an
important debt is the web factor rings
that we need to apply to become to
reduce the amount of time that we spend
to implement a future very similar to
another feature and
and go on so well that's true but it's
also true that the first point that you
need to do is to have full tesco a trick
because without it you cannot resolve
and that's unreason interesting
description about trusting tools or like
your regular or having test coverage
because there are some organizations
that only believes in automatic change
when they have legacy code because there
are more testable than manual changes
yeah but for another part I won't apply
this kind of things if there is no end
of this coverage because you really
don't know if those changes are
affecting the final application and in
fact that's the key if you integrate
this kind of quick fix in your pipeline
after what you need to to run a test and
see if everything is okay just met and
forget it
