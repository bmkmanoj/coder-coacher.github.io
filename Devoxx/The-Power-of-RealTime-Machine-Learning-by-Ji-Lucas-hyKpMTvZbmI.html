Antonio a lot here I see a lot people
it's just 50 Minister so I'll go to just
breathe and then if you are very
interesting about our project you can go
to our github and our website and then
you can get those source code and then
you came some feedback so our topic is
the power of the real time machine
learning first let me introduce myself
my name is Sergey Lucas I'm no scientist
I working for cattle computing research
institute by amla scientist well I don't
have PhD I don't do algebra I don't do
any math formula i do cold I design and
architect luckily I got the very good
love like I was in I'm from Chicago so
one day I was at home and then my
friends call me I have wonderful project
for you do you wanna move so okay y NOS
i sauté in the US and listen but you
have to move the cataract surgeon with a
guitar so i googled it and the somewhere
in the middle east so I look at I talked
him a kisser is fantastic project and he
talked about all the password like a big
data and machine learning and such a
good researchers you know and that MIT
so I said okay sounds good side pack I
talk to my daughter let's go to me
Therese so this I'm oh I moved to cut
off at the three years ago so I walked a
lot of researchers who is researching
about the crisis in the digester their
research about the like a natural
disaster one man made it yet so
something like a refugee was Civil War
and something like that so here's my
email justice so they're like oh
indigence actually you just effective
community saw digital community why
because when we gesture happen even
though in devoxx everybody is using
mobile or social media it's a very hard
to find out nobody is the new social
media so especially when disaster happen
everybody is a communicate through those
social media and then mobile
technologies so we found a lot of their
very actionable kind of inside
information is in there the question is
how we can find this inside information
it cannot be at home it has been in real
time it's very challenging because
though if there is a like a find a
needle in the haystack this hey stake is
the growing growing growing but how we
can find this actionable information in
near time that is a challenging in the
humanitarian community so when my
friends call he was so innovation lab
director so he has the project with the
UN so you n do a lot of our response of
the natural disaster so they want to set
those some project using the machine
learning because it was a tough trend so
that's how I started so look at this
it's a kind of an empire cases when the
first happen a lot of a tweet tweet
millions data is coming happen but what
we want to find why although like an NGO
partners over un they want to find some
actionable information from this math
data let me show you want some po ok
these are our mast I unloaded first
let's go to Napa but this map is a real
time so somebody else that please
looking for Joshua he's in Nepal like it
cannot be today or three days later it
has to be a real time but this
information in Twitter or in the
facebook but we have to find this
information in real time that's why we
said it's a pint or needle in the
haystack so let's cover my presentation
so our question is how you find the
information in needle in the haystack so
our researchers and then some of our
developer and then we open source
projects our community developer so we
develop a code either and the micro
mappers either means artificial
intelligent for digital response and the
microphone / is for the crowdsourcing
platform the nobility of the stem is so
combined with the human computing and
the machine learning so let's go to our
component so our ad tech is architecture
is very simple we have a collector and
the taker in a tree a trainer and we
have dashboards so collector is very as
name mean you collect the data so when
people go to our system they start based
on keyword or what you're bounding box
they find out some data so when did I
succumbing also user they can go to
other website they can download this
data it can use analysis whatever they
want the power is in the taker that is a
machine learning and the human computing
is comes here so people is so basically
when we get the data collection we push
to our cross platform and the people is
taking they classify the okay this is so
about the hell this is about the shorter
they need a medical help or does
something etc and then so basically
humans are teaching the motion of this
means is this so our machine learning is
a machine is learning from the human is
start automatically classifier it
classify the data so it's very powerful
for example we can find a need or
interests of damage and some cases we
are looking for rumors and once this
data is happening and then we go to
dashboard and the we show the map and
the we show the statistic and the we
showed our classify the information base
this information decision maker or
crisis responder they can make decisions
like they can dispatch medical help
where they can send down some like a
food or
some other issue so let's dip diving in
so text classification this is our
pipeline actually we do text and image
opposed but their pipelines a little bit
different because of the nature so let's
look at the text so basically we collect
the data so data is in and does some
black box is happening and though you
have to outside so people can see it so
that inside of our aid or taker that is
our black box so in the black box we
have the trainer and the prediction too
pretty we need a model means some black
bass you you give an input you give the
output there is a black box so basically
when you get data so we have a feature
so for example you are interesting about
the need or medical we called some kind
this kind of things as a feature so we
make a metrics and then peoples are
teaching this means is the medical this
means about the interest rate a Mitch
and then we learn from there and though
we start building the model its own it's
like an on-demand modeling it's not like
we feel the model few months ago and
they're reusing it no it's not it's like
online always active so we start we
build a model and the motor is a created
and then peoples are helping the motion
or your model is ok but you can improve
more so we get the more inputs so we get
the e Barrett we evaluate the motor
again and though our orders are getting
improved improve each time so mother is
ready so once model is ready we get to
load data from the Twitter or Facebook
or news and then we also find some
information with the features and the
weekend the input to our model model is
giving some cannibal pack it says it's
about annealed it's about the
infrastructure damage and blah blah blah
and then this is a keep going during the
our activation so that is how our motion
on
Islam so I mentioned that people start
teaching so our approach is supervised
classification this is a very accurate
but it's pretty costly because we need
the people's help or somebody has teach
without the help it cannot be happen but
the in our nature is so humanitarians a
lot of people like online they are
willing to help so in our case getting
the humans to help like you're labeling
data is a pretty EG so for this there's
a lot of a different technique about
those supervisor classification
techniques but we choose though we
choose the london forests landon
felicity is a pretty accurate you know
compared with the deep learning is the
less but the London first was so still
is a very accurate and distill very good
and then for London for its
implementation we use the Weka the
region is Wicca is the interface for the
Java so hold our application building
the spring or j2ee so integration is a
Wicca was so easy that is the reason we
are using the web cast and then random
forest so let's go to image it's the
same so we got the data i'm showing us
some aerial imagery by doctrine and
though we people sacrifice we get a
notation and then models are building
and do we get the album so imagery
education pipelines a little bit
different because of the nature so when
you get the data and the annotation what
we have to do we have to fix lies it
makes a one by one we have to fix right
it be because we need to find the object
is a house or bridge and blah blah blah
so with that is for region for they were
using the CNN and the ers and the folder
for the package we use the deep breath
and the one segmentation is done next
phase is so we have to find that texture
because sometimes when you get the image
is very hard to distinguish is so ground
or is a building or a ground or whatever
so it's very hard so we have to
Oh identify the texture so we deftly
algorithm we use the feature vector with
the CNN a year and then we do after that
all segments in is done and are we using
the spm to classify and the model is a
building and the ones classifier is
Ronnie we can we know that this is a
background or my all non-damaged or
medium damage or severe so as you can
see picture there is the area in which
we got open or two and then that is the
ground truth means that our volunteer on
the theory and the daddies either our
algorithm is consult so let's iterate
the story again so case so you know the
life is migration so let's something
that 1,000,000 why this all day so today
to show you what we do is though our
task is attack callate whenever shortly
after their life so traditionally put
the people this is a one channel anymore
is going the check check check but you
know you can then you can let me near
your time so what is the human solution
right very simple you add another lane
so more people okay we have a lot about
people so we can do do but still is very
slow because you know the volume of the
1,000,000 web is a day you cannot
control so actually based on like our
calculation if you handle 1 million a
wife is you need to 500 Messiah 24-7 we
cannot do that that's why we introduce
the Ada and my chromophores so my
grandma / either we can do sorry Foley
tagging for second we can increase more
basically our approach is so we get
channel ok so we tag but we get some
coffee for human like sometimes it's
very hard to understand so like a we are
teaching java 11 to undergrad and how
you write the hello world so it's a
teaching and then eventually Easter
learning from the Machine and the our
accuracy is the increase that is our
approach all right
so let's go to hear that is our
architecture so basically we have the
input or the social media and those dumb
images and we have the data collection
once we're data to collect we publish
reddy's and that it goes to tigger and
there is started tagging or so you put
the test prefer for annotation and then
once annotation get it pushed back so
you improve the model and then this kind
of information push the readies and
though we put the output so you can
download you can do so I have about one
minute so actually I'm learning one
collection my local so let me show this
okay so data is coming so I already
built because I tagged some because they
taking is a taking time so once data is
coming is that classify a giving some
information and you can see that and
then if you go to Isis my models locate
here so I can see my mood instability oh
so it is one is update whenever needed
okay there is about it and then let me
give some statistics so we are operated
at those fears over three years so we
listen our activation or so hurricane
nephew and we have some data a lot of
agency they are using and as I mentioned
we depend we are open source sometimes
we need a developer who he'll the our
partner / community health so it in if
you can join our group and then you if
you can help us to improve our
application it will be very good for
Humanity thank</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
