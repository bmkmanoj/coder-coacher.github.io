to invite the devil at super pattern I'm
gonna ask you a preliminary question
okay what's the super Cutten it's like a
pattern of patterns okay so we kind of
started with a couple of patterns we
were talking about like the harmonious
polygamous marriages DevOps made up of a
Jelena and Isis m and then I had another
pattern that I was talking about quite a
lot called the correlations between
halakha C and DevOps and then I met a
chap who's quite significant in the
DevOps world John Willis conference in
Munich last December and he said he had
another pattern that he called his
three-legged stool so we took all our
patterns and merged Morton into one big
pattern and that's the super pattern
okay yeah you find it easy to follow
this super patent I do because probably
because I've kind of seen it evolve I
think potentially I have presented it
quite a few times to see already but I
think attentionally it might be battling
two people they're very new to DevOps
just kind of grappling with the kind of
basic concept of development and the
conflict that happens with operations
and how to help them collaborate and
kind of incorporating things like what a
safety culture mean and how does that
relate to learning organizations and the
three ways and stuff it becomes a very
big subject that we can walk them
through it fine thanks good so we also
talked about DevOps and when we're
emailing yeah questions so I'm at a
changing definition of DevOps and even
if what that term means because there's
just seem to be a bit of a conflict in
the purely development community yeah
with DevOps is that something we're
going to embrace something we're going
to ignore us as a separate and here and
what do you think about that you do you
feel that that exists yes and from both
sides of the fence I think so where
DevOps really started was the
recognition that there was a lot of silo
ization and traditional organizations so
organizationally you'd have a load of
people reporting in two headed air the
load and head of ops
some organizations we work with they set
on different sides of the corridor are
the ones on different floors some even
in different buildings in the same town
there's a lot of separation and that led
to quite a lot of conflict as pressure
was building on businesses to deliver
more digitally the developers were being
asked to push more change through and at
the same time of the operations people
managing very complex decades-old very
sophisticated but quite fragile
infrastructures and they were very
accountable for stability and uptime
so you kind of had these people need to
push through loads of change these
people wanted to keep them up they're
not talking to each other very well not
collaboration very well so you'd get
these things like they just throw their
code over the wall and expect us to
release it instantly and we never know
it's coming and they're asking us the
production access admin access to
production systems and all this
conflicts going on so that's kind of
where it started but it's become the
super pattern really expresses how it's
become much more encompassing in terms
of a whole like best practice set for
the value stream the IT value stream and
the way that business is incorporated
into that in fact some of the work I've
done in the past few weeks we've done a
few assessments I've been doing some
workshops and stuffing it's got me
really thinking that actually it's not
even DevOps anymore it's actually bit IT
so I did tweet that earlier in the week
I think I had a couple of retweets
obviously creates new buzz word but have
really been that's kind of the where
DevOps is now is really about
incorporating everybody that's involved
in delivering that innovation and
because innovation is so much about
technology these days it underpins
everybody we've had if he tooks this
conference about security and how
important it is for developers not only
to acknowledge the importance of
security but then to actually act on it
hmm and that can be can be difficult
sometimes because there's a lack of
knowledge do you think DevOps is a way
to solve that because you're trying to
increase communication between siloed
faces and you try to share knowledge
about very different things how to
secure to come into it and learning
about it very personally question as I
was in Belfast yesterday talking about
the DevOps engineer role at
the OWASP conference up a sec EU there
so I'm very fresh in my mind we have
developed whole course for deaf cyclist
engineers and like many kind of pundits
in the DevOps industry I wrote articles
in January about what I thought 2017
would look like from a devil's
perspective and we all had in common
that we all think security is a big part
of what people be looking at this year
feel like it's maybe been a bit of an
afterthought in the past if you look at
the DevOps handbook it's actually in the
subtitle but it still doesn't appear
until pretty much the final chapter in
the book so we may be a bit slow to
incorporate DevOps you know John the
CISO in the Phoenix project was kind of
left out there in the cold quite a long
time although interestingly I think it
was him that had was the biggest
catalyst for getting that that project
back on track with business so to cut a
long story short we say we said for
quite a while that DevOps isn't one
person's job it's everyone's job and we
really feel the same about security so
security through their own fault or
everyone's for Randall nope nobody's
thought maybe it's just fact and have
been quite separate as you say quite
siloed so well we're really trying to do
DevOps it's not only brings security
closer so in the same way we're bringing
ops in to try and contribute to the
product backlog and get NFRC in early
and that kind of stuff we're actually
trying to get them to help educate the
devil the developers more so that
developers have more understanding of
what they're facing and what the
organization is facing attack levels are
rising for everybody it's becoming an
increasing problem and also to get the
security people to help do things like
integrate tools into the developer
environment so the IDS where they can
get flags if they're putting artifacts
in that aren't gray or if the developers
aren't comfortable with being
interrupted that way then they can put
things in the CI or the CD pipeline to
break builds again if there's something
that it's not quite right so yeah I
think that this year is definitely the
year of dev check ups in my mind thank
you very much thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
