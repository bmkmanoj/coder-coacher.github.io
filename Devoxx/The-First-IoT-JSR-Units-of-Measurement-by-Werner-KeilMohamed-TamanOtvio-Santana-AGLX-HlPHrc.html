previous presentation tation about IOT
and things yeah but few so thanks to
yoga and Vinny's use for the general
introduction and I'm going to talk about
the chase our 363 that allows to make
sense of all of this data in a semantic
context so that you actually know what
they you get and in what unit
unfortunately the two co speakers otavio
who's actually also representing so
travel in our expert group and mohabbat
couldn't make it order the flight budget
wasn't approved so I'm going to present
it on my own
right
yeah so I'm an executive committee
member of the java community process
involved in various open source projects
and also one of the feedback leads of
Chase Alfred 63 so what is GSR 363 since
the previous speakers and also others
like Bruno are all based in South Paulo
how we use sub Paulo as an example of
one of our calls back leads Leonardo he
his company of this is also based in Sao
Paulo although he's now mostly working
in the US so the distance between
Brussels Airport and Sao Paulo is 9650
four kilometers that is almost precisely
5999 miles so you got the unit which is
miles and the entire quantity which is
5999 miles so why do we need a chaser
like 363 they're currently no
specifications of standards to handle
units in Java both of you will use
probably something like bigdecimal or
Java primitives especially when you're
working on smaller devices and that is
of course error-prone because you don't
know what you need the particular data
is represented as even on the examples
those two guys showed earlier the chaser
string for example only contains
temperature 22 but you don't know
whether it would be Celsius or
Fahrenheit and especially if they want
to use that for the American market that
can be quite a big problem we will see a
few examples where confusions between
different unit systems cost all sorts of
trouble so what's the problem in the
code well as just mentioned if you use
float or double for the speed and in
integer for the distance then at most
you can document your code like that and
say okay yeah I know the distance is
miles I know the chat speed is km/h and
then I can do a calculation and I know
that the result will be our but this is
all more or less documentation so you
know it but the compiler doesn't the
compiler just think of it as numbers so
that's where J sorry 63 comes into play
it's a framework for supporting robust
and typesafe representation of units and
correct handling of quantities so it
allows safe and useful met methods for
modeling physical quantities so you will
have most of the methods very similar to
what you would do for example with
bigdecimal but there in unit context
where they actually know what the unit
you're dealing with is and how to
convert one unit into another so it's
based almost entirely on interfaces and
abstract classes like most chairs ours
there are only one or two concrete
classes other than exceptions which are
in an entry point the class that we
currently call bootstrap everything else
all the other concrete classes are only
in the implementations so some of the
basic concepts and the most important
topics so what is a unit for example
here the the exact definition of what
the second is the kilogram
or the meter you may notice the that's
that's the official SI writing of meter
which is also like the British English
so in the u.s. of course they may spell
that differently but that's up to
formatting and representation so
internally in the API we stick to the SI
standard and we call it mitra with our e
at the end when you then represent it on
you you I it's up to your application
and how you format it and there are
formats for example when you choose the
u.s. local it may actually be spelled
meter with ER at the end so did any of
you attend the talk by Professor
Tannenbaum earlier this week yeah I I
didn't meet him here but I last met him
in Rome at code motion conference and he
said that in one of his books about
standards and now we'll actually see all
types of standards here again a meteor
can be pronounced differently then you
got all sorts of prefixes and
multipliers you get the mile yard yeah
and lots of others some of them are even
historic or specific to a particular
context or culture now one thing that
has pretty much established itself well
for most countries actually also when it
comes to everyday life except in Britain
there's a little bit of a mix you will
still see things like miles on street
signs in the u.s. it's almost entirely
US customary and then I think there is
liberia in africa where the SI system is
not yet established and i think myanmar
get adjusted an election day there's a
lot of political change going on there
and i think they're also considering
aside from political changes and opening
the country up that they may also adopt
the SI system but similar to Great
Britain we will probably see this being
mixed for many years for all other
countries in the world the SI system has
pretty much been adopted everywhere
except maybe when when you do things
like i want to buy a dozen x then you
will probably not always use SI systems
but when you buy a bottle of coke for
example you will of course see it's 500
milliliters except in the u.s. you will
probably see liquid answers as the
primary unit and denis will see 500
liters in small print next to it so
dimension allows analyzing a quantity
the seven fundamental dimensions also
match the seven SI base quantities which
are length mass time little charge
absolute temperature amount of substance
and luminescent Ossett intensity here
are some some examples of how to combine
them which then makes a derived quantity
and the derived unit quantity is a
physical attribute of thing something
that can be measured and that that has a
unit again there are also things like
export carton bits and bytes and others
not not all of them can be measured
although in the units of measurement API
we actually do not cover at least not in
the spec we don't cover things that are
not numeric and not measurable simply
because if you want something else and
you want to define I don't know let's
say t-shirt sizes then there's a perfect
solution for that which is called a java
enum
so that's why we actually have one
implementation that also combines units
with enums but out of the box we don't
support non-numeric quantities because
you can use an email for that unit
conversion that's actually when living
right now in burn in the capital of
Switzerland they since about the late
seventeen hundreds there has been
various mostly length measurements as
you see so basically that the tower
doesn't only show you the time it also
provides several length measurements
that are standardized or that we're
standardized sometimes only in a
particular kenton so if you came from
Zurich and you wanted to sell your goods
in Bern then for example I'd say you had
cloth and you wanted to measure it then
you could go to the clock tower that
suit broker and compare and see okay I'm
coming from Zurich oh I'm using one unit
system that is standardized in Zurich
how does it represent in Bern and what's
it compared to the local unit system so
in a sense the clock tower is not only a
clock that shows the time but it also
has a unit converter built into it since
the second half of the seven-team
century and it's still there although it
may not be used that much so learning
from the past there have been plenty of
mishaps fortunately most of them on the
deed financial damage although some of
them almost cost planes to crash and
other things as we will see so the NASA
Star Wars initiative launched by Ronald
Reagan there was a an experiment
conducted with laser beam sent from
believe it was malakia some large
mountain in Hawaii
and the laser was supposed to be
reflected by the bottom of the space
shuttle or to measure the distance or
something else I guess did it you can
think of it if people are on the streets
they do the same thing and they measure
the distance also with laser beam and
they wanted to do this to put up some
satellite or some missile defense
program as part of the SDI so it was
more or less also measuring but what
actually happened the Space Shuttle went
belly-up why did that happen because the
mountain is 10,000 23 feet high mauna
kea as you see in the document but
somewhere in the complex distributed
system some part of the system or some
person or accidentally misinterpreted it
and thought they had to enter 10,000 23
nautical miles and that of course way
much higher than the mountain and that's
where the Space Shuttle was pointing to
and aiming it another one probably one
of the most famous is the Mars climate
orbiter in 1999 that got lost because
two different teams yeah it cost NASA
and the US taxpayer about 125 million
dollars and preliminary findings then
indicated that at least one team or
subcontractor used us english units like
inches feet and pounds while the other
one used metric units the Gimli glider
that was around the time when canada had
just started to adopt the metric system
it now mostly does again like in Britain
you may probably still see some remote
village in northern Canada close to
Alaska that still has miles and of
course when you when you come to the
American border they will also show
both right but at the time they were
just adopting the metric system and
somebody made a mistake by assuming that
a fuel calculation was based on the
pound and not kilograms and therefore
they miscalculated the fuel amount and
the plane ran out of fuel and it had to
literally land like a big gliding plane
it had no more fuel the engines were off
and the pilot made a crash landing but
fortunately except maybe a few bruises
nobody really got seriously injured and
it landed on a military airstrip in
Gimli Manitoba in Canada and that that's
where the name game became came from it
has nothing to do with a lot of the
Rings and something more recently at
least after 2000 was in California the
giant Galapagos tortoise named Clarence
escaped from his cage because the Los
Angeles so had lent Clarence 250
kilogram 75 year old Galapagos tortoise
to to the exotic animal training and
management program at Moorpark College
in moorpark california and the first
night Clarence actually replicate the
cage and escaped into traffic escape the
whole Sioux but at least he escaped his
cage and probably wanted to go home to
Los Angeles bit like the the animals in
Madagascar well he didn't make it to to
galapagos but at least he did did some
serious damage to his cage and that was
because the LSU warranted clearance was
big and needed an enclosure for an
animal that waits at about 250 and they
may not have set
the unit or they just assume that in in
science everybody dealing with units of
measurement actually think of the metric
system look Clarence weights 250
kilogram but unfortunately the local sue
for the men's 250 pounds and as you can
see here 250 kilogram is approximately
twice the weight so some of the fences
we're simply are not strong enough and
that's why I could just run them over so
these were just some examples of
conversion problems there are also other
ambiguities sometimes you have a gallon
but the gallon may not only be gallon
liquid it can also be getting dry and
that's that's different the same with
days they're special the cedar erl as
opposed to calendar days of course that
goes a little more to something like the
java date and time api we also have
different calendar systems although it's
it's rarely used but there there are
also other calendar systems most most of
them historical but some of them are
also used in different countries for
example and of course simply using a
wrong conversion factor if you use
primitive now how human can be tackled
that in the cold let's go back to our
example so this is how it looks with
primitives now let's look at the same
thing applying the chase are so we have
some of the base types of the API simply
represent those types and elements that
I mentioned earlier so the core concepts
the quantity the quantity then
gets applied a quantities or length or
also extends quantity actually it's it's
a subtype of quantity but it's more or
less a marker interface if you want the
length itself usually does not have any
operations other than the quantity so
it's only used as a type-safe marker are
using java generics as you can see here
in the typical generic races and then
our quantities get quantity is a
convenience factory in the reference
implementation there's a slightly more
complex but standard based way if you
use the API then you can also get a
so-called quantity factory from the
bootstrap and do all of that with using
the API itself and the standard but in
the reference implementation we offer
some convenience methods that look a
little bit like for example what you
would see in another chase are for money
and currency that they have a lot of
those convenience glasses or you would
of course also know from the JDK things
like arrays or collections then we
define the speed I get airplane speed is
just a method are with the live demos if
we have enough time i'm going to show
you the actual code in the IDE later and
then you calculate the estimated time to
arrive and that that's literally coming
from the code all sorts that's a little
over ten hours based on the cruising
speed of an Airbus 380 by the way so who
is going to use chase off 363 well
almost everybody who works in the
Internet of Things or also in areas like
big data even though we we made it scale
down to the smallest possible devices
including those running Java ME embedded
we also the same API runs everywhere
from small devices with Java ME and
going to show your Java m.e in the
emulator and java SE running either on
your desktop or also on this nice little
intern edison are so there was a lot of
mention about Intel Edison of other
previous speakers and they put it in a
tablet for example so I I doing a
hackathon way until also kindly provided
some of those i put java on it and that
was actually approximately in march this
year now just a few weeks ago which
other one intel officially announced
that all of their SDKs and the devices
will officially support java 8 so for
you if you buy an edison and you want to
run java on it it will be a lot easier
there was a little bit of hacking and
tuning and Intel was very helpful with
that so i made this work in in march and
it's also documented on our project
website for those of you who want to run
the examples on an edison but to
actually get java running on it it
should now work a lot easier since intel
has supported each other in its sdk so
any embedded developer and especially in
the embedded Walt the problem was often
that code is very cryptic and by
offering this API also to Java ME
embedded we we want to help developers
to have less error-prone called and also
have the code being more self documented
you actually see this is a mile or this
is a kilometer per hour or this is meter
and this is inch and it's actually
documented by the code and also
understood by the compiler and you don't
just to put javadoc there so the
internal structure how many of you know
Java ME embedded or have worked with
before ok with you well we use the Java
ME embedded profile HSR that has the
number pretty much right
now two numbers before hours so chase
are 361 is the emmy embedded profile and
emmy embedded profile is broken into
almost a dozen different packages and
all of them are optional well we try to
make it a little less complex there are
only three optional packages in addition
to the core package and we have
approximately 6 profiles but
nevertheless if you want a very small
device and you don't need formatting
other than just showing the actual
string that's behind the unit then you
can leave format out the quantity
package is optional if you want to
define your own quantity andrew joseph
one or two quantities that are
self-defined you don't need the base
quantities and never of course the SBI
is also optional so there are things
like a system of units in there that try
to help defining unit systems and
extension models but if you have a very
small device and you just need a unit
and the quantity and you want them to
deal with each other then all you need
is in the Java X measure package and you
can leave everything else out so there
are extensions or a lot of the stuff
that was defined in a previous chase out
to 75 that I was also involved in until
it was stopped five years ago well I
would say the main reason that we will
stop back then is that there was no alt
and Sun at the time still leading the
java community process and the view
others actually redhead and IBM voted in
favor of if it at the time but others
like son didn't and in the end it was it
was close but there were a few more no
votes against it that's why it was
stopped at the time but we used that
opportunity to actually drastically
redesign it and take a lot of the things
that were in the reference
implementation out of it and that
includes
for example the SI system which is also
an extension module so the reference
implementation itself it contains a
small collection of units the class is
actually called units and its small
smaller but representative subset of the
SI system if you want so it contains
most of the important stuff like meter
Graham kilogram and so on there are also
the prefixes they are in the reference
implementation there's an SE port of it
I called you or MSC and I actually had a
chat with the speakers at javaone who
presented an open JDK project called
corner for the Internet of Things and
four ways standards mostly protocols and
we are trying to find a way that maybe
the SE port which is not the reference
implementation mainly because the
reference implementation runs on Java
m.e so we are only using types that are
compatible with Java ME for example this
little bit decimal that's why the SE
port is a bit of a superset if you want
or extends it there are also various
breeches and types that support for
example Java time on Java 8 so the SE
port has the minimum version of java SE
eight it won't run on SE 7 the reference
implementation i think it veer we could
even run on java SE 6 although we mostly
target 7 now because 6 is ray historic
it's not even visually supported by
oracle anymore but the api is completely
backward compatible i think the the
smallest version of java that you can
run the API on its literary java 6
that's because the the system loading
mechanism are that was introduced with
java 6 yeah and there are other unit
systems on top especially iso 80,000 or
topics we are exploring support the
unified code four units of measurement
that's a way
large and unique catalog of units that
tries to model every possible unit even
things like spoons or drops in the
health care system and for data exchange
with hl7 or the wh 0 for example they
even mandate the you Kim standard in
many cases when it comes to data
exchange between researchers yeah a good
example for what the iso standard
defines on top of Si and since we're in
Antwerp I haven't brought any diamonds
unlike the previous speaker but i will
show you in the live demo that the the
iso extension to SI also supports
something that is pretty important earth
to Antwerp and to this area which is the
car got that's a measurement for the
weight of a diamond that's something
that you won't find in the SI standard
it's not an SI unit but the ISO 8085
catalog on top of SI defines other
things and karate is a good example here
okay so the more time make sure the
other so this is something that a
Leonardo oh my course packet from me to
come I think he he brought most of those
devices to devoxx UK in London a couple
of months ago I don't have this device
with me here so I'm going to to show you
something else they are actually powered
by Java ME embedded and unlike the
Gemalto board that is just the concept
port most of those devices actually run
Java ME eight embedded already so the
internet is now I already showed you
before which was started in the middle
of march during a hackathon in berlin
where this nice case was also forged and
there was a follow-up doing another
hackathon of the same kind in
tune in London and I I documented all of
that in a ski talk and there are
tutorials that you can find in the demo
section again self that will be
simplified now that Intel I think they
have already published their new version
of the SDK so we're also going to to
simplify and update our documentation
especially when it comes to things like
how to install java SE eight on the
edison board there should be some things
that until now actually did for you so
we can we can lift it out of our
documentation but at a time this was not
available yet and it was more or less
you wear on your own so i also try to
document some of that in the UM demo
section so now let's
so first a few mostly java SE demos that
is dimensioned ESO 80,000
almost all of them are in the console
but I guess except for a few more
sensual examples like voice recognition
most of them were also pretty much
console-based so these are some of the
units that are defined in ISO 80,000
like I think that's the astronomic
something you need then here you will
actually see a 100 carat and how it's
converted into kilogram well look at the
code up here so you can get a bit of
example so here here is the the quantity
mass in karate and then it's actually
converted into kilogram
you
so that requires a little bit of input
does anybody want to share their height
in meters and want to load their body
mass index no don't be shy okay probably
have to use my own and the second one
asks for the weight in kilogram I'm not
sure well let's just assume that it
should be somewhere around 90 oh yeah so
it's it's pretty much on the border i
think somewhere around 25 but i guess it
tells me that the belgium beer and the
good food and the butter I should
probably try to cut back on that because
I'm a little bit overweight as mentioned
it's pretty much on a margin I think 24
points something we actually used we use
an extension in the reference
implementation are called quantity range
that's a specialized type that behaves a
little bit like the range in Google's
guava and google has its own extensions
and it has specialized collections and
all sorts of enhancement to Java and one
of them also defines a range which is
more or less an extension to the
collections API where you can have an
upper and the lower boundary and we
found some of it a little bit too to
complicate it it has a lot of things
that are let go beyond the pair need
here for data and for measurements so we
defined a range type in the in the our
eye level SPI and then on top of that
general-purpose range we defined
so called quantity range that allows to
define upper and lower boundaries of
measurements another example similar to
BMI would be the
the range is for hurricane categories so
here you actually see those ranges
listed the so called saffir-simpson
hurricane wind scale defines Reyes
categories of hurricane the highest is
category 5 and so here we we have a
tropical depression so that's basically
the zero category and if you're living
500 kilometers away from a hurricane of
category 0 then you have about eight
point one seven hours to evacuate your
home before it's wrecked by the
hurricane now let's do the same with
category five whoops now I guess you
better hurry up because now you have
little under two hours left to evacuate
your home with this hurricane being the
same distance but you will probably only
be able to grab a few things and your
family and try to get away as soon as
possible so this is another use case for
ranges where we modeled the hurricane
categories in the quantity range
allowing to pick which which of these a
particular wind speed actually falls
into
ok then i'm going to switch ide
so Java ME embedded SDK got a nice
Eclipse plug-in recently it only works
with eclipse Mars that's why I'm I'm
switching the idea because most of the
AC demos are based on cables tool suite
and I think they have not upgraded their
final version to Mars yet so that is the
same code running in Java ME now so this
is part of the reference input
implementation you can see these are all
the units defined in the in the units
collection and this is the MP demo are
based on a Java midlet and if we have
enough time actually just at least 15
minutes left and we can try to do a
little bit here with the code so first
of all just showing you how it runs
Eclipse let's put all of that into the
console so this is pretty much a
slightly extended hello world example
and it shows free of the key units
actually are all three of them are base
units so we got temperature in Celsius
time and length
let's just have a look if any of them
yeah
why don't we add mass
yeah because that's actually that's the
only example where because there are
certain standards including you Kim
where the gram is actually used as the
base yeah so have to input it
ok
I texel because it's deployed into the
so with the second screen there we go to
restart the midlet yeah NRC actually use
the 90 90 kilogram for my previous
example because with kilogram and graham
we can actually do a to a small
conversion here too you can do all the
other conversions if you add additional
modules for example the common unit
systems which is also relatively small
where you can then define us quantities
I just don't for the sake of time and
simplicity I only stick to the reference
implementation yeah that's why I'm only
converting kilogram into gram but it
gives you an example of all the other
conversions that you can do if you add
additional unit systems or define some
of your own so
so all you do and it's it's pretty much
like a two-string operation or something
similar so the quantity has a to another
unit and then you just define the target
unit there we go
right so let's run this again with the
most recent java me8 point2 sdk you can
actually also install Java ME eight on a
raspberry pi so if if you have a
Raspberry Pi and you probably ran it
with SE embedded you can also do the
same with Emmy and bedded so here you
see the conversion of 90 kilogram which
is ninety thousand gram okay then let's
go back to the
open earlier the airplane example that's
that's the live code that you can also
clone from our github repository let's
make this a little larger is it is the
font okay to be readable even in the
back yes so here's the full code and as
you see that the slides at almost all of
it is just a little simplified so here
you have to get airplane speed of
quantity speed defined as 945 km/h which
is the average cruise speed of an Airbus
380 so if you have a different plane you
would have to change this and here's the
the calculation and the slide showed
this example by casting and that of
course possible if you if you're not
afraid of using a cast or if you don't
consider it bad cold but there is
actually a different alternative in the
quantity and that's the so-called s-type
unit has something similar where you can
do a more types if cast and that
actually also compares the dimensions so
in most cases especially for known
dimensions and quantities it's usually
better to use this version if there is a
problem with s type or you deal with
some dimensions that are unknown and you
would get an error here you could still
use a cast but in most cases it would be
more advisable to use quantity s type
what do the same with you need
oops
that's a problem running each one
eclipse sometimes they keeps compile of
things differently than maven
so we have a little bit of time but i'm
not sure if there's oops if there's
enough time to actually run it on the
Intel Edison
okay so I'll go for the slides intended
at the end if there's enough time I may
probably show you the demo on the Intel
Edison
so you can actually participate in chase
our 363 by either simply downloading it
trying it out or offering to extend it
you can file Chara or github issues and
of course if you have a special use case
then let us know and we we are happy to
add that either in our demo or in a
particular project actually the things
API that Vinicius and yarrow talked
about in their previous presentation we
used an earlier version of their things
API in a hackathon at Java 12 years ago
and we created a remote heart monitor
that's connected to the Raspberry Pi and
allows a health if you want or remote
health and that was also using the
things API and after after javaone when
our case our code started and approved I
updated that life demo and also made it
type safe at least on the server side
the code that's running in in Java EE on
tomcat and the Raspberry Pi that will
actually deal with the heart rate also
in any type safe units of measurement
way you can also find that under our I
think that's a separate demo project so
it's not under um demos but you will
find heart of glass as one of the
projects in our github community yeah
not only for adopting it but also for
the chase our itself actually two of
these four awards that were awarded
during java one at the JCP party the
chase our 363 as a whole the GSR won an
award for the most significant chase of
the year
and although he could couldn't be there
that's why we took the award for him but
Jack Chennai and rush Mahindra hedge
they won an award for outstanding
adopted cheese our participant of the
year of course they did not only adopt
allergies are but they're also involved
in rush represents chuck chennai as an
expert group member in our cheese also
there were two awards at the JCP awards
this year that we're somehow related to
the cheese are including the award that
the chase are itself one this is also
Leonardo so Mohammed on the left then
it's me Leonardo another suspect lead
and Otavio on the right unfortunate up
of Mohammed and Octavio couldn't come
here this time but it is here you also
see see how they look like so the
timeline we are we are pretty much in
the process of filing the public review
as I speak all the code has been frozen
version 0.8 is in github for the core
artifacts like the reference
implementation and the API the only one
that trades a little bit because we
started it later the tck is currently at
0.5 what's also important about it is UK
similar to for example Java ME embedded
we have profiles and optionality so in
the tck when you run it you actually
have to choose a profile by default if
you choose nothing then you will get the
full profile that means everything
that's defined but you can narrow that
down and say I only want a profile that
uses the core types and formatting and
nothing else and then your TCK will test
your implementation against that
particular profile and the other tests
will not be taken into consideration so
you can basically filter the tck based
on the profile
that you want to use and there are two
profiles for quantities one only uses
the seven base quantities and one uses
all the quantities that are defined in
the reference implementation and we
expect the final draft i would say in
the first half of 2016 and the final
release based on where we currently
stand should be more or less around the
same time scale that java 9 also plans
and since the OpenJDK project are also
signaled some interest there may be
actually an open trading a sub-project
that is of course also optimized and
aligned with java SE 9 when we go final
so here are the links so we have three
main mailing lists units def is open to
everybody on google groups you can join
it that's the one that is more for
development specific aspects so actually
improving the chase are itself or
getting involved but you don't have to
be a member of the expert group to to
subscribe to that unit uses is more for
end users they're our end users that
already have started using it for
example somebody at Alice approached us
saying that they they try to use it on
Android and the other interested parties
so of course there are certain standards
like QAPI a standard defined by the open
geospatial consortium they currently use
the stalled and stopped chase out to 75
and at least when this goes final and
they are ready to release a new version
of their own standard they actually plan
to use 363 and the other projects for
example Eclipse smart home they already
created an experimental branch using
chase alpha 63 and before this release
or before the public review
there were some licensing questions that
we are resolved now and when the public
review is approved by the executive
committee then they also want to request
another inclusion proposal for the clips
to actually include the chase are in the
Eclipse repository called orbit so that
they keeps projects like smart home and
others of course it's primarily
interesting photos in the IOT or in the
science working group and several have
already experiment that some of them
indirectly or directly use GSR 275 and
all of those are sooner or later
encouraged to use to use the new chase r
which is now looking pretty good that we
should get a final release so here to
guidelines how to run it on java SE and
with the reference implementation
including the demo data that i just
showed you on any embedded that's on the
bottom it's all of it is ray neatly
documented in a readme so that any part
is the only one that's not automated
with maven everything else you can run
with maven and you should find the
artifacts in either a snapshot or the
final repository at merion central the
emmy part is the only one that takes a
little bit of manual labor but if you
have the Emmy SDK installed and you use
it eclipse or netbeans like I said
Eclipse works a little more neat now
actually but it also works in netbeans
may just be a little more complex to set
it up and you can run every single demo
that you just saw yourself okay not sure
if we have time for any question other
questions free questions yes
I have heard that in jdk 10 they will
add like value types and possibly even
something like operator overloading or
something like that and now you go for
the and reverence types is there any
idea how you but radio types are
supposed to work with interfaces so
there will be a radio type as soon as
Java defines this and what we currently
have in the reference implementation or
more likely in the open TDK project or
sub project that is interested in taking
over our SE port that will actually
happen with java SE eight or nine and
when ten is available this will just be
migrated to 10 so there will be a value
tape type what value types can implement
interfaces so the the relevant
interfaces will just be implemented by a
value type instead of a concrete justin
another question ok well if nobody else
has i think you can you can yes there's
a there's an internal class and of
course in in the SE implementation that
works differently because they're
bigdecimal is available in the RI that
the number of types are limited to what
the me8 runtime allow so for example
bigdecimal and begin nature do not exist
and there's classes like the quantities
that you saw and they actually the
recognized based on the on the type
what's the optimal types if some value
that is provided has no decimal part
behind it then it would for example use
integer along so that that's mostly done
by the by the convenience factory but if
you implement or use quantity factory on
your own then you can of course control
didn't say I always want big decimal the
reference implementation provides some
sort of smart recognition which is
basically based on on the type and on
what's available so the RI will have
fewer numeric representations than the
SE port but you can also overload that
or have finer control if you implement
those types yourself including quantity
victory as long as they are number yes
so at the moment quantity is based on a
unit and the number anything that
extends number if you use apache or
google types or glue numerics as long as
this extent number they should work okay
I think we're out of questions anything
else please just ask them on our google
groups or on some of the issue tracking
systems okay mm thanks for coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
