everybody essence for being there during
this during this conference my name is
Nicaragua as you can see on the screen
I'm just gonna move on my name is
Nicaragua I'm working for al de bajar
maybe you saw or product this morning if
you were attending the keynote paper is
made by what company the robot I'm
developer advocate at al de baran we are
making robot I said that and they are
programmable robot we talked about Java
this morning but it's not the only
language that is that is available
anyway I wanted to have this talk in
order to raise interest about robotics
and in order to show you that you should
also pay attention and start paying
attention to robotics if you haven't yet
because this is definitely going to be
something important in the years to come
I made a quick top 5 of the reasons why
you should pay attention these are
things that we can discuss at the end if
you want but you'll see my point so the
first reason what or at least first
brief explanation regarding robots we've
been fed by a science fiction and books
and all this stuff with all these robots
I guess that you know most of them the
thing is that at the moment if you look
around you there's really no robots to
be seen if you go to shops or if you
look to your friend's home and so on you
don't necessarily see robots so this was
the fantasy that we have this kind of
robot what we have for real at the
moment is this kind of robots in the
center you can see now if you are used
to come to devoxx now was there for the
last two years but there are also new
form of robots that are not necessarily
based in the humanoid form factors but
uh the one that you can see on the left
is color is called gebo so it's based on
the tablet but it's still a robot at
least that's how it's branded and you
also have the vacuum cleaners that are
getting pretty pretty popular so this is
what you can see at the moment the
reasons why you should pay attention to
this to this robot the first one will be
because we have major technologies now
which wasn't the case a few years
few years before what does that mean
major technologies at the moment mainly
that we get better hardware another way
that is easier to integrate inside of
the body of the of the robot we can
think about the batteries we can think
about the chipset but we can also seen
for example like 3d sensors if you saw
paper this morning pepper is
incorporating a 3d sensor that obviously
makes it easier for developers to take
advantage for the robot cats can sense
around him compared to for example using
a VGA cameras so the other one has
definitely getting better but we also
managed to have more and more
industrialized production for the robots
what's the interest behind that it's
also that industrializing the production
for robots as an impact on the price
that you are going to pay in order to
buy them to give you an ID for us when
we switched from building ourselves the
robots in our office in Paris to getting
them manufactured in China we managed to
divide the product price by two so step
by step the fact of being able to
industrialize is going to make this
robot small for the ball and so you
should be able to see them more and more
often around you so this is another
important element and major technologies
it's also mean that you can have safe
interactions when you have robots around
you usually the most famous robots are
the ones that are used on industrial
lines and for production and these
robots were really like the space where
the robot is behaving working and
usually you cannot get close to that
space because the robot could damage you
hurt you or whatever now we start having
robots that are able to understand what
is around them and allow you to keep
living your life while the robot can
also focus on his work and both being
really really safe the robot is not
going to hurt you or whatever so this is
really making a big difference
technologies are made sure and it's
easier than ever to interact with robot
and to have them
the five point will be conferencing
platform because if you want to start
paying attention to robotics obviously
you don't want to start learning
everything from scratch and usually as
you already developers you want to take
advantage of the things that you already
know so more and more even if at first
the programming that you had to do for
robot or a really specific more and more
we're relying on languages that are
pretty popular at the bar has more than
a thousand API is available for example
that you can take advantage of when you
are programming for robots but we also
have SDKs that allows you to create
applications for the robot that can be
based on JavaScript Python C++ or even
even Java so it means that if you want
to start paying attention to robotics
you won't have to go back to school and
start learning you can really take
advantage of what you already know the
other important element or at least that
make sure I physiol as developers is
that we have what I call high level
commands to give you an example of what
that means a few years ago we have
cameras on the robot we were giving you
access to the road video stream and then
you could take advantage of that but
that was a lot of work to do now we have
AP is where you can directly have
information of higher level like knowing
exactly how many people are standing in
front of the robot the gender and the an
estimation of the age of the person that
has the focus for example or even have a
feedback on when the robot is tracking
their face on the reaction they have on
the robot is behaving so you don't have
to write everything by yourself you can
already take advantage of this kind of
functionalities when working with when
working with robot so this is also
another important element there's a
rising interest growing interest for for
robotics we can see that from all kind
of market and industries the few
examples you can see will be a bank
taking advantage of robots in in Japan
but we also have robots in retail we
have robots being part of entertainment
so many many industries start paying
attention to what we what we do artist
what we do with robots you also have big
companies that are paying attention to
robotics
that is another important element from
our point of view at the Bajau is may be
famous in the robotic industry but
that's not necessarily a company you're
familiar with on the other hand when you
see companies like google samsung go
amazon starting working on robotics from
our point of view it's also a signal
sent to the market that one maybe
everybody should start paying attention
when you get this big act of investing
money and time on developing on
developing robots companies are paying
attention but also customers if you take
the example of gog were launched a year
and a half ago something like that
campaign on indiegogo in order to to
make to find money and at first i think
they were looking for something like
half a million and in the end so the
screen captures about 2.2 million but i
think that in the end just on indiegogo
they made something like four million so
it show how people are interested in
this kind of new technologies the second
example is linked to our product this
time the first time we'll head east
pepper on the consumer market in Japan
the first 300 units were sold in a
minute at the moment we are selling a
batch of thousand pepper that we put on
the bucket at the end of each month and
usually so does marketing sentencing we
sell them in one minute relevant in five
minutes each month we set a thousand of
them so there's a really interest from
the consumer to buy this product and
start interacting with them it's also
fun to program for robot which is an
important element I don't know for most
of you what you're working on but it's
not necessarily all the time funky
things to do with robots usually that's
pretty funny to program first because
these are devices that are going to
interact and have an impact or be able
to interact with the real world we are
not talking about a screen while you're
going to display some stuff it can be
funny but it's even funnier when you get
a device that is able to move itself
himself grab objects and do funny things
with that so this is a first element the
other element is that it's not just
about the machine being
geodon a moose but since we project a
lot on robots we also expect them to
have a character and designing the
character of a robot or his reaction in
this situation or this situation can be
pretty funny we have lots of developers
that have invested a lot of time for
example creating real character for the
robot at some point if you type if you
try to for example touch the head sensor
too much the robot is going to refuse to
do what you ask him to because you're
pissing him off doing this kind of thing
so this brings fun in the in the
interaction that you can have with this
kind of device and that's not
necessarily something that you could do
with the screen at least where the user
would feel as involved as is with the
relation with with the robot last point
and last reason why you should well you
should focus on on robot is because
there's a business for that and for a
long time it's been something for
passionated people but now it's r is
something where you can expect to make
some money at some point on both be to
consumer side and business side i had
this image with eps I don't believe
people telling you that there's no b to
c 0 b2b there's still a big difference
but this customers are paying attention
to what we do and are ready to invest
money on this kind of things that's an
important element for us at alibi home
because at first we had this question
like will people understand that it's
not just about buying our way but also
investing money on the software in order
to have something that is really
tailored to your needs and we can see
that step-by-step they understand this
kind of scenes and they are ready to
invest money not only on buying hardware
but also making sure that they invest in
developing software on top of that will
provide of course on app store so for
the consumer case for example that's
really trusting to other place where you
can where you can spread and sell your
higher applications we are not the only
company making robot you have many of
them that are also relying on Android
for example and using the google play
store in order to sell the application
but you can make business out of it and
we also provide step-by-step analytic
solution
so all the scenes and the ecosystem you
are used to have in what you do when you
do a software development but we provide
the same thing with the with the robots
if I try to sum up the reasons behind
why you should well you should pay
attention to robotics we got the fact
that the hardware is becoming more and
more reliable that the prices are going
down another robot are more and more
accessible thanks to industrialization
that it's in as the next big thing at
the moment everybody is talking about
the Internet of Things but the fact that
you can also have an interface you can
talk to is making a difference it's fun
to do that and this money to make sure
that should be a nice set of arguments
in order to convince you to start paying
attention to robotics I got one extra
reason reason for you why which is from
my point of view good indicator about
the fact that yeah it retimed to pay
attention to robotics it's the fact that
lawyers are doing they start paying
attention to robotics when it was just
engineer discussing you could have doubt
about the real interest at a specific
time to invest time in robotics but at
the moment Royals are coming and are not
coming because it just found the economy
because it raises a lot of question and
there's money at stake so if if lawyers
start paying attention to robotics maybe
you should do it yourself too so this is
it for me thanks for listening to these
discs which are humans and feel free to
come and discuss it if you have
questions it's for me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
