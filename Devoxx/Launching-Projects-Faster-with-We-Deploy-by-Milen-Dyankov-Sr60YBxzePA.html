my name is Manon Janko if I work for a
company called live free what I'm gonna
show you today is our new project called
we deploy one thing that I always wanted
to do as a speaker is to get some
feedback like how I am doing as a
speaker and that's why I actually
decided to build an application for that
which you can see on this URL so if you
care now this is your excuse to actually
use laptops and mobile phones and
tablets and whatever that you have to
during the talk so you can go to that
URL or for those of you who are watching
that on YouTube you can also go on that
URL and you will see the app and the app
looks like this yeah you can see it so
you have their talks in progress there's
nothing yet here so now I'm gonna go as
a speaker and I'm just gonna say start
my talk and as an attendee you can
actually click on that talk and provide
some feedback so do that again as the
URL and meanwhile I'm gonna use my time
to tell you how actually this
application came into life and how long
does it take to build and actually
deploy in a cloud an application like
this so we in Liferay have been already
for 10 years focusing on open source and
making developers lives easier and back
in the old days when portals were as
much as a buzz word as microservices are
today we were making the developers life
easier by providing an open source
solution that was easier to work with
without compromising on all the
functionality the business functionality
that the big high price tag products had
things obviously have changed since then
we've invested a lot into new
technologies and from this screen you
can see that there's a lot of a
front-end we're going
and would employ is the latest addition
to that stack that life really offers
these days so what is with it what about
it's about deploying building and
deploying stuff faster without you
getting to know too much of a
infrastructure too much of configuration
you just built your app whether as
mobile app that requires a back-end or a
front-end app or an enterprise app and
you get it in production in the cloud as
soon as possible and what does that mean
so here's my app hope you can see that
it's very simple HTML and JavaScript up
this particular one uses polymer so I'm
now running this thing on my localhost
just to make sure it works properly
so yeah I can sign in and you can see
that I can sign in with a stupid fake
account and I can't do pretty much
anything else
the reason is polymer components have
this notion of behaviors and this is how
my behaviors are implemented so I have a
mock behavior that logs in with a fake
user and I also have behaviors for my
components that are supposed to get and
store data there are simply not
implemented so but that's good enough
for me
do you actually see the UI by the way
this application proves that I'm not a
web designer so sorry for the user
interface but it kind of works so what
does it take to deploy that hung on on
the cloud
what would we deploy all it takes is a
configuration file which I'm going to
create from a template which is called
we deployed our JSON and inductor in
that file I'm just gonna say I want to
have a container called UI which is
using the hosting image so once I have
that I can actually build my application
that is just to get rid of the the
source stuff that I don't really want to
go in production and then I'm gonna do
we deploy and I say I want to create a
project called talkback now which was
gonna ask me to login which I'm gonna do
using my web
and the moment I did this I can go to
the we deploy console deployment process
continues and you can see on the most on
the end of the screen the deployment
activity it just created a container
called UI based on that configuration
file that I've provided I can see the
logs but I'm more over I can just click
and go to my application so this is my
application and running in a cloud it
still does the same stupid thing you can
have like fake authentication and it
cannot store things so what else you can
do now we can fix the logging how do we
fix that well first of all we need to
change the behavior we need to now
provide a real logging behavior so I'm
also going to use that from a template
and I'm gonna just say okay here is my
real logging behavior it uses some micro
service if you want to call it this way
it is this everything's micro service
that is a dis URL authentication
talkback we deploy IO and then I use
some JavaScript here that says well
login with github this is what you do
and if your log in with Google this is
just the same service right so from
that's basically it replacing which I am
doing right now
the my mocking components with my real
components so it's just disable and
enable this one save the thing and then
I can go again to build my stuff which
again I just do to get rid of the stuff
I don't want to and then I'm just gonna
run with deploy again and if you look
into the console you'll see the again
the activity my container is being
refreshed my service is being refreshed
and a new service has been deployed so
if I now go back to my application I can
reload my application and then I can try
to log in and surprise surprise it's not
gonna work it's not gonna work because
we change the UI but we didn't provide
anything for actual authentication so
let's do that let's create that magical
authentication service well I'm just
going to create a folder called out and
in which I'm gonna create another
deployment descriptor which is what
deploy Jason
and I say this is an authentication and
I provide all my health keys there so
this is how you log in with Google this
is how you log in with github and then I
do go to my out folder and I do we
deploy again now looking back in the
console what you're gonna see is there
is another service being created for me
which is the authentication service that
I'm out indicating against ok and then
if I reload my application and I click
on a github I can you can see I'm out of
adequate logged in because I'm
constantly learning and at github
alright well but still I can't save any
data right I can't do anything because
my deployment my storage is is still
fake it's still empty medics right so
let's fix that so to do that we need to
change these four behaviors that are
describing how components particular
components behave those are storage
component related components for talks
and comments so I'm just going to enable
those and disable the mock ones that
this is the place where I do this and
then I need to also provide the actual
behaviors ok so this is just having a
look at one of those so you will see
here that we have a function that
basically gets the data get the current
talk and we have a function already that
we can use watch to basically be
notified every time something in a data
container changes and and you can
obviously do safe and update and all
these things it's basically IR no sequel
database as a service that that is
provided for you so how do we deploy
that thing well before we with the boy
we actually need to create the actual
service so how do we create the actual
data service well the same thing we
deploy the JSON we have the we deploy
JSON file in where we just say we want
to date a container right and then we
can have this API JSON file which
describes how do we store data so we
have a bunch of URLs here and say well
for this URL you can do get for a
district in the past for this can do
whatever if I want to be more where both
I can actually specify a security rules
in here and just particular people do
particular things and and so forth so
when I do this now I need to first
update my UI because I changed it again
providing the actual storage behavior
which I'm going to do exact same when I
play I did before basically rebuilding
my application and calling the deploy
again and you can see on the right the
service being redeployed then I'm going
to go again to my data folder with these
two files in it and then I'm going to
deploy that and once I do that I'm gonna
have another another service running
which is the data service and now
actually that's all I need to do to be
able to store data so if you go to now
to the web application and actually type
something in and click Add talk then you
have the talk already there there's no
comments obviously when the time I was
doing this you can enable the talk and
you can get to the point where you can
display it now
you mean realize we use this prefixes
for internal services those are only
available in your project in order to be
able to actually access this with a
friendly URL from the internet you can
use this do a custom domain thing to
assign your custom domain name to to
your service so that people can actually
access it with your domain name from the
from the Internet and that's pretty much
it this is how much it took to build
this application put it in the cloud say
you guys can use it there for a lot more
things that you can do it will deploy if
you go to the we deployed github account
and just search for a demo there are 31
demos already there so running different
types of applications Java applications
pretty applications so you can you can
look into that to see what else you can
do it with we deploy it's not limited to
oh those are the services that we give
you out-of-the-box but it's a lot more
than you can actually do so that is
pretty much what I wanted to tell you
today thank you and let's see if there
were any comments so I'm
look at my speaker um oh just one person
thank you for the table whoever that
person is so if you want to learn more
about what if law if you have any
questions we have three minutes and we
also have a booth downstairs if feel
free to visit us and talk to us and
explain your use case and we may help
you decide whether we deploy is distinct
for you okay thank you questions no
questions okay so I see you downstairs
then
thank you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
