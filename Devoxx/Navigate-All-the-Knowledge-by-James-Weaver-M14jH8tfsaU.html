we're going to talk about semantic
knowledge navigation my name is jim
weaver with pivotal there's there are my
coordinates got my my blog site is
javafx / com twitter javafx Bert and I
also have a musical blog it's called
culture to hear that would be great fun
for you to visit if you're interested in
kind of music composition so I've
written several java ebooks and the most
recent one is javafx and java and
raspberry pi and i'm a java champion
javaone rock star speaker plays well
with others that kind of thing and this
application that i'm going to be showing
you is live at concept map that I oh so
if you wanted to play along with me you
could certainly do that it's open source
I've got a patchy to license I wrote it
in Java and using spring and other
technologies that the pivotal curates I
do work for pivotal and I'm a developer
advocate so the the ID here behind this
session is is something that I've been
wanting to do for a long time and that
is to be able to to access the resources
of Wikipedia but rather in an rather
than in an unstructured manner clicking
links and kind of almost randomly trying
to research something by clicking links
and hoping that I'm that I've got my
arms around the subject what I wanted to
do was to be able to navigate those
subjects semantically so using semantic
relationships and and so when I found
out that one of the projects in
Wikimedia besides wiki pedia was wiki
data which has those semantic
relationships
I went ahead and built a tool that would
allow me and you to be able to do that
so wiki data provides semantic
information semantic structure to wiki
PD articles as well as language
translation so it keeps different
languages for different articles and the
concepts for them and I'll drill into
that in a minute so wiki data as you see
over at the top Wikipedia plus wiki data
then allows you to navigate the the
Wikipedia articles using semantic
relationships so all we had to do then
is is create an application that would
that would access those relationships so
the big idea then was to build an
application called concept map by L so
you can go there if you'd like to to be
able to navigate those together so it's
designed to facilitate learning teaching
and research learning if maybe maybe you
want to just learn about some subject
and and you can go in and navigate the
the subject and the related items and
then see the Wikipedia articles at the
same time that you're doing that or
maybe you want to teach somebody
something so maybe you want maybe you
want to navigate those subjects put
together a concept map and then share
that concept map or maybe you're doing
research so in the slides and by the way
the slides if to get to these slides all
you do is is you go to the application
concept map dot IO and then you go to
the this ? here and then it gives you
some information about concept map and
then this link is getting started with
concept map by oh that's the slides I'm
using so in the help in these slides I
go through a learning and teaching
scenario I'm just going to go through a
live one with you
you but I just wanted to let you know
that those are there and they explore
the different types of things that you
can do in this application so I'm going
to go ahead and and go through the
scenario first of all when you when you
bring up the application the central
thing in the map over here and the
concept map on the left is universe so
just defaults the universe and then the
pieces of its application other than the
menu bar are are the concept map that
you're going to build and relationships
from wiki data so all the relationships
out from and to the current concept and
then over on the right is the wikipedia
article that is for that particular
concept that's in focus so let's say I
have the universe here and I want to
begin exploring relationships to
universe so I can go down here to wiki
data relationships and I could see that
one of the relationships is significant
event so I'll click on significant event
and I see that there are several like
Big Bang leptin epic photon epic and
cork epoch so maybe I want to navigate
to one of those and pin that so i could
say okay i want to go to have drawn
epoch and now that's going to be in
focus and i'll pin that to the map and
so now that i can see that one and so
i'm beginning to build up this concept
map so i'll go back to a universe and
perhaps I don't want to individually pin
those but maybe I want to use a search
to be able to get all of the things in
that particular relationship so I'm
going to go to back to significant
events but instead of clicking one of
these events thats related I'm going to
hit click x 1 which means if you look at
the tooltip that's
and it expands that item to one level so
now if I do that it's going to show me
all the significant events for universe
so now I want to explore one of those
significant events namely big bangs so
I'm going to click on big bang and that
one the big bang then becomes the focus
item these relationships now are in
reference to Big Bang and so now I want
to go ahead and explore that but instead
of using the wiki data relationships
like i have before i'm going to show you
another way to explore one way of
semantically but another way to explore
is from the article itself so i'll go
down here in the article and i notice
that that there's a link that says for
the American TV sitcom see the big bang
theory so I'll go ahead and click on big
bang theory and now that wicked pedia
article comes up and that's the central
theme then of of that's that's what's in
focus now big bang theory and that's
what the relationships are about so
maybe I want to see what all the
characters are on the Big Bang Theory TV
show so i'll go down here and notice we
have wiki data relationships these are
the outbound relationships but then we
have a little bit further from related
items those are inbound relationships
from the perspective of what it's
related to so if i'll go to present in
work so the the the characters that are
present in the work of big bang theory
are people like Emma Amy Farrah Fowler
Bernadette Howard Wolowitz if you know
the big bang theory you know all those
characters so I'm going to go ahead and
click x 1 and expand that one and then
we'll see that all of the Big Bang
Theory characters come up and if they
have relationships like for example
Bernadette and Howard are married their
spouses so so we can see it's a little
bit hard to see there but i'll go ahead
and zoom in and we can see that their
spouses
so as we're creating the concept map if
there are any other relationships even
ones that we haven't specified or knew
of they're going to show up then finally
let's say we want to share this concept
map with someone we can click this link
over here the link icon and then it we
can share the concept map here's a bitly
link i'll go ahead and copy and let's
say i want to share it via twitter so
i'll go ahead and I've composed a tweet
here all I need is the link and then
i'll go ahead and tweet it and so if if
someone then saw that tweet and then
click that link then it would it would
pull up that concept map so i'm going to
go ahead and simulate that i'm going to
be someone that does that so i'm going
to look for the look for the link here
just go into a twitter client so here's
here's my tweet there's the there's the
link so that here's the bitly link so
then it pulls up the concept map
application with the with the
information that I've preserved that I
that was up on the map when I click that
link so that's a easy way than to be
able to create a concept map that you're
trying to maybe teach somebody about
some domain of knowledge that you know
about and then being able to share it
with them either through tweeting it
emailing it or or those kinds of things
so now I go back to the presentation I
want to show you the architecture behind
it this is a at the bottom as an html5
application and it uses several micro
services that are located in
all web services which is a it's a
subscription-based service for hosting
Cloud Foundry pivotal Cloud Foundry so
they're categorized in several different
areas like I've got several web services
that are that service what wiki data
kinds of things so for perhaps if I if I
clicked on a wiki data relationship then
it would use one of those services than
to tell me what's on the other side of
those that relationship or if I needed
the text of wikipedia article I would it
would use one of the services that's in
Wikipedia services or if I need to graph
as you saw in the client it shows a
graph of the different relationships
then it uses graph DB service and then
finally the URL shortener that I did
with the bitly link that uses a short
bit ly service but I've got an edge
service in the cloud icon there that has
just a web service a rest service that
takes my request and then forwards to
the bitly service so each one of those
things in the big cloud in the in the
cloud foundry instance the micro
services that are working there then are
just kind of edge services and they
proxy for where the work really happens
like in the bitly URL service or in the
neo4j DB hosting service or the
wikimedia which is both wikipedia and
wiki data services by the way if you
have any questions as we're going along
please please do feel free to ask so
I'll just go through some some use cases
and as I'm going through the use cases
that you can use for this application
then i'll also be diving into the micro
services that that they use so one would
be
to search for something so in this case
I'm going to go ahead and and clear the
concept map which is this icon here
erase the concept map and then i'm going
to type in moon and so i'll type in moon
I could either drop down to two to see a
choice or I could just hit search or
enter but either way the moon comes up
and I want to pin that to the concept
map and then I'm going to go ahead and
chase a relationship I'm going to chase
the apparent astronomical body
relationship I'm going to but instead of
doing x1 which will just expand it to
one level I'm going to do X star which
expands it to multiple levels so what's
going to happen then is it's going to
chase that relationship all the way up
to where it's it ends whether it were
there is no parent astronomical body so
i'll hit x star and so it chases it from
moon to earth to sun to gala to galactic
center of the Milky Way and so the the
rest services that happen then I won't
go through all of them but when i click
when i click the moon or when i started
typing in moon then it started doing
article search and so when i hit em than
it did an article search and that way it
could populate the drop-down search box
and then when I finally did say yeah I
want moon and and click the search
button then it called the wiki page
endpoint passing the name which was a
moon and then and then it returned that
and then we saw and then we passed that
name to the ID locator and then that
gives us the the wiki data item ID so
all of the Wikipedia articles have a a
wiki data item ID so it instead of a
clear text like moon or airy clapping or
something like that
it's a cue item so Q and some number and
so then we use that then to send it to
related claims and ID claims passing in
the case of Earth it would be q2 in the
moon I I think it's for 22 or something
like that and then that then gets sent
to a wiki data sparkle endpoint which
then returns all the related items for
that particular relationship so that's
kind of that works it's just an
orchestration of a whole bunch of micro
services that are endpoints that you can
use I mean it's all out there running so
you could use them independent of this
application that I've built just in in
other kinds of applications that consume
those things that if you'd like it's all
out there running in pivotal web
services so then a part of the use case
then is pinning the earth to the graph
or pinning something to the graph so I
pinned the the moon to the graph in this
case and when I did that then it called
the graph endpoint or vis graph endpoint
now I've renamed it since since i
created this slide and then passing in
the wiki data queue item numbers
separated by commas and then that gets
passed to the neo4j endpoint neo4j is a
is a graph database but it gets sent to
that and then it does a query brings it
back in Jason and then we display it on
in the in the graph so this is the neo4j
query the language the query language
for neo4j is safer and so this is just
simply that query where we match sending
two items and then where the item in
those three things that we sent and the
item in those three things sent have
something in common and then we we bring
back then the relationship and so once
we have that relationship and the
collection of relationships then we can
feed we can load that that graph that we
see here over on the left that by the
way is implemented by a lot of people
ask me if that's d3 it's not d3i I tried
d3 and then progressed because there
were some there were some things I liked
better in vis jas so the visualization
library amusing over here is is actually
visit j s which is a runs on JavaScript
so i mentioned that i wrote this in java
and spring and i like spring weather i
worked for pivotal or not it springs a
great a great tool kit and a great
facility for being able to quickly stand
up rest services for example there are
annotations for doing that so i can use
this rust controller annotation for
creating a rest controller and then i
can create an endpoint that graph
endpoint by using the annotation request
mapping and then i can associate a
method that search method and then use
the request / am tag to to define what
what parameters are going to be sent to
that end point and then i give it some a
body and the method then to be able to
do the things that needs to do like call
the other services and things and so
it's just incredibly easy with spring to
be able to do that as far as
representing then when you call a rest
endpoint you've got to send it some data
and the instance i showed you they were
gets where we just send in an attribute
or a parameter to the rest service and
then you know comma separated values but
what comes back is jason and so with
spring it's incredibly easy then to
articulate
what's going to come back but you just
use a plain old java object and then it
serializes it automatically over the
wire in to Jason so here is what we're
serializing just the information for
items that are coming back so another
use case then is maybe I want to change
the language so in this case we're using
English so somebody just give me another
language that that you'd like to see
this translate it into danish ok let's
see if let's see if that's one of the
languages here so so Danish tell me if
you see Dean this year yeah there we go
ok so so go ahead and do that then so so
then Jordan manan is it how's that how
that goes ok and so the ones that the
items then that that have an entry in
wiki data translated you know for each
of those language it'll go ahead and
show you the translation if it doesn't
have that then it's going to go ahead
and default to the one that you you had
before you you selected that and so then
here is the wikipedia article and Danish
and notice then the relationships are in
Danish so so that I could just go back
to english so here we go
so another use case would be to share
the link and I've shown you that but
what's happening behind the scenes then
is that we're calling that edge service
it's a rest service whose endpoint name
is bit ly and then we're passing the
items and then giving it the language
and then it's calling the bit ly service
and then returning the link and then
we're showing it in the UI so here's a
another use case a breadth-first search
and I've kind of already showed you that
with the the x1 and the X star but i'll
give you a more of a research scenario
perhaps i'm interested in in causes of
some form of cancer i'll just say
bladder cancer so i'm going to say
bladder cancer and i'm just going to
start to research about that so i'll
click the search there's bladder cancer
over there and maybe i want to know what
the genetic associations are for bladder
cancer so i go here and i click x 1 on
expanding genetic associations and so i
can see that there's these genes
associated with that and so i'm going to
pick on this one PCF or psca and then
now i want to know what chromosomes are
are related to pcs a so i'll go ahead
and click on this relationship the
chromosome and i can see that it is
chromosome number eight so i'll click on
chromosome number eight and i'll pin
that item and that pins it to the graph
and notice that we see this relationship
this chromosome but but now i want to
see all the chromosomes and see how all
the chromosomes are related to all of
the all of the genes that are associated
with bladder cancer so i'm going to
click x star on the followed by
relationship and that will that will do
a breadth-first search
search on until until the end until
there are no more items in that
relationship and so now we have eight
through there actually 22 and then
followed by x and y chromosomes and
while we're at that then we'll go ahead
and click x star on follows so what
chromosomes does chromosome 8 follow so
i'll click that and then we we can see
that well chromosome 8 follows 1 2 3 etc
and we can also see as we zoom back out
here the chromosomes that we put here
that came up here have relationships
with the other genes and so we can see
those in in our concept map and then we
could share that if we want to again if
you have any questions as we're going
through please please do ask or just
ideas or anything ideas for the next
iteration so here's another use case and
that is what do two items have in common
so for example if just a toy example if
I wanted to know what Batman and
Superman had in common I could go to the
concept map erase it and click Batman
and then pin and then I could click I
could type in Superman and then pin
night item so up at the top I have I see
four in common what do these things have
in common and then RP and I'm going to
get into what RP is in a minute that so
I click one of them and i'll hit i see
if we're in common and then i'll click
the other one and so so Superman is
already selected so I'll have in common
with Batman and so now it will call all
those web services that that I showed
you and then we'll return the things
that both of those have in common so
Batman and Superman they were both in
batman vs. superman the dawn of justice
they were both in the Justice League
they were both in Dark Knight Returns
they're both super heroes they're both
male so that's that's a way for any two
particular things like people or any
really any two items that are in
Wikipedia to find out what they have in
common so another scenario then by the
way this is the neo4j cycler query
that's behind that another scenario is
navigate to route so just like objects
and classes in object oriented languages
have a hierarchy class hierarchy the the
items in wiki data are arranged in a
hierarchy and it's not as you know
because it's something that's that
people maintain it's not a perfect
hierarchy and it's not always you know
exactly exactly accurate and so you know
there are there are three kinds of
relationships that we're we're a an item
might have a relationship with an item
above it and one is a subclass of one is
part of and wanted one is instance of
and so in this this use case where we're
chasing the relationships to the root
we're going to chase all three of those
and show all three of those so this is
the these are the queries that are used
or the rest endpoints there's root paths
you give it a queue ID number of a
Wikipedia ID number and then it calls
the neo4j endpoint and then returns the
all of the items that it encountered
when going all the way to the root and
then displays it so I'll go ahead and do
a use case here around an example i'm
going to say 3d chess so there's 3d
chess and i'll pin the item and then
i'll hit RP for root path and so will
find then the three-dimensional chess is
a board game and a board game is a
subclass of tabletop game a tabletop the
gain is a game as a subclass of good but
it's also a subclass of product and if
we chase that from good all the way up
to a physical object which is a subclass
of object which is a subclass of entity
and everything is goes up to entity
that's kind of the root of all the wiki
data items so then here's another or
there's the neo4j cipher query as far as
from a spring perspective to to be able
to make this executable this java spring
application executable it's very simple
actually after your imports we enable
configuration properties and then we
have we tell it v
annotation that this is going to be a
spring boot application spring boot is a
way of being able to quickly put
together an application and it makes
assumptions and opinions so that you can
easily then just write the code that you
want to write and it it makes it very
easily to to be deployed and in one jar
file and that can be sent up to the
cloud so in this case what we do is I've
get wiki browser service application we
just put a main method in it and then we
use spring application run passing it
the class and some arguments and so
that's all there is to it and the
application bill deploy cycle is very
very simple make a code change do a
maven clean install and then do a CF
push CF is again cloud foundry which and
by the way Cloud Foundry runs on top of
of the major infrastructure as a service
provider so Cloud Foundry runs on as
your google cloud platform AWS
on-premise and so it just pretty much
runs anywhere so if you are creating
applications then it's easy to push them
to the cloud using just CF push rather
than having to use and know about all
the infrastructure and AP is of the
different cloud platforms so it kind of
abstracts that for you and so this is
the this is the pivotal web services
console you can go to to run that
pivotal daioh and and get a subscription
I think it's 60 days for free or
something if you just want to play with
it it's a really nice way of being able
to to create applications and put them
out there for the world to see and to
use and it's a very very inexpensive
subscription cost you know for you know
hardcore production applications
corporate you know corporations will buy
subscriptions to run on pram or or on
their cloud providers but it's an easy
way for you and you and I to to be able
to go in and just put our applications
out there in the world and to get
started with spring to create a new
spring application the place to go then
is start down spring Gotye oh and you
can make choices for your application
like does it need to be is it going to
be a rest service does it need does it
need to us bring data things like that
and so you can make those choices and
then it gives you a starter project to
be able to put code into so the last use
case that I want to show you is is
called degrees of separation so since
you know wikipedia has you know millions
and millions of particles in it and wiki
data a course has millions of millions
as well because there's one there's one
item for every Wikipedia article so some
of those items are our sports figures
and actor actors actresses so we can
play then this degrees of separation
game like the Kevin Bacon game either
with and by the way we could do it with
sports figures or or actors so which
would you rather do would you would you
rather play it with actors or sports
figures as we punch in a couple and find
out how they're related so actors actors
I think i heard actors so so somebody
give me please the name of an actor Tom
Hanks ok this is going to be an easy one
right so somebody has to now give me the
name of someone that's as far away were
removed from Tom Hanks's you can think
of so that we can see
kind of a long relationship Buster
Keaton okay very good so we'll type in
Buster Keaton and we'll pin that item
and so the relationship we want to chase
their from Buster Keaton to Tom Hanks is
actually a reverse relationship cast
member so what you know so what movie or
show or whatever was Buster Keaton a
cast member in that is in common with
Tom Hanks or or another actor that that
is related through some some show or
movie so that's a if you think about
that relationship it's an undirected
relationship because it goes from from a
person for actor to a show to a person
to a show so it's it's it can be one way
and then the other so we call that an
undirected relationship so we're going
to find the shortest path between those
two actors in an undirected manner
through cast member so to do that we've
selected Buster and and I'm going to
click the icon that's labeled P you
which means shortest path undirected so
I'll click that and I'll click Tom Hanks
and then we'll find out how they're
related going through all those those
rest api's and things that that I've
already showed you so it turns up is
pretty short actually Tom Hanks was in
with Harry Dean Stanton in The Green
Mile who was in The Adventures of
Huckleberry Finn with Buster Keaton okay
all right so that's about the end of my
presentation actually
yeah so any questions on that any ideas
for future iterations any any parting
thoughts before I before I let you go
yes okay
okay so the question is that the request
is I'd like to be able to get to a city
you know but from another city by
transferring between you know to find
out and so I don't know the i don't i
don't know offhand and don't want to
speculate right now you know in you know
in tempting demo gods but i do have a
very similar scenario and that would be
i know that there is a relationship
between countries and states and things
like that and so let's say that we
wanted to get from California to Florida
crossing state lines right and so then
that's another that's another undirected
relationship because because we're well
is it I don't know let's see okay so
let's let's actually look here so I'm
going to go here and we're going to let
start in Florida for example and this
Florida will pin that item whoops good
item again we'll get let's give it a
Buster here so on pin buster and then
select Florida and then we'll go to
California
pin that let's look at this look for a
relationship so this California and
shares border with okay so let's do an
undirected relationship between
California and Florida on shares border
with so here we go p you in Florida so
it's not going to be the shortest path
through the database through those
states not necessarily the for shortest
path geographically your mileage
literally may vary right so here we've
got to California Arizona New Mexico etc
so that's that's kind of a scenario you
talked about okay good other questions
sorry yes yes okay so the question is
how is wiki data maintained and you know
that's a so it's populated by lots of
data dumps for example to prime the pump
I guess for so there was a project
called freebase many of you may have
heard of it and it was it was this idea
of having an open database of items and
entities and you know a musical artists
and you know geograph geography and all
sorts of kind all sorts of things and so
then google bought that and and then
they see like like the used part of that
they used the idea for their knowledge
graph and so a lot of the things in a
knowledge graph was was populated by my
free base and then the all the data in
freebase then was was given to wiki data
so it was populated than so wiki data
was in part populated by that but also
populated by lots of other data dumps
everywhere and so it's very much a it's
an orchestrated process but orchestrated
by humans getting dumps from
in places so there are some areas where
it's very very good very accurate like
for example in the in the actors and
movies and things like that there are
some areas where it's not yet so so
accurate so one enhancement I'd like to
make is is to is to also look at dbpedia
dbpedia is a site that has relationships
between Wikipedia and the way that the
dbpedia was populated was by the info
boxes in Wikipedia so it would crawl the
it would crawl the info boxes and
populate the database so the things it's
kind of the out of sight out of mind but
if you know if if something is in front
of people then it's going to be kept
more accurate so the wikipedia info
boxes are kept very up-to-date and
accurate dbpedia crawls those and keeps
that very accurate so so one
announcement I'd like to make is is also
use dbpedia as well as we could be wiki
data to provide the semantic
relationships so someday when wicked
Winky data is is more mature and
accurate then and and actually it's
happening now where the info boxes are
actually populated by wiki data so it's
the it's the way actually should be kind
of to where the info boxes are
data-driven and so there's this there's
this evolution that's happening where it
will get more and more accurate and you
know one as one feed to the other a
long-winded answer to a question I trust
that you were interested in the answer
okay other other questions okay very
good thank you very much for your
attention
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
