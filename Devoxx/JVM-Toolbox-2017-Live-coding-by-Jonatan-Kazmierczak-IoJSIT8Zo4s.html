2017 choose the right jvm language for
the right task my name is jonathan
cosmetic I work as a senior consultant
for Trivedi in Switzerland with easy
talent we have such views nice views
which we can which we can see here a few
more information about me a part of the
fact that I like the Swiss views i'm
creator of cat visualizer useful tool
for Java developers wanted to ask who
knows cause visualize that maybe you can
erase please your hand okay at least one
person that's that's great that grater
and it's really nice because actually
London is from London I have second
biggest amount of downloads of cat
visualizer
so maybe the community is not in this
robot is that that's nice let's see more
information the one which I'm quite
happy about is that I'm first rank in
Java on hacker rank
maybe somebody also is ranked on hacker
rank here in this room you can raise
your hand at least one person that's
great good so let's come to to the
details already agenda as you can see I
don't want to bore you with with slides
and such things the main part is lights
coding three tasks calculation JSON
processing text template processing
that's what we are going to work on and
I assume that I have great audience of
hackers so everybody will follow at the
at the bottom and the footer you can see
the value github link which is related
to this presentation you can download
all the or get all the code which will
be written here let's start with
introduction
what are we going to use during this
session of course tools which which are
related to the I expected it to be
ordered irrelevant now but the time is
shifting of Java 9 so will be more
relevant probably next year but still
Java 9 is here
Scala 212 groovy to 4n JavaScript my
JavaScript we understand
Eggman script 2015 or year 6 running on
mascot Engine Java 9 and the tools will
combine together into one Swiss Army
knife with help of Gradle and you may
ask a question why at all should I use
more than one language or more than one
tool so let's assume that your favorite
tool which represents one of the
programming languages is a knife you can
do a lot of things very good things with
the knife and at once one day you
receive a bottle of wine let's assume is
Swiss wine go to red wine and of course
you can try to open it with the knife
but I don't know how well you will
succeed but you can also take that the
dedicated tool for that task and the
wine opener but you also don't need to
carry all of those 4 tools with you in
that form it would be not so convenient
for that reason we have in real life
solutions like that with army knives and
the time exactly is with the programming
languages you don't need to use
full-blown stock many times you just can
have with help of Gradle one stock and
you just use other language than your
favorite one for the functionality which
is difficult to achieve and in the
moment you'll see such examples now team
tools are important team is also
important we work in scrum so product
owners come master of course and we have
a bunch of developers Java developers
color Ruby and JavaScript developers and
yeah
I hope the audience here you present all
of those four groups I hope
great now time to start our tasks first
calculation we want to implement a
function returning result of
multiplication of two numerical values
let's think for a moment about what is
about that what is behind this innocent
statement two numerical values it can be
anything write integral values decimal
values big small then of course we don't
want to lose any precision at any point
of the time good so it's time to start
some coding in order to start I will
start group of my favorite IDE s J shell
is a nice IDE introduced in Java 9 I
really like it then
Scala groovy as you see every of them is
working on trouble 9 usually mark
somewhere here the same about groovy and
the same with JavaScript in case of
JavaScript shall we have to say
explicitly here that we use language es6
otherwise would be a little bit back in
history so if we want to implement our
multiplication in Java and probably we
will choose bigdecimal
as the result because it's safe enough
good as you see we have Auto completion
even here so big decimal mode as well my
multiplication and what can come as a
parameter the task side any two
numerical values okay any number so we
have number and now we will return our
result
I have to convert those two numbers to
big decimals but now if I'm thinking
about big decimal and the constructors
with decimal has many useful
constructors nearly from any numerical
type except the generic one number so I
have to use a workaround already first
one let's say I make to think okay I
will transform number two strings from
strings I will make big decimal a little
bit yes overhead but will work then
multiply and then another big decimal
and the same thing and if we look into
this code I just want to do simple
things I want to multiply two values but
I already wrote so long code it doesn't
fit into one line anyway the font is big
and it's not very obvious what is going
on if you see that code and it's even
more difficult to analyze it if you have
more mathematical operations so the code
is like right once and then don't do
anything with that
the code is not really maintainable but
the function is great great if we look
into the same task in Scala we can write
it as false
Scala has also type big decimal and also
Auto completion which doesn't work even
in this moment no that is my fault
actually
I forgot that is a syntax coming from
Pascal originally now we have it right
big decimal and now I don't
yes I need big decimal but why I'm
putting the decimal I may have any
numerical type the reason for that is
that in Scala we have so called implicit
conversions
which means that during compilation of
my invocation of the method I will or
compiler will transform any numerical
type into big decimal so I don't need to
worry what is important will be
converted properly and I say just I
multiplied maybe look simple right
you can notice here that we have also
big decimal but is different big decimal
than in China its column advocacy in
groovy I would write something I mean I
will use the same types as in Java
because groovy generally use the same
type and I can say the same number a
number B here I can do the following I
can use big decimal not one which is
which represents value one obviously
then I say x a multiplied by B what
happens on here why can I do like that
what is nice about groovy is that groovy
does a conversions of the types which
actually takes place at runtime but it
can do quite advanced progress
conversions I mean a little bit more
advanced than than Java itself so here
at runtime
groovy takes this big decimal so knows
already that the result will be decimal
then take the number a check the type
makes conversions to big decimal applies
the method which is behind and so then
in fact the result or the which classes
are used in which methods is the same as
in Java just we have one more
multiplication here but the way how we
express it in code is from my point of
view much more readable I hope agree
with me and then in JavaScript in
JavaScript
unfortunately we too
have too much of auto completion and
maybe the reason is that we don't have
clearly defined types so maybe it's
difficult to to achieve that but of this
we can write a piece of code so let's
test our solution yes
few test cases let's start with with
very simple 1 4 4 x 0.25 1 in Java in
Scala as well it will be 1 in JavaScript
once well the results as expected let's
take something bigger now some long
value in Java result is as expected I
would like to draw your attention to
this digit 1 at the end that we have
called the precision in Scala
what happened my one disappeared in
Scala
I am losing precision ordered a big
decimal in Stella is 128-bit big decimal
or double which means can hold up to 34
tickets and I guess more unfortunately
grooving in groovy actually I don't need
this L Y at all I have to put L it's
rubbish right doesn't make any sense
I want numbers and groovy knows what is
the type what I really like about about
groovy is that you can write any
numerical detail by the way the decimal
details like 0.25 they are internally
compiled as a big decimal so you don't
you don't have doubles by default you
can achieve them but by default literals
are big business and any repeater out
groovy checks into what type does it fit
so I can make a number a little bit
bigger and groovy determines that this
is a big integer and
makes a proper dropping of the number I
like and in JavaScript we also don't
have this l and here we have even we
lost even more because in JavaScript
every number is equivalent to 64-bit
doubles of Java which means that we have
we can get 15 digits of precision right
and now what happens if I'm trying to do
something what doesn't make sense
something incorrect I'm trying to
multiply one by a in Java I cannot this
car character in Scala 97 yeah in groovy
also I cannot do that it's not expected
type and in Java speed not a number
which is also a corrective good we
played a little bit with the with the
multiplication in various languages now
let's take a look about the performance
what is the execution time in
milliseconds Java is winning definitely
the groovy is a little bit slower three
times slower than Java Scala is five
times slower and then JavaScript
significantly significantly slower but
what is also may be worth to mention
about this multiplication of numbers
that in case of JavaScript and groovy
the mathematical operations can be done
at runtime so can be even fully
evaluated at runtime which is quite
useful if you want to implement
calculator actually yesterday at least
one speaker tried to implement
calculator and she suffered a lot during
the session F in JavaScript you have it
for free and actually MIT which means in
Java because yes the that's one engine
is in place
now something more advanced JSON
processing we need a function which
takes the specified JSON with list of
countries and results list containing
values of the name property maybe is a
little complicated text but let's look
into example we have objects
representing countries and we have the
outcome let's try to implement this
functionality when I'm looking into Java
and its standard library I must say it's
not good I didn't find any JSON
processing functionality in Java
standard library in Scala we have
something I just have to import the
right class a little bit hidden but is
there let's make some space and okay so
our function I will call it C names
country names to make it clear it'll
make it short jason of type string and
actually i can here explicitly define
the type so maybe you noticed in the
previous example in java
I didn't say what would be a returning
type Scala insert the tag properly here
I may do some mistake potentially so
better if I say explicitly that is a
list of strings and then another
implementation
so Jason purseful than my Jason and now
this is yes please aha Hey
yes that's actually not okay yeah we can
make it very very good point thank you
for for saying that
something like that is okay or okay
great thank you very much once again so
here we have something what is called
optional text also in Java so I have to
extract the content of my optional and
then if I look here what is possible
what I can do with this optional and
then I cannot do much and the reason for
that is that it returns me I type any
which is equivalent of object in Java
actually I lost the after this objection
I lost the content so maybe I will need
to to do it again yes actually I know it
is bigger than the screen Saturday but
the reason of course to not not work
that way
and now it's kids quick so I should have
the history good and the function itself
again Jason of type string good and now
Jason parks full my Jason and get the
optional then our instance off and I
have to say explicitly what I have here
so type any it's not useful like object
interval we cannot do match so I have to
say that this is list what I have as an
input inside I have object so it will be
mapped and the map has property names
and the values then it will be string as
property name and any other value
because we may have six numbers arise
and so then now I say okay we know I
forgotten it but then now I say okay
let's map it to something more useful
and I say okay C is my country
then let's map it to to the name of the
the value of name of the country which I
am getting from the map but at this
particular moment I have a tip any which
is not so useful so I have to cut it
again to string I can do it again this
fancy I think stuff off but I can do a
some trick to see where I can say to
string so compiler will now know that is
a string type okay except that we have a
function defined in Ruby we can write it
as okay but maybe before jumping to
groovy I will actually do it in Java
speed may be more interesting we have
still this color implementation in mind
and we will make it in jealous
it carries our JSON we don't define the
type because we don't have such feature
in JavaScript here I say json.parse JSON
and here I say map here is my country
and I map it to see dot name if you look
into that the code is pretty much
similar to the code written in scala the
difference is that I don't have this
fixed type overhead and in case of
dealing with Jason I saw quite a lot of
such code it's really pain if you have
every time say what exactly is the type
of this value Jason was not in
JavaScript because actually is coming
from JavaScript was not meant for
further together specific types always
defined and then we can do the same in
grooving we expect a list of strings we
have our tracing actually now first I
have to import class
okay Jason slot 4 is in place so my
function maybe you also notice that in
groovy I don't write a written statement
statement I can write it if I want to
have overhead I don't like so new
instance of JSON slurper then parse text
my JSON and here I have a function
similar to the map in in JavaScript and
in Scala but is called collect sorry ah
thank you very much you are following
the typing thank you very much for that
collect okay and we say see to see the
name so what are we doing here we have
some structure which we don't say X
basically what structure is that after
this parsing of JSON and the collect
method is supposed to be run on some
collection which can be directed so app
runtime actually is the tell me we have
collection ok we have then let's iterate
and do mappings on the elements and
again this is C and I say C dot name and
what is nice but sometimes may be
confusing for somebody this C dot name
can mean either property or in our case
is a I'm referencing a map so it's a
value of the key represented by name and
but I personally like it I can write
very compact code and groovy does the
heavy job
me tries to find to make a proper proper
classification of the objects and use
the proper methods behind it seems to
fetch the proper value the code is
compact and actually self explaining yes
I want to get the name of my country see
so let's test now the implementations a
by the way in case of Java is so you are
interested about how it can be done then
to the questions please ask about it
but unfortunately I cannot do it in the
in the shell and that's actually goal of
this of the start here is my test case
Scala talking we have a proper result
please note that here in Scala I miss
triple double quote and it allows me to
use freely double quotes inside in Scala
unfortunately I saw the in Java
unfortunately until version 9 I cannot
do that you have to use those back
slashes improving the same it's ok it's
accepted in groovy I can also use
alternative syntax let's make some space
with single quad and actually I can mix
single and double quotes they are
slightly different but generally in this
case we can assume that it's the same
and what also maybe we can mention that
here is my map so in in groovy I don't
need to knock sorry I'm going already to
fight the next example notice this is
jason lab so it's a fine addition list
and then Jason Mott and JavaScript of
course Jason is a native citizen of
JavaScript we have a result of expected
now maybe we are interested in
performance here we are
anybody surprised about what we see here
I was surprised when I collected the
statistics so Java with JSONP I used
Agent P because is part of Java 87 very
good performance actually groovy
surprised me a lot in this case because
we have pretty much the same performance
as in Java and groovy is fully in this
particular context is fully dynamic it
does dynamic determination of the of the
types so it shows that having everything
fully specifically types doesn't give us
in some cases any value actually only
overhead and maintenance problems
javascript is also not bad is it twice
slower as groovy and Java but I would
say it's fully okay so using javascript
from Java so fine and then Scala I would
say this surprised me from curiosity
anybody tries to do a different thing is
come nobody that's good great okay so we
can move to the third task text template
processing we need a function returning
defined email template field in which
provided data both the text as well as
the data must be easy to change and for
to extend and here is our example of the
email we have few placeholders and we
will want to just get a nice version of
the email with the values replaced so we
can try to coat the solution
and actually things we have here some
more text to write i have already some
prepared versions which i will copy and
we will discuss them so and yeah here is
another great feature of objects and
actually java scripts all the same that
at some version of java 9 it started to
be limited to two lines i don't know why
but i cannot type more than or copy and
paste more than two lines so I need to
compact everything to fit into two lines
so I get a map of string key which is
the variable and the value and I'm using
string format in Java I have this
function I can use it and here I'm using
the some placeholders and when I look
into that or actually maybe if when you
look into that then you see some percent
F some percent N and also hear something
so it's not very obvious already from
this template what we will have what
what value will go there and then we
have bunch of parameters when we extract
the values but even here with three
parameters is not safe all right but
assuming you have more more parameters
then also not so maintainable not easy
to understand not at least correct in
case of Scala we can do it a little bit
differently
in Scala I have the same map string to
think but I have something like s prefix
with triple double quotes and this
allows me now to to embed such snippets
so actually the the dollar end and curly
bracket says that this is some
expression and this expression is then
processed at compile time so the wall
string is broken down into the string
concatenation and function and the code
snippets execution method invocations
and so on but at least for us as a
developer it's easy to write and easy to
see actually what will come here as my
hero Network oh good now in groovy
actually something similar
he had left left stands for 4-letter
hands arsenic leather and also maps into
string triple quotes just we don't need
any prefects here I can also mask a
newline character and here is my text
but please note how I can refer to the
objects and data values the GUI has
quite advanced here and processing of
expressions and what is also worth to
mention that is the processing of the of
the text takes place at runtime so we
have very big flexibility here and in
case of JavaScript yes I would like to
write it and actually it's valid this
code is is fully valid I would like to
write it like that and this is fine also
new line map masking and new lines in
the text but unfortunately because of
limit current limitation of of
JavaScript shell I have to pack
everything into two lines so I have a
little bit less nice for some ugly
version but at least fit into the
limitations here and so just the
difference is that new lines I'm using
the explicit speculation character and
that's the way how I am refer as
differencing the values from my maps
object in JavaScript which I pass cube
ok and now let's see how this thing
works so you may notice that actually
here I have dollar and curly bracket the
same as in Scala actually groovy has
Ruby except the same thing I just didn't
use it but you can write it and here I
refer here to the map and the key now
let's try to invoke our functionalities
I will provide a map of values and keys
and values which will be replaced in our
template in case of Java since we are in
Java 9 I can use a new new factory
method which I must say I like finally
finally finally at last I can create my
map in one line Wow - any rate to wait
20 years forward and that's really fine
I like the the stuff but now let's
assume that we have a little bit bigger
map come here and then I'm taking a look
and I see maybe those two values next to
each other and I may be confused I may
think okay is it my key with my value or
I'm taking all of the value from
something else and then key from
something else
so what is the key what is the value is
is not really clear in that case so
still some room to improvement I don't
know if if Java 9 architect is here but
if it is then yeah maybe we can still do
something about it
but at least we have a good result here
is our hero name in case of scholar we
have something similar
map and here I can specify what is my
key what is my value so each time I see
some two strings next to each other I
always know which one is key which one
is why and works as well as here this
over here in a case of Ruby I have some
other possibility to express my map I'm
saying just like this this is my map
actually this can send also for the list
so then you have to look what is what is
after if you have only values then it
will be list but if you have something
like this key colon value then means
it's map and what also is nice here I
can skip my double quotes why I thought
I should always put double quotes
overhead and the result is here however
if I know that you are following very
precisely there is the code and here you
see that there is empty line but we
don't see this empty line here yes
that's a feature which I don't fully
understand but for some reason in those
particular texts
groovy has many more advanced templating
functionalities but I'm using that the
simplest one the simple one for some
reason is ignorant empty lines I don't
know and JavaScript in javascript is
actually the invocation is very similar
to the one which we saw before moment
including just different different map
indicate actually it's object here but
is equivalent to map and the same key or
property name and the value and here we
are with our hero
and yeah we have it implemented so maybe
we want to see what are the performance
statistics okay
what's happened here Java which
everything is compiled determined very
simple oh its lowest and groovy which
determines everything at runtime gives
you full flexibility don't out to be the
fastest it was also surprised for me
honestly and the you may notice that
there is no JavaScript here on this
diagram and that's very unfortunate but
why we will discover in the moment it is
related a little bit to to gradual M
Java 9 so now let's combine our
solutions together we call it four
different funky different
functionalities in four different
languages now we probably want to do
some use of them so we can build
actually the project obviously with help
of god--all and here we have a link to
some issue yes this issue is related to
two Grado on Java 9 if we try to run it
today
it fails is it good or bad
yes Java 9 is still not officially
released so yes our gadelle colleagues
still have some time to to make it yeah
I'm sure they will be on time and what
is the structure of our project we have
a build cuddle will definition then our
sources under SRC mine and then you can
see we have one directory per language
and then Java scripts we put in two
resources because it's not processed in
any special way
that's quite I would say simple now
let's take a look into the build Gradle
inside the file I would say is also
simple as a build definition right we
just apply plugins we say I
Travie I want groovy I want color and
repository and dependencies mmm in case
for groovy if you decide to use it but
it's always add this indie classifier
unless you are working with Java
prevention 7 or early version 7 early
builds but I'm sure you are not using it
Libby installed version 7 because in the
users involved I Namek so it it's really
a difference in performance and here the
plus says that always we take the the
newest version the subversion and that's
enough actually to have my build valid
unfortunately when I execute it on Java
9 it fails and that's the reason why I
couldn't show you perform a statistical
egg mask it 6 because I was running it
on Java 8 and the support for es6 was
not yet so good in times of Java 8 let's
summarize now the information okay here
we are we have some now colors we were
in mono chromatic mode for some time but
now we have some color so we can see it
flexibility versus safety and the red
means lowest Wars and green means
excellent actually in Java scripts you
can do everything maybe sometimes more
than you would like to do and here you
see the stages in the meantime but if
you compare these safety you can see
that they are actually opposed to each
other yes so this is a healthy sort of
danger zone if we would like to make
full application only is in a Java speak
so probably we don't have ideal language
here which is the vector case and we may
want to mix them together and have the
interoperability and here is another
Mattox which can be interesting we can
see here that Java and groovy they are
fully interoperable
yes the green one yellow means that it's
quite okay maybe with some some few
minor additions but that is okay but
here it's already a little bit more
difficult if you would like to invoke
for example Scala from Java or
JavaScript from Java then you have to do
a few additional steps and actually they
if you take the code from from the
Aleppo here then I'm showing actually
this path because I think is the most
relevant one that there are unit tests
with an in Java which are invoking each
of those functionalities so you could
see what it's required to do if you want
for example to use scholar from Java or
JavaScript from Java it's possible mark
in orange and then that is some summary
also of the languages which I didn't
want to choose so many points so maximum
to the a maximum 3 points of pros and
cons we can clearly see that there is no
ideal language we will come to that
slide in the moment I just will move to
the next one and in the moment this one
is coming back I would like now to
encourage you to ask questions the
questions time and feel free to ask
about anything what you saw or you think
is relevant but during Question times we
will have this pros and cons so you will
have time to read it yes that is first
question here you are
maybe please wait for the microphone
will be helpful so other thing was
immediately obvious but in the case of
the maps for example those aren't the
same map types although I mean scholars
got its own collections library ok so
your question is if the map type used in
those examples is exactly the same or
they are different types yes it's very
good question thank you and they are
different so the map used in let me
actually jump to this
Java and Ruby use exactly the same map
so I mean Java creates actually some
immutable implementation of a map
interface but anyway if it implements
mapping desert groovy by D by default
with this syntax uses link adjustment so
they are fully interoperable Scala has
own map so if you download the code you
see that I have to do some mapping to
Java map in case of JavaScript a in Kay
and groovy groovy Maps JavaScript object
to Java map ultimate to linkage of state
liquor cosmo so the conversion is done
automatically but it's not like that if
you use the code in Java it collects a
different map so it doesn't answer your
question yeah thank you okay
please next question oh no questions now
there is of course why was Scala so much
slower on the checks interesting
could you please leave it I didn't get
exactly your why with scholar so much
slower okay let's move to the to the
relevant slides I think it is also
interesting question I have my
impression but but don't please don't
take it really as a as a final truth my
impression is that this library uses
immutable types which means that in case
of Maps if you add a new key and value
to map it recreates the object and since
the list of countries was quite quite
big the objects had I think tens of
properties and the list was also quite
big then I would assume that during
processing all the objects were
continuously created and this of course
takes time I I noticed a big difference
in in time execution of Java code when
you use immutable collections versus
mutable ones in case if you have to to
change the contents
so I that's my guess and not that there
is one behind but for sure I I don't
know maybe somebody knows the audience
okay and yeah so I I think that's that
that may be the reason okay next
question yes we have here please
how did she do the performance test
perform at that age a unit and sample
size stop with that
sorry sample size how many data you
process and okay we actually can take a
look into the the code is not any secret
maybe the screen will be a little bit
small but so the tests have written as
follows this those are some definitions
generally I was avoiding a construction
of the of the things which are time
consuming within tests so for example I
have here is my collection of time and
in in it actually I create already I pre
load all the the data which are required
I'm creating Xmas script JavaScript
engine and then I have my warm-up method
and what up method is executing all the
functionalities to make sure that all
the classes are loaded or the the
methods are resolved and so on and so it
really goes to all the functionalities
will dip with the values which I'm using
and then I do the real test after that
so that gives me quite good confidence
that the the values which I'm collecting
the the metrics are relevant that's does
it answer your question or or you would
like to add something to that because it
may be also valuable yeah please
microphone I mean the the TVM does some
optimizations if you run it more often
and buy more often I mean like way more
often like ten thousand times or so then
it would be much even faster yes you are
right with that and ready yes native
compilation by default this is ten times
ten thousand times I could tune the
number I didn't do that and because that
was not not also the topics to show or
not there it was my intention to show
how is the execution time when they when
the code is is compiled and in mind so
of course you can play with the with the
test they for that isn't they are
available and the statistics will be
printed at the end so you can see on
example this world up function grew up
into some for-loop and maybe we will get
slightly different values anyway
I wouldn't expect the proportions to be
such different however with javis tip is
a little bit different story because the
bytecode is generated every time during
execution so it cannot be optimized as
well as the the other languages I hope
it answers the question ok thank you
next question I'm looking I don't see
any any questions ah there is great you
are these small tests are very
informative but how is this working in
heavier production environments where
you have do you have experience working
in teams with multiple languages on the
same codes Wapping between functionality
I mean in the case of the template
language example you or the template
thing this you know you wouldn't you use
free marker or some other templating
library so it's kind of where it where
do you see these pros and cons actually
playing out yes thank you for the
question is this very good to be able to
build web those multilingual or polyglot
solutions are applicable in in real life
why for example we don't use libraries
which exist I assume you refer to Java
is at the main language but ok so of
course I'm working mainly in Java
environment and the thing is that in
most of the projects which I am working
and which are in development phase every
day I see additional libraries added to
the project external libraries so tens
of libraries from different origins
different quality different sources a
different stage of in the level of life
some of them are already dead and not
no more maintains exiting the project
and from maintenance point of view of
the project is really big pain it may be
okay for creation of the software but
not after several months and even worse
several years of application lifetime so
they do Treves onto at another language
is to have well maintained
functionalities so for example groovy at
a lot of libraries but they are really
well tested and they are in one package
so it's not our job to maintain those
dependencies to make sure that they are
all ok or maybe they have some we have
some conflict everything is already
maintained by somebody else and this is
the reason why we would we can decide to
use another language and now from the
mental ability point of view and so how
it looks like in real life I didn't meet
many projects which use more than one
language and I participated in some
grave projects and then in Grace Java
and groovy can be used and I would say
it's a normal thing
so everything what is groovy base you
keep petting your mother's you mix those
two things in other combinations I heard
about some scholar projects but not my
personal experience but my colleagues
they were saying that and ok they
usually met some limitations at the end
they needed some additional libraries
then they were adding scholar library
and solid Java library and then from
Java library using Scala is fully ok
with the other way around is more
difficult and so I would say typically
companies want to until now we're mainly
using one language solution or one
language plus Java so scallop or Java or
Ruby path Java more than that I didn't
met but I think this should actually
change and I would say two languages is
it makes sense actually from the spoken
languages in Switzerland we speak four
languages so
moved evening positions and somehow
natural for the mostly these people yes
in in in UK you have one language so
maybe let's not wrong yeah does it
answer your question okay
you're welcome it just to mention our
time is finished but if we have more
questions than please add it otherwise
we will conclude no more questions so
thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
