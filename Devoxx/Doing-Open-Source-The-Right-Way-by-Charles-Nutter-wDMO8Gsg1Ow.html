a little bit but we'll get going they'll
they'll get here eventually and catch up
today I'm going to want to talk through
some tips and tricks I've learned over
the years been doing open source full
time as my job for about nine years now
worked on a number of different projects
hopefully help you get more involved
help you be a good open source
contributor and maybe help you get some
of your own code out there someday too
I'm Charles nutter I've been working for
past nine years on JRuby and other
related projects first stuff at Sun
Microsystems for about three years and
then at Engine Yard for a few years and
then since 2012 I've been at Red Hat as
part of the polyglot R&amp;amp;D group we do a
lot of interesting little projects I'll
talk about some of those later so who
are you this is obviously developers
here it's a Java conference you probably
do some stuff with Java you're in the
Java world so you're obviously all using
open source in some capacity even if
you're just using openjdk itself but
probably a large portion of the stack
you use and a lot of libraries you use
are also open source maybe some of your
contributors how many people have ever
filed a bug on an open source project
okay it's not everybody surprisingly but
but most of the room that one's that
one's pretty good how about folks that
have actually sent in a patch to an open
source project now hands start to get
less anybody that's open source to
project of their own or run a project
okay pretty good pretty good this is a
little higher than some other groups
that I've seen some other types of some
of the technology world's have higher
lower numbers Ruby folks are all working
an open source microsoft and dotnet
folks a little bit less although they're
starting to get there so first of all
we'll talk a little bit about like what
it is that is actually makes up open
source there's several definitions out
there and generally what we talk but
we're talking about here is open source
software of course if you go to the
Wikipedia definition you'll see things
like study change distribute software
for to anyone for any purpose basically
the source is out there and it's
available you can use it you can modify
it and you can pass it on to other
people but it's also another
that's used a lot free software which
distinguishing between the two the
people that have come up with these
individual terms are very adamant that
they're not the same thing but if you
look at the free software definition on
wikipedia its study change distribute
the software to anyone again largely the
same definitions but also includes
running the software for any purpose so
being able to use the software as well
as having access to the source being
able to redistribute it and so what
we're generally going to be talking
about here is the combined world free
and open source software Foss as it's
often abbreviated and again the
Wikipedia definition kind of combines
these two worlds but the key points here
are it's it's software that's classified
as both free software and open source so
it's freely licensed which means that
the license doesn't put restrictions on
how you pass on the source how you use
the project you can use copy study and
change the software in anyways you want
the source code is openly shared it's
not something you have to go find it's
part of the project it's it's generally
distributed with the binaries of the
project or available online somewhere
and the bottom line here for this talk
is that people are encouraged to
voluntarily help improve the design of
the software so open source has to have
a large pool of people voluntarily
contributing time contributing effort
and working on open source all the time
so some of the benefits of open source
in general a lot of people say that you
have cost savings so you don't need to
pop by a piece of software you can just
go out and download a tarball download
some source and that sometimes can be a
benefit but you also on your own there's
going to be things that you're going to
have to figure out on your own you're
not going to have often a nice installer
you're not going to have some the same
support channels so sometimes the cost
benefits are softened a little bit let's
see here okay the visibility into the
project obviously you can see what
you're running you can look into the
code you can debug into the code all of
these things are benefits and especially
with OpenJDK now if you need to step
through into Java code it's almost
always available you can walk right into
it and see what's actually happening
the covers more importantly you're
empowered to make changes if the
organization that distributes some piece
of software it goes away you can still
make changes to it you can improve the
software on your own again voluntarily
improving the software for the good of
everybody and commercial support is
optional you buy a commercial office
off-the-shelf product you have to pay
someone you're paying someone to give
you that software and to give you
guarantees about it with open source you
can kind of try things out play with it
a little bit more easily get into it at
your own pace you don't necessarily have
to buy into something from day 0 and
probably the most exciting thing about
this is that open source really is
winning over the past 10 20 years more
and more developers have started to put
source out in public and open more and
more projects have began been opening up
and the the ecosystem has grown to be
the large pool of software it's no
longer mostly closed source out there
it's mostly open source that's being
used in the real world and some obvious
wins well I work for red hat so I have
to put red hat up here a company that's
based entirely off of supporting
open-source you pay for subscription
support from open from Red Hat you get
support for everything that's in the Red
Hat stack or everything in the jboss
wildfly stack and it's actually worked
out as a very successful model probably
the most successful company based
entirely off of open source support of
course there's lots of other projects
out there just this is a section of the
page from open hub net which monitors
open source projects commits overtime
contributors overtime basically the
health of project you can see a couple
of the browser's across the top there
firefox chrome and so on the Linux
kernel itself is in here languages PHP
is in there my sequel open source
database you can see kind of that
there's lots of folks out there you can
see the big projects that are in open
source and speaking specifically about
browsers you can see the the steady
trend of Internet Explorer a closed
source and rather cumbersome and
problematic software in the past slowly
going down and being overtaken by all
the open-source options we have our
Firefox we have Chrome
as the top two as the top ones chrome
most recently really overtaking this and
you can see this is a contributors per
month for chrome over time from 2009
until the present steady increase of
people actually contributing to the
project now this isn't necessarily that
Google is pouring more resources into it
it's that people like you are getting
involved in helping to continue make
chrome a better project and this extends
to larger areas this is a graph of super
computing platforms over the years linux
basically unheard of before 1999 has now
massively taken over this area so this
isn't just for served web servers this
isn't just for little applications this
is doing real work and the bulk of the
real work out there in the
supercomputing world of course web
servers a lot of folks here doing web
development linux is still way out there
is the the top deployment platform
windows as maybe a quarter of the
platform out there based on most
measurements and then because of this
fact the fact that open source is
winning even companies that were
traditionally hostile to open source
have now started to turn around
microsoft recently open sourcing a whole
bunch of the.net platform and putting it
right on github with everything else
that's out there now fitting into the
open source world realizing that this is
how they're going to get people involved
this is how they're going to have their
software continue to be successful and
that there's a lot of people who just
won't use it unless it is actually open
source and out there available so this
talk is going to focus on the fact that
with all this cool stuff going on the
successes that we've had over the years
open source still really needs folks
like you to get involved everybody in
here should be doing something to help
their favorite open source project try
and walk you through a few ways that you
can contribute things that you can do to
help projects move forward and be
successful alright so getting started
for folks that have not done a whole lot
of open source work before have not been
involved in projects first off why would
you want to do this you're going to take
some time why would you voluntarily try
to contribute your time and effort to a
project well it's obviously a huge
learning opportunity depending on what
you're going to work on you're going to
learn more than you ever did at
university about software about putting
these systems together about
language design about databases and
optimization this is the biggest thing
I've gotten out at it's been incredible
learning opportunity for me to work on
open source for nine years it's a huge
resume builder for anybody out there
that is you know wants to keep their
resume up-to-date wants to be able to
look for new positions having your
contributions out there in the public in
open source projects is a great way to
get folks interested I get emails from
recruiters all the time that know
nothing about me except that I've got a
lot of contributions on github and there
they've got opportunities and they want
to hire me in just based on that they
don't see a resume they don't know about
JRuby they asked me to work on things
that are totally unrelated but they can
see that I've got this track record of
contributions out there there's
community and social aspects you're
going to get to know a lot more folks
around the world you're going to have
opportunities to go and meet them
opportunities to go and speak
invitations to conferences if you get
deeper into projects like I do sometimes
there's a lot of things that come out of
this that are not just ten to like
technical benefits being able to meet
new people get out there get into the
community a bit more and it's actually a
lot of fun I wouldn't have done this
work for nine years if it wasn't great
to meet new people meet new challenges
and learn more about the technologies
I'm trying to work on so hopefully these
are some reasons that will convince you
that this is worthwhile so now getting
down to the actual process here finding
a project that you want to contribute to
alright so it the easiest way is to
think about some tools or libraries that
you use something you depend on right
now maybe there's quirks in a library
quirks in a database library that you
have issues with quirks in some web
framework or features that you think
you're missing something that you use
that you want to improve for yourself
and for the benefit of others it may be
a technology that you're simply
interested in maybe you are a Java
Enterprise developer by day but you
really would like to do 3d graphics or
games there's libraries out there
frameworks out there that you can get
involved in stuff that you can start
playing with on your own time and be a
open source contributor at the same time
as well might be languages or frameworks
or databases that you want
to learn more about in my case I came to
JRuby because I was interested in Ruby I
was a Java Enterprise Architect went to
ruby conf was really enamored with the
language and excited about getting
involved and so then that turned into
nine years of Jay Ruby work and it may
be a project that you simply want to
help something that you see out there
that needs resources needs folks to
start contributing so my story the first
open source project I actually worked on
was called light step anybody here
familiar with light step oh there are
filled awesome so in like nineteen
ninety eight I came into the project and
wanted to try and contribute to it and
like based on those same principles of
how to find a project to contribute to
it was a project i was using myself it's
it's a an explorer desktop replacement
for windows replaces the taskbar
replaces the desktop and then gives you
your own widgets that you can plug in a
pretty cool little thing basically skins
the entire desktop in a totally new next
step ii sort of way so was the project i
was using myself and it was open source
i was familiar with the languages it was
written in c some c++ win32 api is which
had done some some development in
development had basically ground to a
halt there was very little work going on
and the codebase had started to kind of
bit rot it was getting old and crusty
and it was a large monolithic piece of
crap that was just sort of bald together
my way of getting involved was that I
went in there I started pulling the
pieces apart I started cleaning up the
codebase a little bit breaking up this
monolithic codebase into more source
files more sub modules and lo and behold
within about a month of doing that I
became the lead of the project suddenly
and so I led let's light step for about
a year we made a lot of interesting
improvements into it and I believe it's
still out there going as a project today
so the bulk of my open-source career
thou has been in working on JRuby
there's a J Ruby talk later today at two
JRuby is an implementation of Ruby runs
on top of the JVM written mostly in Java
although more and more we're using Ruby
itself to implement it and again
development had kind of slowed down when
I got involved in 2005
there were lots of different tasks that
were still out there it needed to be
updated for compatibility performance
wasn't where it should be for a JVM
language lots of little things that
could be done and so while I was sitting
at rubyconf in 2004 learning this new
language and excited about it and
knowing that I was just the Java
Enterprise Architect I looked for a
project out there called JRuby found out
that an old friend of mine was actually
the soul contributor this last line on
the bottom here is really the saddest
thing this is the saddest part of open
source eventually everyone's in this
position I am really the only JRuby
developer at this point this lonely
world that he lived in so I started to
get involved and over time my
contributions ramped up I started to do
more and more work on it then sun
microsystems got interested hired us on
to work on it full time other Ruby
companies like Rindge and yard continued
to start adopting jruby and more and
more work went into this project lots of
exciting stuff and lots of tasks that
came out of it so the second step for
getting involved here is probably
getting in meeting the community
figuring out who these people are what
their needs are so you can get on
mailing list and forums obviously most
projects are of a medium size medium or
larger we'll have a mailing list or a
form of some kind a lot of them starting
to use things like git er or slack as
well chat services like IRC chat
services like git er great way to get
involved find out if there's a place
where the developers congregate you can
go out talk to them you can just lurk
and see what's going on see what they're
discussing on the channel figure out
what sort of needs there are out there
tell them you're interested in helping
maybe they'll have something you can do
question and answer sites are a great
way to look at this stack overflow Cora
go out there and see what problems
people are having with the software
those might be things that you know how
to do things that you can fix or they
might be things that sound interesting
for you to research you can answer
questions you can go and help the
community improve the pool of knowledge
and then just up to a lesser extent
social sites like like LinkedIn Facebook
even Twitter you can if that project has
a twitter feed you might be able to
follow that not as much getting involved
in the community but finding out what
the pulse is how things are going so
once you get involved in the community
you know the project that you want
to work on the next everything out what
exactly you can contribute to the
project so it doesn't have to be code
doesn't even have to be code initially
doesn't have to be bugs simple things
like just help field questions get on
the mailing list and answer questions
for other users that are having trouble
pass on some of your knowledge of the
project to new users improve the
documentation that's out there work on
the wiki pages submit documentation
patches help clean up the the overall
pool of documentation for the project
you could start presenting about it
there's no reason that you have to be
involved in the project to say here's
what I use it for here's what I'm doing
with this project in the real world
start doing presentations get more
people involved and get them to know
that the project is out there these are
all great non-code ways to get involved
in an open source project and help it
move forward and every one of these we
wish we had dozens more people that
we're doing these any open source
project needs folks that can do these
and then of course you can get more into
the technical side you can file bugs you
can start submitting fixes and so on so
a quick note on folks for the folks that
haven't filed a bug or have filed bugs
and might need some tips good bug
reporting for an open source what we
want to see in a bug report so first of
all clearly stating the expectations
versus what actually happened versus
reality we get so many bug reports that
will come in and say this is broken and
they don't tell us what they actually
expect to happen or they'll say here's
Jay Ruby's output and we're just
supposed to guess at what piece of that
might be wrong clearly state both what
you expected to happen and what the
reality was provides some simple code
and some are some steps to reproduce and
this is not just showing a command-line
session give us a script that we can run
make a little temporary github database
or temporary github project that we can
just go in and run a simple command and
get it to go anything you can do to make
it easier for us to run it in one or two
steps better much more likely we're
going to get to the heart of it always
tried volunteer relevant environment
details every time that we have to go
back and forth and ask you okay so what
platform are you on alright what java
version are you on what version of the
project are you on often people just to
omit that
always try to volunteer at least the
basics of your environment and then be
responsive as your bug is updated as
comments come in be right on the ball
and respond quickly there's so many so
much backlog of issues in open source
projects if you're not there responding
on a regular basis it's probably going
to get pushed to the bottom of the queue
you may never get resolved if you
respond quickly much more likely that
it's going to stay at the top of that
that queue it's going to get the
attention it needs okay so is this a
good bug report or a bad bug report I we
get we get lots and lots of these it's
improved over the years as people get
more into doing bug reports but this is
literally the entire bug report a
nullpointerexception in some line of
code who knows what they were running at
least we do have a jruby version we
don't know what platform they were on we
know what version of Java but other than
that it worked left to kind of guess at
what's happened here we can go in and
say okay well there's this that could
cause a null pointer that but not a very
good bug report so don't do things like
that obviously here's a better example
more recently this is a very simple very
short and sweet bug report it has in the
description a bug the description of the
bucket says what's what's wrong what
it's doing that he doesn't expect it has
a very simple script that we can just
copy and paste out and run to see the
results and then at the bottom clearly
stating what happened versus what was
expected to happen a little bit more
complicated here this one actually reads
like a blog post it starts out
describing some background on ssl on TLS
issues how to all different
platforms and different runtimes figure
out ssl versions and then it goes into
the actual examples of what JRuby does
versus regular Ruby and what the what
the problem is what's expected in what's
not working all right so we can file
bugs but we can even go deeper than that
we can start to dig into the next level
and this one is a huge way to help an
open source project once you get to know
a project you know how to run its tests
you know how to build it go in there and
start looking at the bug reports that
are in their backlog jruby right now has
well over 700 open bugs I guarantee you
that there's not 700 bugs in JRuby right
now or at least not those those 700 are
not all still valid probably a tiny
percentage of those like a hundred of
those might actually be valid bugs at
this point go in there see if they're
still valid take the place of the core
developers on the project ask the
questions about the environment ask for
reproductions see if you can help clean
up that backlog a little bit you can
help guide other bug reporters if you
see people submitting bug reports that
are missing important information tell
them tell them that they need to include
some extra information some environment
details or a nice script you can watch
and see how other bugs are fixed as the
process goes forward especially on a
platform like github you'll see the
patches come in you'll see the
discussion you'll see the changes and
it's a great way to learn how things fit
together in that library or in that
project so pay attention what's actually
happening with other bugs and then of
course you can start to actually go into
the point where you attempt your own fix
rather than just filing bugs and
cleaning up the bug reports you can get
in there and make some changes so the
next section we will talk about actually
the process of getting involved and
contributing a fix to a project so the
main reason that folks don't actually
contribute fixes or contribute code at
least to open source projects is fear a
number of different things most people
can identify with at least one of these
I'm not good enough to make this change
to a project probably the number one
thing I not confident enough to make
changes to some piece of technology I
don't know the best solution these
people obviously know the project better
than I do what am I going to be able to
do to help out and again it's any help
that we can get someone's the proposes a
solution gets the bug up to the top of
the the attention span then we can start
moving from there I'll make things worse
this is certainly possible but I
guarantee you I've done more to make
jruby worse than anyone else that has
submitted a patch to it so I'm going to
be very very accepting of issues we're
going to work through it will test
things that's why we have tests and
we'll make sure that whatever you submit
is not going
your problem and this is more recently
people are worried about being mocked or
insulted and there are projects out
there that are shall i say not very
welcoming we try to be very open and
very friendly and very accepting of all
sorts of people all sorts of all levels
of skill all backgrounds generally open
source is probably the nicest place that
you can be working on projects and it's
improving over time it's we're starting
to see people call out projects that
don't do a nice job of managing their
community and fitting in so most of
these just don't happen they're not
really issues that you need to worry
about so try to try to jump past the
fear and get involved so I want to talk
a little bit about the big contributions
I've made the jruby over time and put it
in in terms of fear here so I've done
several rewrites of our interpreter I've
written multiple versions of our JIT
compiler that turns Ruby into JVM
bytecode I've written some native IO
code and some native process management
so making calls down to see from the JVM
I rewritten multiple times the entire
Ruby to Java integration layer so key
parts very deep important parts of JRuby
and the interesting thing is that I had
no idea about how to do any of this when
I started working on JRuby I never took
a compilers course I'd never written a
parser none of these things I've written
a little bit of see like for university
courses and that was about it but I
learned as I went and I started small
with small pieces started with little
rewrites of existing code get to
understand it and move forward and I was
able to get past most of the fear factor
there all right so now bug fixed types
obviously there's this changes to
behavior that's the most interesting
type for a piece of software project but
you know there could be bug fixes for
performance you can find algorithms that
are inefficient something that's a no
event cube that you can make an o of n
or you know reduce the complexity of
some algorithm documentation fixes are
always welcome that can be documentation
in the code or documentation fixes on a
wiki documentation fixes on the readme
and other files that come along with the
project and there can be quality fixes
we also accept code fixes that just
improve the quality of the codebase
cleaning up source files improving
running things like fine bugs to tidy up
likely pasa likely bugs that might be
issues with the software doesn't have to
be directly behavior performance it can
just be making it a better source code
base so now you've actually decided what
sort of thing you want to contribute to
what sort of fix you want to do let's
see what we've got here so you modify
your copy of the code usually that's
going to mean cloning it from github
pulling it down with whatever source
control the project uses most projects
on github now as as we all know and
modify your copy of the code in place
confirm that it works as you expect and
now there's two very key details here
first of all make sure that it actually
fixes the issue that you're trying to
fix you would be surprised how many
patches we get that actually don't do
anything to improve the situation at all
they didn't actually run it or they
didn't test it or something and then
beyond that make sure that it doesn't
fail any existing tests good projects
will have a list of instructions or an
easy command you can run to do some
sanity checks or a full test suite make
sure you've run that before you go ahead
and submit your patch so and then also
write your own test if you're fixing
something that didn't fail before it's
good to have a test for it in the future
make sure that doesn't break again and
then submit your fix in the open use the
github pull request if that's what the
project prefers use a patch sent to an
mail list if that's what they prefer but
make sure that it's in the open it sits
in the public it makes licensing a lot
easier and it makes discussion and
collaboration a lot easier as well so
here's an example of a reasonably good
patch for for JRuby notice that it's not
changing all lines it doesn't do
reformatting unnecessarily it maintains
documentation even though it removes
some code and then you know make sure
the documentation is still valid well
talk through that with the project it
includes a test in this case it's using
Ruby's r-spec behavior driven testing so
we've got a nice patch we've got a nice
test and we can submit it so a few more
tips here if you feel like you're having
trouble don't be afraid to ask for help
you can file a bug see if you can get
some of the core developers in there to
answer
questions if you're not sure how to fix
it they'll probably give you some
guidance open source projects just want
some hands on the on the code working on
stuff we're happy to give you some tips
and tricks on where in the source to
actually look for a fix limit your
changes to the actual thing that you're
fixing it's always tempting to go out
there and fix related things as you go
make those separate patches make them
separate issues it makes review process
much easier for all of us on the
receiving side follow the proximate
coding style and I most projects will
have some sort of standard for the
coding style coding conventions that
they use but a large enough project
there's there's bit rot there's a little
coding style creep that happens stick to
whatever the coding style of the files
you're working on is even if they don't
seem like they're quite right submitting
patches that also do reformatting makes
reviewing almost impossible so try to
make your change of smaller and keep it
to whatever the style of the code around
it looks like maintain documentation
truths i mentioned if you have
documentation that's already in the code
after your changes confirm that it
actually still makes sense and add
documentation if you see it's missing
and then be patient responsive again
being able to to go back and forth with
the project make changes to the code and
revise it over time alright so we've
made some patches we've made some fixes
they've gotten accepted into our
favorite project maybe it's time for us
to start looking at actually being a
contributor committed to this project so
first of all I want to say that the
commits bit that you get for a project
the ability to commit code directly to
it is is not a prize that you win it
feels great to get it and a lot of
people that's their sole goal is to get
a commit bid on some project that they
really like but it really is also a
responsibility and the reason for this
is because core contributors to an open
source project are developers their
managers their evangelists their QA
their community coordinators they're all
of these things in one whether they want
to or not so getting commit to a project
means that you're going to be doing a
lot more than just writing code
something to think about and when you
accept that responsibility so on the
JRuby project what we look for in adding
a committee
adding a new contributor a proven track
record of contributions and this can be
over a short period of time if it's
someone that we really like working with
and they're doing great work some of our
committers have been out there doing
patches for a year or more and github
makes it very easy for people to
contribute without having direct commit
rights we do pull requests we do patches
but we want to see a proven track record
over time sustained interest sometimes
people will get interested for just a
couple weeks and then they'll disappear
we wait for a little while just to make
sure it's someone who's going to
continue contributing to us we like
having committers on the project but we
don't also don't want a bunch of a bunch
of inactive contributors that aren't
doing work anymore or have lost interest
in the project we look for domain
expertise we have people that are
specifically maven experts that are
specifically native integration native
call experts folks that are compiler
people we brought in compiler expert PhD
guy to work on our new compiler for
JRuby 9000 anything that you've got that
might be a specific domain area maybe
its documentation maybe it's writing
blog posts maybe it's writing technical
docs for a wiki all of these things are
great areas to get involved in a project
and a very quick path to getting in as a
core contributor and somebody that's
been proven that they're respectful we
don't add committers that are obviously
difficult to work with someone that is
answering questions being calm being
respectful being patient with other
develop project users and other project
developers that's what we look for and
that's that's how you're going to get in
so there's another process to this as
well you might have heard of call it
open commit bit the idea here is that
there's a number of projects if you make
one contribution you get in you're a
committer now and this is a great way to
get in to get a pool of developers going
early on in a project lifecycle but as
the project matures as JRuby is we've
got folks running stuff at the BBC we've
got folks running stuff at visa we need
to be a little bit more careful about
who we give the keys to the castle too
great way to start for early projects
though if you spin off your own project
and you want to get folks involved in it
you know that you can kind of give that
carrot of
commit bit out a little bit more freely
at the beginning so profile of one of
our core developers M Christian
Christian Meier he was a maven
integration expert he'd been using jruby
to integrate Ruby and maven for several
years actually he was an active user on
our mailing lists he was answering
questions about how to do drewby and
maven and JRuby and maven together like
I said maintaining related libraries and
consistently submitting patches to
improve JRuby he was the maven guy he
loved to do this for whatever reason and
we needed this kind of guy in the
project so he became a committer a a
couple years ago helped us to make a lot
of improvements in how we integrate with
a typical Java build so now when you
when you are a committer once you get
into a project there's some tips to
actually be a good contributor so any
non-trivial changes especially if
they're areas where you know there's a
more of a dorm domain expert someone
like like em Christian who's maven guy
or whatever discuss them on a mailing
list or on your own on the own on the
project you have commit rights to
there's no reason you can't still open
pull requests and do your discussions
there let other project members review
it work with you and then you can merge
it back in keep the test green all the
time it's it's hard especially on a
large project like jruby to keep all the
tests screen we have about 40 test
suites that run for every every commit
on Travis and our overall build on
Travis consume something like six hours
of CPU time so thanks thanks for Travis
that's great I'd rather not be rid of
that on my machine but keep the test
green every time they go red it's a
matter of hunting down who broke it
figuring out what the problem is waste a
lot of time on the project be respectful
of bug and patch submitters just like
you were when you first started
contributing to an open source project
there's a lot of people that are going
to make mistakes they've got a lot of
fear try and help them get involved in
the project more gently and always
remain humble and by humble I mean treat
every bug report as if it was a gift
someone went out of their way to file
this bug if they didn't file it the bug
would still be there and you would not
know so treat every bug report is a
gift don't get angry at bug reports love
them and hold them close to your heart
always and generally assume that you're
wrong if someone ran into something
either it's a problem in your software
or it's a problem in how they learn to
use your software oftentimes it's it's
just that they didn't know what the
right process was the right way to use
an API maybe it's not a bug but in its
good to assume that you're wrong or
there's something about that could be
improved documentation wise to make it
easier for other folks in the future and
of course not all bugs are in code some
of these things are just user experience
if it seems like everyone's tripping
over this one API maybe that API isn't
designed very well may not be a bug but
it's a usability issue and so it's
something to look at all right so going
deeper one of our big sections here
actually getting your own project your
own source out there as an open source
project so why would you want to start a
project or spin your project office open
source well there may be a gap in
whatever community are working with a
library that wraps some database that
does a a really nice new ORM doesn't
seem to have any analog that's out there
a graphics library then you've created a
nice wrapper API around it that makes it
easier to use some sort of gap that
needs to be filled something that you've
done for yourself or you want to do for
the community a tool that others might
find useful maybe it's something that
you've used internally just a little
utility library you've written over the
years and as utility libraries grow we
have more and more stuff is in there
maybe this is something that the
community would find useful and could
actually help you improve make it better
for you as well it may be a proud you
may need more resources on your project
and maybe something that you don't feel
like you can continue to maintain this
throw it out into the world you know see
if it has legs see if there's folks that
are interested in contributing and
picking it up my example I did another
language called Mira it's a language
that sort of compiles Ruby into Java
code directly statically typed just sort
of a ruby to Java converter rather than
a runtime and I just couldn't maintain
it anymore I didn't have time to do it
with JRuby but put it out there talk to
some of the other folks in the community
now there's people maintaining it and
keeping a
going as a project maybe just for fun
like I said maybe there's graphics
libraries or game libraries that you
want to work with this is a great reason
to throw your cloud out there and start
working on something in the open a lot
of folks when I do this talk ask how do
you find time to do this most folks here
probably not doing open source all day
and many of you aren't at companies that
are going to allow you to have extra
time so how do you find time to work on
open source well you can make it a hobby
for example if you're doing raspberry pi
stuff maybe there's raspberry pi
libraries that you can start writing
spinning off as open source make it sort
of a fun thing a project that you do in
your spare time rather than you know
watching TV or drinking beer which is my
hobby so prefer jobs that support
open-source work maybe you're not in one
of those jobs now but you're probably
going to make a change at some point ask
them ask them how they feel about giving
you ten percent time twenty percent time
a day a week something like that to work
on open source projects this is
important for you and your career and
it's important for the software world in
general so I think it's absolutely
something you should start requiring out
of employers let make sure that they
know how important open source is to
their world and to yours explaining
career benefits too for example your
partner someone at home that wants
timeout of you when you're done with
work they want you to dedicate your time
to the family well make sure they
understand that it's a resume builder
that it's a learning opportunity it's
something that you want to do is
something that you're really excited
about doing and nine times out of ten
that'll get you some extra free time you
can work on stuff in the evenings and
keep your projects aligned with your
interests don't try and work on a
project that you're no longer excited
about again stick to things that you're
excited about embedded route raspberry
pi stuff or games or whatever always
make sure that what you're working on is
what you're excited about working on so
early steps for getting an open source
project out there obviously the the
sticky and icky one is licensing and he
of course here's my disclaimer I am NOT
a lawyer although I have to play lawyer
ball with open source stuff all the time
it sucks but it's the way it is so
hopefully I can I can pass on some tips
here that will make a little
easier for you things I've learned over
the years so different criteria for the
licenses that you choose for your
project how source is shared how rights
are assigned what happens when you want
to rely rely sins the code whether you
need to include attribution for all the
changes auditing of the processes to
keep it above board in the you know
there's a few ways that you can choose
an open source license this is a page
from github choosing an ounce of OSS
license doesn't need to be scary and
that's certainly true here they they lay
out three different options the three
options that they have I want it simple
and permissive that's MIT you know
basically just a step below throwing it
out there is public domain you can do
anything with this code put it anywhere
make any changes redistributed any way
you want in the middle I'm concerned
about patents there's a number of
open-source licenses out there that
require contributors to basically give a
patent grant so that you can't have
folks make contributions to a project
and then turn around patent it and sue
you and everybody else that's using your
project the example here is Apache which
is one of my favorite licenses the
Eclipse public license and Mozilla
public licenses are also have some
patent language in them as well and then
I care about sharing improvements you
want to make sure really make sure that
any changes people make to your software
ends up getting back into it something
like a GPL a copyleft where changes are
required to be put back out there if
you're going to release them less and
less popular these days because of
what's called the viral nature of GPL it
tends to affect other libraries and
packages around it making them
potentially need to be open sourced but
still very popular for really forcing
open source ramming open source on to
your users I mentioned relicensing as a
problem we've had to relicense jruby
only once thankfully and that was to add
the Eclipse public license which is now
our primary license as your software
changes over time you may need to use a
new license you may want to add
something that has patent language like
an EPL my advice here is ideally get it
right the first time pick a license
that's going to cover every possible
need that you're going to have in the
future because relicensing usually means
you have to go out there and con
act every single person who's
contributed to that project and make
sure they're okay with this new license
for their code you can also kind of
blunt this by having folks explicitly
sign or opt into a contributor agreement
this does things like assigning the
rights of your code to the project or to
some foundation explicitly giving
permission to relicense if it's
necessary in the future I we don't have
an explicit contributor agreement for
JRuby but we do have an implicit one and
from what I've found generally just
people publicly saying yes I agree to
your licenses yes I agree that it's part
of JRuby now that's mostly what lawyers
seem to be looking for I talked about
being respectful to your community a lot
of projects already to adopt a code of
conduct basically just spelling out what
you expect of your community members how
you expect people to be treated and how
you expect people to treat each other
and then explicitly saying what
enforcement you're going to do whether
you're going to remove commits remove
commit bits take people off a mailing
list so on just making a little bit more
clear that we're not going to tolerate
jerks in our community a good example of
this and this is one that's been adopted
by lots of projects contributor covenant
org contributor dash covenant org a nice
little form that you can just drop into
your project you'll have your own code
of conduct then and so then you want to
get your true source out there like I
say include that license from the first
day it's out there pretty much every
project I put into into open source or
put up on github now within a couple
days someone asks me what the licenses
so just have it there and available
right away use services that are
familiar to the community like a github
so on I always include read Me's build
scripts anything that someone's going to
need to you do your process of
development give them tips on how to get
going how to run tests and then tell the
world get on mailing lists and shout
from the mountains that your project is
out there and it's available but don't
necessarily expect that you're going to
have a flood of people in there maybe
it's going to be amazing maybe everyone
is just going to start contributing this
project like mad but generally it's it's
a slow process to get going and about
using the the tools of the community
I thought it's really exciting that
Microsoft actually chose to put stuff on
github and they're not using their own
source control areas anymore their own
project sites they've recognized that
the open source world generally is
revolving around github now they did
they're doing the right thing by putting
it out there some quick notes on
encouraging contribution to your project
so the first thing that I recommend for
any project that wants to encourage
contribution is ask for it go out there
and find people and say hey I need you
to work on this you're a crypto guy and
I hate crypto but I love you and I want
you to work on my project so simple if
we get so many contributions just by
asking for them respond to emails be
responsive when you have bugs filed be
responsive when people submit patches be
active and be somebody that they can
count on getting a response from help
educate contributing contributing
members help educate folks in the
community show them what you're doing
try and explain the process of
development on the project and be
forgiving understand that folks that are
going to come into your project may not
know how it works they may be jerks
themselves and have to learn how to
undergo Phi they may be completely new
to development there may be folks that
have not been doing this for too many
years so be forgiving educate people
just be respectful and like you would
want to be treated when you start out
and the final section here just talking
on releasing your software some tips
that we've learned over the years with
JRuby so here's a little checklist I'm
not going to go through all of this
things like tagging should be obvious
there should be some sort of tag out
there I mentioned release notes already
we have we now include a md5 sha1 and
shot 256 and by next year someone's
probably going to request some other
hash that they want for our binary
downloads it's just this pervasive
number of hashing things that people
need to confirm that it's actually the
real jruby securing download channels
this is one that folks are requesting a
couple years ago if you put it out there
on a server you got a tarball or a
binary or jar file for someone to
download a pre pre made build make sure
it's HTTPS so that they can verify
they're always getting
from the right place and announced again
according to community norms get on the
right mailing list tell people your
project is out there and released so
here's tagging if you tag stuff on
github you actually get a really nice
release page that shows that gives you a
tarball download you can attach release
notes to that release as well there's
probably some automated process that
we're not using here to have our release
notes in there again using familiar
sights if you're doing a Java project
probably should have it out there and
maven central at some point it's not
difficult to do if you look up maven
open source you'll find the sonatype
guide to getting projects out there
getting your own group ID really within
about a day you can be releasing stuff
to maven central and it's pretty trivial
at that point and if you're in a
particular route language community like
Ruby like closure use the release
mechanisms that they're familiar with as
well if you have your own project site
for it make sure that the rumor the
current release is prominently displayed
don't make people hunt around for it
you'll get a better response in bug
reports you'll be less likely that
people are filing bugs against old
versions they can always go to the site
and see what the current version is and
we've actually got our little Travis
badge up there to show that the build is
green and it was green this day so that
was good I mentioned hashes before also
including release notes that there's a
full JRuby download page that shows our
two most current versions the JRuby 9x
and the jo v 1.7 x versions and then all
of our different binaries that we have
with their various sets of hashes and I
mentioned securing downloads making sure
everything's HTTPS so a few final words
here the world really does run on open
source and a large portion of the world
runs on Java which is open source but
open source stuff can't exist without
people like you helping out and
contributing and getting involved I
really would love I'd love to encourage
you all by the end of the week to have
done something for an open source
project you've never done before file a
bug if you haven't submit a patch if you
haven't get involved and try to help out
projects that are there because the
bottom line is that you really are
tomorrow's most important contributor to
open source you're the ones thats going
to be doing the next project open
sourcing the next library
so get started today and you'll have a
much better tomorrow and we all will so
thanks very much and I think we have
some time for questions right yeah sure
in front so the question was how much
time do I spend on an average day
managing the community and doing the non
code issues non technical stuff is that
about right so I work full-time on JRuby
which full-time means that from the time
I get up to the time I go to sleep I
kind of I'm thinking about it but i
would say that for my particular role on
JRuby i spend as much as you know thirty
to fifty percent of my time just working
with community and that's things like
answering questions on the mailing list
that's triaging bugs and helping move
bug reports forward that is being on IRC
and answering questions and and making
sure that other folks that are that are
working on JRuby can get their patches
in or they know how to fix stuff I my
role is a little bit more on that side
than a typical open-source person but
I'd say even folks in our community that
are all technical and just writing code
still deal with the community probably
ten to twenty percent of the day other
questions yeah over here
that's a great idea so the point was
there are lots of companies probably
most companies out there using open
source are not doing any work to
contribute back to open source maybe we
should have an open source manifesto or
a open source free trade badge or some
kind these would be great I don't know
if there's efforts to do something like
this but even right now you can go out
and find companies that say here this is
an open source project that we help
maintain these are developers that we
have out there that conferences like
this people that go and say here's my
company I'm out here working on this
project you'll start to find the good
companies in the bad ones I would love
to see some sort of badging or some sort
of I don't know it seems wrong to say it
but some sort of way to shame these
companies into doing a bit more to help
us out rather than just let's just just
carrying them along and never getting
any benefits from it I'd love to see
that definitely any other questions got
a couple more minutes here yes I see a
hand there okay go for it right so the
question is how do you make that
business case to a company that's
entering this possibly considering open
sourcing some clothes or software and
get them get them to do it get them to
see the reasons well some of the stuff
that's in here for example getting more
resources on the project are a great way
to show there's a potential for our our
users to actually contribute back to us
there are a number of similar checklist
on some of the open-source sites free
software foundation and so on that have
lists of business cases for why you
would open source software and
you probably the one of the biggest
biggest things that you would say they
were company is the goodwill that they
get out of it the you they look so much
better in the community and folks like
your Jean over here won't want to shame
them because they're not making
contributions they will be one of the
good guys and I think every company
wants to at least appear to be one of
the good guys so those are those are
some tips and there's definitely stuff
out there from other free software sites
to help move that forward and I think
that's about it for us so thanks again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
