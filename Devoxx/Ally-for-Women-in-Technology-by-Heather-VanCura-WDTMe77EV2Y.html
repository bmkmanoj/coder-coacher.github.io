I'm here to share with you at devoxx my
top 10 ways to ally for women in
technology so I've been a woman in
technology for close to 20 years now
I've been working with the Java
community from California but also
traveling globally around the world at
developer conferences for the last 17
years and one of the things that I've
come to know is that technology reflects
the people who make it and currently a
women make up 52% of the world
population but seeing as that you're
working in technology and you're here at
a Java developer conference you're
probably aware that the numbers of women
working in technology are actually
significantly lower than that 52% it's
currently about 70% of the technical
jobs are being held by women and
unfortunately women are usually paid
less but if you are at the keynote
yesterday you also heard one of my key
bits of knowledge that I have here in
this quickie talk as well which is teams
that include both men and women are
actually collectively more intelligence
their collective IQ actually Rises the
group collective IQ of the group will
rise regardless of the individual IQ so
teams with men and women on them make
better decisions come up with better
solutions are actually more profitable
and more creative so being that I've
been a woman in tech working for 17
years this isn't actually someone
something that I like to talk about this
is something that is a little bit of a
risky topic for me but I believe that
the experience that I do have in working
with the Java developer community puts
me in a unique perspective and
increasingly over the last two years
this is a question that comes up more
and more often from men who come to me
and ask me what they can do to support
more women in technology and so that is
why I put this talk together based on my
experience in technology when I first
got into working
in the workforce working with the Java
developer community in 2000 I really did
believe that tech was a meritocracy and
that working hard was all that it was
going to take and so I work put my head
down I worked really hard and believe it
or not I hardly even recognized that I
was one of the only women even when I
went to conferences but what I quickly
realized was that doing your job will
get you absolutely nowhere in technology
and I think this applies for both men
and women especially these days working
hard and doing the job and being
exceptional is what it takes to survive
in technology but in order to thrive you
need to grow your network you need to
increase your visibility you need to
expand your influence and whether you're
a man or a woman that takes mentors
sponsors and allies and so for this talk
I'm going to focus specifically on women
working in the workforce what what you
can do to support them you can do this
whether you're a man or a woman but
again this talk really is targeted
primarily at the men who have been
coming and asking me these questions
what can you do and I think it really
comes down to these ten things that I'll
share with you today and first of all
the thing that you can do is think of it
as a verb so think of a lie as a verb so
a thing that you do sometimes not a
thing that you are you don't have to do
it all the time but the idea is they
were to come up with ten small micro
actions that you can do that will affect
a massive change and you're probably
aware this conversation is going on
throughout the industry but I really do
believe that talking about it is healthy
and productive but I don't think it's
necessarily going to do anything it
takes people being willing to take
actions to be open and to listen and
when you do listen more than you talk
also be aware that you probably will
make some mistakes you probably will
some say some things that maybe aren't
taken the way you intend them to be
taken but that's okay you can continue
to try and remember also to just be
straightforward rather than try to be
sarcastic or humorous when you try to do
some of these actions especially in the
beginning oftentimes that will backfire
on you so be simple and kind and
straightforward in these actions
that I'm going to encourage you to take
a really big thing that you can do is be
aware of assignment distributions so
assignment distributions in the
workforce can take on many forms when I
talk about assignment distribution I
talked with you can often think about it
in two categories so the housework
versus the real work so when you're on a
team be aware of the assignments and how
they're distributed on your team between
the men and the women are you making
sure that you're assigning projects to
the women that are high priority that
are things that are about owning the
code versus only managing the projects
so think about that in terms of
assignments and also in terms of just
daily work in your work office
environment as well as when you're at
conferences being aware of assigning
real work and significant work and
high-value work to not just the men but
also to the women creating a friendly
environment you may or may not be aware
that the women who are in technology
will leave at significantly higher rates
than men will leave technology and
oftentimes the common reasons cited for
this is that women feel like they don't
belong so look for ways that you can
create a friendly environment and ask
women questions about their work so I
think oftentimes well-intentioned men
will ask questions of women that I think
exacerbate the feeling that maybe
they're out of place so questions like
where your children or who's caring for
your children while those may be well
intended questions they're actually
questions that can make women feel like
they don't belong so try to ask
questions and connect with women on your
team on a personal level as a human
versus trying to compare them to other
women that you may know in your life
friends partners or spouses and also be
be flexible in terms of time that you're
spending together and as an informal
part of a team so if you're often
finding yourself doing things outside of
work like catching a beer and you find
that the women and your team aren't
participating look at ways that you can
shift to things like lunchtime
or afternoon coffee be flexible in terms
of the time that you spend collaborating
informally because those are some of the
moments when teams really come together
in those informal times so make sure
that you're having both the men and the
women on your team participating in
those types of events and also look at
your job description so often time
people will say to me they don't get the
women candidates applying but if you
look at your job descriptions and you
often see those with developer roles
especially you're talking about code
ninjas rock stars all-stars you might be
highlighting the beer and activities
that you may be doing as a culture in
your environment and those are can
sometimes be off-putting to women so
take a look at that and see what you can
do in your job descriptions tip number
five speaking up so you can speak up at
meetings and in forums and at
conferences so some of the major ways
where I think men can speak up is when
women are making suggestions and they're
being interrupted you may or may not be
aware of the research that shows that
women are interrupted three times more
often than men and often you know this
may not be intentional but it is a fact
that it happens so I think this is a
prime opportunity for men or women to
step in and ask if the person can finish
speaking since they were being
interrupted so that's one way that you
can do a micro action there and a
similar vein there's also the case of a
woman making a suggestion and then very
soon afterwards a man making a very
similar suggestion and taking credit for
that idea so again in that case what I
suggest is a concept called
amplification so if a woman makes a
suggestion and there isn't an immediate
acceptance of that suggestion you can
actually step it and say recognize the
idea and name it and for example the
person by name just had a great idea and
then build on that idea with
amplification or a question so that's
that's one of the things that you can do
in terms of speaking up related to
speaking up is an intervention so this
would be more of a thing in kind of
difficult or inappropriate situations
which you know fortunately for me I
don't have a lot of those but
I think I have heard from many women
working in technology that they these
situations do come up so if you see
things something that's inappropriate
happening in your workplace or at a
conference step up and say something and
it doesn't necessarily have to be a
confrontational step up and say
something often time it can be a
redirection into something a topic
that's maybe more appropriate but I
think often times men will tell me that
they're not participating in these types
of conversations or initiating
themselves but at the same time they
don't feel obligated to step up and say
something or redirect the conversation
so I think this is an excellent action
that can be taken and requires very
little investment from the people trying
to support and take the action number
seven is a action related to character
trait traits so in this action I'm
telling you to be aware of this so there
are certain character traits that are
proven to be attributed more to women
than to men and you may or may not be
aware of these I've personally
experienced some of this in the
beginning of my career so one of the
words that was actually used to describe
me was abrasive now I don't see myself
as abrasive I basically am the chair of
the Java community process I interact
with the Java developer community all
over the world that is my job to be a
community connector but oftentimes in
the beginning of my career I was
described as cold abrasive or aggressive
and it's been shown that this abrasive
word is a word that's used often times
to describe women but never use to
describe men and performance reviews so
I think as a man working in technology
and if you catch yourself hearing people
being described in this way you can
think about filtering that out and maybe
using different words so I think some of
the behaviors that I would mirror when I
first started in my career were men who
were acting maybe in strong or being
leaders strong leadership positions
right so those are some words that you
could substitute in for aggressive right
you're being strong or abrasive you're
being direct or concise so be aware of
these descriptions of character and try
to put in some different words that you
might not typically think of I think one
thing to keep in mind is that a woman
working in technology she what she walks
kind of a tightrope as I have that here
on my slide so you don't want to be too
feminine because then you won't be
perceived as effective but you don't
want to be too masculine either because
then you won't be likable so there's
this tightrope that women tend to walk
walk working in technology tip number
eight I think is essential to encourage
norms in the workplace that are putting
men and women on a level playing field
and two of the things primarily that I
found while working in technology that
are behaviors that are necessary to
succeed whether you're a man or a woman
is self-promotion and negotiation and
those two things are not stated
explicitly anywhere in job descriptions
when you start working in technology and
I think oftentimes women are not
necessarily prone to self-promote
they're not necessarily the ones who are
gonna be saying I'm the best to want to
do this job or if there's a new job req
posted and there's ten requirements for
that job oftentimes what I've seen is
men will go ahead and ply for it if they
have a couple of those requirements
where women will only apply if she fits
all of those requirements so it's not
necessary to have all of the things
listed in a job requirement and I think
explicitly saying that and encouraging
women to apply for positions
helps to encourage that self-promotion
aspect as well as in the day to day life
for a conference is being willing to
speak up and promote yourself and
suggest yourself for higher value
positions and projects so be aware of
that and actively look for ways that you
can encourage women that you work with
to self promote as well as to negotiate
so negotiation in the form of not only
salary but benefits that you may receive
in the workplace so oftentimes women
will accept whatever they're given and
aren't comfortable with the idea of
negotiation but negotiation is
absolutely essential working in
technology so and it's not just limited
to salaries so
encourage and share with the women that
you work with to negotiate and frame it
in a way which is not confrontational
but more to people trying to come to an
agreement so I think encouraging these
two types of activities will play a big
role in making them normalized
activities in the workplace and
oftentimes that has to be explicitly
stated unconscious bias is something
that you can educate yourself about I
recently come to accept that yes I do
have unconscious bias I always thought
that I didn't but the fact is that it's
human nature we all have bias it's part
of being human we pattern match we put
things in certain categories and I think
just recognizing that fact you can often
stop it in its tracks in terms of
describing people's actual behavior
versus describing how you feel about
something that just happens so often
time you can uncover bias by doing that
so if you find yourself in a situation
where there's a conflict talk to another
party and describe what actually
happened and get feedback you might even
need not need the feedback in that case
and you can also learn a tremendous
amount from mentoring someone who's
different from you suggest women in my
role I'm very oftentimes the only female
on a panel or in a meeting and what you
can do to take these allies steps is not
only make things open to all people but
in actively invite encourage and follow
women invite speakers to your panel if
you're invited to a panel and there
aren't any women on the panel suggest
women that you know actively go out and
invite them to participate and follow
them on Twitter follow them in other
social media networks so you're here and
that makes you awesome I do believe
these small micro actions can come
together and make a collective change
do you remember though you met you may
make mistakes you may not get the credit
that you think you deserve but any small
action really does make a difference and
I believe that my success in technology
really has been a result of the allies
mentors and sponsors that I have had in
the tech world and together we can be
the change that we wish to see and
changing the ratio between men
and women working on the technology
solutions that are being created today
that are affecting everyone around the
world so I encourage you to take one of
these actions today and you can follow
me on twitter at Heather VC if you want
to ask questions since I've used all of
the time here today in our quickie
session I'll be here the rest of tonight
I also have a Boff session tonight at 7
o'clock talking about the Java community
process so you can find me there
