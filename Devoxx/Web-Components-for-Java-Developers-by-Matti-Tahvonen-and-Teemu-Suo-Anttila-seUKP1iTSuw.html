our presentation
it's about web components and it's for
Java developers naturally because we are
in a Java conference and my name is
mater Dornan and I'm Dames won't tell
them so I work nowadays as a developer
advocate at our marketing department I
used to be a real engineer but now I'm
failed so they moved me aside and that's
why I have PMO here so demo works ok so
you don't have all the phones so yeah
maybe our slides might be a bit dizzy
but let's try to go with those so there
is a real engineer and what are you
doing I'm basically developing our
open-source framework and quite a lot of
related projects around spring and c-d-i
integration for example yeah and on
today's agenda we will discuss a bit
about web components what kind of
standard is it how - of you have
actually googled web components what
does it mean just a couple of hands of I
guess a brief overview of what came up
cabinets are is very good things to have
and then we will also discuss about our
upcoming one-in-ten which contains a
really nice job a framework to use these
web components to build real
applications out of those components so
this is like a typical today's single
page web applications where you have
lots of components and this is not
actually even bad because it it's kind
of consistence there is like same class
names all over again and there is
probably some kind of a framework which
is used to build this this application
but it doesn't really help if there is a
developer who needs to start up finding
out ok there is a part on this area
what's the file that I need to change
because the dome itself doesn't describe
the structure of the application but web
components it will make things much
easier because we can define elements
like custom elements here we have
expenses application and then we have
neon animated pages and login page those
are all
components and also web components it
provides you like a protection from
other web components and from
development practices so web components
it's collection of emerging standards
custom elements shadow DOM HTML
in-person HTML template and let's go
through all of these and discuss a bit
of these what they mean so custom
elements it's kind of the mother of
these all standards and it allows you to
define custom elements so most HTML
developers or web developers they only
have these basic input elements and then
they have div element then span and
paragraph and with web components you
can create your own element you can use
some JavaScript to extend HTML element
as in this case or then you can extend
like div element or any existing HTML on
it and build your application or believe
your web component from that and then
you can define those into your context
and then you can just start using those
in your HTML application then there is
this shadow Dom which actually provides
this protection so inside a set of root
you your for example CSS they cannot
leak outside from your web components so
if you have been doing a lot of like
JavaScript development and used various
widgets you might have spotted out
issues that if you take one JavaScript
component into your single plate web
application then something else breaks
on some other part of the web page
because CSS anchors they might leak to
another component or like normal HTML
structure that you have there and third
one relates to actually reusing these
web components so just with with just
with the shadow DOM and custom elements
you can already build those web
components but if you want to share
those then HTML import this pretty nice
thing so you can define your
web component in a1 HTML snippet and
then you can import that into your web
application and it just start using it
then HTML template is something that
some people like to use but you don't
actually need it
it contains template tag which is
actually just attacked which is not
rendered anywhere and then you can
define some structure there it can also
contain like other web components if
needed and then you can use this
template inside your application so in
this code snippet there is this
container div and then there is some
JavaScript where we take the template
defined earlier and then replicate that
template into the alliant and these
standards are not actually standards yet
they are just working drafts but the
browser support that actually looks much
better so many of the Prowse already
support or let's say chrome supports
everything but like major browsers also
like other like Safari Firefox edge and
also ie lemon you can use web components
there with polyfills so polyfills are
like small Summer Street widgets which
kind of enhance your browser a bit and
then you can use these standards with
with the API and everything at least in
theory everything just works of course
using these polo fields they make your
application bit slower but at least you
can start using these emerging standards
today already
and framework support is getting better
all the time so if you for example have
tried to use web components in old
angular versions then they you could use
them but it didn't think that much it
for you there but the latest angular
that has much better support and in
volume framework for example we have a
add-on for that where you can use like
create custom components for voting
using web components and the next
version which is going to be bought in
flow the Java portal for voting 10 that
will have like it it's natively just use
that components so in a summary web
components they provide you
encapsulation and information hiding for
that that's the probably the best part
of web components so you can actually
share those components with different
project without any collisions then it
also helps a lot to distribute these
components and cleans up the DOM and in
general it helps a lot those people's
who consume those components but it's
actually not helping too much to build
those component there is actually more
things for component developers to think
about and also it doesn't make that
application like it's no silver bullet
which makes you that application web
platform a good place to write those
applications so we will still need
frameworks to build web applications and
it doesn't fix the fact that web is
actually not designed for applications
but for documents what in elements is a
project that we actually started quite
many years ago we were really early with
web components and and we have been
building this elements for a while and
some of our like existing users have
been wondering that what the hell are
they going to teach Java at like
completely because we have been building
that primarily for like front-end
developers who work in the browser and
now with Warren then we are actually
combining these two tracks and starting
you to be using those components from
the Java framework as well and elements
currently has a lot of components it
contains all the boring components that
you need for business applications and
then there are some more advanced one
and lots of charts or charts even more
charts and practically everything that
you need to build basic applications
like business applications and then they
if you want to go go what about chrome
and see the whole listing I don't want
to go through them here that's not the
case here and one thing more about our
voron elements and other web components
go to this address there is a lot of web
components that you can use with boring
elements
today so if there is something missing
from Valen elements you can still keep
using those and pick one component from
some other vendor but I think there is a
Java developer mainly I think web
components don't help you - but yeah not
too much yeah
and that's what we need the Java
framework and they were going to that we
will I'm all quite often saying that web
is not a good place to make I have
applications but just to note this or
make some this more efficient I'd like
to quote this beat hunt who is the guy
behind this reactive framework from
Facebook and he said this in Java one a
couple of years ago that the
technologies are not designed for
documents if you would be building a UI
toolkit it wouldn't look nothing like a
DOM and this is really true its web is
very good for documents but it's not for
dynamic applications and also the markup
language that we like to use well
XML is not strictly HTML but it's pretty
much the same crap so that's why we need
those frameworks and most of the web
framers they actually come from the
document model and then they try to
somehow n has that to be a good like an
application platform but with warning we
have taken like completely different
kind of solution so we we have been
coming from the standard UI library side
and we have just adopted that to use web
as a rendering engine and originally
actually like more than 10 years ago
when we started with volume frameworks
and we had an idea that we could
actually use multiple rendering
technologies we wouldn't need to stick
to web only we could have like a swing
rendering engine and then we could have
something for the mobile devices but now
there's even mobile devices they are
just using the HTML rendering so we have
kind of slipped from that but still you
can see it when you use boring so
your hair doesn't work yes it so body
rotting is all Java and you are using
component like in Java you will
instantly add new components you will
compose new component it's from existing
components and it's almost like working
with a swing or SBT and much closer to
that when compared to lilac using
standard request based web application
frameworks or any single page web
application framework theater and it has
a really strong abstraction of the whole
client-server model so this is maybe
like the most significant feature in
volume frameworks it we get for example
has quite similar model but still there
you will see the page changes and you
will need to think about how how the
communication works a bit involving
that's like completely transparent and
most often you will kind of forget that
you are building a web application you
are just building a UI and then what it
will take care of all that communication
and no need to expose any red services
or anything and often those developers
who come from standard UI framework
table feel like really much like home
when they start to use voice I don't
remember how many times I have heard
today so this is like swing right yeah
it's it's like swing but you will get an
awesome web applications of of it we
actually started really long time ago we
the company was founded like 2001 and
the first open-source product was
released 2002 and since then we have
been developing all the time as the web
has been developing diverse this kind of
Ajax revolution then we switch from
server-side rendering so we used to be
pretty much like JSF but but of course
with the Java API but we did all the
rendering on the server side and when
somebody reacted with the UI then we it
went back to the server render the new
HTML page gave that to the user but at
that point boring applications really
became like much much more usable since
then we have been upgrading the
client-side couple
of times moving from plain JavaScript to
the Google web toolkit based rendering
and then we have implemented server-side
posts using WebSockets and a lot of lot
of lot of different graphs advances and
now we are making the next next big
change by incorporating these foreign
elements divided in 10 and body then
it's open source like the core of it is
open source elements is about 2 license
and the Java framework floating flow
that's also a busty license and then we
need to pay demos salary so we have some
commercial tooling there and then we
have some commercial like a starter
packages and then we provide services
for bonding users and that's for how we
actually finance the like the most
significant part of voting platform we
always try to make usability like a
super good and also that includes
developer usability so we want to make
development with voting as smooth as
possible and as efficient as possible
and we do that even by sacrificing like
performance or server-side memory
consumption so those are we want to make
you to build applications as fast as
possible and make those applications as
good as possible and we do that by this
component based abstraction so let's see
how our intent works so demo which use
such as our users to use this kind of
code no yes so this this is actually
like the really low-level usage that you
can do now with one intent so there is
now wrappers for all elements so you can
create input element or even create
button element and then you can just set
the attributes there at Eve Elvis
Turner's and then you can also
synchronize property like there which
kind of lets one inflow know that this
property should be changed from the
server side not from the client side to
the server side and visa versa so if if
we update the value from the server side
API it goes
the client and and the other way around
and this is what you can use when you
build new components like like really
low level components and for example if
you have a web component it's element
will like just normal input element from
float side so that's why water flow
actually it doesn't provide any special
support for web components but it
provides support for elements and that's
basically enough let's look about then a
bit more advanced example so here we
have a Google map FEM component so
Google is the main developer here in the
web components area and so they have
Google map also as a back home on it so
you can just different attack in your
web application and then you can make it
visible and here we are letting morning
flow note that this street map should be
using Google map tag name or the
client-side then we also do the HTML
import for the actual Google map
component and then we can just set
properties that we want to use there and
then from the Java side its use its
usage we control like really simple you
just instantly at the component and then
call some Java for it
and this is actually one component that
you will be using soon soonish india in
the sign it's going to stand here for
the whole presentation and it's just
actually yeah do something so we are
going to do something really really
stupid so i've seen quite a lot of live
coding examples here in devoxx and lots
of them have failed and we will probably
fail as well because we are using
developer preview version of our product
and we are going to build a application
called trippy and it contains a listing
of trips and then it contains a
visualization so if you select any of
these these rows on the table then it
will show it on the map and also it's
built like well it's built allocating
you can talk more about I can talk more
about this yeah
so let's take a quick look so in here we
have the basic
main layout so we always want to have to
Google map show in every single view of
the application we want to show the map
because the map is quite important when
you are visualizing your car trips from
location to another location then we are
going to have a table that is going to
list everything that we have so the old
one we used to have this piece over here
it kind of had some automatically
generated test data in the US so I had
to change it a bit of course because we
are not in the US we are in a much nicer
place and then this trip list also
contains a button there are yes and that
button can be used to create new trips
and then when we will click the button
it goes to view where there is more
input elements so there is text fields
from where and date field and then the
Save button and when you click that it
goes to the server and it saves actually
the spring booth based database yes and
yeah let's bill this okay but of course
we will be cheating so for example this
google map component that we showed
earlier this is already in the project
but now we are having a problem as this
thing over here is not not so easy to
see so let's see if we can scale it a
bit mm-hmm I think we cannot scale it
you can
everything works just small demo effect
yeah that that was much much bigger
already so can you see the code over
here I hope so
so first off we have the bane layout I'm
cheating a bit I already have basically
all the classes in place but the
implementations are more or less missing
so this is something we're going to use
as the basic layout for every single
page it is defined to be a ruler layout
so I can use it when I'm navigating from
page to page like the page layout for
every page yeah and this is extending
the most simple component available so
it's called division so it's basically
the div element in the UI and there we
are adding this trip map which is a
single down here for like that or not a
single dot but basically a u.s. code you
what eloped thingy that you add there
yeah and we also have a style sheet that
contains not so much CSS but it's like a
basic setup for the application but
let's take a look at what what it looks
like over here so Google Maps is routing
and there I can actually see there's
Antwerp nice I can zoom in a bit
where's Kinney police over there
nice so this seems to be pretty much
working already
but as I can see I don't have the table
listing and I don't have the buttons
over there so let's take a look at the
trip list and this is actually much more
interesting component in general because
it contains this route annotation so
this is actually the view the main view
we have the route so these maps this
view into the server's like or servlets
route yeah and whenever user comes here
without any parameters in the URL it
loads this default view and this is also
a managed bean by default so we can use
all the wires there so this is supreme
Buddha plication and the trip tree
poster is just at JP a repository that
we have there
distort the tricks so let's try to get
something on the screen so I have the
great compound over there I want some
items in their repository find all and I
think we want to sort them by descending
date so the newest ones are going to be
on the top and the old ones are going to
be on the bottom yeah and this grid
component this comes from the body in
elements but it also has this Chara API
which we have bought Ematic lee created
based on the web component api so we can
add a couple of columns here basically
we want to show like what day and we had
like where where do we start from and
where are we actually going like this
and then I want to add it to the UI
right that lets see or one class
reloaded so it should all look at it
it's it's in the wrong wrong place yeah
so by default we don't say any size for
this we could use sizing API so we could
set this set width there but I think you
can also add us like a style name for it
CSS class name I I think we had
something pre-configured there I guess
it was trip list maybe yeah so now the
CSS that we have prepared before folks
in the div web component and its size is
it bit smaller and we can actually see
the map as well but it's still not
actually showing anything because I
don't do anything with the grid yeah so
the next step would be the kind of a
click listener to the grid and then from
the click listener we can take the
selected trip and give it to the map
component and tell it to visualize this
route or treat okay so
I'm going to add a value change this
dinner here it's gonna call actually now
that we are here should we actually make
it so that for each trip there's like a
unique URL for it yeah we could do that
you could really easily let just like
call what what was it
yeah I had this navigate to however that
I need to do yeah you could directly go
to the map and set the trip there but
that would kind of break the experience
for end users and this is where we need
to think about the web a bit
so if user would just select one row
there in the application and then he
would like to send this direct link to
his friend with like a slack or Skype
then that link wouldn't actually go to
the place where the user expected so if
user copies URL from the browser he kind
of expect that one who received that URL
gets exactly the same view so that's why
we need to use a special route through
API here and use to navigate to method
there and we will give there a parameter
which is the trip and then we will use
the trips ID from the database as a kind
of a qualifier for the URL and and then
we will use to navigate to method to go
to this URL and now it it is almost
there so now we just need to manage how
do we change the display when the ID is
set so if the ID doesn't exist then I
don't want to show anything so by
default my trip will be no in many
business application there are lots of
views where you do not actually need
this kind of deep linking but this for
this demo we wanted to show that it's
also pretty easy to start off with
writing as well
so I want great to show the selection
there like that and I want my map to
actually
show the trip itself yeah and now you
will probably get a eternal loop so make
there one more oh yeah click listener so
I don't want to navigate if this change
is not coming from the client yeah so
basically if there is an our new user
who comes with the direct URL it will
also call this value sense listener in
the Creed so in that case we don't
actually want to do the same thing again
and again and again yeah let's see one
class we load it again so we only want
to react to the value change listeners
if they come from the client directly so
then I'll see now if you click there it
feel it should visualize the route so
let's go from Amsterdam to Antwerp yeah
and now if you look to the address bar
you can see that there is this pen which
is the identifier of this trip and now
if you just reload the page or open it
in a new tab you automatically get to
this page even though it was not anymore
in the same state yeah in the same
single page state that is gonna be the
scrolling of the table was kind of off
but yeah but that's basically the only
only one so if I would make manually
couch.you trick number five that process
well alright so let's go to the next
step so we wanted to oh yeah we need the
root root link to add the new trip yeah
so we want to have the functionality add
new routes as well and we already have
this class for for new like filling in
new routes and it was called virtual
link rule no it's it's called a trip
view but then we will use this root link
which is standard HTML on anchor
elements so it's basically a normal link
but it's actually doing the navigation
bit more efficient fleet and normal link
would do because it doesn't reload the
whole page so if you would use the
standard
anchor element it would actually make a
page refresh on the client-side but note
that we are using this Rooter link which
is special component in or extension of
element involved in flow it will make
the navigation on the server side and
then it will only render the changed
parts of the view so basically with this
Rooter link when you if you go now to
the browser and if you now click the new
plus button that you add it there it
doesn't render the whole page but it's
just swept listing into this add new
route form yeah and let's take a look at
add trip class that we have over here so
yeah you notice most likely that there
was already content there because this
is actually using a polymer template
yeah so involving actually earlier in
the presentation I used quotation marks
when I was in all Java it's also only if
you want to do it in all in Java so many
teams nowadays have like a special
front-end developers as well but with
forum flow you can use those templates
that these guys create and you can use
those with your body and application as
well and this is kind of an example of
that kind of a design could you open the
HTML file that has this them so
basically we have the HTML import that
defines that we have this trip formed
the HTML file that contains the actual
code and in here we have a bunch of
extra imports because we kind of need
some stuff from so basically we are
using other web components here in this
template and if you scroll down there is
some styles which is related to this
view only and then there are the actual
components so we have labels and VAR in
text fields just like we actually
defined in did we have some example I
think we did so just like you would
define from the from the Java code but
you can define them in here in the XML
if you like but you don't need and then
we can hook the actual business logic to
this view in the Java class so we have
these
IDs for some of the elements and these
ideas basically we want to map them I'm
cheating again
don't look at me yeah we were supposed
to be using spring tools dev tools here
but it still doesn't work with this new
version this Developer Preview so we
needed to use just a debug mode to make
this presentation bit smoother so that's
why the fields further previously so
basically this tells modding the flow
that in the template over there there
are these four fields that I'm
interested in and it will basically map
these Java objects that I'm going to
have here kind of outer wired into those
corresponding objects define it the HTML
template yeah
so in this treat we are going to use the
data binding which is actually one of
the reasons why you would like to use
this kind of a server-side framework so
we can pretty easily bind the business
object it is just say be a entity in
this case but you could use of course
DTO if you would like to limit the scope
there so binder is the tool that we can
use to bind the properties from Java
object to the input fields in the in
this UI so practically we can do pointer
to point so from is the starting point
and you can define Gators or cetera stir
or then you can also define it with the
reflection so you can maybe use that for
the two fields so here yeah well this
isn't yeah the last one was date and
then also you can like use like
completely name based pointing so you
can just take in all the properties from
the trip end at the end point those
automatically the names found in this
place but this is bit more safer this
way and now we created a new business
object so we are going to only add
the trips here and we bind that JPI
entity to these fields as well you could
use this actually to edit one of those
already existing trips instead of
calling a new trip you would get the
trip instance from somewhere and just
put it to the binder and it would update
values of the components from that trip
and then you could modify them and send
save it later and I guess because this
is kind of boring if nothing happens on
the screen I'm just gonna add a quick
value change listener here so whenever
someone goes and modifies the values of
any of the fields there any of the
fields there I went to preview to trip
with from Q and actually since we're
coming to new UI here I kind of want to
clear to Tripp that it's currently
showing just so that I don't have
anything extra on screen all right that
should be yeah most of it anyway right
so then the browser what what failed
okay restored it's gonna take a moment
my laptop is a potato yeah I need to get
a new one this 2013 MacBook Pro starting
to slow down really badly
yeah you could actually start typing the
actual saving to the database as well
yeah and I'm just gonna quickly do here
so a bit later when I'm gonna hopefully
not restart the server again but like
just you know debug reload stuff I want
that whenever to use at least a Save
button
I want to I'm gonna use the ugly hack
that we have here let me go to and
you'll probably want to save it storage
to the repository and the returning
objects which have a ID a permanent one
yeah but let's take a look so right now
it should work more or less so we can
start a trick from go from unfair
protocol because I want to go home yeah
meet you I'm going to go so we are going
to invite a ring okay so there you could
see the preview so now we'd still
haven't then we'll still didn't click
the Save button
so it has previewed this route and now
if we click Save it didn't compile yet
okay so let's let's do compile it like
this one classes reload it nice so now
we can actually save our trip to do it
back home like this yeah so we can see
it from the listing and you can see that
there is a new idea signed for it it
seems to be you know thousand and one
and it went all the way to do the back
to the database just from the Java code
and this is the this is the thing that
makes you really efficient with vari and
you can directly connect with your
back-end you don't need to think about
any any client-server communication at
all all in Java yeah and of course if
you have some rest services then you can
use those from Java but it's actually
easier to use straight services from
Java and from browser because you don't
have any cross
cross domain restrictions at all no
trust remain problems and actually with
the way that this is working so if I
have some sensitive information for
example in a person being I can not send
that information to the client site at
all yeah if I don't know so the
development model also like it makes you
more secure by default as well yeah so
this is pretty much all that we already
talked during the thing steaming about
theming so Boden doesn't provide any
kind of abstraction for the trouble
users for the teaming but you can just
use poor CSS and then we also have a
pretty good helpers for you to create
like custom themes so we have also we
had also like a previous version of this
built with sass so which is
syntactically awesome styles it and
there you can just provide some
variables and then if you'll
automatically give you the new styles it
based on these variables and then you
don't need to configure or theme each
and every component separately but you
can just declare some colors some
metrics and then you will get the theme
that you want and this is now using more
modern JavaScript techniques that I have
no idea of I have lost my eye
I used to be the only JavaScript
developer in our company but I have no
idea of this new CSS stuff anyhow the
presentation about that in the company
but I guess you were eating some pea
soup that yes didn't join us we need to
have some traditions and all this going
for free super Thursdays so this is a
small video ver where we are changing
these variables directly and there you
can see the changes that happen on the
UI there are two built-in themes so
there is the ball of one that you can
easily customize and then we also have
like a material design team available
for all the components but that's not
that easily customizable the aim there
is just that if you happen to be using
Google's material they what's what's the
component I don't remember
the name they have this what is this
material button yeah
yeah and then they have fields which
look like at the material design and
you're gonna use then mix these
components with the Google's ones so as
I said we are currently in the Developer
Preview with this one in ten you can
come to our booth to see it how it works
and try it out and then you can get this
kind of a cool t-shirt and the source is
for this component or this exercise is
available in the G tub but consider it
to be really Developer Preview so don't
don't make your applications based on
that we have actually better solutions
for that so we have this bakery AB
starter and then we have a beverage
buddy starter the bakery one that
contains all of our tooling including
the commercial ones and this proved very
that example application contains only
the open-source components so you can
get started completely free and these
are like much better starting points for
your own applications and boring
components they are all designed also
for mobile users so you can build pretty
awesome like mobile applications as well
with volume framework and what inflow
this is like this is the bakery
application that we have there it
contains basically all the components
that we have like like the basic
business components then it contains
some of those charting things as well I
think I'm not sure if they are covered
in this video
yeah I'm pretty sure that don't the
dashboard is gonna be a couple of charts
yeah visible over there and I guess this
is also using the board for getting yeah
yes the board is one of those commercial
components that contains like a
responsive design component where you
can just place your component and give
them some parameters and then they will
be displayed respecting the screen size
of your end-user so
all that is available for you from
Vardhan come go there we like to build
help developers to build web
applications that user loves that's our
model thank you
so I guess there are some void in
framework users here as well available
yeah couple of couple of users who have
been using volume premier before I guess
at least you might have some kind of
questions this new web component things
that has raised quite a lot of concerts
among amongst our users so how do you
feel about this do you have any
questions yeah there
so the question was how would it look
like if you would take any kind of
random web component and you would like
to use it with morning
you can do that already today actually
with this one add-on that I mentioned
with voting framework and but it will be
much more easier with the next one in
ten and with bottom law so there we have
a tool which automatically takes the
properties from the web component and
automatically generates the API for it
I could actually saw the one slide there
earlier about the Google Map component
here so this is how you can do it
manually so you can define the API
manually and use the properties tester
previously you needed to create like a
Google web toolkit component to do this
but now you can just use the java api on
the server side to modify the Dom so
doing components is actually much more
easier in one in ten but then you're
going to use this tooling this
automatically tooling which creates you
like it creates you Java API
automatically and we are actually using
that in our own components as well and
then for certain components like for
voting creed maybe make some
enhancements for it because we want to
kind of customize the JavaScript API
because it doesn't necessarily match
perfectly for the for the server-side
Java API test we want to use did that
answer to your question yeah okay any
other questions
yep
what about testing the UI yeah that kind
of depends on what you want to test one
option is to use MVP pattern and there
you will separate a kind of the business
logic of the UI layer to one class and
then you can create unit tests for that
you can exchange a unit and those tests
are like really fast to execute but
that's gonna be hard as well because
then you probably use Java EE or spring
and then you have managed pins and then
you will need to use some other tooling
third wire it all together and that's
why I often such as to use also like
real integration tests which test your
application using browser so you can use
selenium basic selenium and then we also
have a commercial tool called boring
test bench which is basically additions
to selenium it contains like a boring
specific selector library so you can use
Java API which contains all the
component implementations and you can
for example select one single row from
the Creed much more easier than two code
to do the same thing with XPath or some
or some other selectors that are
available in the standard selenium and
also that contains small helpers that
will actually know a little bit how the
communication works between Warren's
client side and the server side and this
makes certain tests much more easier
because you don't need to do the things
that you typically do with single page
web application testing using selenium
then you will have to think when the
browser is actually ready rendering the
response from the server for example so
in many cases you will need to write
codes that wait for this element to be
present or then you will just need to
use random timeouts in certain places
and most of them with one dispense you
don't need to do that so it really helps
to write this kind of browser level
tests
more questions more questions we still
have three minutes okay yeah yeah yeah
they basically make the changes so that
now what if you I haven't used angular
that much but now if you use angular to
bind some property you can do it
directly to the web components properly
and it works natively with with the web
components as well so so it should be
much easier if you go to it's called can
occur with browser to custom elements
everywhere you know this web page
actually contains the studies of how web
components works and with different
different things and this latest angular
version angular for that actually got
like 30 points so because angular is
also built by Google so I I guess they
got some kind of a mighty call from the
upper management that you need to make
it work with that components as well so
they are kind of competing with polymer
team and an angular team inside Google
but they also cooperate and now angular
latest angular works really well with
web components that are typically built
with polymer and I think I didn't
actually mention that we are also using
polymer quite a lot so most of the
components that we build we inside the
body in elements process we are using
polymer there to do the heavy lifting
because if you would be writing
everything by like manually with
JavaScript it would be much more effort
than by using polymer so polymer
contains like data binding for the
client side stuff like bit like that we
had there in the Java side okay any
other questions one and a half minutes
time
yeah
so we will be staying still tomorrow at
our booth we have still a couple of
hundred t-shirts you can come there and
try out for in and you can get these
funny t-shirts and we will be answering
their - even trickier questions if you
have such thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
