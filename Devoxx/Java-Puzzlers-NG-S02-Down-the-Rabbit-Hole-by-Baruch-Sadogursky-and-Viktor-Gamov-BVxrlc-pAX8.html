hey this is very annoyed yeah Victor
ganas global advocated hazel cast and
the park silly goose key developers the
kid at the G from his abdomens on the
internet and he's jay Park on the
internet yeah you got it we do it a lot
right it was like yeah it was very here
yeah exactly okay now this is completely
stole an idea this is what we do we take
good ideas of other people and make them
even more awesome you know who those
guys are yes to us this is important
part when you need to speak because yeah
well get a little get that but you know
but you need you really start new ish
itself who they are just love thank you
very much and and the angelika another
guy yeah okay good one yeah so it's
going to be like the in the 10 years
this representation by borrow and the
other guys yes someone will do this
slide enough energy will be yeah well
this is your book and this is new
governor and they are two of the fathers
of Java and they invented these the
whole Java partners thing and they call
themselves the clicker hack the type it
brothers first time they did it was in
2001 a long time ago 16 years ago and
then it was so successful they are
booked out of their paddlers and the
book is called the Java puzzlers and
we're happy the t-shirt this is how the
book looks like a pretty much ho ho prob
the book oh who has it like who has the
book when's the book good good it's a
good book it's a little bit outdated but
it's your own book now yeah yeah maybe
ok 06 well we need to buy the rest of
the stuff that they have an amazon and
just give away the people who don't know
at this book right that's a good idea
good i hear those are always new shorts
or throwing the books right yeah yeah so
as I mentioned we journey with few stops
so the format is stolen from those guys
yet because one of the the Jewish guy
not a Russian guys what we do it's kind
of coming
with the deal and and most of the
content is stolen from this guy but now
the gear is absolutely awesome he wrote
is he's a big big shot in in Java
especially in Java 8 swings lambdas and
all these stuff you can see is crazier
ratings and scores golden pages in
whatever we never can get there yeah in
the second floor and most of the content
is actually from tagged hijo de Geer
thank you very much and we have more
contributors a two-vehicle senko thanks
sir gay and he's in Oracle working on
Jillian performance and we have some
buffers from Sergei as well and of
course our dear friends drinks thank you
very much to drink and he threw it works
on Gradle and they have a lot of fun
with gifs of those days right so we have
a password on jigsaw a by a Cedric as
well yeah yeah so this is what we do
like we are in Java so we integrate so
we took format from one place questions
from others and integrate them together
and needlessly well yes and needless to
say that the involving a podcast and the
G frogs investing in lots of in Java
modest of the products written in Java
and runs on JVM exactly and this is this
is why we care about that this is why we
did it and and now let's talk about
rules so they're all so simple there are
two guys on stage and that will be us or
at least were trying to be yeah we have
funny and puzzling questions chances are
they're both funny and Portland we'll
see about that and now here's the
important part right this is an
interaction ille session you have people
to record interactive you have to
participate you have to think you said
and vote so we will interact with
audience and the audience need to
interact with us exactly right so in
chances are you want to know the answer
and you will be like what is this
very simple like after first question
you still need to vote just because it's
fun and the other thing is we have four
answers for each question which give you
twenty-five percent or
getting the right answer right now if
you get the right answer twice in a row
the person sits next to you will think
that you're very smart right and there
is literally nothing to lose so keep
walking when you had no idea and and
you'll get there very soon let's do I
need to also explore this you know maybe
i will answer some puzzles correct yeah
this is what we do for example right we
generally have no idea so we just we
just get em t-shirts we have t-shirts
sponsored by hazel cast this time thank
you very much and most of you are hazel
cut employees so you don't need hello
girls t-shirts that the few of you who
are not and we will get a t-shirt if you
have a right answer or you can explain
this right answer yeah it's not it's not
it's not important that you have right
answer you can explain it right yeah
everyone getting is very easy learning
t-shirts not so much so not only will
have another item so you have to explain
why you think it's an item for a t-shirt
right yes alright and we have official
Twitter hashtags Java puzzlers mg and
juice ends for next generation we will
talk about this a little bit later we
have a explanation about this ng thing
all right and a devil serious is them a
hashtag for deviltry are so when you are
get excited this stall is so good don't
hold it us a beggar and tweet all right
yeah you can tweet pictures but pictures
of us not be not not on the screen don't
spoil okay and of course the first rule
of puzzlers is no cheating so whoever do
you have your laptop open do not close
relatives do not run these puzzlers in
in intellij or or or try to otherwise
google dancers just because it's some
fun yeah don't do that and we have a
popular party show yeah just everything
works together exactly okay now we are
going to practice this voting thing
right so that's very easy just to raise
your hand when using them to write which
were java version are you own who is
good working reductions of a poor
production production who works with
java 7
oh that that's weird likelike a third of
the audience that's weird okay and it's
not a key to cast employees okay ginate
okay everybody I'm gonna go too much
nice okay that sounds are good good good
good good donning in production anybody
in production v your laptop with my
production got it got it all right how
about java 6 Gemma fix anyone java 6
here are a couple of guys that need to
maintain this crap all right em now
watch all five do we have over guys
that's a good stuff annotations generic
jellified really really good no okay how
much our our regular guy is not here
like yeah the one that the one that
works on jello 124 is not here with us
today we have this guy following us
around no not that one are you okay
that's good that's good it's good job
everybody everyone is crazy yeah and
that's good because most of our puzzles
are about debate so you should all get
t-shirts soon enough people who raise
their hands for java 9 they would have a
puzzle for you so and that will be that
will decrease basically all right okay
okay we'll see about that over well so
yeah this this is what we should expect
right that that's that's just fine and
get Freddie yeah so embrace embrace it
so don't worry if you don't understand
something it's normal this is how this
session is designed and that's a lot of
fun oh yeah so yeah we checked
everything is war than like what last
update or doesn't work as designed at
least on last update of Java 8 and 9 and
little bit right yeah it's you that we
can sodium and the challenge accepted
alright let's do that okay so the first
one is about some Russian hackers who
are trying to head the bank we have no
idea who those guys are and let's see
the count right so what we see here is a
very strange we modeling a bank system
by using Java five fewer member
semaphore
and so we have a bank account which is
represented by the semaphore and then we
have two operations like chit bonds in
which we check available pyramids and we
also use vine pyramids to implement
drain tako money method right so those
are the two and now we just try to take
all the money from this bank and then
check the balance right and of course
the committee here is that we try to
initiate our bank account in an
overdraft okay so this is puzzle for me
and the way how I I need to think about
this right I guess options yeah yeah of
course but that still I shall order you
see some problems here of course yes
first option is illegal argument
exception you cannot initiate the
semaphore with a negative number yes the
second one is unsupported operation
exception you cannot drain permits when
you are in overdraft already the third
one will be zero and the fourth is minus
42 okay i think i will go with
unsupported operation exception because
you cannot drain like a negative thing
because how you drain negative thing so
who fixes a is that illegal argument
exception you're not even construct a
semaphore with a negative number so you
need to watch so if who thinks is a they
need to write their hands and who have
no idea I just guess all right okay
there we go the things the same as me
it's Abby it's unsupported duration
exception yeah here we go couple to
thank you thank you guys how about zero
okay all right okay and how about mom is
42 when you drain for negative you still
get negative all right ok so those are
the hand logic because logic yes and and
of course the correct answer or
depreciate what how all right answer
so robbery right so I think we see is
the example of very very very
unsuccessful robbery also this robbery
was implemented with semaphores and yes
yeah well not all right how can you a
successful can you explain this why this
happening well I don't think that is
like or maybe someone in the audience
can hear many any ideas why draining
from minus 40 to get you 20 it just sets
it to 0 well yeah that is what there is
no much experience exactly because it is
what it is basically yeah and and and
the thing is first of all you definitely
can initiate a semaphore with a negative
number that's fine sometimes it's usable
right when you are in the position that
sand crabs need to be deposited first
before you can start doing something so
that's okay it's a little bit weird but
fine and the thing is the other is
reindeer meat acquires and returns all
the permits that are immediately
available and here is the thing how many
pyramids are available in minus 40 2-40
to know how many available 0 so how many
term means should be acquired and return
0 0 so what should be the result of this
operation zero how how why don't you
watch until result- 42 we take over
available permits from minus 42 and
there are 0 available pyramids the end
result should be minus 42 but no the
result is 0 this is very confusing and
it actually a bad was opened about that
and they just said no well the people
say people yeah it's by design and
people understand what we met and
actually hear the audience most of you
voted for 0 that means that you'll
understand because of logic because of
logic yeah oh yeah okay whatever yeah
okay so I know now now I understand how
to play this game so I can also ask
yes no available not whatever is there
available no and it takes all the
permits that are available now and
return them how many permits are
available when minus 42 yeah so that's
yeah exactly all right yeah this why we
have the picture from princess bride
yeah oh here we go but there is the box
there I'll do mine are get all right
thank you thank you all right okay so I
know how to play this game so and let's
play two favorite game singletons yeah
so that picture means don't write single
dong Jun drink to excess okay yeah all
right okay let's do that yeah sometimes
you you know when they mature enough is
a developer you just stop writing
Singleton's it should start drinking
yeah singleton all right so here's the
thing so I have two things here um the
way how I can create empty list in the
MC iterator for people who use Java five
I guess it's like very familiar like
this kind of operations and I just want
to know like what this result would be
is it like single tone or not single
tone like can we do this kind of like
comparison can we compare them or it's
not fair compare so in I have some some
options to you that also obviously
options cover all the possible of
exactly right yes because logic alright
no surprises here and and I would say
that's obvious in both those both
factories the empty list and empty
iterator return singletons because what
they return contained no state so it
makes perfect sense to reuse it so I say
22 ok who thinks is a true truly the
same as Barca okay one two three okay 33
people who faces be true false that you
can create empty legal right but it also
will be the thing the empty provider has
steak okay let me just see mtdc as a
state inch iterator doesn't have a state
okay people and they both not equals
well it's not it's not actually single
tone it will create instances each and
every time no one yeah thank you very
much all right so yeah and the right
answer is of course I'm right okay
because there are actually no butter of
them right it behaves exactly as you
expect they should be Singleton's and
they are yes otherwise you're creating
you know if you're using a lot of your
kids a lot of garbage so so it wasn't
for my life okay so Java 8 my friends so
it brings a lot of interesting things so
including stream API which is very
useful in convenient tool to write like
data pipe lines on your collections bulk
operational collections uh-huh and there
is a new concept of how this can be this
collection can be operated called
splitter Raider okay so and also there
are convenience method that allow you
create empty stream or empty spot Raider
so in my ass so in this case we kind of
go in from Java 52 java 8 you know
skipping java 6 and 7 thank you yes and
now we have a streams to operate on
collections and now we have the traitor
to iterate over collections instead of
the traitors so I guess the options will
be the same option pretty much and and i
would say it still behave the same ok go
this is a hey me ok who thinks is be in
the first place / traitor can create in
so splitter a turn in a single term and
then stream is not is not um what this
is see what about be did you ask about
me yes do I one what about be be once
again oh yeah couple okay three hands
for hands thank you who did you see okay
all right and how about be none of them
are single tongues okay all right that's
good selection good luck thank you for
your holding okay so in the right answer
here is Tom so this single dose price
back what okay so let's ask maybe
someone in our audience know what
exactly is happening here know that the
real question is why the hell streams of
empty does not return single why is that
okay why
no you cannot renew streams that good
good good yeah but what's the wood speed
so someone else so what you get other
your streams and you're very close to
eat is where I asked like why you can
introduce three wine so what does it
mean that the key you cannot restream in
terms of the object I think it's a
t-shirt anyway just because we have tons
of t-shirts yeah what size like yours
medium so the thing is you cannot reuse
streams and that means that whether the
stream being used or not in state and if
it is staged at it it means that it can
be singleton and canvassing plus there's
another interesting thing or even an
empty string you can attach a call back
to when what happens when the stream is
closed and of course this Kovac is
another piece of state right so you can
have to empty streams one of them reuse
them we already used another is not yet
used that's a difference but also we can
have to empty streams with different
callbacks on clothes and of course that
means that they have different side they
cannot be the same object yes so in this
case it is it behaves if you know it's a
factory yeah yeah so just produces
multiple objects so don't worry is it
now not a single one it's one of the
puzzles where it's actually useful but
you know we get in there we get in there
for more more useless puzzle you're the
sauce okay well we'll get a little
ridiculous use reference okay so this is
as basically right that just show my
hair okay yeah so this is this is pretty
decorate I love it yeah pretty pretty
pretty much not the difference is not
that then you are still not that big but
we are getting them working on it yeah
alright so okay so here is a disclaimer
we will use the word identical in our
next Butler we don't mean contract x
equals 0 hashcode we don't mean
equals as a reference of objects in
memory what we mean is they are similar
they have the same state they are like
almost the same right or completely the
same right so you remember this light
because we're going to bend logic like
many more times in this in this yeah
right so yeah we overload terms that you
think you know to some complete nonsense
like that one all right ok so here we go
we have and that's really cool ok yes so
we have a lip mm-hmm and we use them as
it's at all so we have a ray of lists
yes wherever L list and then we use them
and set all on a race to put two new
arrays in this array ok all right yeah
so we basically instantiating internal
least we for at least yes we might all
right yeah so we put we run we run
through this listing said all method yes
and put in your a list in every okay I
understand okay yep all right okay what
a little bit absolutely identical empty
list identical doesn't mean reference to
the same object no absolutely identical
of empty list non-identical until it's
known as any well known antilles i see i
see you very sort of like working hard
to come up with these options for for
answers I think they will be absolutely
identical empty lists because you know
logic and you know this is what I see in
this code of jump of the other things is
a it's absolutely identical non empty
lists two different objects we are not
talking about comparing with eagles of
objects nope they will be but they will
be too ambiguous yeah exactly but it is
be identical no I'm taste no takers that
make sense there is nothing here to
indicate that there will be something in
the list how about no non tentacle empty
list interesting and how about
non-technical non-empty list
okay that's good okay so we have half of
the votes for for a in helmets or see
you voted for a and of course you are
wrong okay so how many people voted for
well if I can bring in to watch our me
saying that you have no respect for
logic all right once we said that who
voted for see knows why ah here's the
trick yeah this is the trick yes yeah
the size of the list will be different
why why sure yeah yeah because your
answer is basically repeating the answer
that we have on the screen yeah array
initial yes but why the size would be
different that's the real question why
it's called the new twice on two
different objects right that's fine
you're close guys yes no no no it's it's
plain code there is mark but not too
yeah they're not nothing going on in
like JVM optimization level it's on the
code yes no okay I think we should just
go with yeah because the the you need to
look on the different in two different
are you part of this okay Kirsten okay
okay give up dancer will give you a
t-shirt yes we have what you should
okay so now when you think that Greece
is very smart bear in mind that he knew
the answer before all right soldiers all
right okay so the thing is set all
method passes an index into the lambda
it receives for no obvious reason them
and what we end up with that a relief
you get this argument and the
constructor of very least have an option
to get a neat which initializes the
underlying your way to this capacity we
will have to empty lists one initialized
to a size zero the answer initialize
through size one so there will be none
on tentacle but they will be both like
empty empty PSA and of course we have to
do all these dancing with introducing
the new meaning of identity because they
actually would be equals because equals
in a released only checks for content
right so that's why we had all these
dance with those terms okay so now this
is something for you but you know I
don't remember if you remember the time
when you were when you were single now
that was a very long time but I will try
to really go this is for for single
people in this room okay okay so let's
let's see some code so we're trying to
come up with some of the model for a
single person so and I think like party
hard and drinking this is what single
people do at least what I did when I was
single and now we have a functional
interface that extends the single person
and the single person single and happy
but I think or maybe not something is
wrong with the code ya know so I clearly
see what's wrong with the code yes the
animation functional interface implies
that there is only one single abstract
method I see here is it three he owes
are absent metals okay so and let's see
what kind of options we have here the
first one is exactly the one the
register
choosing this yes I all know each other
okay and everything else is just for
feeling with four options a is the right
one okay so I'm just a you know the
first one is because the functional
interface expects just one the abstract
manner this code will not compile or you
know whatever happens who thinks is a
interesting that's very sad okay thank
you so thank you thank you for a be the
problem we've departed hard so if we
remove this party card method then
everything will work see things will be
okay so we have one person two people
okay two people good who is it see so
the problem with drinking method so we
remove it everything will work stuff so
we have one person to person okay good
and everything will be worked fine and
everything fine and the party hard and
drinking will be absolutely you know you
know what now I took another look at the
code okay i think i will revise my
answer why because what I see here is
this interface is typed with drink okay
that means that we have party hard which
except string and returns void we have
party hard that except strings and it's
on void and we have drinking that except
three in return void and another
drinking that accepts drinkin it
employed okay those to and those two
will be merged so we will have a default
method which doesn't count is abstract
and then in abstract method which counts
as the single abstract method in this
spatula in the face an hour or 30 okay
who thinks Izzy maybe because borrow
change is mine right right 1-ranked
envisioned I was good okay so let's see
the direct answer is obviously maybe is
it that obvious so you had this cow
that's the morning of party hard and
everything yep and so anyone any
pictures for one right now how it's wise
be
we'll give you another hint because
Barbara did give you hint he or he
basically explained but now you need to
you know explain this right I know so
yeah I gave you basically all the answer
yet hmm here you go that's a t-shirt
right after which which size of t-shirt
so this is absolutely right the drinking
merges just perfectly because of the
type string here that will be absolutely
identical methods and they will merge
just fine but you cannot merge an absurd
method with the default method even if
their signatures are the same right in
here genital is over I'd equivalent
signatures this compile time error
occurs you cannot do that right just for
you to know we are too useful in this
talk I'm sorry to be concerned ok so the
Russian hackers decide to strike back
because after the yeah that the previous
the previous robbery in love didn't went
well with 142 no we did another way and
they decided to try it again again ya
know who they are yeah russian hookers
here some russian hockey okay okay so
that's that Valerie very complicated
first we need to verify that the
software is original Java that means
that in taco like 99 percent of bun
right and then with them we just one
percent is cool yeah like 99 okay and
then we hack into it and then we need to
google calendar which I have important
and then we need to analyze the accounts
right and then we need to see which
counts you wanna we want to strike and
and of course this is bank where all the
nice guys saw their money right that's a
good list and then of course and we want
now to check what's another which
accounts are though so given the code
above Victor which statement is wrong
the service order by hashcode the order
is predictable across multiple rounds of
jerry ehman same machine which is not
because wrong here I'm here so you have
this run so in this case in the end
every sentence in which is not we do our
best to make it as hard for you as
possible yeah because in English there
is no double negative for any sentence
but in Russian so we just took the other
negative here that implies to all of
them right smart the order of elements
in set is not predictable which actually
means it is predictable because we have
double negative and segments a real
career because that which means they are
not correct yes all right so this is a
who thinks that this set is not ordered
by hashcode no one took computer science
class i guess that is not all them guys
this is what you've been taught okay how
about maybe there's two programmers who
rely on the will check that okay how
about the order is not predictable
across multiple runs of the JVM insane
machine well you need to select the
wrong statement see you see you see it's
already hard working ringing today we
have seen the bargain the quest okay
yeah what if you see that orders the
statement that states that order of
elements and say it is not predictable
is wrong here ok so here and gentlemen
the things that it is predictable yep ok
and how about statements a and B are
wrong here we go ok all right these are
what they want um I think Jesus solid
tuition they always right here covers
most of the options 100 sense what
exactly yeah all right ok oh the order
of elements is set is predictable right
and this is kind of nice and this is how
we hack into account but then
what by the way how it's predictable but
the hash code is deterministic perfect
right so in theory as I already
mentioned the set shouldn't be ordered
and unless it's an ordered set but in
reality we know how that works in Java
right in particular implementation
cookie butter have said no and a half
set is ordered by a hash code but now
yeah right so here we can see that it
just using the map hashmap and
everything is work now that the FBI
strikes back and you know how what is
the best way to protect security you
know to upgrade security upgrade and
your software exactly so just an agenda
to run Gemini now right because why not
and and and of course let's see now so
what's going on thing is here in Java 9
who now we have this very long awaited
convenience method to to instantiate the
set so instead of creating this object
there's a factor methods that you can
provide the sort of least or it called
off we provide the same options and then
we do exactly the same we just use the
convenience set method and the answers
are the same so how about now so I think
because Java is the backward compatible
so it would be you know same so what was
a previous answer so the brilliance was
this we can you can know the order of
this set yeah I think it's it will still
stay the same because javis they will
compose things now in Java and the set
is really unordered like you have no
idea to predict Regina all right how
about it is ordered in the same run in
the JVM but not consistent through
different runs of the GBM here we go and
and and how about em it's so predictable
yeah so pretty cool all right okay and
how about yeah okay that's good let's
let's skip d it was too complicated even
permitted first okay the correct answer
of course
is now be we have a proof we're am j
shell yeah and what we see is that would
you write this code across multiple
implications of the jvm and racial
creates a new JVM every time it runs it
gives us different results in the same
run it will give the same anyone has yet
so that's another robbery attempt yeah
so Java nine strikes back any ideas why
why it is happening so how what what
changed yes well I thought you'll need
to be some implementation right and and
it feel like it works the same on when
you run it on the same jvm yes across
different trance of the JVM on same
machine and same yep which they used to
use a randomized it thank you now this
is a t-shirt I guess we can also give it
a short because you have too many
tissues yeah the killer has at first
yeah that first part of the game yes
that's a good judgment which says so
those buffa sorry an oracle deliberately
randomizes the order of the set to
prevent people which says to rely on the
order of the set because set really
should be unordered but too many people
until now knew that they can count on
the order of the set well welcome to
java nine no more that will break a lot
of software bank software okay oh yeah I
think I have a son partner for you like
very interesting from perspective of
from the perspective of modules I know
yeah I know your life modules to this
wire brought two modules into your Java
so you can do module I cannot one of you
Joe
I cannot even start to explain how
passionate I man about project jigsaw
not only good way okay so which which
one of these statements are correct so
in this case there's no like inverse law
all right so if you convert your
application into the module classpath
dependencies will be a correctly result
so you have a descriptor that defines
modules and everything would work no I'm
not gonna happen okay okay okay if one
of the appendices was converted to the
modules you need to declare this in
module and fro in order to use it well
this is nice what this means is that
it's a viral like it's a viral thing if
you want to use a module you have to be
a module yourself that that's a good buy
right way to introduce by the size of
the disaster it will make it sound like
a good option okay so and once you added
the model module info to your project
and in this case you need to declare
your dependencies twice in the classpath
and the module info that's something
also very much Oracle will do okay and
you know everything is fine butterflies
uniforms and they were also awesome yeah
not know no rig no no double negative
yeah nothing of that is correct yeah
things it's a so this is what we waited
for for a long time okay how about be if
you touched a module you have to be a
module now all right how about see you
just need to work twice as hard to get
the same result because Java nine no no
Tigers all right how about none of the
above and we're wrong here okay of
course of course it will be C right
that's it couldn't be couldn't be
anything else yes because because yeah
because yeah and how is it like it's
gonna break a lot of software yeah right
so the thing is yes just explains once
again um
if you are a module java 9 jigsaw module
and you have this module descriptor that
is called the module info and you use
some dependencies whether they are
modules or not you have a new
dependencies format declaration which is
called the module info on the other side
you still want your code to use to work
without jigsaw flag is on so you'll also
need to repeat all the dependencies in
your classpath so the same thing is that
compiler doesn't cover you but i guess
some tools will be able exact so the
good news are that the beatles and then
namely Gradle will take care of that for
you good between are you sure okay so
yeah so maybe the reason that there
isn't update from the unit update they
just okay and the reason update from a
when I saw they finally added this like
a call for console output so when you
use it it's not really how I guaranteed
for Gradle and and Chris deliberately
hope okay and I I know if your Gradle
increase hopes it for me them but you
have a declaration depends the
declaration format in either of those
tools like average dependencies closure
or dependencies XML tag f and and they
both both those tools will generate both
descriptors for you right it will
generate the correct module info and of
course the class pass to run your tests
and what's not right so that's that's
the pain but not so much it will be fine
yeah that's what I think about jigsaw by
you in general we have time for that
yeah we have a moment to lose that
engine jump to yeah so there's if you
kind of follow this ideal for puzzlers
for quite some time we love this like
old-school action movies in the old
school action actors is why there is no
any presentation where we don't have
presentation about expendables or in
check noise or something like that so
here-here's it so another one with a
little bit of java a taste so there is a
there is a puzzler that we need to pass
action of our expendables and kill them
all and here is a very very very
sophisticated and i would say mean and
very rod you are bastard you're going
the way how to how to kill how to kill
expendables in our action here stars so
in this case I'm taking the iterator
from the collection of objects that I'm
so far so good and after that I do for
each remaining and for a Sherman gives a
new method that allows you to provide a
lambda that will be executed for any
every element to remain this iterator
games we didn't start with this iterator
yet it will means that for each
remaining will run for all the elements
in our collection and inside this lambda
are we trying to iterate if there is
another one we remove it and going next
so we go back to our original integrator
and do the iteration manually which is
the next element we ask if there is a
next element we take it and then we
remove it from the iterator and then
we'll just print whatever is there so
whooping so here are some with some
options ok ok so we can kill them all
you can kill one by one no only even
once even ok we didn't kill even once or
everyone will survive or we can call
only the close ones all right ok ok ok
all right so if you thing is that
negative double negative 4 in the yeah
your belly door EVS up like what's
complicated all right ok well im so and
i would say that you kill them all just
because well this is for Asia mainly
just you showing go for java who is java
8 but actually there is nothing
interesting here and because you're not
that for the coupon yeah yeah exactly
during the first iteration we're just
going to all the interrater and remove
them all and it will be just fine ok so
you think which one is this yeah i think
it's a and you just try to confuse us
is all this monkey business and Wickham
place Mickey Mouse okay so it's
a piece of a prince is it will remove
all old mansion collection have some
faith case here we go thank you thank
you go thank you good Oh spirit good
thesis be it's only even only even okay
I'll even come a good number okay you're
allowed also right nothing like when no
one was removed okay good good good my
family all right because why not that's
that right EU why not okay so everything
is correct okay and how about e okay
this is so we don't count Greece so here
is our brave gentleman the things that
all that can happen together well yeah
so and this is special for Kevin because
he said kill them all okay of course
next one and yes and show they give how
we kill them all multiple times yeah now
that's we can removing them okay Kevin
sorry you're in your session one style
of time because we are watching that
okay so depends on the time give you
already get the t-shirt good you say the
t-shirt yes because of course it depends
on the time first of all don't do that
like ever yeah okay don't use two
different types of iterations on the
same collection in a same time so we
actually have some parlors in the past
that explodes some of the contract
modification exception that you know
when you mention with iterator and this
is just getting getting better bet well
yeah so no concurring duplication here
first of all because we don't modify the
underlying current collection we only
mess up with iterative underlying
iterator and there is no contract that
said if you have two iterators running
on the same collection at the same time
you will get any concurrent education
exception so kill them all all arraylist
will effectively kill them all kill em
all on linkedin will only
a kill the odd ones just kill them all
on a raid if you will not will not kill
any of them and kill them all and reset
will only kill the old odd ones so all
the answers are correct depending on the
time now forget that you ever saw it do
not yeah yeah key takeaways that it's
good to know implementation of
underlying collection now the difference
between I really now that's not the
thing that's not to give away I'm here
let you know I'm very positive and I try
to get something positive positive
outcome from that that's the only here
away from this puzzle thank you from
this father don't do that yeah okay in
we have time for one more let's do Spock
it's short ones good one and it explains
why it's next generation ok all right ok
ok later this book so yeah I while she's
switching to slide I will explain next
generation so you know that there's a
star trek movie who like his original
Star Trek fan like a original movie
original series or in general series
yeah all right and we consider the
George blog and new capital is the
original original right Q's and we got
here yeah who is here for next
generation Star Trek next generation
Captain Picard where's your art where's
your vocab good Goodman so we are yeah
we're obviously I shall get outta here
yep or and I'm the data ok ok so yes so
we have this stream of characters of our
favorite shows spoke your day-to-day
takia spoke we have this method on on
stream called sequential after that we
do filtering to to create eliminate is
that all you know whatever what and you
know what sets due to collections we
duplicate right yeah and and and then we
have and we take it back to eat and then
we bring the yes yes it's pretty much is
normal data modification that you
usually do right yep okay so the results
are data cube Spock it means that we
successfully filtered out the duplicate
spoke here day-to-day the cube spoke
that
original list we didn't do anything okay
it's Paul cube data so this one also
sequential later on also filter is by
natural ordering ordered by natural
origin and this only kills the
duplicates okay right and then of course
not nothing was removed but they are or
that yeah I know though it's a problem
so I will say that you cannot put in the
same place the characters from two
different universes okay yeah so they
also not be on the same your torrent but
yes my mind answers I are freezing the
answer this one yeah okay you know this
is a the acute Spock and so they both
order now and feel them now right that's
couple of hands how about nothing like
changed at all all right how about the
filter by not but not ordered well you
know what order they're not synced out
can I can I you know jokes apart can I
actually pick the right hands go ahead
so I think here I'll take that's all you
should do now I got here no I mean like
you know there's the thing so you have a
new tree so it will Jaden it yeah it
will just create each and every time
creating to sign your angle I ever
doesn't mean yeah it will just take the
each element and put it each element
inside three set which has one element
in it and after that the daughters do
collect on this one so it's going to be
this one be there yeah no change yeah
right because it's in you yeah it's
sequential a sequential goes through the
three set and after that prevent the
stream of presets and it will use
collect to create collections create at
least nice nice right oh no no how are
ya so the video trick me twice I did you
put you put data in the same in the same
collection and you put yeah so the thing
is filter with new tree set and then
calling to add it's not the same
filter new tree set and then add a this
one is initiated every time this lambda
is called and then you would be right
but this one is an instance method it's
a reference to an instance method so the
set will be created on you once and that
means that it successfully will filter
the duplicates out so basically it will
allows you to have a state if you ever
wonder how you would do you know before
before the streams over before this nice
stuff what you usually do you will
create the instance of this okay we're
gonna bring your writing when Kevin's
time and you don't want to be Swiss
Kevin okay you don't write okay so
conclusions in two minutes and we are
out of you if you want to start sick now
we're we're we're so close the door lock
the door in everybody's face all right
okay conclusions well if this is the
confusion with great power comes great
responsibility I have my option here my
with great software comes great
responsibility right it's similar also
j-rok software and Java nine and here
again software almost assured alright
graders disability right and so guys
right readable code don't do whatever we
did hear that really don't don't bad
idea so use comment absolutely yet your
tricks need to be coming to sell you
remember about the guy with ex who gonna
be supporting your code after so yeah
and you know there is there is a maniac
with ABS who knows where you leave these
are so he's going to read your code yeah
so keep that in mind yeah who also knows
were really right sometimes it's just
about we didn't see any bugs although i
would consider the drain permits is a
bug but whatever and sometimes it is the
back so you just need to keep my in mind
that use right tools right 20 fault
analysis so whoever did cheat and tried
our code in IntelliJ IDEA would discover
there are no butters IntelliJ IDEA will
highlight all of our partners as either
errors for not compile or there would be
some more warning some inspections don't
do that you idiot right kind of warnings
and yeah read the manual many things
displaying in documentation and then I
saw we have some some screenshots from
from Java yeah yeah the condition is
important and don't use lambdas and
strings and things when you don't need
them use them but don't abuse them use
them but not abused them here you go
couple of house holding items and we
have much more puzzles it will be three
and three look for it and if you have
any partners in your day-to-day job with
work with Java 8 and most of the origin
Java 8 is send us in those buggers to
partners at Jeffers calm and we will
mention you as respectfully as we did
for the gear Sergei and NZ break em shut
out in general that comes less show
notes you'll find there an entry for
devoxx us and the entry for jugglers the
slides are there the video will be there
in 24 hours all the links to all the
partners and their explanations is their
ratings to tell us how awesome we are
and also raffle just to thank you for
being there on top of t-shirts general
also provides a small price if you come
there especially if you come early you
can double or triple your chances and if
you like it please praise us on Twitter
like very seriously in use the job after
sandy hashtag and devoxx us hashtag and
of course this is Ginoza on twitter and
this is jay Park on Twitter and if you
didn't like it your feedback is also
very very important if you didn't get a
t-shirt for answering this question come
to see me at my booth and now we got
rolling with all the urine of the value
of the t-shirt thank you very much guys
thank you thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
