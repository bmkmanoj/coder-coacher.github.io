I've seen you before hello welcome back
and if not hi my name is amy nicholson
I'm a technical evangelist at Microsoft
and I wanted to come and talk to you
guys stay in this session a bit about
and the Internet of Things and what we
like to kind of sort of calling the
intelligence of your things and
sometimes the Internet of Things kind of
a lot of people tend to boil it down to
the device and then the device is
extremely important but sometimes it's
kind of what you do with that data as
well that's that's really really
important so I just wanted to talk
through that a little bit today so
everyone starts with this den I work
what is the Internet of Things and
Forrester there gave us quite a good
example and you know combining sensors
using them to monitor having analytics
against them I quite like the four boxes
on the other side as well I think they
explain some of the key components
around Internet of Things and as an
end-to-end story so you have your things
we have lots and lots of things that can
connect the into the internet now and
actually it's going to grow more and
more so over time connectivity we we
forget how lucky we are actually to be
in such a world where we have
connectivity be that through Wi-Fi
networks be that's through sort of three
and 4G networks as well with mobile
phone providers and from these sensors
you always get loads of data like you
know each sensor sends something you
know have a quick they send them and
it's just masses and masses of data but
actually being able to do something
useful with that that kind of leads onto
the analytics side you might have lots
and lots of devices all over the place
but actually been out to say okay what
can I get that's useful at these how can
I make a difference to what I'm doing
how can I be more efficient or maybe me
be more transformative and do something
negative so an example of the Internet
of Things I talked about this this sort
of example as well in the machine then
talk we think machine then and and
incentive things have a huge crossover
in some senses so we have a lift and one
lift has say a couple of sensors on it
and no sense of the broad
in data and there's loads of different
people that need to get access to this
data for it to become useful so that
might be the guy in the field who is you
know on a tablet device he is needing to
get access to things straight away he
needs to know exactly what's going on
when he's in the field your control
center they need lots of dashboards they
need instant numbers instant alerting
say maybe and no colors like if
something goes wrong change it straight
to read so that someone instantly
triggers it through their vision so not
having masses and masses of data that
they have to sort of scroll through but
actually having something that's really
really visual and available in your
business planner who kind of looks a bit
more the future so they actually might
not want the data in real time from
these sensors like the other two but
what they do want is they want the
stored data that's been there over time
to be able to then say okay this
happened how can we plan our business
better in the future how can we create
new business models so that's one that's
one lift so what if you have like loads
and loads of lifts and in each of them
has two devices on it and each of them
has is sending so much data it becomes
an a huge huge problem it becomes
something that's really really scales
very quickly and sometimes scale in the
Internet of Things is something that's
quite tricky to handle going from that
initial proof concept to something much
larger so so why now just like machine
then in some senses the Internet of
Things has come at a point it's now
again that word of inflection point and
you know are we able to bring all the
right pieces together and actually say
okay yeah we've got you know we're able
to now do this a lot easier so first on
their components and devices I I change
this to less expensive because actually
you still have to buy them and if you're
buying loads like you know and maybe
even your you're building the board
yourself you you just things
consideration there are still some costs
but actually the costs are very very
much come down so that many people are
able to get involved I mean now we're
encouraging children's get creative with
raspberry PI's or micro bits and stuff
like that so it's
really exciting to see that these two
things are coming together we mentioned
connectivity again we're lucky to be in
a place where connectivity is something
that is available and we are able to
connect over Wi-Fi we have Ethernet we
have 4G 3G we're always connected in
fact I am I'm from the UK so I came over
here and I was like okay mobile
providers and they change and I was like
oh how much is my dates are going to
cost me now and stuff like that but it's
it you you forget how much you do
because I was in the trying to get the
address for the hotel stay and I was
like normally I would just go on the
internet and it's so quick to just go to
that port like that source now and so
you're lucky to have this this mount
etna connectivity development is easier
that guy's an interesting one again I
think it is I think we're giving more
solutions or even more services were
able to put things in the cloud we're
able to you know do all sorts of
different tests in as well on it and
actually these each individual part of a
much bigger Internet of Things scenario
it's actually easier to develop now and
then the kind of last two are more on
the business side in some senses but
actually there's lots of new Internet of
Things scenarios that can actually fuel
new business models so something that
maybe didn't happen before you can start
to actually say okay you have I don't
know and you originally just had the
lifts but actually now you can start to
do something interesting you you might
go to save money in some sense it's be
able to monitor that lift and what
working in the future maybe you can
completely change the business model of
how you sell those lips maybe you sell
it with a with a service package so that
the person can takes controller lifts or
something like that so there is all
these other opportunities around it and
and yeah so connecting things today is
absolutely becoming super important
everyone seems to be seen the the
possibilities that are out there when we
start to connect things in our
environment and potentially things on us
so so was microsoft CEO this we kind of
say and the internet starts with your
things there's so many times we may be
speak to people in there and the
okay so I need a whole new thing i want
to put millions of devices that we don't
have i want to i want to buy them i want
to connect them i want to do that and
then actually there's so much they can
do with stuff they already have so it's
quite exciting to see the internet of
your thing so the things you currently
have and how we can start to maybe get
data that was previously unavailable and
then move on to adding more devices to
that to actually enrich that data or
enrich that experience and and I've said
it said a million times over but in
getting more from the data as well so it
you know having all this streaming data
or this live data real-time data isn't
something that's extremely interesting
and it's great to have something you
know happening in real time but actually
can we do more with that is there things
now that we can do in real time in
statics are now in int of point of time
as well so wait yeah so we think it's a
lot about start and we realizing the
potential that you have with the devices
you currently have and then add into
that so start small and grow bigger so I
wanted to jump straight in with a bit of
a demo and I mentioned connecting your
things I mentioned and you know being
able to take data that was maybe
previously unavailable and I'm actually
and wearing a amount of fitness device
and some Microsoft band and and what I
want to do is actually connect the data
that I'm producing right now talking to
you guys and try and kind of get a some
kind of real-time scenario going on and
this kind of end-to-end idea so from the
device to the cloud and then maybe
seeing it in different places and
visualizing it so a little bit about the
band's the Microsoft band is is a is a
health wearable but like the Fitbit bit
like the you know all the other options
that are out there some of the go on and
watches as well and and it just allows
you to be productive connected a prompt
you every now and again let go you know
how many steps have you done today that
kind of thing and how many calories have
you burnt cuz you've been eaten all day
and as someone's that you brought me
chocolate so I'm really excited about so
and maybe I should you know do something
to be healthy and this allows me to sort
of track that there's about
sensors it's quite a good diagram
actually that one who took pointing to
where they are but some of the ones you
might not be able to read their just
sort of you get your stand up on gps
heart rate light sensors UV and there's
a microphone on it just stuff like that
so obit sir it's a wearable which is
cool so and it's a we've actually just
really spun too I had to add this onto
the the slide as well so I I have a band
one unfortunately bought the the band
tears is out as well which is fun I just
wanted to mention as well that this i'm
going to show you this with a windows
phone and however this does have native
iOS Android and Windows SDKs so this is
absolutely available to all of you the
the band's connects to a health app
again can be downloaded on all platforms
so the key here is just saying that this
is this is available for everyone it's
not you know just a Microsoft demo thing
going on and and actually that point of
the bottoms are streaming data from
these senses it's something that we
weren't able to like my heart rate which
I'm going to measure shortly is not
something that I originally had access
to until we had wearables so even a
Fitbit and all that you can get all that
data and actually being able to say okay
can I do more with that is there
something that I can monitor can I mean
think about it in team sports what if we
can monitor a whole football team or a
basketball team or maybe not swimming
because they're not waterproof yet but
when they are maybe we could you know
start measuring a swim that and seeing a
bit more you know what's going on when
they're in the pool so this is the kind
i want to just very quickly show you the
architecture then i'm going to show you
a demo off so we're going to start with
the band and the band connects to the
phone so and and what were able to do
from there is actually send it into the
cloud so straight away from my phone my
phone is the gateway device in some
senses so my phone is the internet
connected device the band does not have
that otherwise we would go directly from
the band and actually we're going to put
it into these two symbols show something
called the event hub your event hubs
they are some mass ingestion of data so
we also bring in loads and loads of
readings one after another and
sometimes it's when you're not that
worried about them coming out of order
so it's a queuing system but it's a much
more wider scale queuing system a symbol
there what we're going to do is we're
going to take the data that comes from
my band in however many times it post
per per minute and actually we're going
to start to aggregate that so we're
going to use something called stream
analytics and that's actually can allow
us to aggregate the heart rate data that
comes and every I think it's every five
seconds it's going to take an average of
my heart rate and actually post that
back down to various different places so
first one it's going to pass it to
another event hub q so you can see where
this going this could then send a
notification back to me and I don't want
some one thing I do want to build is
actually saying I don't drink enough
water I jump a lot of coffee so I get
dehydrated I'd actually like it there's
a skin response in the buttons as well
so it when the sun's sort of moisture of
your skin if it could ping me if it got
below a certain threshold and again all
this could be done in the cloud and pass
back to the device which would be really
exciting so we're going to pass it back
down to another queuing system it's
going to put us out some real time data
I'm going to also pass it because it's
the power of the cloud being able to say
from one service I can pass it out to
many places and actually we all say okay
that's that's a symbol for something we
call power bi and it's a visualization
tool so I can take my data and I can
visualize it in real time and I can
build graphs and in various different
things so a bit like the guy with the
lift in the control panel room that kind
of idea and then finally the storage
part so the guy who was doing the
business planning he wants to keep that
historic data so we're going to pop it
into storage as well because you never
know when all my heart rate I might go
in handy okay so if I just swap on to
this screen now so if i plug my phone in
okay so we see Amy's phone again and him
basically I've got another app on here
and it's called connect the dots let me
just restart that sorry and what connect
the dots does is it's a sort of simple
example solution of connecting my phone
to the cloud and actually it's able to
take some of the senses and as you can
see if I move my arm about we can see
all the sort of acceleration sensors
change in my heart rate is quite high
and so so but if I tick that box
basically what I'm able to do now is
it's going to start to understand some
of the data it's gonna start sending my
data to cloud and I have some sort of
connection settings in here and I'm
saying where while i was in reading in
the UK i should have changed out the
belgium apologies and but actually it's
just saying these in my keys these are
my you know event hub names and stuff
like that so I'm telling the console
where to send this data and yet so we're
still moving and it's getting all this
data now what i can do is i have
something in the cloud called stream
analytics and it's a service that you
can actually connect multiple items to
sort of aggregate data in real time so
in sort of sliding window effects and
actually output to different places as
well so we can see i started this just
before the talked so it's showing me
that it's running I've got some
utilization you have a dashboard that
then shows you know when your input
events are coming in and if you have any
errors and stuff like that but go to the
inputs we can see I've got some data
coming in a stream from that thing I
called an event hub so the event hub is
taking all the dates effort that's
projecting from my band so I'm still
moving it's still giving me all my data
and it's actually putting that into the
cloud and passing it here it's saying I
want you to take this data and always
aggregate over it the aggregation is
quite nice actually again all sitting in
the web browser we're able to start
aggregating over my data and just
writing simple sequel like queries so
and it's actually called TC cool so it's
sort of a subset of sequel some of the
things you can do in the hole you know
language our own are quite available yet
back sure you can
do a fair amount so I'm I'm putting this
in three places like I said I've got
query for where I put it into storage
I've got a query where it's going real
time into my visualization dashboard and
actually i also have a query at the
bottom starts to average the value and
passes it back as like a notification
and so will see that running shortly for
going to the outputs again we'll see
those three things three things i've
just mentioned so they pair up to those
three queries and i'm able to view my
data now in lots and lots of different
places so if we have a quick look at the
storage 1 i've got something called the
usual storage explorer it's a nice of
you i for being able to see various
different things so if I very quickly so
we've got one here there's some of the
right one yet 30 through thousands if I
view some of this day so here we can
actually see what should be i'll see
those we got my display name we're
saying okay what's the measure that I've
tix I'll take heart rate so it's passing
that in its passing the value so it
looked like it went sort of down 75 76
came back up to 83 don't know why and
him and then it sort of got a time stamp
on it so this is that historic data this
is data that I want to keep that maybe
through the business plan so close that
so I know I know this is working they'll
starts always promising oh and then
actually if I very quickly sorry go into
version be shown you this but oh well
and I think so I just got a project in
visual studio that basically takes the
the output of what's coming to back to
that event hub and allows me to see in
real time if i run this my heart rate
being passed every five seconds so it's
just quickly open this and the exciting
thing here is just by saying this is
truly real time again another way to
test where is the point of failure in 90
scenario because actually you have so
many different parts on iot scenario
that you can start stop
like Oh something's gone wrong which
part of it is actually stopped so if I
just start this so if anyone was in the
in the machine learning talk you would
have noticed actually there was very
very similar code and okay so we have an
average value there is only six and
every five seconds that should add
something to it there we go so it's now
shown in real time it's passing my data
back out so we've had a band to phone
phone to cloud and then back down to my
device to say this is happening all in
real time and so we've got a little
average going on there now if I promised
myself a potentially wouldn't do this
but if I started to say skip then my
heart rate would probably go up and I
would have to take my shoes off because
i think if heels on and but actually you
would know my heart rates actually
variant on its own sometimes like those
laughs and what we can see is the
average over time so currently if I just
show you and this screen as well it's
it's on 80 but it's kind of dip in
between 79 80 81 so you can see it is
definitely taking that average between
those times and then finally for this or
that third output I like to very quickly
show you someone called power bi and and
what this allows me to do is actually
send data to a visualization of sport
and I'm able to send it directly from
that cloud service I don't have to write
another piece of code that's going to
stitch these things to get that it's
able to do it for me automatically so I
think this is probably tracking it and
so what we can see if we go down there
is actually this was my heart rate when
I was testing it the other day so this
will then change in real time and show
you that actually it starts to sort of
ping and shows you on a graph you can
see where this might be useful again I
have you know visual things like the app
my average heart rate in that session
was 71.5 one for the whole session not
just the five seconds I'm sending back
to the device i'm also i would say this
is how many different heart rates have
been sent 353 so it's act like initial
immediate visualization of Internet of
Things data I think is really really key
so if I pop that some slides earlier so
that was a really simple example so I
had wonder ice I was chatting in one
piece of days to the cloud I was pulling
one piece of data back into many
different places interesting scenarios
in real life not like that they are so
much more complex I don't want to be the
bearer of bad news but obviously you
have long time lines even for a proof of
concept sometimes Internet of Things
scenarios can be really really you know
time time-consuming in some senses and
you really have to you know invest in
them and say let's take this from end to
end I mentioned that was that was one
that was a small very very small
Internet of Things demo well actually
these things are then how would I then I
know have us all where fitness devices
and take all of that data how would that
how would that set up scale it once go
very well probably some of the services
in the cloud would be able to scale
actually my implementation in my code
that would not so is there a better way
that I can do that and finally sometimes
it's quite difficult to customize you
take samples I took sample there what if
I want like I said I want to take the
Gallup their skin response so I over
cutlets know how dehydrated am so what
if I could take all different types of
data and actually I wanted to do
something completely out there isn't in
you know any documentation from that
these things are hard to customize and
there is no one-size-fits-all kind of
idea so recently microsoft announced
something called diaz your iot sweet and
we we believe that actually connecting
your devices is incredibly important the
security of connecting your devices how
many times do we see in the news
actually things going a little bit wrong
currently with internet-connected
devices and security is absolutely key
especially if it's a a wearable so it's
my personal data that's absolutely
paramount that this is totally secure
there's a there's a whole suite
basically of things and you go from
connecting the device on one end all the
way through to use in all the different
analytic services and all the dashboard
and visualization services
as well and actually these things all
pull together that's what we like now
that's where we think we can offer
someone something in the sense of the
end-to-end scenario lots of people ask
me to do microsoft have a board we we
don't have one single board we partner
we plant with many people partner with
raspberry pi partner with arduino minnow
board dragonball all these different
balls actually we want to say you know
bring the devices again that you have
the intelligence of your things and
actually connect them and use some of
our clouds processes and and bring this
sort of end-to-end system gather
slightly easier so as I mentioned it's
this capture and analyzing of untapped
data so renounces say okay how am I
going to take my all these different
devices again one device how do i scale
that this can scale really well using
something called an IOT hub and so
similar to an event hub in some senses
but actually you have unique IDs for
each device and you can start to feel so
you can make sure there's roll level
security on there you can actually stop
that thing from projecting from sending
its data to the cloud you have control
you have admin over your devices and
available on any operating system we you
know it's not it's not one-size-fits-all
as I said it's you know everyone's using
all sorts of different stuff but the
cloud the cloud is open the crowd is for
everyone to use the services on so and
not there's not a problem with where
where you originally sit once you're in
the cloud it's acting on that new data
so like I said we can you can i'm going
to show site shortly actually that talks
a bit about sort of the progression of
Internet of Things customers and it's
quite interesting to see that we're able
to pull in this data and you can do like
initial analysis I am I have here some
reports but actually can we push it
further can we do more than we did
before by using cloud compute and
storage can we actually do more than we
did before by using maybe predictions
and stuff like that and this
visualization idea and actually again
going back to like the intelligence of
your things we and now we understand
that people have all
the technology providers I mean in
Oracle SAP Salesforce Twitter data comes
from everywhere like there's no there's
no true source of data it is everywhere
so actually being able to build this
again into systems you already have been
able to extend you know your your
current business systems or your current
applications and be really creative and
sync them up to an IOT scenario is
something that the azure IOT suite
offers so again I showed a simple
solution my architecture with a lot more
simple than that but this is actually a
pre-configured solution that we offer
and we're hoping to provide more so if
it's something like remote monitoring
that you're looking at so if you have
lots of machinery or they have lots of
devices out there and you just want to
remotely monitor their health or
something like that you can actually
start to pull these services together
like jigsaw pieces and connect them all
securely be able to use the IT sweet to
spin to spin these services up in the
cloud extremely quickly so again this
uses the idea of sort of an IOT hub
pulling all the data and again you have
stuff going to websites you have stuff
going to dashboards you have things
going to logic amps so logic apps in the
azure world is being outstanding sort of
text messages and so for that so our
lift guys well the guy on the ground the
guy actually out there fixing the lift
because he's being really proactive
because the dual machine learning it's
actually saying okay I need to be other
then and the backend system needs to be
I'll send a text to that guy so yet this
the addressee need to go to this is the
exact device that's gone wrong guy from
the control room sending this and
actually for the guys say okay yet all
done all sorted is it back to normal and
be able to do this real time fixing
proactive kind of you know exciting and
interneting scenarios and that add felt
adds value so rather than redesigning
the whole system add value to what you
already have so for the sort of data and
decisions I mentioned that we we have so
like so many different pieces of data
and we deal with them in different ways
and
everyone will have probably something in
this list here and a lot of what happens
is kind of at the bottom so stuffed it
reports what happened in the past and
and then once you have that data there's
a bit of a manual process to kind of
produce that report and someone maybe
has to do that like every month or every
week and then from that report you have
to make a decision so maybe that will be
people get in a room never meeting stuff
like that and then action happens what
if we could go right so then interactive
dashboards maybe that happens quicker
maybe because we have those visuals we
can do something a bit faster about a
problem we might have and and do action
quicker predictions again can we start
to them predicts be proactive and
actually say well what's going to happen
and make that decision and make that
action sooner a really really nice Hans
kind of bit at the top that takes you
all the way to the end so can you kind
of recommend from your data what you
should be doing as in action so my
favorite favorite part the size just
that action box it's one of the key
things I think in in internet Internet
of Things scenarios it's one of the key
things when you talk about and data
analytics it's kind of okay we can make
cool reports we can make cool dashboards
what do we do when we get that data
because that's where you can make the
impact that's where you can make
something better or you can make
something more productive or and just
top it near Hansen and innovation so
that the value stream works exactly the
same way if you're able to take data
you've got loads of data we saw that
heart rate data on the storage thing
yeah it's useful to have in storage but
actually using it in that format would
be no use at all whoo that's not use but
actually being able to sort of move
across that value spectrum and say can
we start to automate these things come
results have automatic decisions and
actually use this kind of stuff that's
always very exciting i mentioned sort of
briefly as well around how we see
Internet of Things customers working
with stuff at the moment so you have
something that's really really a fish it
you know that
people often start with connecting
devices so it's a first point of college
like inter things let's kept the
connecting devices as collect some data
and actually we can probably more
efficient with that data then we can
maybe add in and a different process
that allows us to say oh well now we've
done that we know that like dividing you
know that device kind of does this we
can do something with it we can have
someone action something this could be
as we said that that asset monitoring
that could be command and control so
again sending that data back to the
device but can we sort of move along
that journey so the the lift company
back to those guys they started with
this they started with connecting
devices that were stuck word that were
on the lifts and actually starting to
asset manage and monitor stuff and they
found incredible cost savings there eat
like they did so so well and they were
so happy and everyone was like oh yeah
but you have to like you know pay for
all this stuff to do it and they're like
it was nothing compared to what they'd
saved it you and that that was fantastic
what a great custom story but actually
they then kind of moved along to this
innovation idea so they've connected
devices they have things I on all their
lifts they're saving lots of money which
has then allowed them to actually sort
of jump into may be any more innovation
side of the project cuz there's budget
so sometimes you know having that
initial smaller quick fix
proof-of-concept if you're if you are in
businesses allows you to maybe make that
pitch for the next the more innovative
thing the thing that's going to make a
little bit different the bit thing
that's going to maybe do something with
exciting new technology so you have the
enable insights and you know you can
start to be really innovative you might
increase revenue through that you might
be able to do and different you might be
able to produce data as a service you
might be able to produce something that
says okay this is that this is a data
coming off does someone else want to use
that actually for something they want to
produce and and what the lift company
were able to do is actually again do
this proactive maintenance so their
customers were were happier they they
didn't have to because their left her
and somehow the tallest buildings in the
world so when then maybe some bankers
after you know time is money in some
senses and the lift breaks down and
there's only one lift now for like 500
people and office building it gets a bit
of a nightmare someone doesn't want to
walk 20 floors they were actually able
to make a better customer experience by
implanting the Internet of Things and
that was really you know really nice
story to hear from people and then it's
kind of moving on to i mentioned start
like different business models did
business transformation so how can we
start to do stuff that is and decision
support it so that automatic action that
be able to do something and deliver
straight away so less so than just
taking the data from the devices so this
kind of sort again pushes on that point
that and we like to think the Internet
of Things is end-to-end and less on one
side and less on the other and you know
some people kind of again focus on the
device and some people focus on the
visualization and and there's lots and
lots of stuff in between that that goes
on with that so we like to think there's
there's so many different parts that you
can sort of move so the the new revenue
model again we see it with lots of
companies lots of companies now that
pick up and are very very different to
other companies you know they might not
actually they provide a service but they
might not actually provide the actual
objects as things like you know be able
to stay in other people's houses for
holidays and stuff like that you know
they're able to sort of do all these
different types of business models and
maybe the internet of things can be
another way to do that so I did I didn't
really want to take up so you know too
much of your time I just kind of want
taught you a little bit about how we
think about it maybe consider having a
look at and the is your IOT sweet I
don't know how many of you guys have
used a show before so I popped up and
you can get free trial of azure cloud
computing platform and it's just as your
doc microsoft com you get 30 days you
get you know various amount of credits
and you can start to investigate all
those different services then
specifically on the IOT side it's kind
of more a bit around and the Ojo IOT
sweet this is something that's quite new
and it is sort of in in preview ask if
you want to call it that and it's it's
an exciting piece we've had lots and
lots of people if you go to that website
you'll see there's many many people who
we've worked with and when it's been in
private preview to actually build out
these solutions and some sort of a bait
and feedback on how much how they enjoy
the experience and it's it's an exciting
one it is a really really cool service
it allows you to keep control of prices
as well sometimes in the cloud it can be
quite hard when you have to like add up
all those different services and how
many calls you're making to them on
average and okay what you know what's my
seat price here and how much compute and
storage I mean here it gives a very nice
a nice pricing model or with it as well
as well as all that extra security and I
think Security's is a nice play here
have been out to interrupt the device
and just just with my machine the only
one exactly sort of similar is and
please bill build the end-to-end IOT
solutions and let us know we really like
to hear how you guys use the technology
how you end up sort of putting this
stuff together and making something
really cool maybe you'll make a new
business model maybe your application
will go from zero to hero like it's all
about that kind of thing and so I've it
finished very very early so give you
some more time back but actually I
believe I got told by and some of my
colleagues that there was an art there's

downloaded it and I'll also have any
questions is there anything you guys or
even discussion I've those think

discussion thing as well it's it's so
very new that sometimes you need to new
hatch out where those problems are and
we had a bit of really interesting one
actually at a conference I was out
recently that was all about sort of how
