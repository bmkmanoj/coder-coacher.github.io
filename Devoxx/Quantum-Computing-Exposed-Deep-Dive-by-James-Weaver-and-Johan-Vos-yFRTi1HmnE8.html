friends call me Jim you can all call me
Jim this is Johan how do you on hi James
yes sorry hey what's calling you at Jim
before no okay you didn't call me Jim
you're not my friend right look yet yeah
so so so this is these are my
coordinates over here developer advocate
with pivotal and Johan is a I'm not sure
what do you do I will talk about that in
four flights from now so I work with a
Chance okay so anyway I've written
several books Johan actually had
something to do with some of those I
worked for pivotal pivotal is a company
that helps the the world transform how
they build software we curate spring you
know pivotal Cloud Foundry which is a
cloud platform that runs on top of all
the major cloud platforms as well as
on-premise so it's this consistent cloud
platform that you can use pivotal labs
we engage with customers and help them
with agile processes and then a new kid
on the block is pivotal container
service for some reason the acronym is
PKS I guess it's because its production
grade kubernetes and we have some
principles and practices there's five of
them three of them are right here my
favorite one is over on the right and
and that is be kind I you know it's
refreshing to work for a company who's
one of the prime directives is to be
kind I think I'm a pretty kind person
unlike Johan but but so I don't really
need a company to tell me to be kind but
but it's very refreshing and it's you
know especially in today's environment
for God's sakes let's let's be kind to
each other let's treat each other like
we want to be treated so the pivot of
definition of be kind is slightly
different from my definition of be kind
but
gone okay I'll go on working with also
we're going to have a spring party in in
San Francisco spring won in December
come across the pond and and in come
party with this okay over to the more
serious stuff now can you go four
strides back why don't you just do your
own slides now if you're gonna this is
on a Mac it's not on a Linux system so
these are the books that James wrote see
I started before one book for Java vex
eight I took that over the publisher
wanted better quality the others here
are still on my to-do list but it's a
yeah there's much work to do so apart
from correcting James books I work for
her gluon I've been working with Java
since says it started I was doing my PhD
at Dallas University of Technology and
there was a new language new programming
language and I needed the programming
language to do some computations and
that by the way I have nothing to do
with quantum computing so same things I
know something about it but um because I
have a PhD in physics but I'm trying to
explain that physics is a broad area but
the gym physics is just going to the gym
and lifting weights and so that's all
the same so I had a I had a spark
station and I wanted Linux on that spark
stage there's going to be a history
lesson I mean you know this extended
biography are you gonna get to a point
the other point
do you want to talk about quantum
computing sure yeah okay yeah okay so
there was I had a spark station I want
to plead X and there was no Java on
Linux so with a bunch of people reported
Java to Linux and that's how I got
started with with Java always been
involved in n2n java combining the world
of the small of the world of the baked
and today that that means combining the
world of mobile devices with the world
of cloud devices so that's what we do
with gluon so we bring Java to mobile so
today it is possible to run Java
applications on mobile and you anchor
them you actually pour the Java to Linux
I think you did I forgot to mention they
forgot to mention okay so
that was pretty cool stuff if you ever
want one minute you will in assault and
science but you just didn't mention okay
so yeah Java on Linux I think I
mentioned didn't I mention it to say
okay you said you needed on Linux but
you never said reported okay we need to
keep you awake for three more hours okay
so and so Java is important mobile and
Java works on across systems and Java
sentiments know you might ask what the
relevance for this in a quantum
computing well there wasn't until two
days ago but we will come back to that
later I will I will tell you about it
because I didn't tell you before nice
thank you
oh yeah so this is what what we're doing
with Java on mobile so you have Java iOS
app Android app and you connect them via
group on Clark link our which to the end
forest world to existing and new
backends and you can also use serve less
platforms and so so that that that's all
for the commercial break now and change
at this moment is to James will now talk
about what we will talking okay great
so this is kind of a road map by the way
I have Katherine Beaumont to thank I
didn't have a road map in my slides but
now because of her excellent
presentation on neural networks
she put a road map in different places
in the slide so we can tell where we're
at and so now because of that you'll be
able to tell where we're at in the
presentation where we're at right now is
introduction to quantum computing but
we're going to get into things like
qubits when you get into axioms of
quantum mechanics
I think Johann will be doing a lot of
the physical stuff for that we're going
to talk about quantum computing
algorithms quantum entanglement things
you've heard of more algorithms and
we've got just some appendices in the
back that I'll point you to more
resources supplements with resources
that means coffee tea coffee tea so
maybe maybe one one question before um
before you go on boarding the people who
here has a PhD in physics oh you're just
bragging now
well who is here because they think we
will stop early and then it will be over
for a room for Frank ups okay we're safe
I think okay good all right so who knows
what this is what is that
that's very cool thing who knows
yeah so one mortise you know what it is
right you're you're it's a what it's a
blocks figure there was someone who okay
good it's a block sphere and and so you
can represent what's called a Cuba with
the Bloch sphere and so it's just awful
Wikipedia here we put that in there it's
just this this 3d this spherical
representation of all the the quantum
states for one qubit and so what we're
gonna talk about what a qubit is and and
those kinds of things but we're gonna go
into a little bit of history first wait
before yeah yes you said that I wasn't
allowed to do this way and now you start
talking about history yes
but it's it's it's relevant to the talk
not your personal history well my
personal history is relevant because
otherwise I wouldn't be here right okay
if there are questions and we do hope
that there will be questions ask them
but when one can they ask questions when
we when we ask we'll say does anybody
have any questions and then yeah
something like that
yeah because everyone so I will do that
for us it's a to be honest it's it's
pretty hard to to give a presentation on
quantum computing and everybody keeps on
happening you know that that's the easy
part
we are developers in front of a
developer audience talking about it's
it's it's a bit out of the comfort zone
and it's it's not clear if we're going
too fast or too slow then yeah let us
let us know but how um so all your
questions will help us you know back to
history back in 1940s none of us were
probably around in the 1940s but but I
hear that the
computers were very large they took up
rooms and not only were they very large
but they had a very limited memory bits
things that represented bits were
actually iron rings you know sewed
together with with with you know coils
and things like that so you know you had
a small amount of memory and everything
was new everything was being invented
software was new to run these things and
so history is repeating itself now we've
got quantum computers that that
companies like IBM and Google and
Righetti and and others are building and
they are in these you know some of them
are require dilution refrigerators to
get it down to milli kelvins to get them
really cold so they so that they can be
super conductive and and display quantum
mechanical properties and the qubits you
know it's the analog the quantum analog
to two bits two classical bits qubits
these computers that they're making
maybe consists of five cubits or a door
they're 17 I think Google is working on
one that has 49 but but who knows you
know how long that's going to take and
so we've kind of repeating ourselves but
one important point here and we've got
it on the bottom here is that the
quantum computers make direct use of
quantum mechanical phenomenon like like
superpositions the ability to be 1 or 0
or a combination of those as well as
quantum entanglement and so the idea
between behind quantum computing is to
leverage those properties to do things
that would be difficult to do
classically yeah so one minor correction
that's not at the bottom at the bottom
it's our tweet handles yes please tweet
us but then in in general the idea is
that classical computing started with
low power low memory high volume and it
became
after a very short time relatively our
cellphones have much more computing
power than the big houses that that
hosted classical computers some people
many people expect that quantum
computing will have a similar path at
this moment it is not only theory there
is there are some quantum computers in
practice already but they're not not
suited for for production yet by by by
end users so here are some pictures of
quantum computers or at least parts of
quantum computers they use a very low
temperatures they use laser technologies
in order to generate the quantum effects
so it is it is at this moment not yet
ready for primetime but once it's ready
you have you will have to hurry because
and that is the difference I think with
classical computing with Moore's law
which predicts that I think so the
computing power or the number of
transistors on a chip will double every
18 months I think that all that that
that will not be the case in my opinion
with quantum computing it will go much
faster because in classical computing if
you have if you go from 8 bits till 9
bits yeah you don't win a lot but in
quantum computing if you can go from 8
qubits to nine cubits you double your
capacity we will explain why later
but it might go much much faster so once
a critical barrier is caused it can go
very very fast and it might it might
become scary because there are many
applications of quantum computing that
that that that are interesting but also
scary and some were you going to do this
right no you you change the slide on
your laptop yeah but you wanted I just
wanted to know what the next slide
wasn't going to be but I think we
discussed that you were going to present
the next I was interrupting you ok no no
no I will interrupt you when you present
it oh yeah that's right so why use a
quantum computer so we have in this in
the universe we have solutions to
problems so as you know
problems our ability you know you have
the ability to solve them on classical
computers we do that every day we're all
classical programmers there's also a set
of problem problems that are feasible on
quantum computers that you can't do
classically I think of for example
factoring large numbers like with RSA
one of the appeals to quantum computing
is this ability to to factor very very
large numbers quickly and you just
really can't do that with classical
computers but you can with quantum
computers and so those things aren't
feasible on classical and then there's
an intersection between the two where
there's some things that you could do on
classical computers and this is where I
have to interrupt you ok please because
there's a misconception often about
quantum computing so it's not that your
daily computing algorithms will all need
to be replaced with quantum computing
algorithms that's that's definitely not
the case at least that's not how we
envision it now quantum computing has
different areas where it will outperform
classical computing you know in other
areas it's simply not suited so there
will be a combination between classical
computing and quantum computing in the
future so it's not that that it's
quantum computing is not simply
classical computing but much more
powerful it's it's something different
and there are algorithms which we will
show near the end where you need both
classical computing and quantum
computing that's a very good point and
so some some companies are advocating
this architecture where you know you
have this classical computing
architecture but then you might have a
you know a kewpie you a quantum
processing unit to where you might say
ok now do something hard you know do
some some very hard problem like the
factoring or whatever and you ship that
to a qpu and so that's a there's a
there's a good hybrid kind of scenario
that's a very good I pretty yeah yeah
that's a good word well you're giving me
a compliment yeah I actually was you
take compliment
someone take notes about yes and so one
of the things that's driving this is
that is that you mentioned Moore's law
right and so every 18 months
it used to be anyway that that the size
circuits get get smaller and you can put
them all order twice as the same number
in outer space or whatever yeah but then
you can't get much smaller now right
there's a physical limit because if
transistors they are at this mode
already extremely small and so
transistor which is the the the core of
classical computers it basically will
allow current or it will stop the
electrical flow but if you make them
even smaller than because of a quantum
effect called a tunneling quantum
tunneling the electrons will still be
possible to cross the barrier so they
will be even though the transistor says
stop the there is a possibility that
electrons might end up at the other side
of the transistor so in that case the
transistor of course stops working
because you assume it will stop but it
it won't stop so there's a there's a
real physical technical limit to what to
do the size of transistors we can't make
them much smaller anymore and therefore
the idea of one of the basic ideas of
quantum computing is if those quantum
effects are limiting us from making
faster computers why don't we use them
in our advantage so instead of seeing
those quantum effects as a problem we
try to see them as as a solution as a as
a way of new ideas and and and actually
it's as a way of better ideas because
our world is not it's not with composed
of zeros and ones our world is composed
of quantum quantum mechanical effects on
on different scales so and and our
computers are not really representing
the the real physical world because
the zeros and ones quantum effects are
the real representation of the real
world and we can turn that into
advantages so what are the advantages
you can turn that into as as I mentioned
factoring very very large numbers you
know 400 digit numbers 500 digit numbers
I mean we can't do that yet with quantum
computers but the algorithms are there
so once we scale up the number of qubits
that we can have in a quantum computer
we can we can start doing this so so RSA
encryption is based upon being able to
factor large numbers end up into prime
numbers and so Peter shor dr. Peter shor
here created in 1994 what do you call
what he called Shor's algorithm and and
that's this this idea of being able to
then factor very large numbers and so he
was interviewed in 2013 and he said you
know if you start factoring tens digit
numbers then it's going to start getting
scary because we're gonna start getting
close to that there's a there's a paper
by the way this presentation is full of
links that you can leverage and a couple
of housekeeping things I should have
said instead of insulting Johann so much
a couple housing keeping things number
one is I tweeted a link to these slides
and they've got a lot of resources on
them and then the other the other thing
is is it will be taking a break at about
at about 90 minutes in 780 minutes at 80
minutes in and so and then you know
we'll take a 20-minute break and then
we'll continue
I think 61 minutes from now because that
Peter show is that James James Gosselin
I can never I can never tell so wait
wait wait good because you said so the
idea of a RSA encryption is to factor
large numbers into primes well they are
the exactly the opposite so making sure
that you can't factor that but so one of
the so in in this slides we want to show
the practical reasons why quantum
computing might be
quit and and one of the things that this
sure algorithm will will make it
possible to factor very large numbers so
for 4096 bit numbers factor them in in
primes it's something that quantum
computing can do extremely fast now
think about the consequences it actually
means that RSA encryption becomes
useless because it's if it's easy to to
break the key and to find to decrypt
messages that have been encrypted with
RSA encryption then then RSA encryption
becomes becomes users so that that's a
very important consequence of quantum
computing now this will also there are
also new ways to encrypt data thanks to
quantum computing so it's not that we
will that we will have to live without
encryption the may be more philosophical
strategic or political problem is that
if half of the world is still using our
encryption and the other half of the
world is using quantum computing to
break those keys then the first half is
in trouble now it doesn't even take half
of the world if there's just one company
one nation a few people that can break
the existing RSA keys then yeah they
have a heavy huge advantage so therefore
the race to quantum supremacy is really
a very hot race and there are many big
companies and governments that are
working on quantum computing not just
because they like the physical effects
but because of the practical
consequences of this so is there anyone
in the audience here who is working on a
secret project for a government and
anyone in the audience working on a very
secret project for a big company who
wants to steal or break encryption yeah
okay so that's what I assumed so that is
actually the proof no one if you're the
first one who can break air they will
you tell anyone of course not because
you first want to break all the keys and
then he will tell so no one here said
that yes we want to do
this so I think Jim Dale they can all do
it already
gotcha great so another algorithm is
Grover's algorithm and so that's the
idea of being able to find a record in
unstructured data very quickly and so
that's uh it was developed by dr. love
Grover in 1990 was a related paper in
1997 I think that he actually came up
with this in 95 but one thing that he
said was that it's particularly
interesting to program a quantum
computer because there are multiple
things happening in the in the hardware
simultaneously so you need to be able to
think like a theoretical physicist like
my colleague here and a computer
scientist like us and so you kind of
need to do both of those kinds of things
and so there's a good paper that this
link is a good paper
another thing you know I had I keep
giving you letting you not interrupt me
go ahead another thing is applicability
of a quantum computing simulating nature
so I was a as I was already saying our
nature is its composed of quantum
effects and if we want to understand
this better what is better to simulate
nature by something that resembles
nature especially the the world of the
very small sub atomic particles so if we
want to understand things about quantum
mechanics the best the best thing to do
that is to to use the quantum mechanics
in a computing unit themselves so that
we can use them to predict what will
happen and to explain what happens and
why it will happen so quantum computing
will allow us to to have a better
understanding of the different aspects
of quantum mechanics and it would also
be it will also allow us to better
validate the theories and validate if
those theories much with the
experiments and with the reality around
us so where it would take classical
computers billions of years or let's say
close to impossible to to simulate some
processes quantum computers can do it
extremely much faster because they don't
have to simulate they just act because
they they are those small particles that
we want to investigate so I thought this
this quote by dr. Fineman was very
succinct you know nature isn't classical
and if you want to make a simulation of
nature you better make it quantum
mechanically and and it doesn't look so
easy and he you know he said that in
1981 he was right it's not easy that
companies are having a hard time
creating quantum computers but it's a
it's a cool cool problem it's a it's a
cool field for there and some of you
watching who watch this Big Bang Theory
right so you probably recognize Sheldon
over there and and and there was at
least one episode where he was he was
playing as bongo drums and that was kind
of an homage to to dr. Fineman who who
played the bongos what does my goalie
mean I'm sorry by golly what does it
mean and by golly it's a wonderful
problem it just mean really okay no it's
really a wonderful problem okay thank
you not a problem and so why don't you
take this one yeah so this is just
another example there's a the opa
fermium poor tech who heard about it
already so that's a an initiative I
think Google Google is involved in it
yes for determining finding more
information about the electronic
structure of of the subatomic particles
and there are a number of initiatives
now that are mimicking the the laws of
the very small particles and trying to
leverage quantum computing for this
trying to find algorithms that will give
answers to to the questions on what
particles for example or stable and
what how will different particles react
when they interact with each other so
there's there are open initiatives about
this there are so closed initiatives
about it but it's clear that mimicking
nature is one of the one of the big
applications for for quantum of
computing one of the big but not the
only one we don't have to stress that
quantum computing helps finding quantum
theories but it's not only about solving
quantum mechanical problems I think you
mentioned this but you know the over on
the left is is a nature article on the
idea of modeling chemical reactions and
which is it's it's very useful in the
areas of you know making drugs or or
solving environmental problems because
then you can you can model like you said
using no I didn't I didn't say that I
actually forgot it so it's good that you
interest me so but but that's really
important as well so uh in in in lots of
resources involves lots of data
computations for finding a medical
solutions and so they're quantum
computing will definitely help so one of
the one of the goals is that with
quantum computing in not that many years
from now every disease can be
investigated much much much deeper it's
actually what you said yeah so another
thing that they're doing this is in
China there's a couple of arc sieve
papers about this so the the top one
talks about ground a satellite quantum
teleportation and that's something that
we're going to talk about in a little
bit but quantum teleportation is this
idea where you can take the state of a
qubit and you can like like entangle two
subatomic particles of photon or
whatever you can entangle them entangle
their States and you can what they did
was they shot a photon you know one of
the photons there to to a satellite that
was entangled with one on the ground
and they would measure the one on the
ground and then measure the one in the
satellite and and you know and it it
actually did obey the quantum mechanical
property to where they you know
Schrodinger's cat you know where it's
both are zero or if you measure this one
it's a one and that one analyte was one
even though they're separated by lots of
juice so that is something that we will
cover later
quantum entanglement but it is it is the
base if I said RSA encryption will
easily be broken by quantum computing
the new encryption methodologies or
algorithms will partially be based on
quantum entanglement and at least
Chinese already demonstrated that this
really works and it the the the core
idea is that you can have you start for
example with one particle you make two
particles that are somehow entangled
it's not that they have a bridge or so
but then you take one particle on your
arm you walk away and if you look at
that particle then at the same moment
you know what the other particle also is
so it's not that information is being
sent because information was already
there but it allows you to to agree on
random numbers between two parties so
the run the number is random until you
look at it and that is what what is key
to encryption so and one of the
important consequences is if someone
wants to sniff the network he has to
look at the key and by looking at the
key you destroy the physical the you
destroy the superposition State so then
the real recipient of the message can
see oh this message has been tampered
with it's not the original one anymore
and that is what quantum cryptography is
leveraging that is based on the
principle of entanglement which we will
briefly explain later good so what Johan
was referring to is this idea of qkd
quantum key distribution so you can you
can over a quantum Channel then you can
communicate a key and then in the
short-term anyway you might want to go
ahead and use that key in in classical
Kintaro fee but you've been able to
communicate the key knowing that it was
not sniffed so then the second paper is
they did the same experiment only did a
satellite to ground they shot a photon
from the satellite to the ground that
was that was entangled so now the next
thing what questions yeah yeah oh yeah
any questions anyone yes your question
is shouted out now I will repeat it
okay so the question is you know you
mentioned that we did say that RSA at
some point could become useful useless
because of because because quantum then
can can break the keys and then as there
is their replacement a quantum you know
corollary yes
so so then so yes that that is true that
that at some point it'll break RSA but
then at some but then also you can use
you can leverage quantum computing then
to to teleport information and and also
to teleport keys and things like that so
there is a quantum cryptography
cryptography that is so actually the
quantum key distribution is part is a
solution to this problem because you
don't know the key the problem with well
one of the future issues with the RSA
encryption is that you know the public
key it's it's it's not a secret but if
if the key is not known until you look
at it then nobody can know is the key
because once you know the kid and you
know that the key has been tampered with
because if the well yeah because there
are there are ways to find out if if the
key has been inspected already and once
the key is inspected you're not safe
anymore
but as long as the key is not inspected
you can't you can't you can't factorize
it so that is that is that is a so here
another quantum mechanical effect called
entanglement is used to make up for the
world for the fact that we lose the the
safety the security because well the
integer factorization will will be
broken by quantum computers but the new
way of doing is well at least that's the
way that people think now about it that
new way for doing encryption will be
based on quantum entanglement
and it is looking very very promising
and and there have been successful
experiments about it well I don't
exclude that there will be another
theory coming up with with with more
success it's it's not not really the the
theory that matters it's also the how
hard would it be to implement in
hardware because we are talking about
and and and and I prefer talking about
equations and also mathematically we can
do this and this and this and this but
still you need to do this in a in a
computer and that is for me the mind
mind boggling part my bling-bling part
mind-boggling yeah the difficult part so
that how can you get sort of a mini LHC
and laser systems and and and and and
measurement systems in such a small
thing as a cell phone that is a that's
extremely hard and I really admire
people working on the on the physical
Hardware that's a that's that's amazing
so and and therefore evolutions there
will the will in the end tell whether
quantum entanglement will be suitable
for encryption or not yes your to
represent so now let's get into some
there were no more questions I don't
know any other questions yes question
okay so the question is how long before
RSA becomes useless I don't know I
really don't know people are it was some
people are very much respect both
independently from each other told me
ten years I think it will be sooner that
the the problem is yeah as I said if
you're if you have a quantum computer
with one hundred qubits will you tell
anyone so we don't know how how fast it
will go and also there will be a
difference between the first quantum
prototype that can factor those four k
bit numbers but then it's not ready yet
for
productions so it's it's the time
between the first prototype and and
something that can be used commercially
or or at least privately there will
still be some time but I think it's it's
definitely not going to happen this year
but it won't take 20 years so you don't
know either is what you're saying any
other I said it in a more scientific way
I think okay any other questions that
neither one of us can answer okay all
right
so now we'll get in some practical
things as far as like things that we can
relate to as developers so starting from
the very beginning as developers we all
know about classical bits on and off
with quantum computing you have what's
called a qubit and as I mentioned it can
be either on which is in the at the
South Pole there that one or off which
is at the North Pole of the of the Bloch
sphere or it can be in any other state
and those states can be represented by
any point on that black sphere on the
surface of that Bloch sphere and so you
know there's three degrees of freedom
there as far you know like three axes
that you can then use to point to any
part so for example what it's pointing
to now is this superposition that's over
on the right this superposition this
this combination in algebra you could
think of a linear combination of on and
off and because it's a it's it's a
circle it's a you know you're talking
about a kind of a unit circle unit
sphere then the way to get to that point
is is you know 0 plus 1 divided by the
root of 2 and so that would be an equal
superposition of 0 and 1 I prefer and a
lot of people prefer to think of it not
as as as you hear nowadays you know 0 or
1 or both you know at the same time I
prefer to think of it as more
a combination of both and what it's
really in is this this state that isn't
decided until it's measured right yeah
so the so it's not about and there's a
lot of confusion it's not about
probabilities it's not that there's a
60% chance that this cube it is one note
that qubit is one and zero at the same
moment there are different
representations different people have
different opinions about how to
visualize the state of a qubit we will
show a number of different different
ways but the important thing I think I
think at least I think the important
thing is that a qubit can be 0 and 1 or
is in the superposition is 0 &amp;amp; 1 at the
same time and one of the consequences is
if you have two bits you can have 0 0 0
1 1 0 or 1 1 so you have four
possibilities but only if you have two
bits only one of those four
possibilities is two at a given moment
and in quantum computing
they are those four possibilities are
valid at the same moment and that offers
lots of lots of possibilities instead of
doing if instead of doing four
calculations with each composition of
those bits you can do one calculation
that's also mind mind blend boggling yes
we will talk about it later
so what this represents if if you're
looking at the slides or even later
there's a link down here to a really
cool site called desmos that's it's it's
nice for being able to visualize
different mathematical things like in
this case trigonometry and I created a
an image that then represents the points
some of the points on a on a unit circle
that that represent the state of a qubit
so now unlike the Bloch sphere which we
saw just a second ago so that was a
spherical representation of
of a cube it gave me of a sphere there
unlike that black sphere there's another
way as Johan mentioned you can you can
represent it with just a flat unit
circle and so in that unit circle you
can think of it as I as a plane right
where you have and kind of like a plane
and an Associated vector right where you
have these orthogonal basis where you
have 0 here and 1 here and then so the
the the state of the qubit could either
be 0 or it could be 1 or it could be in
that superposition which is which you
can represent is this plus in that
superposition you might remember from
the Bloch sphere slide is you know some
combination so the combination you can
represent is 1 over root 2 0 and 1 over
root 2 1 and that's this position on the
this feet on the circle which happens to
be here you know the square root of 1
over the square root of 2 on the x axis
and then 1 over the square root of 2 on
the y axis which then has is this point
on that circle by the same token you
could have minus something that's minus
on the 0 axis and plus on the one axis
or even minus on both axes now the thing
about about cubits is that and if you
look over if you look over on the left
here the thing about cubits is that you
have the states of 0 and 1 are expressed
in some number it can be real numbers
like you see here it can also be complex
numbers but those numbers have an
amplitude in this case you
if we maybe I'll rotate it a little bit
here and I'll pick on our our equal
superposition that amplitude is 0.707
you know 1 over square root 2 and then
if you take the square of an amplitude
that's the probability that it's going
to be that in that state when it's
measured so maybe one of the more about
this did that's important how how team
said it so that's a compliment so it is
it is the probability that it will have
this state when it is measured so it is
and and and that's very important it is
not a probability that is at that moment
in that state so it keeps in the
superposition state until it is measured
and that that is the key thing about the
quantum computing that it is both States
together and only when it is measured it
will have that probability yes thank you
well said and that's a compliment too so
that's all for the complement for today
yeah no more confident yes ok so then in
this state for example we have you know
point eight eight seven zero for the
zero axis and then point you know four
eight one seven on the one axis and so
then the probabilities up here if you
square them then are make this bigger so
you can see it the probabilities would
be point two one probability that it'll
be zero when measured and 0.78
probability that it'll be one when
measured and so the next slide will will
maybe shed some light on that so this
particular these graphics are from a
really good series there's a it's a
three video series from PBS infinite
series on the math of quantum computers
and so I would I would recommend
watching that series at the very three
very short videos but so you can
represent qubits with a unit circle and
this is just what we were talking about
a second ago
here we just happen to have an amplitude
on the x axis of square root of 1/3
and amplitude on the y-axis of square
root of two-thirds so it's the
probability then of when its measured of
being zero would be the would be the
square root of one third squared which
is one third so it's a one-third
probability that this would be measured
as a zero in it well when its measured
and a 2/3 probability that will be
measured with when it's 1 another way of
representing it is with vectors I mean
these are you know you can this is a
two-dimensional space here you can have
two two two dimensional vectors well you
can represent it this way so this would
be the the zero state because it's one
in the zero state zero in the one
computational basis state what they call
that so that would be the same as zero
and then here we've got 0 1 which would
be which would be the one state or you
could have linear combinations of those
so this 1/3 and 2/3 that's represented
here so we have the root of one-third
zero in and the the root of 2/3 1 which
would be a vector what a vector is just
like a you know one dimensional array
kind of thing and so that's you could
represent it that way as well so so the
first two examples the zero and that's
in the ket notation the zero and the one
those are qubits that are not in a
superposition so the zero is clearly in
in in the state of zero so that is that
is not a superposition it will always be
zero you know for sure that when it will
be measured it will be zero the one when
it will be measured it will be it will
be warm and so you can think of a qubit
in a as a combination of how much 0 and
how much 1 and the last example the
third one that is a qubit in a
superposition so and that I think that
that's an important concept
if you
the zero and one cubit is not in a
superposition but if it's a if it's both
zero and one at the same moment then it
is in a superposition and then the then
you can do cool things with it as we
will show later on on classical bit you
apply classical gates on quantum bit you
apply quantum gates and therefore the
way of how to represent a qubit is very
important for doing mathematical
calculations so one zero means it is
zero there one means it is one and
anything in between means it is both so
as far as like with with classical
computing you know you represent
typically you represent ones and zeros
in silicon you know using transistors or
whatever right but with with quantum
computing we represent them in much
different ways I'm going to ask the
physicist how we represent those yeah
well the fact that we have a real one
with a PhD in physics scares me a bit I
have to explain this so correct me when
I'm wrong representing qubits can be
done in in a number of ways so there are
different different quantum computer
prototypes that are using different
technologies for example photon and and
Jim has a very nice demonstrate it with
the demo board yeah ok cool it's a very
nice demonstration about it the
polarization of a photon can be
horizontal or horizontal or vertical or
it can be horizontal and vertical at the
same moment so that information about
the polarization type of a photon can be
can be used as a qubit so that is a
physical process that from from
something that that can be in two states
at the same moment until you measure it
then it is horizontal or vertical so
that that that matches that mathematical
concept electrons can have a spin up or
down and you don't know until you
measure so it is an up and down
at the same moment so it can also
represent a qubit and and and and it
seems that this is this is being used a
lot lately if you use superconducting
characteristics then and you measure the
charge something can be charged or
uncharged at the same at the same moment
until you measure it again so these are
three physical concepts that that share
this idea of being in two states at the
same moment until you measure it and I
think in in the end one of those there
are a number of orders as well but I
don't know which one will ultimately win
I think and I was in order we actually
prepared this presentation so as I was
reading about quantum computing earlier
today and I read about photons and the
article said it's actually very easy to
to split the photon and create two and
tangled photons I think well that's
slightly exaggerated but how easy it
will be to create this on a scale will
determine how quantum computers will
will really look like at this moment it
seems to me that super calm
superconductors which require low
temperature seem to be not extremely not
impossible to create so maybe that's a
that will be the basis for the future
quantum computers but it can also be the
photos or electrons of course okay Jim
you have to smile because the picture is
taken meanwhile I will answer a question
if that's okay yes yes okay well repeat
the question no he's still asking the
question how can I repeat the question
talking but nobody else can hear what
he's saying
I try to understand the question all
right go ahead sorry can you repeat the
question
[Laughter]
yes
you don't okay so okay so okay so the
question was wait wait the question was
I said that it can be in two states at
the same moment until you measure it so
and then how do you know it without
measuring it and and the thing is you
don't know but that is and and actually
that that is a very good question we we
were giving this presentation that you
have won a couple of weeks ago and we
got we got the same question and I had
an extremely hard time to answer it and
Tim was no use not no useful at all so I
told a lot about it and we added a great
slide I think at least we added a great
slide to to explain this but spoiler you
all know Java 8 probably here who isn't
familiar with the parallel streams in
Java 8 okay so with parallel streams you
can have you have a collection a Java
util collection and you want to do some
processing on it with a parallel stream
you can for example if the processing is
I want to multiply all the numbers in
this collection by 2 with serial
processing you do you'd first take the
first and the second and the third and
so but with parallel processing you can
have all those numbers to be multiplied
by 2 at the same moment okay it is with
different threads because we're still
talking classical computing and then
after this parallel step you can then
reduce the result or map it to the sum
of all those numbers so we have a
correction 1 2 3 4 we want to multiply
every element by 2 and then take the sum
so if and and the end result is only one
number so we don't care about all the
intermediate results as long as they are
computed in the right way we don't care
we only want we are we are only
interested in the measurement which can
be a very simple
but it can be even zero or one and the
same holds with the classical with the
quantum computing does it mean I'm
talking too long no okay so the same the
same holds with with doing these
computations using a quantum computer
you don't care about the intermediate
steps you only care about results but
that also explains why quantum computer
is not suited for all problems because
it's not only that you don't care about
those intermediate results you can't
care about them because if you measure
them bring your system is gone so this
is only applicable for systems that
where you don't care about intermediate
results more or less and there was
another question there yeah so so so the
question was that the different way than
Java dot optional because there you can
measure it twice and that is that is
that is that is very true I'm not gonna
make you talk about it now that's very
because Brian guts is not here so just
we'll just go ahead and move on here so
this is just an example of a chip it's
by Righetti computing in in California
and so this this they actually put at
the bottom of a dilution refrigerator
that's colder than outer space and that
way on the chip that you see in the
middle I think they have nine cubits on
that that that they're they're working
on that that can then exhibit properties
quantum properties and not and not be
exposed to the two you know through the
to the outside world because as soon as
it's exposed then it's it's instantly
measured as soon as it interacts with
the outside world its measured and and
then collapses and so so that's why it
has to be so cold and isolated and that
means so and that's actually coming back
to this pressure as soon as you measure
it it's the end of the of the story so
as long as you don't have to measure it
you can you can you can do strange
things
with it it is and but it is really true
and it sometimes remind me to have time
for a joke anecdote how long is it yeah
one thirty second 30 seconds okay so for
example this is my cell phone and this
is a this can be teleported so I will
put it in my in my pocket here and now I
say hocus pocus putz and the cell phone
is in Jim's pocket don't don't you don't
show it because then we break the
measurement now I will do a second
teleportation hocus pocus putz and the
cell phone is transported back into my
pockets see it worked
so that is actually what we are trying
to explain here at least that that's
what they told us so with quantum
computing you have to believe everything
that's happening in between because but
you can't see it you can only see the
end result and yeah so now we're gonna
talk it wasn't too long no no the axiom
of quantum mechanics so there's there
are three there's the superposition
principle which we've kind of talked
about where it can be in one state or
another state you know a 1 or a 0 or
some combination I'm going to keep
saying you know some combination of both
you tend to be of the of the religion of
they can be both at the same time I say
it's a combination of both or you don't
know until you measure it I think I
think that's ok the only thing that I
think is not ok if you say that it has a
probability of so much right okay all
right good and so we have the
superposition principle then we have
this idea of measurement and then we
have this thing called unitary evolution
and what that is is over time qubits can
can change you know this the quantum
state can change and that's that's how
you program a quantum computer using
these these gates that provide this
unitary evolution the reason why they
call it unitary is because you know
you've got the unit circle each each
qubit can be represented on the unit
circle so the evolution these gates that
you have that change it from one state
to another retains that unit norm
and in addition they're also reversible
it's kind of cool with quantum computing
you can you can take it through a gate
and then you know so you do a
computation and another computation and
then you couldn't reverse that it's
completely reversible so you can back it
all the way up to the to the beginning
state so we're gonna delve into that so
slowly we are moving from the conceptual
things of quantum computing into how you
can program for quantum computing that's
right yeah yeah very good okay yeah
thank you yeah makino first we're going
to show a science experiment mark martin
clan is going to claim is going to help
me and what we're going to do is show
you this idea of superposition States
and then a measurement and and so we'll
do the experiment first here March and
if I couldn't I couldn't really being a
theoretical guy I couldn't really you
know trust your ability to set up the
experiment so so I'm had Martin do it so
what we've got here is three polarized
filters I remember you know light can be
polarized or like you know light photons
are polarized and so this filter is
polarized vertically so when a foot when
photons come through it like you can see
photons coming through it right so you
can see photons coming through it but
all but when they go through it because
it's polarized as they hit that as a
photon hits it it collapses their
photons that were already vertically
polarized are going to come right
through any ones that weren't vertically
polarized are going to collapse into
either vertical or horizontal because
we're measuring in that on that basis in
the vertical horizontal basis so they're
collapsing some of them are gonna
collapse horizontally and so we're not
going to see it but some will collapse
vertically and those are the ones that
we see so now let's say one collapses
verdict
then if you put the other one in front
of it so we can see all the light now
so they're both positioned
they're both oriented with vertical
polarization so it hits the first filter
it collapses in the vertical state we'll
call that one and then it it goes to the
next one well it's already in the
vertical state and so it's not in a
super position relative to the second
one it's just going to pass right
through because it's already vertical so
a hundred percent of the light that gets
through the first filter is going to get
through the second filter but if you'll
rotate the second filter slowly now we
see that now we have a ninety degree so
going through the first filter it
collapsed to the horizontal state
quantum state but now the second filter
is horizontal and as johan mentioned
when you're in in one state and now you
it's in that state so none of the
photons that that got through the first
filter are going to get through the
second filter because it's not possible
for them to collapse in the horizontal
state because they're not in a
superposition they're in there in that
that that vertical state but now the
cool thing is and is that because of
that if we and I'll do the thought
experiment first before you do this if
we interpose of you know we see no light
now but if we interpose a filter that is
polarized at 45 degrees we would expect
that because we've added another filter
that we will see you know no light still
but what's surprising is is that we will
actually see 25% of the light that comes
through the first filter and so if
you'll do that then I'll explain why
that happens so now we can suddenly see
25% of the light that's coming
through that first filter even though
we've added yet another layer okay so
you know so now I'd like to kind of
explain that and and I may need your
Hans help to explain it thank you very
much you've been a great assistant all
right okay so why don't you ask Martin
to explain it if I wasn't allowed to do
the experiment then yes I don't know
don't know okay so I'll talk and then
you can you can help me okay so this is
this is what we did so we have over on
the Left we see light coming in and by
the way this is this comes from a really
nice video from three blue one brown
they have some great videos on on on
mostly on math stuff and they did a
quantum thing with with minute physics
so I would I would really encourage you
to go watch this video but in a nutshell
what happens as you see the blue
polarization they're coming in on the
left and that's at that 45-degree angle
let's say and then it hits this this
vertically polarized filter and some of
them are gonna collapse in the vertical
position and so the blue line the blue
coming in you could think of it as in
that equal superposition up there the
one that's marked with the with the
diagonal line and you know root over
root of 1/2 horizontal root of 1/2
vertical so it's in that position but
then it collapses from that diagonal
position to the the vertical position so
that was that first filter photons
coming through the first filter and then
what happens is you know here we're
measuring it in the computational basis
we're measuring it you know with with
vertically and horizontally
well the horizontal where we're saying
is the the zero state the vertical is
the one state and so so maybe if this
light here if the light
was verdict the photons were polarized
in this position then it's going to
collapse in either a 0 or a 1
probability being more more zero than 1
and so then what happens is we saw this
we saw when we had 90 degree filters
there that we saw no light come through
and then so photons that make it here
through this first filter aren't going
to make it through that filter and we
saw that in our in our experiment
because they it's been decided that they
are vertically polarized and it has
collapsed vertically and so it's it's
not possible it's not in a superposition
anymore
where it could collapse to 90 degrees
and then but then we interpose that lens
at 45 degrees and that actually let's
let more light through and what happens
there is where it was 45 degrees off
that one in the middle and so what
happens is that middle filter measured
the the the state that the photon in an
alternative Bay alternative basis and so
if the photon was coming in vertically
oriented and since we measured it in
this other basis then it's it's in a
super super position relative to that
basis and so it could collapse then to
either either the plus basis or the
minus basis and that's why and so 50% of
the light can come through then that
second filter and then when you have
another filter another filter 50% that
that third filter another 50% because
it's the same story it's been measured
in in the in the computational basis and
so now 50% of the light can get through
that filter so that's why we we saw 25%
of the light get through from end-to-end
through those three filters
so questions on that please
questions yes yes your hand yes
I'm sorry because your could you repeat
it but a little louder please
okay so the the question is as I said if
it's the experiment is you're done when
it's measured right that collapses it so
wouldn't that make this this experiment
inaccurate and so so the when we only
when we exposed the light when we shoot
a photon through a polarized filter that
measures it so in that first photon its
new state well it collapsed to anything
that got through collapsed to the
vertical state so that's its you know
that's its measured state but now so now
it's it the only ones that got through
were ones that either were originally in
the vertical state or collapsed to the
vertical polarization so now so now it
is it's in some quantum state ready to
be measured again right so it's in a
quantum state of you know a vertical we
know that now and so now it's ready to
be measured again with another filter so
it's it's actually three different
measurements rather than rather than
this this idea then of of like deferring
measurements and then only measuring it
at the end
we're actually met in that experiment
just now we measured it three times in
three different bases okay other
questions yes you have a question
okay so the question is is when I when
we did this okay when we did this so the
lights polarized vertically and then
here it's able to get through but then
it's when Martin did this yet oh oh oh
yeah yeah I don't I I think that there
there must be some polarization in the
camera lens or the camera in the filter
in there okay so the the projector has
some polarization okay that's a that's a
very good point
so yeah that's even 1/4 1/4 filter in
the experiment why don't one more
question before you move on yes
okay so the the the question then has to
do with what is vertical what is
horizontal you know is it's you know
because of gravity or you know where you
are on the earth you know what's what's
the frame of reference and so so I may
need Johan's help on this but but but
photons can be verdict you know can be
polarized in you know 360 degrees any
any way right and so and so when we when
we hold a vertically polarized filter up
the point is is that they're either
going to collapse or if they weren't
originally if it wasn't originally
polarized in the same you know direction
as the filter or it didn't collapse in
that in that polarization in that
orientation or if it class in that
orientation then it's going to get
through and so now that's your
regardless of whether you call it
horizontal or vertical or whether
there's an angle or whatever that's the
that is the state that it collapsed to
and then relative to that when you take
another measurement like in that in that
alternate basis it's going to be
relative to that that you're measuring
and so there's not this ground truth of
you know what is horizontal and vertical
it's just I think maybe the confusion
comes from I think I hurt in the
question whether it's horizontal
horizontal or vertical and and and and
and it is not horizontal or vertical
until you measure it it is both and so
it's it's not that light that some light
waves are going like this and others are
going like that it's it's they're they
can be horizontally and vertically in a
combination together and only when you
measure it in a certain reference system
as Tim said then you can talk about so
this is to my measurement system this is
horizontal and this is this is this is
vertical but it's not that for example
yeah that it's relative to to the earth
or or so so there's no no zero
that system for this yes.well repeaters
opposition so the question was it's only
an instrument to create a classical bit
because you can't work with something
in-between well you want to work with
something in between as long as possible
and only measure it when you when you
need to know whether it's 0 or 1 and
then indeed if you're at the end of your
experiment and you need to measure it
then you use this filter for seeing is
this now one or is is now a zero and
we'll show that in some in some of the
examples so there's this famous
experiment called the double slit
experiment and and it it has it's been
used you know for classical physics but
it's also something that demonstrates in
a very real way the the wave property of
quantum mechanics and so we're gonna
we're going to expose you to it now if
you haven't already been exposed to that
and then we're going to leverage it
later in some quantum algorithm so from
a physical we will no no we will explain
it later the that the thing that we
wanted we we brought us up informed now
because the idea of of this is that you
can have constructive and destructive
interference so the the the the bright
spots here or constructive and and black
spots or destructive interference so and
we will explain it later but the basic
idea because now we're going to the
algorithms the basic idea is that in
order to solve a quantum mechanical
problem we want to to constructively
interfere the things that contribute to
the solution and we want to destruct the
the order information so a common thing
in quantum algorithms is that you first
shift the problem
somehow because with the problem Howard
is exposed in the beginning you cannot
really do something but by shifting or
by shifting some qubits and not others
might provide using operations on them
one the the problem area is slightly
different and by doing those shifting
you can have constructive interference
on one hand on the things that you want
to expose and destructive interference
on the things that you that you don't
care about okay so so that in the in a
classic or in the double slit experiment
just let me explain it just a second
here so you have photons coming in from
the left and those because of the
quantum nature of because of the quantum
nature the wave nature of quantum
mechanics you have those photons
interfere with each other
and so we see then that wave pattern and
as as Johann mentioned then on the
screen then we see that that on the the
back wall there that we have
constructive and destructive
interference and so that just
demonstrates that that the light the
photons obey quantum mechanical
principles and so we said that to then
be able to set up for some algorithms so
when you talk about quantum algorithms
we mentioned you know this unitary these
gates that we're going to have unitary
evolution kind of gates so with
classical gates you have and gates you
have not gates you have or gates we're
all familiar with those those work on
combinations of bits but then with with
quantum algorithms you have you have
quantum gates and so some of those are
are similar where we have for example we
have a not gate it's also called a
Holley X gate there's the notation for
it but it'll take a qubit and it will do
a knot on it so it flips the state it'll
flip 0 qubit to a 1 or a 1 to a 0 and
then if you're into linear algebra
here's the matrix that then performs
that operation so you remember a qubit
can be represented in a vector and so we
can multiply that vector by or the
matrix by the vector and then in this
case you know with this gate it would it
would flip the bit so so the the told me
that every equation would decrease the
audience by 1/2 so I wasn't allowed to
to write any equation in there
I assumed to it we would only have one
person and I didn't want to see that
person split but matrix computation is
actually very easy at least at the level
of warm gate on one qubit but the other
principles are exactly the same but just
on bigger matrix matrices but so the the
not gate as a gem set can be represented
by this dis matrix and if you think
about if you remember how a qubit in
state 0 is represented it's represented
by the vector 1 0 because it's 100%
chance being in zero and zero percent
chance being in 1 so that is 1 0 if you
multiply the matrix 0 1 1 0 with 0 1 so
it's the first two times the first
column so that's 0 1 is 0 plus 1 times 0
is 0 so that's 0 at the bottom and 1
times 1 plus 0 times 0 is 1 time it is 1
at the bottom so we will turn the 1 0
into a 0 1 so that means that the qubit
zero became a cube a qubit 1 I didn't
show an equation I just explained the
equation how
but I think that I think I think that
I'm actually they're all gonna walk out
because it's time for a break yeah so
let's get back together at some at ten
after three please all right oh yeah
maybe maybe wait for a before they leave
we have what we will do after the break
is we will continue with the quantum
gate and then we will show some very
basic tools that can help you create
quantum algorithms so that you can play
with the quantum gates on the qubits
actually I think that that's the fun
part
yeah I think they need they want to go
though for for 20 minutes take a break
okay all right I can take a break right
by seeing a little bit everyone welcome
back everyone so we're gonna continue
with some quantum gates and so we we
went through the not gate which flips
bits and then we have the Z gate which
is used sometimes we have this Hadamard
gate and you'll see how to mart a lot
and so and then we have this
controlled-not gate
now the ones above it work on one qubit
the C naught gate actually works on two
qubits and you'll see that in a minute
we also have some other quantum gates
that have to do with changing phases the
the S gate and the T gate we won't
really deal with those much in this in
this presentation also in order to
physically realize these gates these
transformations of qubits and quantum
states there's an example of some
quantum gate hardware and if you could
briefly discuss that I'd appreciate yeah
well yeah it's it's not a real hard with
the so I I'm by no means an expert in in
in this hardware it's a must be
extremely complex to realize this but
the C knob get actually we took a bad
example of this but the C not the
control knob gate first have to explain
it it operates on two qubits as Jim was
telling and so it doesn't touch the
first qubit but the value of the second
Q
it is will be applied with an odd
transformation if the first qubit was to
1.so and and if it's zero nothing
happens so there is a control not so the
first qubit is only used as a probe so
depending on the value of the first
qubit the second qubit will be flipped
or not and yeah then you need some some
hardware to to not measure the first
qubit because if you measure that first
qubit it will be you can't use it
anymore because it will it will be to
its ground state again so you need to
use that state and you need to use the
information of that state to ear flip
the second qubit or not and that is more
or less what's shown in here the
polarization of the incoming wave there
which is the representation of the
second qubit it remains intact in case
the the first qubit the control qubit is
a zero but in case that that control
qubit is in is 1 then the polarization
of that photon will flip from vertical
to horizontal so I think you can imagine
it is well already a classical computer
with transistors which are pretty simple
compared to this
but still it's a it's amazing how they
can have so many transistors on such a
small chip now imagine that you need a
system like this on a small chip that
that is really amazing and and and
that's why for me it's impossible to
predict how long it will take before
this becomes commercially available
because I have no idea how how to do it
but clearly there are experiments that
are doing this so there are quantum
computers that are that are doing this
that have this these gates and these
gates are exactly what is needed in
order to
the quantum computer and the physical
processes need to happen inside your
computer not in the CERN infrastructure
it need to happen in your computer so
you need to have a wave polarized wave
and flip the polarization answer so that
that's that's really amazing how you can
do it in such a small area yeah so that
mean that's one that's one example right
where where the the qubits would be
represented as photons like the some of
the hardware that we talked about it's
it's electrons in superconducting states
and so so though the way to evolve a
Cuba from one state to another with
electrons what might be electronic
pulses or something that that disturbs
it which could be much smaller right
okay so here's we're gonna examine some
of these these gates and what they do in
the unit circle remember a qubit can be
represented in a unit circle here with
zero this way the zero this way what
happens with the Polli x gate is that it
has the effect of rotating in this
diagonal direction so that the one
becomes a zero the zero becomes a one so
we've in effect rotated at that bit flip
and there's the there again there's the
corresponding matrix there's a great
series of videos by the way here's a
link to one of those videos by one of
the pioneers of quantum computing
massive Ozzie Ronnie they're very
entertaining videos and very very dense
with good information so this particular
graphic was was taken from that and then
we have a poly Zee gate it flips the
phase and so the so it is rotated around
this horizontal axis so one becomes
minus one minus becomes 1 so that is
flipping the phase and then plus the
plus state becomes minus minus state
becomes plus
if it's zero then it just stays the same
gonna can I now remember that I should
have interrupted to two hours ago okay
about something unfortunately we can't
travel back in time at the minus one
here mine might if you if you remember
how I did the the calculation so without
writing the equation so 0 1 becomes 1 0
but if probably the values in the vector
can be negative as well and that's
perfectly fine but if you had a can you
bring that up that that external you
know the fact that I didn't want you to
show that was yes that one okay so and
if you go to the negative yeah just like
I'll make them both yeah what reactions
negative okay so the key point in the
vector representing a few bit is that it
should somehow somehow be one but and
that is important those are not
probabilities that if you sum them up
they become one but you'd have to take
the squares of the values of the
elements in the vector and some of those
squares and they should become one as a
consequence and therefore if you're at a
45 degrees it's easy if you have a 1
divided by square root 2 and 1 divided
by square 2 so if you square them it's
1/2 plus 1/2 that's 1 but if you have
negative value values if you square them
do you say written English okay we don't
say that in Dutch cut square is not a
Dutch word so okay so if we if we square
them they they become positive values so
therefore it's perfectly legal to work
with negative values and those are not
negative probabilities so that's not
mine
boggling it's not that this qubit is in
is in then has a negative chance of
being warm or so that that's not the
case the minus the values are easy for
computations but have nothing to do with
probability of being measured
so therefore the important thing is
and all the matrix's so maybe now we can
go back to the to the other side
all those matrices or unitary matrix S
or that's not entire - do they keep the
total probabilities of measuring any
states the same so they are not altering
the system in a way that it becomes
physically impossible so those those
gates that we have here need to somehow
be represented by physical forces so
they have to obey the physical laws and
therefore the minus one here is not
contradictive - to intuition we're hope
that means that we will have a negative
probability no it's not yes because
you're taking the square which makes it
positive and this always whether you're
talking about 1 cubed or two qubits or
however many qubits the the total
probability when you add up all of the
amplitudes and square them is always 1
so that's why it's unitary so then we
have this very useful gate that you'll
see a lot it's it's called the Hadamard
gate and what that does is that will
rotate it will flip along this axis and
so a 1 is going to become a minus in the
minus state and a 0 will become in the
plus State and so here is the the vector
or sorry the the matrix that is applied
to the vector and so here this the H
stands for Hadamard gate so if we if we
took the 0 state and applied the
Hadamard gate it's just saying that it's
going to be in the plus state and that
plus state as we saw on earlier side is
a superposition an equal superposition
of 0 and 1 and then the if you take a
Hadamard gate and apply it to a 1 then
it's going to be
in the - state this one right here which
is in a superposition of of one over the
root of 2 0 and then minus the 1 over
root of 2 1 and as as Johan just
mentioned that's not a contradiction
because if you square a minus 1 over
root 2 what you get is 1/2 and then you
square this 1 over root 2 you get 1/2 so
it will if measured it will still you
know the probability that that this was
going to be measured as 1/2 and the
probability that it'll be measured this
way is 1/2 yeah
there were actually four things I wanted
to add here yeah one of them I forgot
already the second one is what you just
said this matrix why does it have the
wire isn't it just 1 1 1 minus 1 y is
the square root of 2 there well that is
2 to keep the norm so that if you apply
them to to a system to a vector that
sums up to 1 that it still says 1 and
the third thing is that this Hardware
transform you will see that a lot in
quantum computing it is it transforms it
brings a qubit that is not in a
superposition into a superposition with
equal with equal values for being 0 or
being 1 so it's it is yeah you can I you
can consider that as a launched state
for qubit so you start with a clear 0 1
but if you apply a naught and a
controlled not and whatever gates then
it stays in a 0 or a 1 and then you're
more or less doing classical computing
but by applying the harm are transformed
you bring the qubit in a superposition
and and then you can start doing doing
the cool things because then it's both 0
and 1 at the same moment without doing
this it's it's either 0 or 1 and and
and not everything in between so Haddam
are extremely useful for for yeah
launching the the the it brings a qubit
in a superposition so it allows for
doing all these computations in parallel
well soon thank you and and and and and
the for thing the fourth thing the
fourth thing was that in Sam's yeah sure
thing but I forgot the first one so I am
okay with adding a four thing I think
the gates for this or and that was
actually what I what I was feeling
because if you have a classical gate
yeah you need some some transistor
technology to create it if you have a
harder market we showed the hardware for
a controlled not gate for a harder
market you have similar hardware
depending on what your physical
representation of the of the qubit is
but for example a photon can be with
some technologies can be decayed into
two other photons but that's it that
really depends on on what the underlying
physical representation is but there
exists already hardware that allows you
to bring a bit from 0 or 1 into this bit
where it's in that superposition thank
you thank you okay so Johann talk about
the scene at gate so in in in quantum
circuits quantum programs you can
represent them as circuits so each wire
represents a qubit so we have a qubit on
the top coming in the control qubit and
then we have a qubit on the bottom and
so if there if the one on the top is is
one then it'll flip the one on the
bottom and but if it's if it's 0 then it
won't flip the one on the bottom and so
you get these these states so 0 0 goes
to 0 0 0 1 goes to 0 1 but 1 0 goes to 1
1 1 because it's flipped that second bit
also
here's how you would represent then
these and here's you know here's a
formula for ya Wow
so you could represent two qubits as a
superposition here where you've got some
some value some amplitude of 0 0 some
amplitude of 0 1 amplitude of 1 0
amplitude before a 1 1 and then if you
take as C naught then it's going to flip
flip these bits this one and this one if
if the first one is is a 1 and then
here's the the matrix so I'd like to can
can we defer that and come back to it no
actually actually
okay so Johan what are we looking at
here yes yes so so what you were showing
before was a form and I'm not an
equation it didn't an equal sign so
that's why people were not running away
okay so this is this is maybe very
theoretical so far and a couple of days
ago started working on how can we make
this more and more visual and there
exist a number of tools already but
being a Java developers we wanted to do
something in Java so with a colleague at
Gruen we we quickly wrote a java-based
quantum simulator and I will I will show
it how it goes so this is this is just
some work a few days well actually a few
hours probably but it's a something that
you can use to simulate quantum
algorithms and that will that will
hopefully make it more visual we are
making this open source which means that
we hope that many people will contribute
to it so on the left side we represent
qubits those qubits are all in the state
0 which means that they are off and now
we can apply gates so
for example here I have a not gate and
the knob gate changes the cubit from
zero from off to um I can apply the knob
gate to order cubits as well and the
second gate that we want to show here
that we discussed is a Haram our gate
and how am i gate if I apply to the
first to the first tube it will at the
end of the line we see the measurements
so at this point we will measure the
cubits and if we measure those cubits
now there is a 50% chance that it will
be in um and a 50% chance that it will
be in off and by applying gates to those
lines you construct algorithms and if
you want to add more cubits you can you
can add you can add them and you can
apply more gates and note that a harder
mark and a Haram are will correct
themselves so superposition and then
another amar will bring the original
state back so there is just a very
simple very simple simulate with only
two gates we plan to add more gates and
and it's and and and and because we're
doing this in Java it's open source so
make make sure what I want to make sure
is that you understand that this is a
quantum simulator so this is not a
quantum computer in Java so the the code
which we will make public if we clean it
up a bit is just a Java code where we
have a simulator interface where we have
a model which consists of gates and and
circuits the simulator interface is
implemented in a in a class local
simulator which will do the calculations
and if you look at the calculations the
core of the calculation is actually this
this is just a matrix computation so
it's a nothing more or less than
applying matrix operations on on vectors
so it's a it's yeah it's a bit complex
if you have different qubits that need
to
combined at the same moment but the the
core of it is just matrix computations
so the limitation of this is if we have
one qubit we have a 2 by 2 matrix if we
have two qubits it's a four by four with
three cubits it's 8 by 8 so that sums up
very fast so if you have lots of qubits
you won't be able to do this anymore on
a local system and therefore we plan to
have another implementation of simulator
which will be in the cloud so that's
then going to be a cloud simulate so
we're looking for cloud providers to the
hostess because this can be computation
incentive but it's actually the same
principle as and so I want to give some
credits to do to the guys from AI
solutions there are NASA contractor and
they provide they have a client
technology for doing deep-space
trajectory exploration and on the device
can be a laptop or a mobile device they
do calculations for seeing what the best
orbits are for sending satellites and so
and if it requires lots of computations
they offload that to to the cloud for
doing the computation so we plan to do
something similar so with a the Java vex
user interface showing the simulator and
if it's loads
simple calculations with a limited
number of gates you will do it on your
local system and if it's a heavy if
there are many qubits you will need lots
of memory and that's something that we
can upload to the cloud
thank you young so now you can very nice
very nice in just a couple days that was
good stuff for just two days and so what
I'd like to do now is talk we've talked
about one qubit and how that's
represented and now we like to go into
how would multiple qubits be represented
so before I go into this other quantum
simulator called quark I'd like to talk
about represent a
of multiple qubits I think you mentioned
this was cat notation right so when you
see a line a vertical line and then this
this greater than sign and something
inside of it you have it don't you
applied but you didn't mention it so I
thought that I should mention it's yeah
no I appreciate that
so this is called cat notation and it's
a it was created by Paul Dirac physicist
and it's it's used a lot in physics and
its purpose is to be able to very
succinctly very easily represent vectors
and so like an individual cat like like
this one where we have just a one zero
and at the a zero in it that would be
you know that's the state zero that we
talked about for a qubit and so if I had
state zero zero where I've got two
qubits now in this in this combination
of qubits this composite state then I
could just put both zeros in the same
cat and that is equivalent then to if I
just had a zero here in a zero here
which is equivalent to two multiplying
actually doing a tensor product of both
of those qubits and I recall that that a
zero qubit is represented as a vector 1
0 and then if we multiply if we take the
tensor multiplication the tensor product
of those two then what we get is this
vector and is everybody familiar with
tensor product effectives no
unfortunately I can't explain because
I'm not allowed to put equations on
fights
ok so I'll walk through it I'll walk
through it so if I want to take the
tensor product of this and this what you
do is you multiply the the second vector
by each one of
the first vector so the I would take
this one and multiply it by one and that
goes here I take this one and multiply
it by 0 that goes here the same thing I
take the zero multiply it by one that
goes here 0 multiplied by zero that goes
here so that's a tensor product and that
this vector then represents the the
composite state of these two qubits
I had three cubits then I would have
vector as as Johan mentioned of eight
dimensions eight elements in it if I had
ten cubits you know a 10 qubit composite
state that I would add a thousand
twenty-four elements dimensions in my
vector so there's a really good overview
of that from a lecture lecture notes
from John Watrous of the University of
Calgary that that's worth diving into
what I'd like to do then is open up this
quirk
maybe sure yeah yeah Louis the quirk oh
that's Kalos the course yeah okay all
right sure what because there what's on
your mind
there are many many ones and zeros here
and I can imagine it's quite confusing
who is slightly confused who is slightly
confused as well okay who is extremely
confused okay so maybe we need to spend
a few seconds explaining knock yourself
out man
explaining again what a zero no the one
zero zero zero mean I mean Jim did it by
showing the equations but this factor
means this factor is a reference
sensation of the two qubits and the one
on top means that there's a 100% chance
that if we measure the system there's
100 chance that the two qubits will be
in the zero State
zero-zero there's there a person chance
that the qubits will be that the first
qubit will be in the zero state and the
second will be in the one state zero
chance
there's also zero chance that the first
qubit will be in the one state and the
second will be in the zero State
and there's also several chance that the
qubits that the first qubit will be in
the one state and the second will be in
the one state as well so this vector 1 0
0 0 represents the different puzzles the
composites a desig nice word composite
state we don't say that in that zero
well so so and and you will see lots of
if you talk about quantum algorithms you
will see lots of those those factors and
applying gates from vectors is nothing
more than multiplying matrices with
those vectors so that's why it's
extremely important that you understand
what those vectors mean and it can be
confusing I understand because the one
here means it's about the combination of
the two first qubits so it is it is it
is something that you need and therefore
I think it was it was nice that even
even though Jim tried to prevent me from
showing a simple simulator I think it's
it's nice that you use a simple
simulator for playing with very basic
gates that's actually what team will do
himself now ok thank you for that
explanation
ok so our people for is or people a
little bit less confused now yeah most
most are completely not confused anymore
now okay that's good so maybe maybe
visually we'll will help as well okay so
um you have a two qubit system here both
in the zero State okay I see most of
people ah so they just sort of queen and
I think everything is clear now okay so
we have a two qubit system there's the
top wire as the zero Cuba another number
zero qubit
if I wanted to express these together
it's the least-significant cube it is at
the top so this is a zero zero just like
we saw before and so now if measured
there's a zero percent chance that the
zero qubit would be measured as on as
one and the same thing with here this is
the Bloch sphere representation of zero
which is remember pointing north
and then as johann said as he pointed
out in in the in that four dimensional
vector the composite state is a hundred
percent chance of being measured that's
that magnitude squared a hundred percent
chance of being measured as zero zero
see that amplitude of zero zero up there
and then amplitude of zero one is the
magnitude is magnitude squared is zero
so there's a zero percent chance that if
this were measured it would be zero one
a zero percent chance of being measured
at one zero zero percent chance of being
measured as one one so these for the
vector that we showed the previous
flight is actually the same as what is
here in these four elements so and
therefore the woman the zero helped
visualizing it so the the amplitude the
only one with an amplitude of one is the
element in the zero zero position which
was at the top of the vector so at all
different ways for representing
something pretty complex and the quirk
editor provides a number of ways to to
visualize it and different people will
prefer different visualizations but I
think that that quirk simulator if you
why don't you or were you going to going
to show the not gate
oh yeah zero one okay so yeah I was too
fast gone
did you have something to say though I
was going to say this okay okay
no no but it's better that you say it no
dearth do know please please you say it
after you okay so um it's time that you
do something as well yeah okay okay I
guess I'll do my job here okay so now
here's another state 0 1 so that would
be a ket 0 and I kept one there or you
could represent it as a vector vectors 1
0 and then 0 1 we tensor those up and
that would be this state which is
visually shown here so 0 1 0 0 so if we
open that up in the quantum simulator
here let's see right there and see I can
I can drag a not gate here down here see
so now this represents 0 and that that
flipped this bit this 0 qubit into the 1
state so now it's a 1 so the chance of
being on if that were measured is a
hundred percent and so then we see that
the Bloch sphere is now pointing to the
South Pole which is the one
representation and then here we see the
amplitude of 0 0 is magnitude is is
magnitude squared is 0 so 0 percent
chance of if this composite state we're
being measured 0 percent chance of being
0 0 but a hundred percent chance of
being 0 1 so 0 1 0 0 that maps to what
we saw here 0 1 0 0 so it's just a
visualization of of what's happening in
the in the matrix and so then going on
to maybe a little bit more complex so
it's like a simple quantum circuit but
it's more complex than what we've talked
about it also leverages
what the the Hadamard x' and the super
positions that johan just now talked
about where you could create a random
number generator with very easily with a
quantum computer or a quantum simulator
so we have three qubits coming in all in
state zero and then we apply this
Hadamard transform this Hadamard gate to
each one of them and what happens is is
that they go into the Hadamard will
transform it into remember a
superposition an equal superposition so
a zero as you can see there on the on
this this drop down here as a matrix it
transforms zero into a half a square
root of 1/2 0 square root of 1/2 1 and
so it's an equal equal chance of being
measured 0 or 1 which is what is
reflected here each one of these qubits
has an equal chance of being measured as
0 as it does 1 and that's also reflected
here in this quantum simulator its
samples the qubits as if as if measuring
them and so what we see here is the
sampled state so here it's you know
sampling it you know 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
so it's and then we see the decimal
representation as well and we also see
the chance of each one of the them being
each state is being measured so what
we've done here is is basically create a
random number generator that that that
because of the underlying you know if
this were a real quantum computer
because of the underlying quantum
mechanics just naturally generates
you know collapses into random states if
you've got equal superposition so then
the composite state is represented over
here so the the chance of the random
number being 0 0 0
you know like qubit 0 0 0 is 12.5% which
is 1/8
same thing with 0 0 1 etc and so this is
the composite state and note that this
is not the first time that this
composite state does not consist of
zeros and 1 only so the amplitudes the
value is if you remember from the
previous one we were simply playing with
not gates then we had all zeros and one
state was warm because then we ran in a
superposition but now this is the first
time that the amplitude is not 1 but if
you can move over so the value is of
that amplitude is 0.35 if you square
that you will get about 0.12 5 you will
actually get exactly that and because
all values are equal all the eight
values or equal here eight times twelve
and a half percent is 100 percent so
that's the check that in the end needs
to needst always need to hold the
previous examples were very simple all
zeros and one and one so if you square
one and count it to all the zeros you
have warm here but now here there's
there there's not a single truth there's
just possibilities that if you measure
it it will be one of those states so
here we have for the first time an
amplitude that's not 0 or 1 is that more
or less clear ok any questions at this
point yeah we forgot to ask about yes
yeah questions any questions
I got an enterprise interesting question
at the break but what about this
because it was an on topic here it was
definitely on topic
I'll think about it in a will you'll
forget you forget that you were gonna
think about it okay so here's here's a
Dilbert cartoon on quantum
superpositions and observability so
we're gonna be talking more about
measurement now so I'll just let you
read it
okay so now measuring qubits for example
when we when we start out let's say we
have this composite state of zero zero
and then we run it through some quantum
gate and maybe that quantum gate results
in the new state the new quantum state
being square root of 1/2 you know in one
position in 0 1 and square root of 1/2
of 1 0 and so notice that 0 0 isn't
represented and and 1 1 isn't
represented the total composite state of
the of the quantum the quantum state
there is just 1/2 probability that it'll
that it would collapse if measured to 1
0 1 and then 1/2 probability to 1 0 and
then we have another quantum gate that
let's say that it's it evolves it it
transforms it to this state where it's
the root of 1/2 of being measured 0 1
the root of 1/6 being measured 1 0 and
the root of 1/3 being measured 1 1 and
then we observe it so so it's got it
will with probability 1/2 it will be
observed as 0 1 probability 1/6 as 1 0
probability of
of 1/3 being measured as one one and so
there's this whole the the irony I guess
of quantum computing is that is that the
when you're you're creating like you've
got qubits right and you're creating
through gates you're evolving these
qubits and you might have let's say you
know let's say that Google successfully
makes a forty nine qubit machine here in
you know the next two or three years
well what's to to the forty ninth power
it's a it's a really big number right
and so so you have you have that many
states millions of states and each one
of those states then has associated with
it some complex number some complex
number that's it's an amplitude and so
pretty soon you know you have this this
this quantity off you had you know 100
or to two hundred qubits I don't know
what the maximum is but it would take as
many particles as there are in the
visible universe to be able to hold all
that right but but you know that's
that's the idea is that nature you know
you're hacking nature's computer hence
the the talk and so you're setting up
these quantum states that are being
there are being physically kind of held
by nature in the universe right and and
you're able to then take quantum gates
and evolve that state and do these
calculations like you know like a
factoring large prime numbers and doing
all this magical stuff but the irony is
that when you you measure it when you
try to get some useful answer out of it
it it it collapses into one
State okay it is zero zero zero one or
it is you know whatever and so you so
Nature has has has opened herself up to
to these great computations but then
when you try to you know you can't look
at what what the intermediate states are
all you can see is you know an answer
like you know the probability of the
prime factor being this of that number
is you know there's a there's a 75%
chance that the prime factor is one of
the prime factors is 19 you know that
type of thing and so that's what that's
the did you fall asleep while I was
saying that I was actually thinking how
to explain this right and right when you
switch to it I got it okay good okay
thank you right so I thought you were
nodding off falling asleep no no I think
he that during the break I didn't I
didn't get a cookie cookie somebody get
this man a cookie you are thinking about
sending a message to okay for me no so
this is actually what what what I
explained in the in the beginning
without without this fly to the parallel
with the parallel with parallel
processing in Java I like that the
audience likes it too so since you've
already explained it do you need to
explain it again yes because I have a
very I think because I have a hopefully
an idea on how you can value Y quantum
computing is so powerful even though in
the end you will only measure simple
states so as I said in Java stream
computations you can use a parallel
stream and I'll have each element of
that stream being processed in parallel
Java will use a new thread for this or
thread pool so it doesn't really happen
in parallel but in quantum computing it
happens in parallel in the end
you still have all the information in
the same number of qubits as that you
started with but one example and of an
algorithm that doesn't exist and that
you can probably also easily prove that
it can't exist in quantum computing but
something similar does exist and we will
come back to that later is suppose that
I have 10 cubits and I want that means I
can represent numbers from 0 to 1023 and
I want to find the biggest prime number
between 0 and 1000 23 what you would do
in a classical computer is restorative 0
is it a primary yeah you will start of
course with the highest number and see
is it a prime no ok then I will go one
lower is it a prime and I will go one
lower and and so on and so on but with
quantum computing it would be possible
that you compute you you compute them
all at once in one step and the end
result has the qubits in such a state
that if you sum them up as bits that has
the highest prime number that can be
represented with ten bits so I think so
hopefully you understand now that even
though in the end your information all
the intermediate information is
unavailable you can't read what is
happening in between that the fact that
you can have a result can be of enough
information for solving a very complex
problem and that brings us actually to
how so that's the way how I would how I
like to explain it very complex problems
can have very simple solutions do you
hear me coming in next night yes and
very complex problems can require lots
of computational power and the result
can still be very meaningful for example
and that's how team what to expect so
right so Hitchhiker's Guide to the
galaxy who knows deep thought ok so so
so deep thought took 7.5 million
years of calculation to get the the life
- or to get the answer to life the
universe and everything and came up with
42 and so and so you know here it comes
up with the the quantum state 42 so
after all of that calculation and in
using all of the resources of the
universe then you measures one quantum
state you with with with some
probability and so that's the the kind
of analogy that I like to think of so
now we're going to go to questions all
questions yes any questions
okay so the question is is the thing
that comes out of these quantum gates
exact or is there okay
so or is there a chance that it will be
incorrect okay yeah okay so so do we
know that it will be the prime number or
is like there's 70% chance that it will
be the prime number and so the short
answer is it's always a probability like
when it when it collapses and it
collapses to some state then there's
always a probability associated with it
right there's a probability that it will
collapse of this state but when it
collapses to that state you don't know
what the probability was that it was
gonna collapse at that state but all you
know is it collapsed to that particular
state now due to the nature of the
algorithm the way that you set things up
you may know that there's a hundred
percent chance that it'll collapse to
this state or that state and so when you
measure it you know you know you know
that that's the that's the answer but
there may be another algorithm to where
for a different problem to where the the
probabilities maybe it's maybe it's an
eighty five percent chance that it'll
collapse to a particular State and so
you might have to measure it three or
four times
you know until you have the confidence
that that that they had that you get you
know maybe three times that same answer
so you have a confidence that that's the
correct answer so adding to that so
indeed if your algorithm predicts that
in the end you will have the exact 100%
probability then you're not yet fine
because in today's quantum forces there
still there's still some error
so typically experiments are done a
number of times to reduce the error but
that's one of the big things that
they're working on in a quantum
computers to reduce the error rate of
yeah of the of the different gates so
that that is still the case but even
then if you need to do the algorithm
1000 times or so it's it's gonna be much
faster than then infinite and infinity
is the time it would take to do it with
a classical computer true and it to add
to that and also you know for every
qubit that you have in a quantum
computer depending upon the the
underlying physical technology you might
need a hundred or a thousand cubits or
whatever to as as error correction right
so so it's it's that's why the problems
so nasty as far as building a quantum
computer so now I think that we've said
enough to where weakens we can start
into quantum algorithms so that's where
we're at is quantum computing algorithms
and we're gonna start with what with
what I understand to be the very first
quantum computing algorithm and that's
called deutsches algorithm it was it was
discovered or proposed in 1985 literally
the hello world of quantum algorithms
and it's got two qubits and I'll just go
ahead and walk through this this is a a
quantum computing circuit I've got two
wires coming in two qubits coming in
we've got a one in the zero state coming
in at the top we've got one in the one
state coming in at the bottom so that
the state of the system at this point in
time right here is one zero because this
is the least significant bit qubit so
now we send them through how to Mart
gates and so now the state of the
compute the the system is going to be an
equal pursue per position of four
different states as we've talked about
and then we've got and I'm going to walk
through this again in more detail but
just over viewing this is called an
oracle or a black box that is going to
handle some function so it's a black box
in the sense that you give it some some
argument in
and then it's going to give you some
result out but you don't know the
internal workings of it and then we're
gonna throw the bottom bit in the trash
and then we're going to apply a how to
marred on the top bit of a qubit if I
say bit I mean qubit and then we're
going to measure it and so that's the
algorithm and I'll delve more into that
so the algorithm is supposed to solve
deutsches problem so what is deutsches
problem so Joyce's problem is if you
have a function that takes in one bit
one and this time I do mean bit I
shouldn't have said that
it takes a zero or a one
so if that function then no matter what
you pass in returns the same thing then
we call that that we'll call that a
constant function so I passed a zero in
it returns a zero pass in a one turns a
zero that's a constant function same
thing as if it always returned to one
that would be a constant function but if
it returns something consistent but but
but in a balanced way we'll call that a
balanced function so if I pass in a zero
and it returns a zero but if I pass in a
one it returns a one you know every time
then we call that balance conversely we
would also call it balanced if we turn
if we send it a zero and it returned to
one or send in a one and return to zero
we'd call that balance the output is
balanced the output is constant or the
output is balanced yes thank you
and so then here's the the black box the
Oracle then that that will that will
implement that function and it's
implemented as a quantum gate now we've
talked about how quantum gates are
called unitary they preserve the unit
norm which means that they when you send
something through
quantum gate the probability of the
system is is always still going to be 1
it preserves the unit norm but also
they're reversible so as opposed to like
a an and gate where you have you can
have two inputs and one output with
quantum gates you always have the same
number of inputs as you do the outputs
because then they're reversible you
haven't lost any information with a NAND
gate if you have a one in a zero going
in and the answer is zero coming out if
you just had that zero you can't reverse
it you don't know what came in you've
forgotten but with a quantum gate you
you have the same number of outputs as
you do the inputs and so you can reverse
it all all quantum gates are reversible
you know you can you can reverse them so
the way that this quantum gate works is
that the input comes in as a qubit let's
say it's then a zero are one qubit and
then the output for the output the
function is applied so you know if you
had a if this were a constant function
that first one when I said zero if I
zero came in then the the function would
be applied and then this would be a zero
and then we would this stands for X or
exclusive or we would exclusive or yet
with whatever came in on the B so if a
zero came in on the B and then this
function returned to be R 0 0 exclusive
or zero is is exclusive or is zero
because they're not exclusively or and
so that's that's the idea here
so Deutsch is algorithm so so the the
the question and you
how many queries of the Oracle do we
need to solve this problem directions
problem may be the the problem that we
want to solve is finding out if the
function that we're investigating is
that the balance function or a constant
from sorry
that is the problem it's always not that
you tell the solution but it always
helps if you first know the profile
problem but in this case that and that's
why I didn't want to make make fun of
you but in this case the problem is a
bit weird because the problem is that we
will not want to find the result of the
function we just want to know if is this
function balanced or not it's extremely
unusual
it seems very in useful but that's why
it's called the hello world of quantum
computing because it shows how how you
can compose gates to fix a problem and
it's the basis for the much more complex
problem so the problem is do we have a
balanced function or a constant function
we don't care which balance functions
which constant function is just easy to
balance function or constant thank you
for doing that yeah that's that makes it
much clearer thank you yeah the solution
is it's more complex but you will
explain that yes so how many queries of
the Oracle would it take to solve well
classically it would take two and so
what I would do is if I were trying to
solve this as I would pass in a zero and
then notice which one of these I got
maybe I get a 1 and now I pass in a 1
and I would note which one I got let's
say I got a 1 again and I would know
yeah that's that's constant but it it's
gonna take 2 queries minimum classically
so how many queries of the Oracle to
solve quantumly and so now we're really
getting the heart of quantum algorithms
and why they're useful so quantumly
believe it or not it takes one and the
way that we do that is we create a
superposition of inputs we're going to
do that with those Hadamard x' and then
we're going to leverage constructive and
destructive interference
like we did with the double slit
experiment to then weed out the wrong
answer and and make the right answer
appear so how do we do that
so how would we do it classically so
remember we we use vector and matrix
multiplication but the way what do you
when you're multiplying a vector by a
matrix do you just call that matrix
multiplication or do you always say
vector - main vector and matrix
multiplicative you the working with the
multiplication okay all right so thank
you anyway are useful yeah that's really
useful so anyway so this is matrix and
it's called a permutation matrix but
anyway it's the gate it's the the matrix
that's going to it's that this Oracle is
going to use to to take this input and
produce this output and so if I were
going to let's say that I wanted to pass
a zero into that dysfunction and you
know and I get a zero and then I pass a
one in and I get a one that's a balanced
function and so how is that implemented
well the matrix to implement that is
right here and so here's an example I
pass a one into this one
this is the least significant qubit
right here so I pass a one in and if
it's a balanced function I'm gonna
expect to get a one out and so so here's
the here's the transformation with a
vector to matrix multiplication here
it's it's the second element here is a
one and so what what that does is that
picks out the second column of this
of this matrix and so we can very easily
see then that the result is is this
which represents 1 1 and so querying the
Oracle classically using using using the
gate is is just like this and and you
would need to do that twice
classically so now with quantum
parallelism right how would you how
would you do it quantum Li and so the
kind of the common misperception as far
as like quantum algorithms you know how
does a quantum computer work the the
common misconception is that it tries
all the answers in parallel and it
doesn't do that but what it does is it
is it sets up a superposition kind of
like the double slit experiment and
choreographs things to where it
constructively makes the right answer up
here you know makes it more likely by
having constructive interference and
then takes tries to weed out the wrong
answers by having destructive
interference so the right answers would
you know would be brighter you know and
the wrong answers would be darker so he
has the opportunity for you as
developers I think when I said twice the
analogy with the Java parallel streams I
try to warn you that it's not as simple
as that so it's not that the quantum
computing is doing everything there in
parallel
you need to to shift the problem a bit
so that it can be solved much easier and
this very simple hello world program is
already difficult to understand and the
further we go with algorithms for
socialism they become even more complex
and so there's definitely need for our
first of all the heart we need to be
fixed but the hardware guys will do that
the second is that the algorithms need
to be created in order to create to make
quantum computing useful and I think
that on top of this low level stuff that
we are doing now that you can build
higher-level gates that you could then
use for another way of programming in
quantum computing without having to
think too much about the low-level
things that we are explaining now so
there is definitely a huge opportunity
for developing quantum computing and
developing quantum brain works
absolutely absolutely this is a so Scott
Aaronson is is one of the kind of
luminaries in in quantum computing and
he's a I think he's a theoretical
physicist at University of Texas I think
but anyway he he has this cart he had
this cartoon commissioned which is kind
of like the talk you know the
birds-and-the-bees talk that that you
would have with your teenager only it's
the quantum computing talk and so here's
a link to the cartoon but one of the
frames in the cartoon is is is saying in
quantum computing the whole idea is just
to choreograph a pattern of interference
or the paths leading to each wrong
answer interfere destructively and
cancel out while the paths leading to
the right answer reinforce each other
and so that's what we're going to do in
this one and so this is a very busy
slide so we're not going to go through
all the numbers but but I want to show
you kind of how how the the constructive
and destructive interference happens in
these gates so so here with this is the
the Deutsch algorithm represented in in
gates or our very it's a it's kind of a
little bit of a variation of deutsches
algorithm represented here in this
circuit so you have the zero coming in
and
coming in at the bottom and then you run
them through hata Mart's and so this is
zero and one
actually you know one zero because this
is the least significant is represented
by 0 0 1 0 so this is you know 0 0 0 1 1
0 so that's a 1 0 and then we multiply
it we do a matrix to vector
multiplication by this matrix well what
is this matrix this matrix is is 2
Hadamard gates the tensor product of 2
Hadamard gates well the the Hadamard
gate from a previous slide is this so
you would multiple so if it were one
cubit you would take the state of one
cubit like a vector representing one
cubit and you would multiply it by this
matrix but if you have to Hadamard x'
you know on two adjacent wires here then
you you take the tensor product and so
here we have the tensor product of maybe
yes in general and not again not allowed
to write equations if you have two
qubits and you have two gates applying
to the qubits then the result is so you
have get a two qubit X get B two qubit Y
the result is the tensor product of gate
a and B times the tensor product of
qubit X and qubit right that's something
that you can prove but that's also very
important in all the algorithms here so
that but that means that you go from a
two by two matrix for applying gates to
one qubit to a four by four matrix to
apply two gates to two different qubits
and that's the four by four matrix that
you see there that's been applied thank
you so now if we multiply this vector by
this matrix then that that does you know
that's going to evolve the state to this
next state so if I multiply this by this
then now we have this super
position which is represented here by
this this vector and so notice that you
know half of them are plus half of them
are - it was like the waves these are
you know this state right here is like
the wave pattern that the double slit
experiment and so now that's the input
to our Oracle or a black box maybe just
questions through the to the audience to
see who's still awake
what is the chance if we do a
measurement right now before we are at
that Oracle what is the chance that we
would measure the first qubit in a one
state and the second tube with also in
one state great great
25 percent that's we had a book we would
hand it to you now but but it's square
of 1/2 we write the square of 1/2 right
so now we're going to take it through
the this this gate this this black box
which is represented with this
permutation matrix so notice that we're
not going to query this Oracle we're not
going to do this operation two times
we're just going to do it once and so we
take so here's the state here's the
quantum state and that's so we're just
repeating that over here the plus plus
minus minus going to multiply that by
the matrix for the gate and we end up
with this superposition so that's the
superposition that we that we have at
this point
and then we do we multiply it by the
Hadamard z-- you know we we we send that
superposition through these two Hadamard
z-- so here's the superposition again
repeated from down here we multiply it
by this matrix that represents that the
the tensor data marts and we end up with
zero zero zero one which represents one
one
so so this is kind of like the a mini
double slit experiment so what we've
done with this oracle here is we've
orchestrated the constructive and
destructive interference and which which
ends up with this state at this state
and then here we're focusing the light
back onto the back wall the back screen
you know this is the the result of the
constructive instruct destructive
interference and so that's the that
that's the end of that state so now if
you looked at four different for
different situations here where you have
these are the Ravens the four functions
where you've got constant here constant
here balance here balanced here and
these are the these are the circuits
each one of these is an individual quark
circuit that represents that particular
function algorithm so that so here we
have an oracle that does nothing here we
have an oracle that that that flips the
bottom bit etc and I'll get in I'll get
into one of those in a second but what I
want you to notice is the end result
here this slide answers the question why
could we do it in one query rather than
needing to why did we only need one
quantum query and the reason is is the
the superposition we were castrated this
superposition to where when we measured
it it collapsed if it was constant if it
was a constant function that it the
state is going to be here it's going to
be one zero with a hundred percent
probability and if it was this Oracle
here the state it's still going to be
one zero with with a hundred percent
probability
notice that the phase is reversed and so
because of the constructive and
destructive interference we've set
things up to wear when it's measured
it's guaranteed that if it's a constant
function that the result will be the
quantum state 1 0 and then similarly if
it's balanced with there's a hundred
percent probability of where the state
is going to be 1 1 and so I can open up
the quantum circuit for example for for
one of the constant functions and see it
was like let's say this constant
function and we see you know here's the
state coming in the Hadamard these this
represents as we saw this is a
representation of the vector the plus
plus minus minus and then we send it
through this this Oracle yeah it's a
very simple Oracle here we're just
applying a not gate and so then that
flips the the bit on the bottom wire and
then that is the that minus minus plus
plus superposition that we saw we send
it through a hat amarte measure it and
then it collapses to where to where 100%
probability that it's the amplitude is 1
0 and so we have just seven minutes left
so that this shows that with one
evaluation we know whether the function
is constant or balanced we don't know
which constant or which balance but for
this problem we didn't care in classical
computing maybe we have to skip a few
sites where you go to the numbers with
because this problem can be repeated for
higher numbers of higher qubits ok ok
I'll go ahead and skip to so so now
we're gonna thank you we're going to go
to the Deutsch Yosha algorithm anybody
Hungarian here I need to know how to
pronounce Yosha is that correct yeah Joe
Joe Joe Joe
ok very good thank you
so it's the same problem only it's kind
of generalized and here's the circuit
same circuit but there's n number of
qubits coming in to the function so
that's the Deutsch Osia algorithm and it
was it was proposed in 1992 and so it's
still determine if the function is
constant or balanced but we have X
number of bits cummick bits coming in
rather than just one and so here's here
we could have let's say we set up the
problem to where we have three qubits
coming in from 0 0 0 1 1 1 and then week
if it was a constant function it would
always be either 0 or always be either 1
if it was balanced and we could set it
up for example if it's even it'll it'll
be 0 if it's odd or it'll be 1 and then
there's another function that if you
know it's it just reversed maybe maybe
that's an important okay and so
classically so classically how many
would it take well it's going to take
for however many bits are coming in it's
going to take 2 to the N minus 1 of
those bits plus 1 so if 8 bits coming in
you're gonna have to query at 5 times
but with quantumly it's exponentially
faster
you just have to query at one time and
that is because if it's a constant
function there's a hundred percent
probability that it will measure 0 0 0
because of this constructive
interference
so here it's perfectly constructive
interference to where when you send it
through Hadamard x' it's going to be 0 0
0 and on our percent probability that it
won't be 0 0 0 because of this
destructive interference if it's a
balanced function so now going to talk
about quantum entanglement in the
- that we laughed that we have life well
no no we will use most of those time for
Q&amp;amp;A okay for showing the other
algorithms so quantum entanglement is
very important but because we have no
time I will just explain the very basic
concept with punctum computing it is
possible to create two qubits that are
entangled which means that they are
related there are in a superposition
state but if you measure one and it
turns out to be one then you know that
the other one is one as well and you can
do that with qubits so with two qubits
you entangle them and then you move them
to different locations for example a
consumer and a producer and that is what
is used for for encryption for example
because the moment that the consumer
reads his qubit then the producer will
have the same value so that is actually
distributing a random number between
different users the question in the in
the break an hour do remember it was yes
but if someone in the middle tries to
read this qubit then he destroys the
information but how does the sender the
receiver knows that the information is
being destroyed again you do some of the
operations like we did in the Dutch
algorithm you don't directly measure
that first that that cubed that is
entangled but you add another qubit you
do some for example to see not operation
and then based on the value of that
qubit you can of the control qubit you
can still see if the first is in a
superposition or not so very briefly
entanglement combines allows you to to
share information and the value of the
qubit once you read it in qubit a it's
also it has the same value in QB and it
opens lots of possibilities for
different algorithms you have gates word
as well and we will skip the
teleportation because I think what we
wanted to do is very briefly show that
there we now show the hello world of
algorithms of quantum algorithm but
there are much more algorithms and you
know I think the okay good yeah so
there's a there's a progression of
algorithms
and you can go through these slides that
that kind of step-by-step takes you to
where you can understand Shor's
algorithm and there's a really good
video on Shor's algorithm we have two
minutes you can explain Shor's algorithm
right so so there are there are four
steps to it three of them are classical
step one
I was joking three and four are
classical the second one
finding the period of a number then is
is one that quantum computers are really
good at doing there's something called
quantum Fourier sampling that does a
Fourier transform that makes it that
it's very easy to do to do period
finding finding the period of a function
which is something that is is critical
for being able to factor a large which
which is much harder to do with
classical computers so there thatthat
slide shows I think if you go back to
this previous right so it actually what
we said in the beginning for some
problem areas quantum computing is best
suited for orders a classical computer
is best suited and here it is shown that
and as we explained that if you combine
classical computing and quantum
computing you can easily break
everything encryption yes yes so we have
a minute and a half left if you have
questions please please let us know here
and then after afterwards then please
come up and we'll be able to answer
questions as well about any questions
now while we have some time questions so
I see anybody yeah okay yes question
okay so the question is what's the
difference between a zero and a one
because in both when you send it through
a Hadamard because it goes through a
superposition so back on this they're
both in a superposition so back on the
gates go back to the gates here yeah
here's how to Margate so the zero when
you send it through a Hadamard gate it
goes to the plus state and a 1 when you
sent it through how to mark goes through
the minus state
well the plus state is is 1 over root 2
0 and a 1 over it to 1 but the minus
state is a 1 over root 2 0 minus 1 over
root 2 1 and that in the in the hello
world algorithm the Deutsch algorithm
was the key was one of the keys to
constructive and destructive
interference but what's what's
interesting then is if you send it
through a Hadamard again remember gates
are reversible and some gates are
reversible by using the same gate if I
send it through the Hadamard again it's
gonna end up as its original one so if I
sent dude to had a Mars on a zero to get
a zero back to had a Mars on a one I
would get a one back so amplitude is the
same but the phase is different and
that's what you can keep in the next in
the follow-up gates you can take into
death
yeah but if I if I measured it at this
point it's gonna measure you know with
half probability of 1/2 probability 0
thank you very much for your patience
and your attentiveness and if you have
any more questions please please come
out thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
