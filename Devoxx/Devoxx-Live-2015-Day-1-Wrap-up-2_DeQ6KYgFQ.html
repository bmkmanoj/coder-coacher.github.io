round up for day one fantastic cheers
guys cheers oh we're just enjoying our
very inception with our faces on our
beer yep yeah I love drinking a beer
with my face on it i also like trickier
beer with your face oh this is like a
mutual appreciation society came here
with both your faces on FY faces on it
that's even better talk about the
technology to why we are gathered here
today yep Oh are we because this morning
was very much quantum physics as well
yeah the keynote with Lawrence Krauss
this morning was kind of mind-blowing I
really liked I saw a tweet halfway
through a guy kind of gushing onto it
again oh my god what do you actually do
when you're in the same room as your
hero watching him and I thought that was
that was nice we've made someone's dream
come true he was paid back by his hero
telling him that his life with pointless
conference is pointless yeah it was good
it was good it's set software in
perspective whenever you've went even
got a bug in your code you don't need to
worry because life is short and
everyone's going to die eventually
anyway so it's a good it's a good
takeaway yeah absolutely i mean
effectively what's the point of us being
here today what was the point in us
being here yesterday as well it was
interesting he had a focus on religion
is just nonsense effectively and in
software that's very important too
there's no religions and software
following Dogma is I think there's still
some softwares that are that about down
to and worshipped a little bit almost on
a on a annual basing or based on we see
the next fad come along not necessarily
the next fad but well you know there's
another buzzword that everybody's less
about docker is the new religion da
continually religion at the world and I
think for me today I've been speaking to
a number of people and microservice
comes up and
the glaze hits some people's eyes
container lazed / eyes sometimes the
eyeballs roll back it's not that they're
not important it's just I think if you
go to a lot of conferences exactly
you've probably had your fill to self
you know if your conference doubt you're
absolutely high on the micro services
and the darker but I think it's still
something which a lot of people are
still adopting yeah so there's still a
lot of use in that kind of it yeah I'm
that kind of discussion moment i agree i
don't think we can stop talking about
this because when we come to an event
like dev ox you have a range of people
who come in and won't have been
subjected to as much information and
talk about it as we have over the last
six or something so incredibly relevant
still the trends and kind of things that
are popping up Richard from your
perspective is there anything
particularly that's jumped out at you I
think looking at devoxx specifically
there's a few Java nine talks coming up
lucky enough to get some of the JDK core
developers / mark reinhold scheme the
keynote this morning it's interesting to
see a lot of those changes because well
as Java rates a lot of big changes a lot
of stuff that was really useful for
day-to-day Java developers lambdas
streams collectors all of these stuff
jarvan I'm not such an easy sell for
people because a lot of the advances are
under the hood a lot of the advances of
her framework authors and library
developers Mac Reinhold himself said the
fact that there might be some breaking
code might even slow adoption for java
yeah yeah I think he's absolutely right
there it's going to be a bit slow and
there's gonna be a few things which will
break along the way but hopefully
hopefully once they're over the hump
looking forward to Java 10 which is more
again developer focus yeah absolutely
it's good to see marked speaking the way
that he did this morning and we showed
that I guess earlier today as well on on
the devil's live stream so a lot of
people would have seen it now even if
they weren't able to be here which is
great stuff personal highlights for you
today for me I did so I didn't ignite
talk today and I've never given a proper
ignite talk before which over at the
slides for and this went on ignite talk
you don't know the slides all to advance
on you after every 15 seconds and you
have no control over them but the sign
five minutes five when he's lied try to
slide yeah
and it seemed to go fine so that was
that was a big relief for me I think the
other the other big highlight for me was
the Lawrence Krauss keynote as well I
thought it was just an excellent tour
lots of interesting stuff going on there
mind-expanding yeah it's great to see
that kind of keynote at a tech event as
well because I think too often we get
kind of caught up on making sure hey
let's do a technical keynote or let's
try and do something specifically
designed for developers whereas actually
we can expand our minds by bringing
somebody else in and a lot of people
will have had a grounding in physics so
you know it's not a completely cold
audience but it's completely away from
what we would what we would normally see
somewhere like this I thought was
refreshing be expecting I think which is
kind of the core of DevOps isn't it
there's always a surprise than the mix
yeah creator of minix here as well this
week yes I drew tannin bounding yeah
he's speaking tomorrow right it's gonna
be very interesting absolutely some
people kind of looking at it almost why
is he here this is his community but
it's great that he kind of wants to come
and be yep yeah and also lots of lessons
we can learn from him he's very notable
in the field a lot of the maybe not
day-to-day technologies that people use
but other kind of grounding and
foundations that they rely upon came out
of work that he did and people like him
did as well so we should always remember
that historical context and fundamentals
as well I think yeah and I I'm really
looking forward to tomorrow I think it's
going to be another cracking day yeah
and probably not quite as good for me as
today I got introduced not once but
twice as Mark Reinhold this morning
before walking on stage I'm hoping my
wife's not watching because she's never
going to expect a pay grade to have gone
up with a new name that didn't happen
but seeing the state rebranded as book
ah yeah week writing the stage as Fox
this morning was good fun as well so
yeah really good day actually I caught
the end of Jurgen Hollis session before
having to run down here as well and that
was packed out and it seemed that Jurgen
was really walking out on stage as well
so much for watching that back cool I
think the journey yet thank you very
much for the feeds very thanks very much
cheers Cheers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
