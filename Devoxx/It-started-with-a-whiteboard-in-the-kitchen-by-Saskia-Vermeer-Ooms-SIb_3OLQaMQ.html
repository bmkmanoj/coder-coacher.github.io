welcome everybody to my quickie I'm
going to share my experiences of
bringing agile into my family while
you're munching away on your salads so
first question how many people have kids
in the audience yeah how many think it's
easy raising kids no you can leave now
for the rest of you I'm hoping I can
give you some helpful practices of
getting agile into your home and maybe
getting a more structured wave raising
your kids for the ones that don't have
kids please be inspired to use agile
outside your workplace for remodeling
your kitchen or doing something with
your hobby club well anything so first a
disclaimer I am NOT a child psychologist
I open tend to be I also don't have any
diplomas of teaching or so it's just my
story my story that what works for me
might not work for you but maybe you'll
get something out of it especially don't
expect any silver bullets you need to
experiment with this and see how it goes
a little bit of my way so who is mom at
work I have a background in mathematics
I've been a software engineer for over
15 years now the past three years I've
been working as a score master for a
small company in the Netherlands called
worth internet systems next to that I'm
an active member of the dutch chapter of
touches and i'm a board member of the
dutch deb books for kids so organizing
lots of workshops for getting kids to
code and i have a husband and three kids
I'll introduce you to them later on so
let me first tell you why I like agile
as I work it use it in my workplace and
I get that it's small chunks of work in
small chunks of time so it's an
iterative process it helps you get to
prioritize your tasks what are the
things that we need to work on first to
get the most value change is always
happening and because you have small
iterations you're you're able to adapt
to change better we're like a lot is the
evaluation at the end what did we do
good what can we improve on and
prioritize what you're going to be
working on for the next iteration this
way you can remove the barriers that
make you unhappy and do things better so
why do I think my family needs agile
well nothing is more changing more than
a family so you have all these different
phases where once they get finally get
to sleep okay and nice you have problems
waking them up to go to school first
you're you're traveling getting them to
hobbies and having to bring them
everywhere and then you're you're worth
eight at night why aren't they coming
home yet so it's all these changes that
many different roles so it can't be a
rigid system with fixed rules because
just doesn't work trust me then the
thing about shift of power what I mean
by that is if I look at my work when our
team is doing a sprint and it's not just
a scrum master or anybody else dictating
what's going to happen it's the whole
team feeling responsible for the end
result I don't have to yell at them well
not not always to get them to do what I
want
and in the home it's usually things are
dictated by the by the mom and her dad
this is the way we do things in the kids
just either follow or usually they don't
and I think that's smile I think that's
what empowerment is all about getting
everybody feeling responsible for the
end result so they actually do the right
thing yeah so let's meet the team so you
already know everything about the mom we
also have a dad who in my case is also a
Java developer which and he is also
using agile force at work and this helps
it helps to have a buy-in by your spouse
when you bring something from the
workplace into your office so that was
very easy for me then we have the boy
who's 13 who looks like a girl but he
really looks like that and yeah just
basically year 13 year old he's looking
at the internet now trying to get
computer parts to build his own game
computer then we had the boys 11 if it
was up to him he'd be playing Minecraft
24 7 of course he knows how to mod with
Forge then we have the girl was a bit of
a tomboy she's the best soccer player on
her all boys soccer team and she
recently turned nine and she asked for a
drum for her birthday but we're quite
normal so how do we get started how did
I get started well you need a kitchen
and you could have to buy a whiteboard
so when I bought it my kids are actually
so excited so we have a whiteboard we
can draw castles and everything then I
had to wipe that all out and say now
that's Mel to that so so then I started
explaining what we're going to do and
started with post-its
so we got it around and everybody could
just write write their task out what
they think thought what was needed to do
in the house so they could beat anything
like tours your homework or long-term
projects and that is actually your
backlog so we call it a wish list so
here you see some evolution the left is
one of our first wish lists where we
used inferior yellow post-its who didn't
stick a lot of aggravation and to the
right I think we color coded it then
pipe person so every person had their
own post it colored so this is actually
just writing down what you think needs
to be done and then after that you
prioritize your backlog so agree with
each other what do we tackle first and
what comes later so if you I don't know
if you can see it but my kids even
prioritize above the whiteboard and then
there's what there was one task there is
that oh that's never going to happen
just put it on the floor so then if you
agree what you're going to tackle first
you put that into your first sprint and
somehow you track progress so it's to do
in progress done I actually had to
explain to my kids why the done column I
mean if you're done with it just check
it out and I said well no you need to
have a visual picture of what you're
accomplishing each time and actually
they got the hang of oats it's really
satisfying putting something from in
progress to done so then later on we
also throw in some Kanban so we actually
color-coded our types of work so like
green is for school and
the yellow is actually when you have to
go out and buy something you put into
the avatars and we had another
whiteboard so that's just the daily
progress and we need to limit your work
in progress for day because you actually
can only do one thing at a time even
other people think you might not one of
the most important things is the
retrospective so we call it family
meetings where you actually sit down and
evaluate how it went anything goes you
can just put in topics and discuss what
needs to be changed and everybody can be
commented on so use the vocabulary well
just two examples of what we tackled so
one is about screen time so we needed to
discuss do something else please you're
you're on that screen all the time it
was really getting annoying people just
cut being call that not reacting so we
had an open discussion of it and they
even came with their own suggestions and
so I'm just rushing here so if you
notice so this is what we came up with
so we actually have a screen free
wednesday now you're not allowed even
the parents are not allowed to go on to
their phones and we visualized it by
putting up a screen so second example is
about using curse words which became
sort of normal because I don't know in
Holland on television everybody's just
cursing all the time and I thought we
need to do something about it so same
thing happened here we had an open
discussion what do you suggest we do
about it and we came up with a solution
so it's 50 cents for curse word now and
once you get all the savings up we do
something nice and also the parents if
they curse fifty cents so we have a
thing called the Moka pot
grumpy jar and it's sitting there and
living room it's just to visualize that
you you shouldn't curse no I don't want
them to be goody two-shoes I just need
them to know that if you're doing
something wrong you need to follow the
consequences so even if I say a bad word
I have to put fifty cents in so I didn't
really come up with this it's Bruce
Feiler who inspired me you wrote a book
about it and he has a thing called the
agile manifesto so it can read about it
if you want I have some tips and tops
it's especially just listen to your kids
have fun with it and make them part of
the change process some further reading
about it so the book first layer has an
awesome TED talk which is really
inspiring so please look it up then
there are a lot of people doing this
they blog about a lot there's even an
agile school blogger so he actually
applies this to schools which i think is
a really good thing because with the
21st century skills of people kids need
to learn these days I think this is a
good enhancement for it so I want to
leave you with a couple of more things
so please stop yelling start listening
start changing have lots of fun
experimenting with this yeah I don't be
the agile family thank you very much
are there any questions yeah um just
actually facilitating at all I'm not
dictating anything I hope but yeah
really facilitating because yes if the
kids of course have no idea what you're
talking about you just need to help them
and get it get the post its in-house and
start writing give examples and then
they start writing am i part of the
problem I'm part of the solution I don't
have an answer for everything now and
then I understand that it's fine yeah
yeah so what Bruce Feiler actually did
was have like checklists so if if people
are responsible for doing dishes or
cleaning the table just see what you
have to do every day and you can check
them off and yeah if someone forgets
well have you check your list and they
go to the kitchen oh yeah I need to
clean the table okay I'm I'm not really
fond of checklist oh I don't know I
think maybe in the beginning you need to
use them to get them but we don't have
checklists in the house actually I think
you can start young I think of course if
they want to write their own post-its
they need to write and read but I think
you can get engaged in many ways yeah
yeah
do you want me in it ok I have 30
seconds for questioning that's question
yeah
and you're afraid that there's too many
things on there that I don't know should
know what ok yeah so I don't really have
that problem yeah you could think about
hanging it somewhere else than in the
kitchen so maybe upstairs where not many
people come something like that yeah ok
thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
