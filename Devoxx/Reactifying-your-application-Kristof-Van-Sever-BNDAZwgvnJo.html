presentation on rectifying your
application now I do see a couple of
familiar faces in the room but for those
who don't know me let me start off by
introducing myself my name is kissed
offensive I work as an IT consultant for
a company called travels and I'm also
Springs certified instructor I mostly
teach the spring core and spring
enterprise courses among other ones now
Pharos is an idee consultancy company
from Devon city close to Brussels here
in Belgium we're mostly focused on Java
technology and spinning every system in
quite a bit of different sectors like
the automotive industry food industry
banks insurances etc and at Ferris we
think that keeping up to date with
latest trends like technologies really
is essential to better ourselves
and to be able to help clients with
better solutions now we do these true
trainings internal trainings external
trainings also internal workshops also
workshops for example for university
colleges etc and from that also grew a
reactive competence centre where we look
well we experiment with reactive the
technologies we build proof of concepts
etc now what can you expect from this
quickie well I'm going to highlight to
try and highlight at least the most
important bits to know about reactive
programming reactive systems and also
trying to fill in some missing pieces
that some other talks seem to skip or
seem to you know not get deep into
enough now this mostly comes from
practical experience from the proof of
concepts from actually you know using
the codes I'm not here to sell something
but I'm here to try and explain how it
can help for regular programmer if you
have any questions or you think I'm a
cool guy anyone have to be here after
you can just ask me after now before I
start talking about reactive programming
or active systems I want to talk about
something called cargo cults now a cargo
cult is actually a concept from Peter
for a second
world war it was coined by sociologists
back then and it describes a phenomenon
seen around the Pacific area basically
the Japanese and American armies were
fighting there and during the war they
would make runways for their planes to
land and the native people there the
indigenous people around the Pacific
would see the soldiers building them
would see them you know signaling for
the airplanes to land and they would see
actually airplanes landing
so they started assuming that if they
also build runways like that and also
start signaling then the airplanes which
would bring cargo like food medicine
medication weapons etc which magically
appear now that's also something we tend
to see in the i.t we go to conferences
and you know see interesting
technologies but we don't always apply
them in this in the right sense because
we're not use well we're big setup
reason why and the action itself now the
same goes with all the technologies
we're used to doing things in a certain
way
but that might not be the idea well
ideal ideal way at least yeah an example
of you know being able to think outside
of the box is actually directive
manifesto or active systems directive
manifesto actually doesn't contain new
ideas those are ideas that come from
small talk programming language from way
way in the past and it describes
building applications that are
distributed and consists out of you know
different parts that communicate with
each other in an event driven away the
gold for the goal is actually to create
a responsive application an application
that is resilient and elastic is able to
continuously deliver business value to
users and it does this by being message
driven and hold this whole concept is
being called
being responsive now an example of a
framework in order to do this is vertex
it's a tool kit to build reactive
applications on the JVM that's how it
solves itself and you can actually use
it to build event-driven micro services
that can communicate with each other
through for example in event bus using a
hazel cost or through other ways it's
actually very interesting framework to
take a look at another one is akka
actors akka actors is a huge topic that
only solve deserts
different-different talks on itself so
it's a bit limited this talk the quickie
but it's very comparable to how small
talk works its uses actors that
communicate with each other through
messaging and also enables you to build
a huge message driven system it off also
offers supervision and monitoring
through an external runtime so yeah it
really helps you build a system that
self-healing and skills really well now
from reactive rating systems at least
reactive programming where we try to
also supply a better programming model
to help build reckless systems we're
going to try use resources in more
performant way we do this by creating a
synchronous boundaries in our
application so instead of you know just
calling the database waiting for the
result and then giving a result of the
user we're going to ask the database for
information and then subscribe ourselves
to the result and work in a declarative
way now an example of this can be seen
in protect reactor project director is
sust spring 5 to enable reactive
programming and for example here we see
that we have a big repository where
we're going to get a list of takes
really simple and we can see that it's
actually being run in a declarative way
and you can really imagine the big
objects running through the different
parts one by one in a synchronous way so
the program doesn't block now the first
big tip is to not overreact like a set
in the car goggle bit it's very exciting
fun new technology but it certainly has
its limitations right now but if you
believe that your project is suitable
for it then go ahead and be sure to use
it and maybe go physical but when it
comes to / when it comes to reactive
programming at least it's important that
you have to make sure that your whole
team is ready because you're really
making a complete paradigm shift you're
programming in different way you're
architecture in a different way but you
also have to make sure that your
application server and your database
server is ready for it there are a
couple of experimental for example my
squirrel drivers I believe to support
reactive programming but most of the
support right now is in NoSQL databases
like Cassandra like MongoDB etc now when
it comes to reactive programming it's
also important to really change your
mindset when you make a program you're
used to you know you after the
application server which calls the
database server it waits for information
and then it gets a whole set in one go
this doesn't really count anymore
because when you really want to enjoy
the full benefits of having a reactive
application you're basically waiting for
the events that come back from the
database consisting out of the
information that you would normally
retrieve in one go so you get them one
by one and you really have to change
your mindset basically go from a robot
that was one thing after another to a
whole factory that produces output for
your user and the big of an advantage of
that is of course that your user gets
information right away it doesn't the
user doesn't have to wait for the whole
dataset to return from the first element
that's returned just goes through your
application server and goes all the way
to the user
that's big advantage now in order to be
able to do that of course you have to
remove the appendices to aggregations
the aggregation see would normally eat
the whole dataset for well we basically
have to make the user do them or for
example the client application for
example if you need a sum of elements
you don't need an entire set so that's
something you have to consider also like
I said before you really have to make it
pay for the entire team your analysis
need to make well they need to make your
UI for example if they design your eyes
you you're wise they have to be ready
for it they have to be able to handle
real-time application streaming in your
architects need to make reactive systems
you design them your developers also
need to be schooled in you know reactive
codes being able to program in their
active way and your system engineers or
DevOps team also needs to be able to run
the goats they need to have the
knowledge to have the right application
servers or the right databases now it's
also important to design for failure
that's really a big element of the
corrective systems of your active
manifesto you can basically do this in
several ways there are quite a bit of
libraries that enable these things for
example the Netflix stack is pretty
great when it comes to them also well
basically it's important that your for
example if you use micro servers that I
died in a graceful way that your user
still gets quite a bit of functionality
another way to see this is when you use
an offline mode when you use an
application well it's a pretty fun game
to play the one with the dinosaur but
it's usually something you don't want to
have your users see you basically want
your users to be able to deliver
business value for example you could
build an offline mode in your
application and because you have your Y
and your backends
picture time
thank you okay so basically this on your
you are interactive way as well and you
want to be able to you know consistently
deliver business value to your users now
what's also important is you don't don't
block really don't block let your users
block their this really goes on on the
bit about not trying to have aggregates
in your codes basically when you cut use
code like this you will wait until the
whole flux has run true and that's
something you don't want to happen
because you really lose all your
advantages of using reactive programming
now when it comes to testing reactive
codes well we're basically programming
in a declarative way and we're basically
decoupled from our trailing model and
really working in an asynchronous way so
it's not very easy to test it by default
but for example in project reactor we
have a stuff verifier that can help with
this example the code is seen below
where we have our big service returning
a flux with order theta and we basically
describe what we expect it to contain in
the future it can also be your one
excuse to block that's okay if you block
in that case now when it comes to
debugging it can be a bit harder as well
the biggest advice would be not to write
any bugs so you don't have to debug but
for those programmers that do make
mistakes like myself there are for
example the hooks on operator that you
can use in project director that enables
you to really get a very interesting
stack overflow
second stack dump at least results when
you actually make a mistake in your code
this debug mode should only be enabled
when you're actually trying to debug of
course because it's quite expensive to
use another way is by using composable
method references as can be seen here
where we basically try to describe our
reactive flow in a declarative way but
we decouple all of our business logic
and by doing so we basically give our
business logic its own place and we
don't have to debug through this rather
yeah untestable or on debuggable at
least reactive code now be sure to
remember the following things we're air
cargo cults really try to decide for
yourself okay this is a cool technology
or leaf uses this kind of technology in
the past but is it suitable for our
organization for the things were the
issues we're trying to solve be sure to
design for failure don't block when you
use reactive programming your reactive
code can still be tested and debug it
can be done in different way than you're
used to probably but you can still be
done of course and when you use reactive
data flows be sure to use composable
method references so thank you for your
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
