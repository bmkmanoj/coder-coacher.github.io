about mathematical concept to category
theory we're talking about collections
of objects and arrows which is that
right there that but that's correct so
it's basically what say we theory is
about is how you compose things together
without worrying too much about the
details of what you are actually
composing what is important is the type
of composition that you choose rather
than the object itself that you are
composing and that makes life a lot
easier for specific problems so it's
associative sensitivity is one of the
properties there are at the base of
category theory there are others but yes
associativity is one of the key ones and
then you have the other key property is
identity so unique no matter what type
of composition you choose you wanted to
be associative and having the identity
property so having the way of
reproducing yourself ok and this is
something imagine the cool kids in
functional programming picking up I said
how do you think functional programming
it's beginning it does look weird in
particular for people like me I mean I I
was double the developer until let's say
four years ago and at the beginning when
I started brushing this new world
it was just bonkers we honest with you
but after a while you get used to it it
becomes more and more natural and you
understand how more productive and less
prone to errors you are so it definitely
is the process that you need to go
through and I'm going to be honest it's
not going to be easy at the beginning
but it's definitely worth it because
your code will be better so that is the
way all ten of them
organizing how you write your functions
and chain them together and exactly so
um basically you will declare the type
of composition that you you want and you
will gain some expertise in choosing the
right types complete
for the right type of the problems you
have and once you pick the right type of
completion obviously the the process of
going through stacking all your
aggression together is going to be much
much easier and it's going to be a lot
easier to have a proper program that
doesn't have the huge bugs obviously
bugs will always be there but it's going
to be interview is going to be easier so
you're not going to have 900 exceptions
or exception that blow away and you
didn't consider so that makes life a lot
easier and can you give me an example of
castaway theories solving a simple
problem it's something that I'm going to
talk about my talk but it's basically
the way we reason is by trying to
decompose the problem that we have in
small problems and then compose them
together so if you think about it I need
to the list in your life like for
example when you bake a pizza you want
to get though then you want to get the
source and then you want to get the
mozzarella but what happens if any of
these three things are not there what
happens is that you cannot make a pizza
so if you express this through types
instead of have to do this check
manually and make sure that the function
that gets you the dough actually has the
dough and so on and so forth you can
just combine them together and the
composition will load if any of the
ingredients is not there the whole thing
is not there so is just a way of
analyzing your problem and composing
bits and pieces together it's not
something new we have been doing this
our all life not just with programming
it's just a different way of doing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
