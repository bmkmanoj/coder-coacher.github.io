session so this is Doctor Strange code
the most important that though is the
what stands underneath which is I
learned to stop worrying and love the
type system just as a show of hand like
how many people have seen the actual
movie dr. Strangelove good I love it I
had to remove all the actual video
reference and stuff to it and the thing
there are so some quotes in there that
come from the movie so I started really
enjoying type systems even more than I
did before after I stopped doing Java
for a living and went back to C and C++
and and all of a sudden was remembered
how much things can go wrong all the
time and that we humans do one thing
really good and it's doing mistakes so I
work at a company that's called Shopify
in Canada
we're a big ecommerce platform and we
have a feature that enables our
customers to run actual scripts ie
strings that come from the internet and
execute on our servers to power their
business maybe some of you so it's a big
the scripting language that we use is
Ruby that's what we give our customers
to to write code and maybe some of you
know about a Ruby VM that's called M
Ruby 4 which has been like a huge bug
bounty day out last year somehow around
half a million dollars because of a
couple of it exploits in there and yes
bunch of that can be blamed on C and
ultimately humans so I guess I should
start this where it all began
and that's 1997 for me when I was still
young and good-looking and though I'm
not sure about the good thinking part a
friend comes to me and tells me about
like a new language is coming out from
some company that looks somewhat like
that
I knew them for the the machines that
they were building ultrasparc more
precisely I was like oh that that must
be an awesome language and as I was that
language and he explains like how cool
it is in blah blah blah and then he
mentions something like it's being
garbage collected and I go what I'm
writing see I can match memory like what
do you mean garbage collected nobody
needs that if you can't actually memory
you probably shouldn't be writing code
but I wasn't really real you know I was
actually writing stuff that I shouldn't
mention I disassembler for Nintendo 64
for those who know that game console so
effectively a long story short I was a
punk like literally I was actually
playing music for a living that's me on
the floor there so don't take any advice
from me what would I know right I wasn't
a developer for real I wasn't being paid
40 hours a week or whatever it is that
we work to actually deliver code and add
value to the business so fast forward
probably 2001 2002 so the guide that's
biting his nail in the back on the right
on the right there that's me because I'm
nervous I'm writing code and I need to
figure out a way to do PDF generation
like really fast on demand for users and
all sudden that memory comes back from
Java hey maybe we could do this in Java
so that's probably servlet 2.3 Apache
Tomcat 3 like nobody remembers that
stuff and I was crazy enough to have him
use gni to actually use a thing that was
called PDF lib apparently still exists
too to be able to generate those PDFs
and it turns out Java was actually fast
enough for what we needed to do and it
came with no use after three problems
it came with no dangling pointer
there's no buffer overruns like a sudden
actually didn't Majan vironment i
thought wasn't all that bad and i can
able me to get the job done
and move forward and so that's when my
story I guess began with with Java and
I've been writing Java for the next I
guess 15 years or somewhat and I moved
to doing more stuff with Java so when
Tiger came out
that's Java 5 we got generics we got a
memory model that we could leverage so I
started doing more and more concurrency
stuff on the on the JVM then moved on to
a company it's called terracotta that it
used to do clots like clustered JVM
effectively clustered to Java memory
model across big clusters uh hold that
doing bytecode manipulation so I spent a
bunch of my life on the JVM but somehow
things weren't quite right
I felt that yes what Java enabled me to
do was really awesome but somehow things
not always went as well as one would
have expected still things kept on going
wrong so disclaimer none of the problems
you're gonna see coming up next would
actually happen so that's a reference to
the movie where they had to put that
before the movie started because the US
Air Force thought it was important that
whatever this movie was the big thing
would never happen in real life but what
could possibly go wrong so let's be all
honest with each other how many of you
had to deal with a no pointer exception
and say randomly the last week
I saw a couple events not going up you
probably you guys were on vacation
that's awesome
so that's what the guy that actually
came up with an old reference said about
it in 2009 I think was in you in an
interview it's it's it is interesting
that one I'm about quoting him and this
is said like he couldn't resist the
temptation to add it in because it was
just so easy to do and intimate right
but initially the goal was to make sure
that all use of references would be
absolutely safe and check that compile
time and nothing could ever go wrong
well we know how that went well so I'm
not gonna spend more time on this know
are an interesting case of things that
keep on biting us another one that
happens in Java I think is kind of sad
it's a switch case on an enum so what is
wrong with this code anyone no default
yeah I said I was done with null but it
was a lie I'm just a very bad guy so yes
indeed
like at war in our class president isn't
actually initialized so that actually
throws a null pointer exception but you
guys were right nonetheless right there
is this issue with the default like how
do I make sure that all the minim
instances for that I've actually covered
by all the possible switch cases that
exist right so let's fix the first
problem first
so let's initialize this for some reason
we had to add a new instance to this
enum because you can be at war yes you
can be at war no you can be at war with
the media apparently it happens somehow
we had to add this instance so we did we
initialize this blog up there and so now
it's coal we don't have an 0.2 anymore
that's good
but but that's what we get right so and
what should even the behavior be here
and if you at war with what the media
and somebody asks you to go to war for
real what do you do like do you throw
the wind the current one first exception
or do you actually let go then non so
important things I move on to an
important stuff
so obviously you could write a test for
that you could write a test and make
sure that that particular method does
the right thing but maybe there are
other places that you don't know about
where where this would where this new
case has to be covered heinz kibbutz who
writes the java specialist newsletter
endure it like it's the 161 something
has a way that you can actually sort of
automate this and make sure that
actually adds stuff and that there is
something that covers all the cases but
again i need to write a test for that
right that's an example we're looking at
it i feel that we should be in a place
that the compiler actually tells me that
i forgot most probably forgot something
and and that i should just do the right
thing so locks who your rights
conquering code so nothing could ever go
wrong with locks right all right so now
we have a class here we want to leverage
our president and so we want to go to
war sadly enough so what are we missing
here well let's solve everything with a
lock because when you have a currency
problem just add a lock it'll be fine in
the end
so we're gonna use a lock in this case
we're using a reentrant lock that is
mightily important to this example but
also later widest to some extent so what
we want to do is make sure that we lock
do go to war do it proper
so that only one thread goes to war and
not all of them that's good and then we
unlock right so as you guys saw the
issue is that obviously go to war can
throw an exception so again what's wrong
with this try finally you want to make
sure that you really see a lock so the
pattern is this one because if the lock
if you wouldn't know what kind of luck
it is actually lock good throw in the
case of the reentrant I don't think it
ever does
but unlock can actually throw so if you
put the try if you put the lock inside
the try be sure that you know what
finally like if you really need to
unlock the lock or not if lock through I
hope that made some sense because what
could possibly go wrong
and again that's again a case well I
think that this should the compiler
shouldn't let me do this those things so
yes again I can run like static checking
tools they will make sure that I don't
do stupid stuff but why isn't this
directly build inside the compiler or
even better inside the type system
directly so that that kind of things
can't even be expressed bonus question
if we had like a wait I should see if
we're at war or not would this code be
correct right it's not safe because
we're like you should read and write
using the same kind of happens before
relationship in this case we're not
providing any so yeah something's going
to come out but whatever so that's not
safe and again why can I do this why is
it fine that I can express something
that actually probably I never want to
express I don't know this feels Oh
this one's iterator in violation this
one is a big one certainly C++ so
anybody sees what the issue is with des
côtes on creating a list adding a
couple numbers and then I iterate over
my list I if at some point the sum of
the first elements in the in the list is
three because that's very useful logic
then I want to add another element at
the end of my list with the value for
exactly so that actually would throw a
concurrent modification exception which
actually just says that while iterating
over the thing I don't mean multiple
threads for that so while it's rating
over the collection actually I managed
to change the underlying collection that
you traitor iterates over and that blows
up again why am I even allowed to do
this why why contacts like these are all
things I think we're in Java it's easy
enough to shoot yourself in the foot
like how many people had the concurrent
modification exception here right and
and when you the last time you had it I
guess most of you knew what you had done
wrong right but you still every night
would we're just humans another quote
from dr. Strangelove but instead of the
dooms machine we're talking about the
compiler I want something that's
automated that just knows what the right
thing is to do at all times and if I do
things wrong it lets me know and fix
stuff and since when - quoting stuff I
think that we as developers need to find
out a tools to manage to express the
right things and prove that our programs
do do the right stuff completely and and
that needs to happen like as we program
one thing that I struggle with a lot and
maybe
just because I'm hold but when I need to
come back to code because say psych
faulted and it's really hard for me to
put myself back into whatever the mind
said I was in when I wrote that code and
that context switching is is just
annoying certainly to me so if I could
get rid of this I feel like I would be
way more productive well it does feel
that getting to this is a task that
could easily be accomplished by a
computer you need to say that with a
very heart German accent so let's look
at an alternative language so plan a
plan R is not for Robert but for rust so
rust is a programming language that
started in 2010 actually started even
before that that really started thing
appeared around 2010 1.0 got released in
May 2015
it's actually backed by Mozilla that's
what they used to build their a new
browser servo or just back into that so
let's look into what what the code that
we looked at right now what it looks
like now so be warned this is evangelism
big time I want you to rewrite
everything in rust certainly if it's
written in C everything has bugs in it
so rust rust is a strong static type
language it supports the thing called
ownership and lifetimes are built inside
the type system itself I'm not gonna
dwell into lifetime in this presentation
we're going and look at ownership and
the kind of problems that solve in order
to so on I should properly though you
need the lifetimes it generally falls to
immutable so when you do stuff you just
you need to be explicit when you want a
value to be immutable it does a whole
lot of type inference this type
inference I find that times this both
arson the
because who has ever complained about
generate signatures becoming just way
too horrible in Java right so Russ
actually if you want to be explicit
could probably beat it at it but you
don't need to do it interestingly this
comes for the downside that sometimes
it's if you like thinking types it's
really hard for you to know really what
is what so you can always be explicit if
you want to like JetBrains now
officially supports like a rust plugin
for all their tools so you can use it
IntelliJ you can use a sea lion which
then also lets you debug the code which
is kind of nice that actually has this
nice feature we can actually show you
the type somatically you know like all
their intentions when you want to make
it explicit or just know what it is so
that's that's really useful uses straits
so kind of your interfaces and it comes
with a very big ecosystem it of bunch of
things the most important one is
probably cargo that is to build system
it's rusts maven if you want does all
the dependency management for you so
that you can pull in libraries as as
need be the one issue with it though
well it's not cargo itself it's more
like knowing what libraries use
Knightley's versus the stable releases
of rust so Knightley's are the ones that
are released nightly where the platform
and language the core team effectively
like does experiments now if it makes it
stable it's going to be stable forever
but I like these things change so what's
this ownership thing so ownership is a
way for you to know like really who owns
a binding he reference to something so
let's say I have an instance of this
bottle and I own it right I created it I
own it I can actually give it to someone
and then it's yours and it's yours to
keep I just transferred the ownership is
a bottle to you
I can also lend it to you and I can do
that in two ways either the immutable
one and I can actually like lend it to a
bunch of people but they can only look
at how full the bottle is like a color
and I look at properties like but not
mutate it if I didn't lend it to anyone
I can then lend it to a single person
because obviously the two exclusive in a
mutable way so that say I lent you the
bottle you can drink out of it you can
write stuff on it if you feel like it
and eventually it'll get back to me the
important that there is again the
lifecycle because it sometimes nobody
owns the bottle anymore and in rust like
it's totally predictable when the bottle
will be destroyed and that's for
instance one way that in rust like the
concurrent modification problem that we
saw right before is actually not not
expressible you cannot write the code
that will that would that would throw a
concurrent modification exception or
worse in C++ if you would add something
right possibly the container like the
array that contains like all your
element could be moved to some other
place in memory and then but you're it's
right already pointed to god-knows-where
and welcome to the jungle
all right let's relook at what what our
code would look like if we would be
writing or president in rust so I have
the same Ingham up there I have my
public so by default it's all private to
my module and I have the pubs drug
president that says oh it's a struck
president has this one field so that's
where like the initialization problem
goes away is so I don't need like in
Kaplan you don't need to specify new
because actually this will be allocated
on the stack not on the heap so you
don't write anything you just create a
new instance of this president you see
the type inference right let president
don't need to specify that it's the
president's written right after the
equal and I have to initialize all the
field there is no way for me to not
initialize a member of a struct like I
need to provide values for everything so
looking at our president I am now
implementing those two same methods that
you saw before so here are methods so
the FN thing stands for function is at
war that returns a boolean and go to war
that returns a result of void but
possibly in there an error because you
Russ doesn't have any exceptions so
let's look at the first method so the
important bit is the AMPA sense which
says it takes a reference to self since
we're implementing president right up
there it expects an instance of
President to be passed in method to the
function it's effectively the same way
that it works in C++ it's the only here
in at the method definition its explicit
when on the call site I'd I can just
write president dot is at war I don't
need to call a function in path instance
in that's the way it's declared the
important bit is as I said before by
default everything is immutable so in
the case of the first method it just
takes a reference to self to president
in the case of a second method
we're actually need to pass a mute
immutable reference to self because as
you see on the self dot at war equals
yes when mutating the instance an
interesting bit is this has to be
specified on both ends ie both on the
end that actually like consumes on the
call end as well as on the call side so
that it's always pretty clear well I
guess I have examples of that right
after
so rust added some sugar on top of
things
the one difference that you see between
the two methods there like the one above
the that line doesn't miss a semicolon
at the end if that semicolon isn't there
it's actually the return value that I'm
specifying which is effectively the same
as say returned blah blah blah and then
semicolon which is the return okay that
you see underneath so how do I see if
going at war worked out or not so that's
you do that by doing pattern matching
that's the that's what we do for the go
to war so let's see what the value is
for at war if we're not at war we can
just go to war and if yes we are at war
we just return the error and that's
where my compiler kicks in and actually
tells me that the code and I'm
expressing doesn't work because like it
tells well the case were worth war with
the media like that would ever happen
isn't covered these are the kind of
errors you get most of the time now with
the russ compiler they try to be very
explicit about what the error is and
what you need to do sometimes there is
actually an end that tells you you
probably forgot mute here that's
probably what you meant because that was
like a big complain in the early days
where like the compiler errors nobody
really understood so nobody knew what to
do about them so how would I fix this so
here I just decided that that if you're
at war with the media thing you should
first settle that and then then you'll
try to go to war with somebody important
maybe it's not a wise decision I don't
know so I just added this case here with
an or and move on but so any call site
that would actually would have had
pattern matching against all those
instance of meinem like what everything
colored by the compiler so that's how
you would invoke that go to war method
so I just it's the same
line and sensation line as before and
then prison go to war and that doesn't
compile because the go to war method
tsuki took a mutable reference to
president which is not what we declared
online for so it's actually telling me
you consider changing this to mute
president saying that I want a mutable
instance of that so defaults to
immutable noise so just doing that and
we good to go we can go to over that's
awesome I say there's bug in the slides
well let's do it with that markdown for
the win
okay so we're going back if we wanted to
right now the same code as we did before
but like threat safe the way that you
express that in so let me see where
things went wrong I guess these are
supposed to be two slides so we just add
a mutex in this case I created new mutex
that's a static function you on mutex
which I didn't do for the president is
considered the same constructor and I
pass in the president this is called
interior Butte ability because
effectively what I do is I transfer the
ownership of my President to the mutex
so that if I if I would write the code
that you see under this title president
mutex pass transfer the ownership of the
President to my mutex and then tried to
go to war directly with the president
this will tell me this that I didn't
move the value of president there and
I'm trying to use it afterwards and I
can't do this which avoids the kind
problems that we saw before that you
know it's the Oh what was the annotation
again guarded by to just say like what
is guarded in this case it's not like
DES intention or whatever right the type
system just makes sure you transfer the
ownership of whatever it is you're
trying
to protect in this case for this mutex
it could have been a readwrite lock like
that a bunch of other primitives but I
just went for the simple one it doesn't
work and the way that I would then do
this is I would call lock on musics RIT
which returns AP and this is where it's
really nice to have type inference
because actually what's being returned
is this so it's a result where in the
case where everything went fine I have a
mutex guard that guards the president
and in case things went wrong I have a
Poisson error that actually contains the
mutex guard for that president
nonetheless that I can get back to my
resource but what it's trying to tell me
is that this lock was poisoned I'll get
back to that what poison means in a
second so if I would to use that P I
just put that in the scope there for a
second
so that's resource acquisition is
initialization that maybe some of you
know from C++ so this this guard I can
explicitly get to the guard I calling
unwrap let's say I know there is
something inside that lock right I get
to it and and then on that guard I call
code so the unwrap like returns me the
guard and the president I can go to R
but the trick the first trick is
releasing the lock so when the guard
goes out of scope at the end of this
curly brace here it automatically
unlocks lock so I cannot forget to
unlock the lock the one thing that can
go wrong is actually this so if I go to
war actually I wrote that wrong no no I
wrote that right sorry if I go to war
and I read I call unwrap on the result
of that method before I didn't check
whether I managed to go to war properly
or not if I call unwrap here what's
gonna happen
it's got that's gonna panic
because what I returned is a failure
from my go to our method because I
already was at war with the media I
couldn't go to war with some random
country so that will panic and as such
the mutex will be marked as poisoned
because things went wrong while holding
the lock that protects the resource so
that's concurrency quickly in rust so it
comes with other stuff well I guess the
important stuff is to remember that the
data belongs to a single owner you push
that in your readwrite lock whatever you
can have multiple root readers that's
fine single writer nonetheless so there
it there there are other types that you
can compose where this is for the
signatures if you're being really
explicit are going to become like
explicit so you have arc which are
automatically reference counted which
helps to know when to get rid of the
resource that somebody protects in case
you've sharing get across multiple
threads you have the beauty that you
just saw and then there is this thing
like the straight it's called send that
defines how you can transfer on the ship
of things from let's say one thread to
another so one other thing I can show
quickly I think is a little bit of
assembly code there are other kind of
nice stuff that that Russ does which is
for instance this method so we're on God
bold of the orc if you don't know that
website I think you should bookmark it
it doesn't support Java though that's
sad so but it supports go rust the C++
obviously and a bunch of compilers for
all of those so what's wrong with this
code
yes it overflows so if I compile this
actually you will see so you can look at
the color stuff so the yellow matches
the NAM times num matches matches the
yellow on the so line four to nine and
the interesting bit is actually that it
so line six to set Oh al actually checks
if the flag that we all float doing the
multiplication on line five was set
which many we overflow if we did it's
actually going to jump to what work is
the panic method on the call anyways you
get the attempt to multiply with
overflow thing the interesting bit is
this one is that's that's the default
behavior of the compiler which the
default the compiler is I to the debug
mode if I were to actually ask it to
compile stuff sorry in optimized mode we
get rid of that like nobody checks
nothing anymore so you can run your
tests and verify that at least that
doesn't happen if you need to deal with
it but but if you optimize stuff like
that check goes away it's all LLVM based
and some people on create were crazy
enough to try to pour it all the
intermediate representation of that LLVM
code to crawl and so long just as an
exercise we got two things working so
it's interesting who knows that maybe we
get rust on the anger soon enough what
the world we live in
all right
moving on and so discovering rust
actually to me was kind of an eye-opener
that there are actually ways to get to
better safety and that was interesting
and then I got more interest in all that
stuff and turns out there's a bunch of
very interesting efforts going on that
are let's say none neglect able I'm
going to talk a bit about another
language and that's Pony I don't have
that much experience with Pony to be
honest but like the things that they
tried to do and the stuff that I played
way to have fun pretty awesome and they
have goals apparently for supporting
this really did actor model in a very
safe way that looks very very promising
that's on their roadmap so if they ever
get there it looks like it be solving a
problem that I've been fighting way too
much in my life because having Titan
mismatch in big clusters is just a
nightmare
so Pony again type safe object-oriented
as in act immobilizer way of doing
anything so concurrency obviously but if
you would want to do like a single thing
there would be one actor in doing it
it's memory safe sorry yeah exception
safe I let's be sure that there is no
runtime section thrown ever and
everything is handled properly and tells
us about it at compile time
no date erases no deadlocks no dead logs
because there are no locks so when there
are none locks it's hard to deadlock and
and but nonetheless make sure that you
get the proper visibility one big
difference is that it's actually a
garbage-collected
language or runtime there has been a
presentation at splash two or three
weeks ago in Vancouver if it comes
online or I think the paper should come
out about the our courage
yeah I guess I would recommend mom made
like nerds I have a look at it but it
looks like there are two interesting
stuff one important bit is that they
have a mathematical proof for everything
that he put in the language so until
those proofs are correct everything they
pretend is also true and that's pretty
awesome so the way that they actually
match to deliver on those promises is
capabilities and capabilities come in
two ways or object capabilities and
reference capabilities show quickly a
couple of reference capabilities so
object capabilities are the way for you
to allow things to be done with your
objects while reference capabilities are
ways for you to specify things not to be
done with the references I eat them
those memory locations like for instance
here's a thing you come right to it you
can't read - it seems kind of weird but
it's actually supporting it and so
here's an example of this Iza would sort
of be like the equivalent in Russ make
sure there's only there's no alias to
the same thing so here I'm trying to
create an alyas from A to B on the
second line there that is something that
I cannot do because the ISO stands for
eyes'll isolated as well I guess
isolated or isolation and so it's a
reference but that cannot be aliased so
tag is actually that's what I just said
so in this case I'm creating annales be
that it's tag
I cannot read and I cannot write from
that B but I can store it and I can for
instance use it for comparison so that
can be useful but I cannot use whatever
is that that memory reference one thing
you can do is consume the equivalent of
transferring well the equivalent kind of
what we saw with transferring and rust
in this case like the first line that's
allowed
because the same line is so the same
function line so first one says consume
a into B which means that a now is
invalid anymore I cannot use a so this
line that was previously invalid with
adding to consume is now fine but then
the C which is a tag reference to a
that's not valid anymore because a isn't
valid anymore
another thing that's interesting in and
kind of confusing at first is the way
that rust a sorry that Tony does
exceptions so exception is like if you
would only ever throw like a single
static thing so in case that isn't clear
that's kind of what this matches to so
this code it's it's not the way you
would write this code not in Java on on
ponies just to illustrate the control
flow so you have your try that does
exactly what you think air is this throw
else has catch and then does tickle into
finally in Java but if you look at this
there is one thing that really sticks
out is that you just error you you don't
throw anything and you just else you
just catch you don't catch anything it
just is the exceptional path there it
darn it darn types that instances of
types that you can it's like if in C++
you would decide to throw and I know
like one all the time and catch that all
right so I think that it's like this
quote somewhat resonates with me a lot I
find that we need to take way more away
from us making sure that we actually
write correct code and that the kampala
can take care of this and that we should
focus on whatever it is that we're
actually trying to solve as a problem by
writing this code I think anything that
helps us getting there is is good for
I'd like to hope everyone that means
certainly probably your employer's but
most probably also the consumers of
whatever it is that we deliver
to people so that's good from the humble
programmer that was written in 1972 and
one thing that I would like to see my
goal is effectively even lead this right
if it can pass just ship it if you wrote
the code that that sorry the code and
the test that prove that whatever it is
that you actually need to do the test
should only test like the logic the
business whatever think that it is that
you do and if it does compile that you
can be sure that this code is bug free
and can be shipped I know there is
another session hopefully in the future
I didn't check but elm actually it's
kind of the same approach right trying
to make sure that whatever it is that
you build actually will not throw any
runtime exceptions in production later
down the path and I think that's very
important for a couple of reasons
so here comes the one self speech for me
so I work as I said a child if I we
actually the mission statement is to
make commerce better for everyone
it's a company it was founded in Canada
in 2006 currently of merchants and over
170 countries in the world two thousand
plus employees two thousand plus apps
that people can use half a million
merchants using our stuff but the
important thing isn't that is the way
that why this important because it gets
my salary paid so it is actually
important don't quote me on this the
important thing is that we actually
really is probably around 40 to 60 times
a day during a working day stuff go
changes all the time and I think we need
to find we need to put things in place
so that we can have that like it we
invested a whole lot of time in this
infrastructure so that this could happen
that people can be confident enough to
ship coded like at a very high pace I
think that's important whatever it takes
to get there I think makes our life
better and I think that type systems is
one way of achieving that funnily enough
we are actually an entirely ruby shop
so no types there or at least not shake
statically but we managed nonetheless so
if you think that could be interesting I
think we should chat because we're
hiring and you were all smart people and
so we're hiring smart people so we
already have one match but that's it
thank you
try to stay safe if there are any
questions I'd love to take them there
are six minutes left any questions okay
I guess that's no questions thanks a lot
what if there are further questions
later just grab me and we can talk and
if you look for a job talk to me - thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
