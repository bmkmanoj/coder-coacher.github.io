can find their way down here to this
morning I hope you had a pleasant
Thursday at least I had on the speakers
dinner yesterday
my name is over Lindstrom I'm going to
talk about crash coaching how to do
agile coaching in a dangerous feedback
so I'm taking a little journey to this
morning I'm 44 years old
I have two lovely daughters more than I
deserve actually and I'm a long time gel
evangelist and I'm a speed junkie a
total speed junkie if it goes fast I
would love it this is me or well love me
it's the picture that was taken when I
started I was getting more access card
and as a boy and this is also me a
little bit more protected a little bit
more lean and well I will come back to
this images in a short while but I will
have a quick words from my sponsors how
many of you have actually heard about a
cell blowing yeah one well I work for as
a boy I work out of comm but we're a
global company we have an office here in
Krakow for example we say that our
business is the total door opening
solution we want to seamlessly connect
the outside with the inside I don't know
if you have noticed but we are actually
the first thing that greets you when you
come to this lovely eyes conference
center because the rolling doors at the
entrance that our doors so if you look
around this building I actually went
around and took some pictures and I
could find doors I can find emergency
exits so we are
everywhere wherever we want to go in or
out we are present so we are the global
leader in door opening solutions
that's our pitch line we have operations
from over Rome is about 70 countries we
are 47 thousand employees so kind of a
small company we do seven and a half
billion euros per year in revenue
okay right we do have a development of
this hearing crock of also and we are
hiring so if you want to have a really
cool job working with mobile access mo
working with the access solution I of
IOT really cool stuff in a secure
environment
well then head to our our corporate
website and see if you can now let's go
back to the main program and for it I
actually interchange role that's what my
corporate role so now let's get into the
the fun part I was supposed to show you
a video here but the squeeze doesn't
really love me so we'll skip that I'm
going to take you on a journey to my on
my summer what I do during the summers
in stock in Sweden I'm a member of the
Swedish Motorcycle Association hard work
say in the morning SMC we are
approximately 75,000 members we have 21
local districts we are a pub now 400
local members and motorcycle clubs and
no health angels is not one of those I'm
I'm not really going to talk about this
part because that's the administrative
part I want to talk about the fun part
the SMC school where we do education and
this is one of the things that we do on
the yearly basis we have above
approximately 70 advanced courses that
we do on race track
and we also have about 200 basic
education that we do on parking lots on
go-kart tracks gravel patches wherever
you can ride a motorcycle basically we
are we are there to do this we have over
800 volunteers doing over 15,000
educational days per year that's a lot
and actually motorcyclists are the one
traffic group in the world that does
most driver education after they have
taken the license not even the well if
you are doing it professionally you will
do it as often as the motorcycles do and
that's what I'm going to talk you to
about you remember these two pictures I
promised I would get back to them you
might be surprised that I'm actually
doing the same thing in both pictures
both when I'm in the office and when I'm
on the racetrack and that is what I'm
going to talk about today this is what
the whole talk is about so I'm going to
take you through the journey of a day
I'm going to talk about the challenges I
have of taking a participant on my
course safely through the days and then
I will draw an analogy and show you the
similarities that we have when we do
software development on developing
systems so driving a motorcycle fast and
doing agile development has a lot of
common things first thing is that in
anything we do we take a calculated risk
when I do a push to get I know that
might break the bill somebody might get
angry at me if I go to production might
introduce a bug that the QA isn't set
they didn't fetch but okay fine with me
as long as nobody dies right when you're
on a racetrack
bug can be slightly more dangerous and
have slightly more consequences and the
trust me quite a bit more physical now
that's not me that's Dani Pedrosa the
MotoGP rider yeah he's hiding
don't get into technicalities so you can
brake a little bit more than the build
on a motorcycle however what we do to
protect ourselves on a racetrack and on
the development side is sort of the same
before we go further I actually want to
ask you one question what makes a day
awesome coffee that's one thing Vica
famous coffee good progress there's a
lot of things that makes they awesome
this is what make my day awesome good
attitude
what I feel yeah it could great nice
behaviors we are nice to each other
the bosses are observant stuff like that
a safe environment where I can feel safe
reckon increase my skills going to
conferences perfect we can elaborate on
next best practices use best practices
and maybe even improve them
so let's first start with looking at the
challenges I have as a motorcycle
instructor first challenge is that when
I come through racetrack I don't know my
stakeholders the participants they are
totally unknown for me most part some of
them I actually started recognizing that
and I do have eight participants per day
up to eight participants but I sometimes
even more the worst group I have over
sixteen alone second biggest challenge I
have is I I don't have any idea where
they come from and I don't have any idea
where they want to go it's an unknown
journey third is that on the normal day
on a race track I can have up to two to
ten different groups on the same race
track at the same time doing other sort
of development and the final challenge
is that I also have it a team that's
only just keeping an eye on us those are
the people that manage the the pit lane
I exit on the track the flag post
ambulance crew yes we do have an
ambulance crew an ambulance on track
whatever we do this we need to have
people that doing the food and as you
mentioned a lot of coffee there's a lot
of coffee going on of a race day does
this sound like a project that you want
to be part of or is it a project that
you are part of yeah it's pretty much
the developers day right so how do we
solve this how do we solve this puzzle
well we are using agile principles we're
using them in our planning we're looking
a lot of the lean principles trying to
cut away the waste doing it as flawless
as possible we don't really want to push
anything on to the participant that
doesn't add value they are paying quite
big money you know to get a day at the
racetrack so what
get'em we are doing self-organizing team
stuff like that just a question for how
long have you all been driving a
motorcycle 20 years and the rest of you
you also drive oh okay then let's
actually start about going through a day
at a racetrack if you haven't seen that
movie do it the first thing that happens
when we come to racetrack we come a
couple of hours earlier than the
participants is that we gather all the
instructors all the crew around our
training leader that's the one that is
the final responsibility for everything
that happens during the day and he's
outlining the day this is what we're
going to do this is where to find
everything this is where to find food
rings the toilets everything that
happens around the racetrack he also
tells us who is the master instructors
for each group I come back to the
group's a little bit later the track
responsible or the race control as we
call them he forms us how to enter and
exit a track where we will have man
pickets flag posts and if there is
anything we need to know about the track
that has safety issues if they are using
an alternative path or stuff like that
we have a long list that we go through
so I won't go through all the things
that we do but we do this every day
quite often we have education that span
over multiple days but regardless of
that we do this every morning go through
the checklist it might have changed it
might be somebody that is new to this
particular track to this particular race
training leader
so it might be it might be a new master
instructor that wasn't there yesterday
what we then do is we look at the who is
going to be there today and the master
instructors in conjunction with us with
us actually then go and say here I will
work with those groups you will take
that group oh your bike is not really
feeling well today so you can take a
slower group stuff like that
so in that case we are self organized
and what we then do is we do security
check on the bikes on the instructors
bikes anything that needs to go out on
the track must have gone through
scrutiny otherwise you're not allowed on
to try because that's a safety you want
to have a bike that has no brakes now we
want to have a bike that leaks oil I
don't think so
safety is always number one and then the
participants arrive and they sign in and
we divine didn't to the degree groups
according to the preferred speed they
want to do and which educational step
they are going to participate in we have
four different steps starting from
basics to really advanced stuff and
normally we run three or four different
speed groups on the track at the same
time but not at the same time actually
but we have three or four speed groups
I'm going to talk about the speed groups
a little bit more later and then we tell
you have the drivers meeting which
basically is where the training leader
tells everybody again what to do how to
do with the same checklist more or less
and it presents the mastering for
instructors for the different speed
groups and what we do then we take the
different speed groups and we gather all
of them together regardless of which
educational step they are going through
and we have done that when I've gathered
everybody we go through the flag signals
again we go through the safety
procedures again
and then we are sort of letting the the
group decide which rules they're gonna
have on the track are you allowed to
overtake in the corners are you allowed
to trail break are you allowed to
wheelie what are you know how to do and
they have to figure this out by
themselves
of course we are nudging them in some
sir in some directions you have to do
that but it's the teams that going to be
on the track together that makes the
rules and then we split up into the
different groups depending on which
educational step that you're going to do
and we do the same inspection that we
did on the instructors bikes on the
participant bike the scrutineering so
now everybody should know what to expect
of the day right and what happened next
is the fun part the really fun part this
is where I go into my role as smart
master architects instructor coach
whatever you want to call it and I have
two major things I do at this point the
first thing is I make sure that
everybody knows each other have a short
presentation hey my name is over I'm
drive this bike it's named Olivia I have
been ridden for 17 years
hi my name is Klaus I write this really
shiny new bike and I be riding for three
weeks that's the level that you can have
inside of a group but it's important
that everybody knows each other we
iterate over the day and we decide which
is the overall theme for the day and
this may differ a bit between the groups
because as I said I don't know where
they come from I don't know how many
educational days they have done for how
long they've been riding a person
doesn't be doing the race tracks for 20
plus years has a totally different need
than someone that has has the driver's
license for three weeks
I won't do everything that we want to
know about where to meet how to go into
the racetrack how to go out the
racetrack and then I have the
participants write their stories what do
you want to do today some may be the
same as another participant some may be
really personal sometimes I even have
the participant rank their own stories
in t-shirt sizes so you know is this a
big deal or a small deal because for one
participant this might be just a small
change but for another participant this
is a huge deal so you can have editing
from small to XXL on the same story so
this is sort of our epics so now at
least we have a backlog so what we have
done now is a sprint zero right
you recognize this seen it before this
is the toyota improvement and coaching
kata that's what I've been basing my
education my coaching on for the last
couple of years based on this I have the
petitioner right there stories where do
you want to go what is the challenge
they have what do they need to change
and then we select an experiment where
are you right now do you know where you
are that might be a problem do I know
that I don't know this and then we
conduct an experiment and then it's time
for the fun that's when we actually go
out on the racetrack and and we do we
execute this experiment and when we come
back from that we are running about 20
minutes then we do retro and we see hey
how did that go do I need to change
something but this actually what I
wanted so it's a retrospective
sort and that one that's a pace that
we're doing the whole day we have a
theory session sort of a story grooming
we have a planning we execute it when we
are on the track and actually doing the
fun part and then we do a retrospective
and of course somewhere there we need to
fit in some coffee
on a normal day I do seven eight nine of
these sprints taking sixty to eighty
minutes now we talk about short Sprint's
and on each of these we are conducting
one experiment and hopefully we're very
being a better motorcyclist at the end
of them of a sprint now we can talk
about continuous delivery a lot so this
is me doing an expert an experiment how
far on to the tank can you sit and still
drive it I can say you can actually sit
on the tank do you notice the camera I
have on the back we do monitoring a lot
really actually I'm on the racetrack
with my participants riding so I can
look at them and give them feedback
that's monitoring the application but we
also have other people around the track
the track marshals manning the pickets
giving us flag signals that also can
feedback to us and say hey that
participant is doing this so can you
please tell them to stop I all I have
another a couple of others instructors
with me on the track I'm not alone on
the track as I said they can be four or
five even six other groups on the race
track at the same time doing another
exercise and doing another educational
step but they also look at my
participants but not giving them
feedback on their X because they don't
really know what exercise to do we have
on our race track quite heavily
limitation of
how much noise we can produce so we do
monitor the sound of the motorcycles
also and if somebody's is being making
too much noise it's I don't know why
it's almost always a Ducati but yeah
might be so we have the monitoring that
also so it's a lot of looking on looking
monitoring going on that is by the way
Olivia that I mentioned but the bikes
name under 7 of Aprilia good notice this
is this is me doing pair programming
with a participant and this is an
excellent way for me to actually show
the participant how to do it how do you
want because motorcycling is is more
quite often about feeling and sometimes
I can't really see what the participant
is doing but I can feel it so I tag
along and trust me that can be a really
scary experience sometimes do we do mob
programming no we have try but you can't
really fit that many people onto a
motorcycle what we do do is actually a
stand beside the track and look at
somebody that does an exercise and then
we can talk about it so it's sort of a
mob programming feedback is everything
in our education we need to have fast
feedback on what's happening on a track
as an instructor my focus is to give
feedback to the participants
I can never teach somebody how to drive
a motorcycle it's impossible because
motorcycling is a lot about gut feeling
how does it feel I can talk about a lot
of things I can talk about how the bike
works how the suspension works why would
I do this why would I do that but in the
end
what I can do is just make sure that
somebody knows what they are not knowing
and that they can execute the exercises
that I'm trying to put onto them and
then they have to draw their own
conclusions because in the end of the
day it's about understanding what your
bike wants to tell you it's what to
understand what your brains want to tell
you it's what your gut feelings wanna
tell me so question I get really often
is how do you actually establish a safe
improvement environment on the racetrack
oh that has actually never happened but
let's ask ourselves that question
because that is the important question
here today and now I can talk a lot
about more circles I could talk about
survival reactions I could talk about a
ton of other stuff that actually happens
on the racetrack on a different day but
I will not do that because then we'll be
here to 3a and 3 p.m. in the afternoon
but all we'll talk about is slack and
80% mark when we ride we tell our
participants don't go so fast yeah I
know that you can drive faster I know
that you are now three seconds below
your best time on this track but I don't
really care take a step back and don't
go over the 80% threshold because that's
where things starting to happen really
fast that's when we go into corner and
we are saying oh holy in our
helmets we get scared and when you get
scared on a motorcycle same as you get
scared when you're doing software
development you start to make mistakes
if you're going on full speed all the
time you're breaking really light you
are getting on the gas full gas and it's
really
I hope you have tried the Vela machine
it's really cool then you have no time
to reflect and you have no time to learn
so most of my time actually goes to
pulling the participants back he cooled
down a bit it will come to that later I
tried to do this in software development
teams also I don't want them to drive
100% all the time when will they have
time to go to conferences and listen to
me they will be scared if you push them
all the time
they will have no time to time to
actually be in an environment when they
feel comfortable and that is where the
speed groups comes in if you're riding
in a group that are above your level
they're really pushing it all the way
well then it's scary because you can't
really keep the pace if you are in a
group that are doing a really slow
development or driving really slowly
that can be even more dangerous because
then you're getting bored and then you
don't pay attention so the speed groups
are an important part of what we do we
talk about 80 percent but 80 percent is
not the same for everybody my 80 percent
might be your 120 and my 80 percent if
you talk about the MotoGP driver is 10
percent so it's a lot of but we need to
have the same possibilities on the track
all themes must be treated equals but if
they have the same track time that have
the same abilities they have the same
opportunities to learn and they have the
same basic rule set and everybody on the
track applies to the same thing and they
have common rules like in the pit area
where you can't go how fast you want
even if you want to
but faster speed groups can be an
inspiration quite often I find that
participants just standing at the race
deck and looking because what you do is
you look at those who are better that's
why you're on conferences like this and
getting inspiration hey that guy is
actually riding the same bike as I do
much quicker than I do
dot there's always somebody that is
faster some of our participants have the
right to go really fast even when
they're not on a race track and trust me
I've been shaped by the Swedish police a
lot I've never been stopped and it's a
really interesting feeling to serve to
tell a police that it needs to go faster
but yeah so is the two of my
participants from a course we did a
couple of years ago let's slow down a
bit and talk a little bit about my
journey and why I'm actually doing this
as an instructor when I started riding
motorcycles about 17 years ago I was
slow really slow and over the first
three years I had no improvement or at
least I felt no improvement whatsoever I
was still going slow I still have those
now this is not fun I even started
thinking about sure I sell my bike
because this is not fun and then one
friend told me that hey you need to stop
going to two regular track days where
you just ride around and you need to
join me and and do this motorcycle
course that I'm attending as an
instructor at so let's go and have some
drivers education and stop comparing
yourself with everybody that is so much
faster than you because well
do you actually know them do you know
what I've done so I started asking them
how come that you're driving so fast
yeah well we have been riding on the
track for quite a long time and when we
started counting we realized that they
have about 15 championship medals of
national and international so yeah they
are kind of fast so what I was comparing
with was the fastest motorcyclist in
Sweden at that time and of course I felt
slow if you are always comparing to
those who are the best of the best
then and I blame the bike because it's
always the tools fault
that you're slow right you can always
buy a faster tool a better tool no but
they became my inspiration today 15
years something later I'm still not fast
enough to compete with those guys and
they're actually starting to get kind of
old now but at least now they have a
little bit more struggle to pass me and
this illustrates because I have a better
bike than they have but that's a stop
signal that's a the flag we don't want
to see because then something had
happened on the track but let's stop for
a while and just see if we can gather
our thoughts how can I have eight keys
forty developers maybe I'm in
motorcyclists on the same track at the
same time doing different development
without hurting themselves or someone
else well what is needed is of course a
set of rules an agreed set of rules we
need to have common signals like the
flags we need to have a plan of action
if anything goes wrong how do we stop on
a track how do we go forward
when does the ambulance goes out all
these things
we need to have the right support I have
talked about what happens on the track
but off-track we have those that manage
the fika coffee lunch entrance time
keeping the pickets everything we need
to have a line sprints
I don't want half of the group starting
ten minutes after me and then ending ten
minutes after me we need to go out at
the same time we need to know that that
when we are in a sprint nothing fussy
will happen I don't want to all of a
sudden meet a bus going in the other
direction how many times does that
happen in a sprint when we do software
development we have different speed
groups so that we are aligned with each
other
and then it's all about communication
communication and communication talk
with each other if I feel that hey that
wasn't really good that power thing you
did didn't make me feel good talk to
them and one thing that has been really
doing a lot for our incident statistics
is taking what we had before which
basically was this is how you want to do
it exactly and you're supposed to stand
in this spot at this time and then you
are going into that lecturing hall and
you're listening to that person doing
this theory and then you're going out
and do his what he's told you we're now
doing more self-organized
teams you set the rules it's more an
autonomy and that has brought down the
the sophistic a lot really a lot so we
have a lot less incidents than than we
did more by the rules that's what I'm
thinking that that's what you need to do
on your team is also make sure that they
have the autonomy make sure that they
have a self-organizing and self-aware
environment
there are five keys to a successful day
at a racetrack I wanted to ask my
participants I myself five questions and
the first one is do I see can we take
risks without feeling insecure or
embarrassed I need to admit that I can't
do this and I need to be able to do it
on a track in a safe environment
no buses on the raw onto the track and
the wrong direction
can we all count on each other
to do high quality work on time do I
know that my fellow participants on the
track actually respects my need of space
and don't mess up with my driving and I
have the same respect for someone else
all the goals the roles the execution
plan of our team clear do I know what I
want to do have I understood the
exercise all these things do I know the
flag is what they mean and the important
thing is are we working on somebody
something that is personally important
for each of us if I've done this
exercise a million time before I can
ride it with my left hand on the gas if
I want to that's the level I have why
would I do that exercise for the
millionth time it's nothing no I don't
want to do that let me have some fun
instead that's when I started wheelie
and the last part is do I fundamentally
believe that I'm doing this for a reason
must actually matter if I don't
understand why I'm doing this why am I'm
doing this the instructor told me to
yell out why
and about a year ago I cut across the
Google rework site if you don't know
about it go into there because there is
really really really a lot of cool stuff
there and they have the same five things
that they are their teams so if you can
answer yes on all those questions that
would have been an awesome day and I try
to have my team ask that questions the
same questions but in software
development at least at the
retrospective each sprint hey was this a
sprint where we actually did something
meaningful or did we feel safe so we are
trying to get the same effect on a race
track that Google does when they do
awesome team development and awesome
products like Gmail and Google Apps and
along so this summer it up in the last
minutes what you need to be a good race
driver
good educational a good coach and of
course also a good software developer
team is you need to have a safe
environment to be awesome if you don't
have the space to be awesome then
everything else doesn't really matter
and you also need to have this space to
make sure that you can fail in a safe
way don't crash it needs to be including
everybody must feel welcome they must
feel the place that's what it's
self-organizing comes in you need to
have commonly agreed rules what happens
if somebody crashes on the track yeah
you get the hell out of the track
because you need to get ambulance on the
track it might be hurt do you want
somebody to lay there on the track being
hurt
for some extra time because I'm going to
drive another 4 laps because I was
always almost done no same as you don't
really want to have somebody commit
stuff when somebody else has broken the
build you don't do that you have to have
common goals we do want to go this
sprint
I want to go it that way no we are
supposed to go this way but it's much
more fun to drive this track at the
other direction not so quick short
iterations fast feedback don't do a
1-hour sprint this is not an endurance
race autonomy and self-organizing I said
that that was one a key point to getting
the incidence on the track down if you
are taking care of what yours are doing
that's what you do you take
consideration of it
constant communication talk to each
other give feedback I have a lot of fine
I do use my hands a lot on the track
just to make sure that I can signal to
my participants the one I use most is
this good that I never use that one and
every other body needs the participant
or participate on their level don't try
to force them into something that they
are not ready to do if you find that hey
you can't do this right now in this way
because you're lacking a skill you're
lacking a team member that has that
skill make sure that that one comes into
it try to improve all the time constant
improvement try to be a little bit
better today than you were yesterday I'm
planning is everything plans sucks we
plan for what we want to do if something
happens but we are not planning making a
plan that it should happen at this time
and you need to have the right support
organization if you don't have a boss
that comes with fika every Wednesday
cinnamon buns and a good coffee or ice
cream or whatever get rid of that boss
they need to support you if you don't
have the right tool the right
environment if you need to do your your
development on a crappy old Dell
computer that is actually kind of good
nowadays but you really want to have a
Macintosh because that would be improved
then make sure that you get that one
that's the base of it and then there is
a lot of other things that you can
understand what I've noticed I have left
out here now is make sure that you have
some slack
those slack is important it's when you
get some slack that you actually start
going fast I had a young participant a
couple of years ago that went extremely
fast nobody know of none of the
instructors and some of them work pretty
fast had any chance of competing with
him but he had not been improving his
track times his lap times for the last
three years we said hey seriously put
your race bike aside lend this one
instead that has half the brake
horsepower that you're used to and then
you just go out and have fun on the
track and he was there for nearly three
days and then we let him out the end on
his his race bike and he was going yeah
I can't ride anymore because this goes
so slow nothing happens and when you
then look at the track time he actually
had improved his time with one and a
half second just by going slower so
slack does matter
that is actually everything I was going
to talk about today so let's have a
little feedback session does this make
sense can you actually compare
motorcycle driving and software
development or is this just a lot of
yeah yeah that's a good point
teams have survival reactions to what
happening the same way as a motorcyclist
has survival reactions to what happening
on the track or on the road they freeze
the target lock stuff like that
any questions
No then I thank you for for letting me
talk to you for 45 minutes if you want
to ask me any questions off camera I
will be here for at least until lunch so
find me I will take off this but
otherwise you will find me anyway I
feeling of that so thank you for
listening and have a pleasant day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
