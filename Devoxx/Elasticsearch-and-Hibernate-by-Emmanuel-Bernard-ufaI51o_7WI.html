sorry for being so far away from you
guys but I'm gonna have mostly cut-side
you don't want to be on this very
awkward problem so today we're going to
talk about two fairly successful project
and try and make the best-loved all of
the two by integrating them as as good
as as well as possible my name is
Emanuel Bell now I'm a part of the one
of the hibernate core guys and hibernate
being more than one project and I'm
essentially working on everything
related to data inside Reddit leader
where so you're probably family always I
grenade the object relational mapper and
that's what you call hibernate but I
actually hibernate as more than one
project behind the same banner and one
of them is hibernate search which is
essentially an object index mapper so we
we take an object or an object graph and
we create inverted index all of them and
we've got two backends one is the
routine back-end which actually go and
create the Lucene index and we actually
introduced another one which is the
elasticsearch back-end and that's what
we're going to talk about today and
we've got several sorts of changes that
we can enlist to and the main one is a
grenade Orem so I've got a tour M knows
when it has to apply an update or an
insert on a project on an object and the
way to do that is well and knowing that
it actually can send an event to library
that would want to listen to that and
hibernate search actually listen to
those events so that every change you
apply via hibernate to the database it's
also applied to the inverted index so
you've got those two systems in sync
even though out of the box they are
actually not synchronized an elastic
search is essentially a full-text search
server that is using loose in the
library but make a server out of that
service all of that and the cool thing
about it is that it speaks JSON on top
of HTTP so you can really call it from
any of the software stack you have
around okay so that being said I suppose
you know do you know how about hibernate
okay do you know about elasticsearch
okay sorry we're in the good room let's
go the rest is going to be a in action
watch you can go get the demo bye
you know getting a picture of that thing
forgot the name although what just go to
github okay so this is this is a GPA so
so what we're gonna do is start with the
legacy application that just use the the
J pql to do queries see some of the
limits and then add elasticsearch
manually and try and see how to do that
and the kind of problems we have and
then we're gonna add the actual proper
integration and C or awesome that is so
you know if you have to leave the
results that it's awesome so let's use
the integration together so that's a
simple domain know that so we've got
video game here which is an entity with
you know title description raging and
associated object publisher which has
you know name and address it's got a
collection so you can a video game as a
list of characters associated to it and
what's interesting is that the character
also a leak has links back to the video
games it they belong to so some
characters can be in more than one video
game like Mario is you know quite a
bunch of video games and then we what
simulates the application here is this
unit test that says okay I'm going to
create an entity manager factory or of
the GPA so if you're in Java EE or
spring this kind of stuff is done for
you but what's interesting is to call
the application which is okay within a
transaction what I'm going to do is
create a couple of characters and then
create a couple of video games
especially revenge of the samurai which
we're going to do a search on top of so
keep that in mind we got create those
three games and the three characters
link them together because we are within
at reduction when we commit all of the
chains are applied to the database
to go and the unit tests are essentially
just a GP QL query again done within a
traction where we say okay give me all
of the video games where the title is
exactly Revenge of the samurai so that's
easy that's what relational database are
foreign and SQL are for if you want to
search for one specific term well that's
a little bit more convoluted you need to
use the like operator and using the
wild-card are not working sorry
percentage before and after that's gonna
create either an index scan or a full
table scan right so it's not necessarily
going to be the most efficient way to
navigate information I mean at least to
get it fast the worst is that when you
try when you don't know exactly in which
order if you want to search for more
than one world and you don't know
exactly in which order to retrieve them
or if they are not capitalized things
like that right and here SQL shows its
limit so you could use the native you
know full-text technology that some of
the database offer or you could use
something like we've seen or elastic
search so we're gonna use the elastic
search I'm going to cheat a little bit
for the sake of time let's make that
bigger okay so here I've got an elastic
search node running and what I'm going
to do is check out the elastic search
version of that application what has
changed
so let's first look at the sorry the
problem which has two dependency one on
the elastic soft client and then one on
the Jackson client because elastic
search speaking reason we need to
transfer our object graph into JSON
before shipping it to our friend add
elastic search and then when we look at
how we stop the application so we start
the entity manager factory but we also
have to start the JSON binding object
and also we have to stop connect the
client elastic source client to the
elastic search server we use in this
case the transport client library that
they have and we connect to port many
three zero
and then the piece of card looks very
much like the same except that every
time we persist a videogame we say ok
let's also index that video game object
and to do that we are going to take the
Jackson map take the object converts it
into a JSON object and then pass that
information to the client and go on call
it what happens if we have an error well
we've got a choice we could say ok well
that's probably not the right choice
just bring the stock stack trace but
let's say we could propagate the
exception which means the transaction
will be rolled back ok so the database
transaction we see ok never mind I'll
never create this video game object and
the index will you know not have change
it gets a bit more complicated when you
start having a second game within the
same transaction because what's
happening here is that the first game is
pushed to the database within the
central action then an index is pushed
in the exchange is pushed and then we
create the second game and then we try
to push the second index change and then
an error happens and while we can
actually roll back the transaction from
the relational database point of view
you cannot roll back the elasticsearch
indexing operation at least not in an
atomic fashion so you would have to find
out strategy to compensate things so
anyway the logic is to say every time I
save a video game I will also go and
index the information how to do the
mapping it's pretty much you know
vanilla Jackson usage so just by default
all of the properties will be pushed to
the gzhel and I might decide to ignore
some of them in this case I'll also
index the publisher and index the
character so a video game as a list of
characters which will be part of the
JSON payload what we have to do is to
put a JSON ignore here why because when
you are going from the video game to the
character if the character has a link
back to the video game then Jackson
doesn't stop this infinite loop so you
get an infinitely big gzhel object or
you got a lot of memory exception more
likely the second right so here we
decided to cut the link at that level
the other problem you have is if it is
this one here we are just creating
objects that's fine but let's imagine
I'm changing this character a Luigi and
is changing its special power for
another one when we index the
information from the video game we
actually embed the information of Carter
in it the gzhel object is really video
game and all of the characters
associated to it so if I change one of
the character I have to go back to each
of the video games that the character
plays in and then update the video game
object so in my code on art I will have
to do that kind of manual work every
time I change the character so it's
additional work for you to do but the
good thing is then our query system is
much nicer if we look at well let's good
straight to some more complex one okay
this one so you use the elasticsearch
line and and you say okay I'm going to
query on these video game index which is
the one where we push the information
initially and I'm going to write a query
that says please find matching result on
the field title and with this text
samurai and revenge in reverse order
compared to the title but because we
have this inverted index technology we
cannot have two will actually will get
results and what elasticsearch returns
is essentially an array of jeezum
payload that to represent the results
matching the the object and the most
interesting one at the top so what you
have to do is take these just JSON
payload for each of the results and
convert them back into a video game
object which Jackson is going to do for
you and you got this area of video game
object two things though this video game
object is actually not a hibernate
manager object so if I do a change to
that video again the change will not be
propagated and the second problem is
that if I take the video game and I go
from video game to cartels and then for
a given character go to video game and
so on
I don't have the lazy Association and
the graph navigation that hibernate
provides I just have what Jesus object
hat
if I want to then go for the navigation
our party will have to go and fetch the
object by anxiety from the database and
then continue navigating okay it's
actually run to prove you that I'm not
just talking nonsense here this should
start the unit test and go and index
information into our front elasticsearch
if we look at elastic search and the
what's indexed what you have is what we
what is called a mapping that says hey
for the index video game of indexing
stuff of type you know this fully
qualified class name and I've got
several properties and they are actually
indexed using default analyzers if you
want to custom that and very quickly you
will have to cut some things if you want
to do approximation you might want to do
Angra more phonetic approximation and
that requires different analyzer maybe
you're playing with different language
and whatnot here you would have you will
have to not rely on the default settings
auto created by elastic search but you
will probably customize this cheese on
mapping essentially to add the analyzer
you actually want to use so you will
likely get this fixed
Gee's on structure and store that in
your git repository or whatever you know
so system your you're using and you will
have to keep in sync both your object
model and that structure and make them
evolve together okay so I've been
complaining about a few things so can I
do better and that's the idea of that
demo so I'm going to start from not from
scratch but I go back to the legacy
approach and I'm freaking fearing pretty
configuring things like the poem and
whatnot okay but we start from a
nonworking you know hibernate search
elastic search integration so let's look
at the pump so instead of having the
jackson and elastic cells library
dependency no we have a dependency on
hibernate search or because we integrate
between hibernate or a mandala and
hibernate search and we also have a
dependency
with the medulla hibernates
elasticsearch which actually use
elasticsearch as a back-end that's cool
how do I configure that well actually I
don't need such actually you don't
bootstrap hibernate search manually it's
actually boots from buy hibernate or M
itself so the way you put configuration
is via things like the persistence
tonics ml or you're no spring property
file and whatnot so you can see four
properties that are related to hi
million searches first of all we use
elastic search and that you seen back in
second we use we point to the to the
actual elastic search instance in this
case we'll use 9200 which is their rest
endpoint instead of the transport why do
we do that well we didn't want to be
tied to a specific version of elastic
search and the library tends to be
tightly coupled with the version of
elastic search so we wanted that
flexibility and they do recommend that
kind of approach
nowadays and they are actually walking
on a rest-based client library but it's
going to take time in other things we
have is schema management remember this
G's on payload that represents the
mapping well hibernate has the actual
class structure so it can actually
propose something very much like that
and because you can put the ad analyzer
some additional information on your
domain model itself you can actually ask
hibernate source to say please use the
analyzer foo or bar and so on so you can
actually customize a lot of the way the
integration is done and that mapping
will be pushed to elastic search for you
so you don't have to keep that jeezum
payload on the side of your product it's
just going to be generated by hibernate
search and the last point is because
I've just got one instance of elastic
search it's in yellow mode and we try to
be safe from a higher net source one on
you so we don't let you push stuff on
the yellow states unless you explicitly
explicitly say ok so in this case that
just degraded a bit the quality the next
step I have to do is to actually put
some mapping in
so by before entities are not indexed
product can ask them to be indexed and I
just start to say please you know make
this entity indexed and then I'll decide
which property exactly I want indexed so
I want to feel the title I want the
description and maybe for this one I
want a specific analyzer so define the
analyzer with its name definition in
this case let's say I'll use the English
analyzer which happens to be defined on
the elasticsearch side so this is the
binding and that's how we are going to
create the mapping that I was describing
automatically for you we do the right
type coercion so if you have a numerical
we do the right you know numeric
conversion we could deal with dates it's
not interesting here and for objects so
by default we don't include stuff in the
index which because we don't want to
pull it too much the index but if you
want a when video game is indexed if you
also want to index for example the
publisher or the list of characters you
have to add the add indexed embedded
annotation all right and all of the
sudden when you index the videogame we
also indicate the characters associated
to it and we don't have to use the add
G's on ignore thing for a couple of
reasons so first of all I haven't added
the add index a minute so by default
this association is not a minute
okay but even if I had hibernate stocks
is smart enough to say okay indexing
this video game and then there is a cart
and then the character reference back to
the object that was coming from so I'm
going to stop to avoid this infinite
loop so it actually stopped that you can
also define the specific either depth or
a specific list of paths that you want
to in that so sometimes you want the
video game and the list of characters
and then for each of those the actual
video game associated to do a query of
like friends or friends kind of thing so
you can define explicitly the path where
you where you want to go another problem
that agonizer observes is remember when
I was changing the character object in
here what I had to do is remembering
that I was updating the character object
and then updating manually all of the
videogames
well hibernate search does that
transparently for you it knows that a
character is associated to the videogame
and what you just have to do is add the
containing annotation here to just give
him a small hint so let's see how you
actually index information so no more
starting elasticsearch client normal
jackson we just have a regular entity
manager factory bootstrap no hibernate
search bootstrap it's actually embedded
here a transparently for you and within
the transaction we're creating the
object we are creating the video games
oh there is no explicit indexing here
and we do think we do things and then we
commit the traction and we close so
where's the hibernate search goal here
it's actually embedded it's done for you
because when those operation happen and
when you do the actual flush on
hibernate the list of changes creation
update or suppression of entities is
actually passed to hibernate search will
which we look and say okay that's a
video game so I need to update my index
or that's a character so let me go back
to the list of video games and then
update those video games so it does all
of that work for you and it does it in a
batch mode so you start a transaction
and it cues all of the changes that it
has to deal with and instead of applying
them right away when you do a persist it
will actually wait until the transaction
comments so if you do a transaction
rollback then this Q is just discarded
and then the index doesn't change the
database hasn't changed everybody's
happy
if you commit then we have this list of
changes that we can push to
elasticsearch and we do that we're using
their batch API to make it more
efficient and have less back and forth
between your application and the elastic
source client what am I missing here I
think I'm pretty good okay well we're
ready to do the query then what you have
to do is create of food Tex antimatter
which is just a decorator for an entity
manager so you just use this small you
know decorator builder and with the
entity manager it's going going to
provide you a queries you methods like
create full text query and things like
that the other stuff we're gonna do is
provide a query builder which we is
going to give us a type safe way an
object level way to express our queries
you can do actually two types of queries
using the this high level cry builder or
the actual native elastic search query
so I'm gonna build a query builder for
the entity video game and that last get
it and I'm a write to write the query so
let me first start with what first of
all let me use the full text entity
manager and let me first start with the
query builder which is that a higher
level and I think nicer so the way we do
it is you say create full text query and
then you can pass a query that you will
build with the query builder so you've
got a bunch of options here
range phrase spatial query more like
this which is please compare this object
to what you have and give me the one
matching but let's do what the query was
doing so I want you to acquire a on the
field title and it scans very nicely so
I can add a field description in this
case I won't do it because it will
change the results and then I want to
match samurai revenge fetching the query
giving it the what index I want to
target the one storing video game and
I'm essentially done let me do its more
super scoring here
it's something we're gonna fix but it
requires a major summer small backward
compatibility change so it's gonna be in
the next major version to fix that
smaller and safe use it should work
let's give it a run something that I
should have done is to actually do so
it's working it's all green awesome
something I should have done is create
pagination because I do not want to
retrieve all 10 you know 1 million
results and actually hibernate
elasticsearch limits the result to ten
thousand by default but they really want
you to give the you know retrieve the
first ten or first twenty or the one you
really need so in this case we just use
the GPA pagination logic and just use
Express them and by the way the object
will return our managed object so these
are hibernate objects with the lazy
associations and you can navigate you
can change the objects and the change
will be propagated by a hibernate so
you're back to the same model that you
are when you use a GP ql query another
things we can do yeah is instead of
using the cry builder here is using
native elastic search query so you just
have the small wrapper and you can
either use the query string approach or
the JSON approach which is a bit a bit
more powerful
we remember the query so let me just
copy it here so it's a query it's a
literally the same query in this case
with the exact title but it doesn't
really matter and that's gonna walk so
you really have the choice to use the
native elastic search query or work at
the higher level and the final stuff I
want to show you is that I can do
something that is called projection so
instead of retrieving the actual manager
object I can say oh only retrieve the
some of the properties so title and
maybe I want to get the score the score
is the relative result of the relative
value or quality of a result with with
another for a given query so something
that I typically do when I
play with search engine is to say okay
I'm going to display the first result
and the rest of the result up to say the
10% of the value of that score so if you
you know the twelfth result is it's like
less than 10% of the first value I feel
that it's too much too diluted and I
will stop showing them for example so
you could could do things like that you
could even retrieve the jeezum structure
it's called the source in our case I'll
do some nice diction so let me don't do
it and what you retrieve here is not a
video game object but an array of object
okay because you've got title at the
first well element zero and then squat
element one and so on
okay I think that's what I really wanted
to show you I showed you that the DSN is
much more flexible and much more
powerful it scales very well even when
the query becomes become complex so
that's that's very nice let me go back
to it so if you have to get an output of
that presentation is that there is a
super nice integration if use hibernate
ORM and you want to index stuff inside
elastic cells then go for go for the
hibernate search integration it will do
a lot of nasty and tedious work for you
and you will not miss some of the index
or deal with the air or and whatnot and
we query at the higher level which is
your objective domain model conceptually
even if of course we do the mapping and
there is a lot more stuff like the
heroin links you could say I'm going to
log all of the air out where when I'm
doing indexing or I could throw an
exception or I could send a message to
somebody and put it in a queue to retry
and whatnot there is a mass index which
is going to take all of the data from
your database and indexing it as fast as
possible to elastic search so it's a
very nice way to do the initial indexing
or even like a regular indexing if you
want to you know refresh information and
don't you know for some reason trust the
event system and whatnot faceting
geolocation lot lots of goodies and of
course because it's a regular elastic
search index you can do
native query play with the higher level
things like mana and whatnot so you got
all of the goodies from those two tools
and bring those two universes into into
one correct coherent one so yeah have a
look at the demo it's it shows you know
all of the different phases and they are
like different branches for the steps
like the legacy one the manual
integration with elasticsearch and the
actual full integration and I try to cap
to keep a try to keep a few minutes for
questions so yeah if you have any
questions just you know so question is
why would I want to choose the last six
types of early scenes so they are pros
and cons maybe you already have an
elastic search cluster on already have
centralized stuff around that so you
would prefer to push stuff into elastic
search maybe your ops team is already
familiar with it instead of having to
deal with recent thing you seen out of
the box will let you write stuff on off
say of a file system so in I've done at
search we have a way to cluster that in
a somewhat manual way but elastic search
really wants all of the way to you know
make it cluster Berlin and Scabbers that
would be an interesting model on the
other hand I would possibly if you have
like super low latency requirement one
of the cool stuff about Ella I don't at
such that you can keep a copy on the
index on each of the application layer
and you would do a local you know lookup
instead of having to go through to an
external system so that would be
potentially a bit faster and then you've
got access to the actual Lucian API
instead of the elasticsearch API so in
terms of flexibility but complexity
using API or from rational can do lots
of magic magic stuff then hibernate
search provide an object level
abstraction to it but lets you give
access to the listen API if you really
need to an elastic search is pretty
complete feature wise but of course at a
higher level than the plain
using API so that's how I would you know
make a choice what was also what yeah
so the question is if character actually
are indexed annotation on it instead of
the containing that I put so if we could
character here if I had put at indexed
here what would happen so what would
happen is well first of all you would no
longer need the contained in because we
would know about that but that's kind of
a detail what you will end up having is
an index an index character and an index
video game so you will have two
different indexes and they are useful
because you will be able to apply
queries starting from the Carter or
starting from the video game so you the
video game will still contain the
character and the character in this case
because we haven't put the embedded
indexed embedded in the video games you
will only have the character information
indexed right but you could also you
know like cross streams essentially we
do not make use of some of the quote
unquote join each thingy of
elasticsearch first of all because the
denomination we are doing is doing some
of what they are doing it's something we
will probably investigate down the road
but there is not not a very pressing
needs needs to do that and the other
question yeah
okay so the question is are we using the
LS are we targeting elasticsearch five
or elasticsearch two dots something to
look for so we the version you have here
is actually using an S six search 2.4 we
have to make a choice and they break
they did break break a lot of things in
5 so there was a we had to and frankly
we discovered quite a few bugs so we
couldn't map everything but we are
fairly close to actually other there is
a pull request with a working version of
elasticsearch 5 so we're really going to
have two different backends one for last
6 2.4 and one for 5 so I don't know if
we will hide that complexity or just let
you say 2.4 vs. 5 but yes you will be
able to target elasticsearch 5 and
elastic search search for and hopefully
and that's what they are targeting
they'll try to not break stuff as much
as they did so we will have less problem
in in the future but if you want to give
it a try this is literally pull requests
it might already be on master so it's
not in a release yet but you could
experiment and give us some feedback
about bugs and whatnot maybe one last
question ok so go git clone and give it
a try thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
