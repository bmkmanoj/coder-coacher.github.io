coming to the last session at devoxx
sorry for the delay getting started they
asked me to wait 10 minutes so so this
session is about building chat BOTS so
let's dive in so here's our quick agenda
we're going to talk about why bots we're
going to talk about slack BOTS facebook
Messenger bots and Alexa so if you're
like me I get distracted easily and so
there's always these questions that pop
up in my head while I'm doing things
like what's the weather in Boston or
what's my employee ID or what's my cost
Center or what's the status of this
flight or am I eligible for a new laptop
or what are the houses that are for sale
around me there's all of these questions
as I'm working through the day that just
pop up in my mind and what bots are
really enabling us to do is answer those
questions within the context of the
systems that were already in so we're in
the world now where we have tons and
tons of apps but most of us spend all of
our day using chat clients how many
people here use slack and are in slack
all day long
most of us yeah that's that's my life -
and then I'm in facebook Messenger all
day long as well for for personal
conversations and then like a whole
bunch of other chat channels so we're in
these chat channels and the thing that
bots are doing is allowing us to answer
those little questions that we have in
the context of those chat programs and
with natural language we can do a really
good job of having interactions with
bots in those chat channels so the idea
is to be able to answer those questions
without switching context to be able to
stay in the context that we're in but as
those little questions pop up be able to
get answers to those questions and have
inner
actions with smart bots that are behind
those services so there's been a lot of
great AI sessions here this week and I
hope you've gotten to see some of those
AI in BOTS is is really what's enabling
some really cool interactions and
interactions beyond just just the basic
type of interactions that you'll see in
my presentation so I'm not going to
focus on the AI piece today there's
there's great ways to implement AI and
and do use it for image recognition
speech recognition all sorts of other
things but I'm not going to be talking
about how we do AI and bots I want to
first give you an overview of just how
do we have a conversation with a bot how
do we how do we create architectures and
programs that allow us to do that so our
typical bot architecture is that we have
some form of messaging application and
this is slack this is Facebook Messenger
and a host of other systems going back
way back in the day to IRC BOTS for IRC
have been around for a really long time
I remember there was I hang out in an
IRC channel like 15 years ago and there
was a bot that was pretending to be a
human and so the the bot was actually
learning what humans say to each other
and how to say things to each other and
so when I first went into this IRC
channel I actually had no idea that this
bot was a bot and so this this type of
architecture the the this has been
around for a long time but now I think
where we're at with it is that it's
becoming much more mainstream so we've
got our chat channels and lots of
different options for those and the
architecture the that's pretty much
across the board for these chat channels
is that they have exposed a
bi-directional API for the chat channel
so you can build your service and that
service can use AI and it can connect to
other back-end services and then use
what's usually called formatters to
actually interact with that channel and
so it can get notifications outgoing
notification
and then can also post stuff into the
channel so that's that's our typical
architecture but for each of these
different systems there's a bot protocol
and the the kind of unfortunate place
that we're in with the bot world right
now is that every different chat channel
has a different protocol that it uses
for commute that bi-directional
communication but luckily for for pretty
much all that I know of it's HTTP and
JSON mostly JSON I think there are some
exceptions to that but machine to
machine integration over HTTP so at
least we have that in common across all
of them but then there's a whole bunch
of different ways that that the
protocols actually work so it can be
actually pretty challenging if you if
you as a company say alright I want to
build a bot that works in all these
different places you're essentially
having to rewrite large portions of that
over and over and over again because
there's there's no standard that anyone
is using for how they do this
communication but if you are in the node
GS world there are often libraries that
will help you to to build this so
because of that I'm going to be showing
the code today in JavaScript so
disclaimer the the description did say
Scala says sorry I'm going to be showing
JavaScript instead but hopefully
everyone can understand it instead of
only a handful people so so hopefully
that will be be ok ok so we've got our
bot protocols and we're going to be
taking a look at those throughout the
demonstration today I'm going to be
using a app called dream house and this
is a sample app that a colleague and I
came up with and so I want to just show
you the context of what we'll be going
through for the other demo so let me let
me show you the dream house demo real
quick so this is there's there's a bunch
of different pieces of this dream house
demo application but essentially it's a
real estate finder application so if I'm
looking for a house to buy then then
this is a sample application that would
show you how you could build all sorts
of different things around that
experience so this is the the web
version that's actually more catered
towards a mobile web application so the
some of the formatting stuff is a little
weird on this display but you can see we
can go in and search for properties
these are pulling up properties in
Boston and then we can go through and
see pictures and information we can
favorite properties and contact broker
and that sort of thing so so this is our
little sample application that we'll be
using this the data from from this
application as the example application
for our BOTS so I wanted to show you
that the the Dreamhouse sample
application and all the stuff that I'm
gonna be showing you is all available at
Dream House Apio
so if you go to that domain you can see
all the different parts of this dream
house
sample application and get all the
source code and everything that I will
be showing you so dream house app Daioh
okay so that's that's dream house let's
dive into our first bot so the first one
I want to show you is slack so with
slack there's a few different ways that
our BOTS can interact with slack so the
first is that we can actually have our
service post messages into a slack
channel so let me just hop out to my
slack channel here so I'm in a slack
channel and you'll see that there was
this this message posted here by the
Dreamhouse bot and when the price
changed on one of those properties in
the Dreamhouse application the bot
actually sent a message to the channel
and said hey there was a price change so
we'll take a look at the code for how
that works in in a minute okay so that's
that's one way to do a slack bot is to
to have some event in your system that
then posts into a slack channel there's
a couple other ways we can do bot in
slack so another is slash commands and
slash commands allow us in a channel to
ask a bot for some information so let me
show you that one so here in this
channel I can
say slash house and then I can do a
search for like Boston and three-bedroom
oh I didn't understand that let's try
again
house Boston let's just try a house
Boston oh come on have to know what it's
Oh
searched there we go got to tell it to
actually search okay let's search Boston
so there we go so that's now sent a
request out to my bot and said okay
search that dream house dataset and get
me back the houses that are for sale in
Boston and then it posts those back into
the Select Channel so all sorts of
different ways that I can interact with
bots through the slash commands here
within channels so that's the second way
that we can interact with slack the
third way is that we can have a direct
conversation with a bot so we can
actually go back and forth in a
conversation with a chat bot so let me
show you that one so this one is going
to be down in direct messages I can go
to the dream bot here and let's ask the
dream bot for help and so now the dream
bot is said okay here's the things that
you can ask me and so again we could
search for houses in Boston or let me
show you this one where we can create a
case so it's now asking me some
questions now we're having a
conversation back and forth I need help
it's a very descriptive subject hello
okay so now it's it we've just had this
little conversation back and forth and
now it's it said okay I've created a
case for you and in this case it's
created that case in Salesforce the
Dreamhouse app has a Salesforce
component we're not going to be talking
about that today but but so that's
that's where that data eventually got
created in this case okay so that's the
third type of way we can use BOTS and
slack is to have a direct conversation
with the bot okay so that's that's our
slack integration
options here and I want to dive into the
code I'll show you the URL first for
that so if you want to get the code
that's all I get up and in the
Dreamhouse
app organization and then that one is
the Dreamhouse bot slack so let's go
take a look at some of the code here for
for how this actually works so this
particular one we we actually have a
library in nodejs that makes it easy to
do the slack bots and so the code here
we don't have to worry about the actual
underlying JSON protocol that's being
used it's it's pretty easy to set up
everything that we need to do our bot so
this particular this part of the
application is is just used for that
direct conversation so the other parts
of the the first two options I showed
you for slack bot integration those are
in a different source repository so
we're just going to look at this one
okay so you can see that what I'm doing
is I'm saying alright if my controller
hears help then what I'm going to do is
create a reply and the reply is going to
be the text there that it that you saw
when I typed in help so then I said
let's create a case so let's go down you
can see some of these other ones you can
see parameterization here so if I did a
search and it would allow me to
parameterize the search so you see this
is pretty a pretty basic I'm not doing
any AI natural language processing in
this case but you certainly could add
that into this application here it's
just parameterised text and not even
much fuzziness on on the text matching
just parameters okay so let's look at
the create case one so when it here's
create case or new case then what we're
going to do is we're going to add two
first return say what's the subject so
we've started this conversation you'll
see that we're using this convo dot next
so that it's keeping the context of this
conversation around for until it's
completed the conversation so then I
have this ask description
here we we get the the conversation
responses so we get what they entered
from after we asked for the description
and the user entered it we get that
response and then here's where it
actually calls out to Salesforce to
actually create that case and then it
says so that's it oh yeah and then it
says I created the case once it's been
created and so this is what we're
actually returning from this this this
this handler from this this controller
is we're starting the conversation and
we're starting it with that subject
which if we look back up here this links
together with the ass description that's
down down here okay so that's that's how
we would do a conversation and again
that's we're not seeing the protocol for
what's actually underneath this in this
case because that library provided by
nodejs made it so we didn't need that
one other let me actually show you that
library so you can see that we're using
but kit here is the library in that
application so I mentioned in the
architecture that the typical bar
architecture will have four matters that
will tell the the display system the UI
that we're in how to actually render the
responses that were given or the the
information that we're giving it so you
can see in this case here's where we're
actually doing the the format of
properties so when it listed those
properties into the slack Channel is
adding these fields to to the response
and then those are being rendered by
slack so in most of the bots that I've
seen they don't allow you or you don't
often do HTML usually you do like a JSON
structure and then that JSON structure
gets rendered by the chat channel so so
in the case of slack that's what we're
doing is we're giving it essentially
this chastened data structure with
titles and values and then we have
parameters like whether or not it's
short and those are what gets rendered
like this so this is is rendering like a
title
and then actually this is probably the
title and then the description there so
so that's that's being we're giving back
Jason adjacent structure to this to this
thing and the formatter is creating that
Jason structure and then slack in this
case is responsible for actually
figuring out how to render that okay so
that our basic slack bot with node J s
and again it was pretty easy to set up
here I guess I'll scroll all the way
down so you can see the actual like
server bootstrapping we just create a
server and and and run it and that's
pretty pretty straightforward is there
any questions on how to create slack
bots or any of the code here okay all
right there is obviously for all these
going to be some some authentication
steps you have to go through to set
things up and get them authenticated and
create a bot and so so usually there's
just a few setup steps so you have to
walk through to like register your bot
in this case get a token and so we're
just setting that token as an
environment variable and then it knows
what to do in this case so okay so
that's our slack one let's go on to the
next one so messenger is a very popular
chat system by Facebook and the
architecture here is is very similar to
what you saw with with that third
example in in slack so this is a
bi-directional conversation that a user
can have with a bot through messenger in
Facebook so let's go check that one out
so here I'm on messenger comm this is
like a standalone version of Facebook's
messenger system you can also do this
directly through the Facebook UI but
what I want to do is start a
conversation and messenger
with my bot so let's go to dream house
is my bot and let me actually show you
that on Facebook so you can just see
what that looks like so there is a page
on Facebook so what I've done is I've
created a page on Facebook and this is
called dream house it's not a public
page it's just under development and so
currently nothing really on there but
but this is this would be like a your
business page right is where you would
create something that then you'd hook a
bot to okay so we've got our page dream
house and now in messenger we can come
in here and have a conversation with
this bot so should start responding
sometime there we go cool okay so I said
help and then said hey you can ask me
some questions so let's let's say find
houses and Boston you can see that my
dataset is very limited because I keep
using Boston so so there we go it's now
gone out to my service my dream house
service and done a query for houses in
Boston and then it's it's returned those
here and I can scroll through and see
those I can schedule visits and I
definitely in this case could create a
conversation as well with the botton and
go back and forth but in this case just
did a simple request response you know
search for some data and give it back to
me so this would obviously work just
like the slot want a slack one it would
work on the web it would work on the
mobile app however you however the user
wants to interact with the bot okay so
that's our messenger example code is up
on github as well but let's go take a
look at that code so we can see how that
works okay so for this one this one is
going to get a bit more involved because
at the time that we built this we didn't
actually have a library there maybe a
library now
or to make this easier but but things
are pretty - pretty new with the
messenger BOTS when we wrote this so
you'll see that I'm I'm doing things
pretty manually here I have to implement
the protocol all on my own and so I'm
using Express which is a HTTP server for
node.js and then you'll see again I have
to do some authentication so I've set up
a verify token that I got when I created
that page and created an app and my
developer account in facebook so I had
to do that that set up but now we are
setting up JSON parsing and then we have
a post handler so when there's a HTTP
POST to slash webhook then we need to
parse out the payload and implement that
protocol so there's a few things that we
do here but ultimately what we're doing
is we're trying to figure out what
handler is going to be necessary for
what the user typed in and again we
could implement AI - to do this to make
it to make it smarter but in this case
what we've done is we've just created a
dictionary of of the dialect that the
user can say and so so you'll see when I
typed in help that is going to run the
help Handler and when I said search
Boston or whatever I don't remember
which one that was what I typed but it
picked one of these other handlers for -
to run based on what I typed in there
okay so those are that's our dictionary
and then let's go take a look at our
handler so let's start down at the the
help 1 it's a simple one so here what
I'm doing is I'm saying ok I have a
handler it gives me a sender and then
I'm going to do messenger dot send and
return the response which is just going
to be a text response with the help text
there so that's a that's a simple one
let's do search take a look at search
house so for search house it first
response it says ok it's looking for the
houses for sale around you and then it's
going to in this case call Salesforce
find the properties that match that and
then
return those properties back to
messenger so we're sending two messages
in a row in this case and then you'll
see that we're using a formatter again
to format that data that we got back
into the the format for how that's going
to then be rendered by messenger so
let's take a look at that formatter so
you'll see what we're doing is we're
assembling up again a Jason structure so
we're parsing out the data that we got
from back from that Salesforce service
with with the properties in it and then
we're assembling things like images and
the title and the subtitle and the
buttons that are in there and so and
then returning that in the right format
and then again it's up to messenger to
actually take that JSON structure that
I've given it and then render it how it
wants to render it so so it's it's I'm
not actually writing the CSS and HTML
and those sorts of things to do the
rendering so yep different render or
different for matters here for for the
different things that we need to format
and this is just a transformer from my
data structure to the data structure
that that messenger wants okay so that's
our messenger bot with our server again
just a simple nodejs server and calling
these these handlers but in this case a
lot more manual because we didn't have a
library to help us implement that
protocol any questions about messenger
bots okay yep good
contextual questions yeah so yeah so it
would be very similar to the way that we
saw it in in the the slack bot is that
you would create a conversation and we'd
have to implement that part of the
protocol for messenger but definitely
possible with messenger to have that
back and forth conversation and retain
the context like we did with slack just
that in this case because we didn't have
that library to help us we didn't
implement the conversation part of the
protocol you can see that I kind of
conversationally in that search example
I am at least like like sending two
things right so there is a way to create
a context object and then get the
context and and then be able to maintain
a conversation just like we did with
this lack one but we'd have to implement
that part of the Facebook messenger
protocol on our own because we didn't
have a library to help us in this case
does that answer that question oh yeah
go ahead about the sender so I think
that it's intentionally pretty limited
like they don't want you to get access
to a bunch of stuff and I don't know
what all the fields are that it gives
you but those those come in to the
request headers so when we get the
request headers in the HTTP POST that's
when we can actually get out the context
information or about the user but I
don't think they really provide us a
whole lot of information about the user
just for privacy reasons so these these
type of facebook Messenger bots are
starting to pop up a whole lot more and
more especially around customer service
so we're seeing a lot of companies now
that when you go to their Facebook page
and start chatting with with them on
Facebook that they're doing some sort of
initial analysis and conversation to to
try to figure out what the user is is
trying to do do they need help or do
they want to contact sales so they're
doing some initial like vetting of the
conversation with a bot and then handing
it
over to an actual person so one of the
interesting things about the way that
Facebook Messenger works is that it
allows both the both a bot or Benny BOTS
and humans to both interact with the
users and so at any point in time a
human could go in and start actually
responding to things as well and could
take over from the bot so I think
they've done a good job at making that
transition smooth from bot to human in
their case other questions about the
messenger example if you there's
information on the Dreamhouse site about
how to actually set up the Facebook
parts of this but it's just some
clicking through some UI is to actually
create the application and get your
token and that sort of thing so so
that's all in the Dreamhouse github repo
for this one okay so that's that's
messenger so now let's go on to Alexa
this is this is the fun one so with
Alexa again same architecture that we've
that we've already seen what we're doing
is is everybody familiar with Alexa
thinks that I'm talking to it because
that's how its activated so everybody
familiar with Alexa these cool little
voice-activated devices from Amazon so
this is this is the dot version of Alexa
and so it keeps turning on because it
keeps saying Alexa that's funny
so with it with sure how to help you
with that yeah thanks Alexa so same
architecture as we've seen before what
we have is in this case a device that is
listening to what I'm saying and when I
activate it by saying its name then it
will call my service with the
information that I've given it and so so
we can ask Alexa questions like Alexa
what's the weather right now in Crested
Butte it's 24 degrees with cloudy skies
today's forecast has lots of Sun with a
high of 57 degrees and a low of
two degrees that's Fahrenheit so a
little chilly today Thanks okay so so
that's let's actually just dive into a
demo again the code is is up here so
let's go let's go play with Alexa so
when you when you set up this device
what we do is we give our application or
bot an invocation name so the invocation
name is the way that we actually are
telling the device that we're going to
to enter a certain application so what
I've done is I've given this I've given
an invocation name of Dream House so
I'll show you in a second how we
actually activate that but then we
define an interaction model and so the
way that Amazon is is set things up is
that there's there's kind of this
declarative side that I configure some
things and then there's the programmatic
side there's my service behind this and
so in this case what I'm doing is I'm
defining some intense and intense may
have parameters so you'll see the answer
city intent has a couple different they
call them slots but essentially just or
that has just one parameter which is the
city and that's of type Amazon US city
and then we have another one here which
is answer number which has a parameter
type of number right and change is so
you can see I've declaratively defined
so the the interaction model that I'm
going to be using basically the the
incoming the incoming stuff from the
user the incoming voice from from the
user and then you'll see these sample
utterances and so now this is where I
take those intense like search houses
and I give it some actual utterance that
it's going to be looking for and so then
that's how it actually starts to figure
out what you're actually talking about
and they're doing some amount of
natural language processing on the
incumbent voice to figure out how to
match up what you've said with these
utterances so then what actually happens
let's go to next screen here is I I tell
Amazon the endpoint that it's going to
call when it actually gets something
that comes in and so I have my app it's
up and running in this case on Heroku
but you could run it anywhere or you
could create a lambda on Amazon and then
but let's go test this thing so we can
we can test saying something right here
so let's do an utterance which is let me
actually go back because I always forget
to search for houses there we go okay so
let's enter an utterance
so the utter incidents that it's going
to test with is to search for houses so
we're going to say all right let's ask
Dream House to search for houses and
then what that's doing is calling out to
my service and that's that's in this
case running on Heroku which is
searching Salesforce and then coming
back so in this case I have a
conversation so what the response that
comes back is is it's going to then say
ok in what city so let's actually try it
out and hope that it works
Alexa asked dream house to search for
houses ok
in what city Boston how many bedrooms
three around with prize 500,000 ok
here is what I found for three bedrooms
in Boston around five hundred thousand
dollars 121 Harborwalk
Boston $450,000 127 in Broad Street
Boston $400,000 ok thanks
ok call that no problem oh I'm happy to
have
bots are so much fun okay so that's
that's our sample application with Dream
House hooked up to Alexa so let's take a
look at I need to stop saying your name
let's take a look at some of the code
for that which is down here okay so for
this one again when we wrote this we
didn't have a library to help us with
with the implementing the protocol and
so in this case we had to come up with
that protocol on our own so let's go
through some of the code here again
we're using Express and setting up an
HTTP server and then you'll see that
when I get a post to slash Dream House
now I'm starting to parse out the
request information that I got and then
we're going to again set up our handlers
and and then be able to handle the
responses there's where we start the
server up okay so let's take a look at
here's where we implement the the
protocol so you'll see that what I'm
doing is parsing request body and
getting some information out of the
request so I'm getting the intent name
I'm getting the slots which are the
parameters and so I'm parsing that
information out and then what we're
doing is we're assembling a response
back so that we can tell tell the device
what to say back to us right so this is
this is just the simple little
implementation of their JSON protocol
for interacting with with the device and
then let's take a look at our handlers
so you'll see that I've set up my
handlers like search houses and you'll
see that the the response is to ask a
question which is okay in what city and
then you'll see that that then my
response to that is comes in to answer
city and so now we can set our stage
which is up here actually is where we
set our stage so you'll see that this is
where we're keeping track of that
session the conversation is we're
telling it what the next stage to go to
is so that's how we create that
correlation to the next request that
comes in which comes in to the answer
city
so we're saying all right if our stage
was asked city then what we're going to
do is we're going to store the city into
the session right and then we're going
to set the stage to ask bedrooms which
sets us up for the next part of the
conversation and it asks okay how many
bedrooms and then then when we answer
with the number of bedrooms and we ask
for the price right and then when we
answer with the price then it goes out
and does our query and eventually
responds with okay here's what I found
and and then uses a formatter again to
to be able to return that information so
that's that's really it there's fewer
things I can do in here like ask it for
changes and stuff like that but but you
see that's a bit more manual because I
had to implement the protocol on my own
for to talk to you the device but but
still pretty simple it's all just Jason
moving back and forth with requests and
responses over HTTP okay so any
questions about about the alexa
integration code anything on that device
I've got a stuff yeah sorry I couldn't
see back there no it does yeah it does
handle multiple languages so so there
are some configuration parameters that
we can that we can set up in here so
you'll see that the only language that
I've configured for my bot at this point
is English but yeah we can come in and
add a new language here and then we just
have to give it the new invocation name
and give it the sample utterances in in
that language so so it's not automatic
it doesn't do translation for me so we
would have to set up each additional
supported language manually so yeah good
question Thanks any other questions
sorry okay
okay so that so all the code for that is
again available on the the Dreamhouse
app repo so if you go to dream house app
do all the the code and information for
how to settle this stuff up on your own
you can go down to bots and get all the
code for the the different bots that I
showed you there so so those were the
three bots that I wanted to go through
is Facebook Messenger and slack and
Alexa and guess we have some time left
for questions just any questions about
bots in general or anything you've seen
okay all right I'll be around if you
have any other questions or anything but
I hope you had a great devoxx thanks for
coming and I hope to see you again next
year
Thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
