capital of Romania and I'm joined by
Rafael who's a Java developer at Google
and you're talking about mutation
testing so typically mutation testing is
supposed to fill the gaps of
conventional unit testing what are the
limits to unit testing so hello
the music's testing is basically to test
your tests so it's not exactly to fill
the gap between mutation between the
unit tests and no tests it's more to
fill the gap between like code coverage
checking if your tests are fine with the
code coverage and make it something
better and this better is mutation
testing so what kind of mutations does
it does it make it operates I will speak
about in general about mutation testing
but also specifically about pit mutation
testing framework which operates on the
byte code so it can change a lot of
opera-like operators like from it can
just negate the operation operators or
any other things and byte code and check
if your test fails on the after the some
kind of bug is introduced into your code
like y equals x plus a it will change it
to y equals x minus a yeah exactly and
then see your test should fail on that
because you introduced a back into your
code and when there's a bug your test is
to detect your back if it doesn't fail
it means that your tests are useless so
mutation testing it's a library written
by Henry Cole's
developer in Edinburgh and so I had a
little look into it a while back and one
of the things I found is it can be quite
slow because it operates on the bytecode
every sound that mmm it was improved
from the other libraries like gesture or
like some Azamara libraries which were
before pH testing framework and one of
the improvement is that it operates on
byte code that's why it's faster because
it doesn't need the compilation
compilation again still like additional
testing can be considered like kind of
slow
comparing to normal cold coverage it's
way slower because if you create all
these mutations you have to run tests
against all the meat all this mutant
mutated code called mutants so
competitive their libraries and they
might they they do a second compilation
this just just goes straight to the
bytecode I'm not sure about the now like
the mainstream for Java bit I'm not sure
about what was gesture
obviously it depends on the language for
Python you don't have compilation so
just operate on the code for Java it
seems reasonable to operate on bytecode
do you find say it covers most of your
unit tests mistake yeah I just feel like
for for my development just to check
myself like I'm doing right like do to
check if my code my tests are good
enough anything that you think mutation
testing isn't doing at the moment it
could do I'm not sure it could do but I
think the evolution would be to make it
faster and to make it better but like
the still a little bit slow so for if
you would like to run it on your whole
code base then it may be slow is better
to run as you write unit tests maybe
there is something that you'd run on
your whole code base yes you're
absolutely right it's like it's better
while working on unit tests you just run
it and check if your unit test is fine
to run it on your whole code base you
can still do it in your continuous
integration but yeah the most important
is why Ronnie while writing the unit
tests to to check your anything to do
with data mutations or is it more just
operations in the code it's more on the
operations of the code you can imagine
like data corruption also but I think
it's more dedicated for for unit testing
and for for checking not really the data
but but your algorithm and take away
from your talk do mutation testing
because it's simple and it's like you
can do it while coding and I think this
is this bit framework is so good that
you can just
do it and there is no big overhead and
you don't need to spend more time on
writing your code
yep very easy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
