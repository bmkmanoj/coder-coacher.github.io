your favorite part of the conference you
might go first all right I got one for
you yeah you should go first yeah so I'm
algin bet you've been enjoying a night
hacking yeah the Belgium well well that
was actually a local so Tom who's a Jake
reader brought belgium beer from his
private stash for anybody anybody who
watched a full interview was entitled to
join us in the beer stash so that that
actually was my favorite part but my
second favorite part was the Java
Council session that was really fun
really awesome your eggs are amazing
yeah the but I mean also they did a
blind ignite oxa Simon maple talk two
slides that were created by Martin
Verburg on the train not intentionally
silly slides too but there was code in
there like imagine that having to like
talk to it ignite with live codes I
thought my favorite was Java is to
JavaScript as ham is to hamster and
forth you can just see him but what am I
gonna do with that yeah but he handled a
graceful like wonderfully yeah it was
nice was your favorite part um my
favorite spot
I guess just getting to talk to everyone
from the java community like obviously
we have events to live the world but
this is the original the first and
everyone here is so friendly and so
excited about what they're doing it's
just a really great space and I think
people to compare it a little bit to
Java one but I feel like actually it's
very European it's very open and what
people do and just the amazing interview
for what they have that's kind of yeah
the interview is the people yeah I oh I
can watch the talks online actually I'm
super pleased that they're gonna be on
duty yeah you can watch your own talk
online right cuz I ciff not again but
but it of it the talks are there there
for me later the real value has been
just the hallway conversations I've
written we've solved more code more
integration and more like I've closed
more tickets with people in the last two
days just sitting with people hacking
and I'm like yeah just two days ago Yuri
