basically at the point we're using a lot
of mobile devices and like four years
ago with mine okay so people start just
to use mobile devices no desktop devices
at all and so no constant connectivity
we have breakups apps doesn't work so
yeah we just have to save like a little
bit of data and maybe some assets
offline and we'll be fine
but like at some point we realized it's
likely more so we started to rethink
actually the whole concept and this is
why it's about offline first we realized
that we have to have like the whole
application all saved on the device and
just enhance through network and this
might like this is this is the
progressive enhancement part basically
because everyone's like oh my god yes so
much progress it's not it's just the
network that helps you with everything
so yeah it's safes also like so much
bandwidth and performance when you just
do that I'm tied to um how do you find
the balance then with being offline
first I'm taking up memory on the mobile
device like these huge apps this is hard
this is really hard at first you have to
separate both cycles the updating cycles
from the essence and from the data then
of course way more important right so
you basically store as much data as you
need on your mobile device
except of images images still very hard
you can pour it a few of those for
example to SVG and atomic CSS which is
really great but this is like the one
part of it and just enhance through the
network when you're getting and setting
new data that's that's one part of it
you also had to take care of the caches
like all the time so it always depends
on what kind of application you're
building how much data you actually need
because all data is always valuable it
always depends on that and you have also
you have to take care of the assets
right so what we always
to give us an advice to have a very
basic set of your I just store that
locally like for example a bit of CSS
very few images again like portrait and
enhance that through network so
something you can have a very basic font
that always works or you can even base
in code base 64 encode that and store
that in your local storage and just push
that or you just enhance all your I
through network with new images with
different that phones etc etc so yeah
pretty much this so you might have em
the basics that you need on your app ya
say if you had a news app yeah maybe you
have the basic news stories and the
cover image yeah but when you are online
you get all of the other images and
videos exactly exactly so sometimes it's
just super important to have like the
hero image the main image of the biggest
news story there when you just make sure
it's a very compressed one because it's
important to see what's on the image but
it doesn't have to be like five and B or
something right but people still do that
and videos mostly don't play which is
okay for users it's actually totally
fine so they just mark the story for
example read through the text and
realize okay that's important for later
so just save it watch it when I'm back
online or just dismissed because the
information they had they got it's
basically enough so it's more like
deciding on which application you
actually working on right now and what
do you need
and yeah working on open source projects
yeah I'm I'm since year since January
I'm back to source again which is a
really nice way to work right now I'm
working with Mozilla and that compact
and this project is super interesting
because we all tend to like work and
learn like all the frameworks and all
the cool stuff would just reflect her
all the time but basically what we need
is to finally learn the basics again
relearn
learn how the specs work etc so what
this project actually does is sometimes
have box where in one browser
something's like a website is broken but
it works on the others so you can just
go to that computer come report that
back and we diagnose and either it's
something in the specs that has broken
some right specs or annoy a different
browser vendors that they should finally
fix that or you can also help and just
get involved and reach out and diagnose
box so this is this I love this project
because it actually fixes the web yeah
that sounds really cool so you you're
essentially kind of acting as a gateway
to collect problems yeah and then either
fix them or pass them on to the
interested exactly and we also build
tools that are sometimes just optimized
and recheck things or tools to actually
just report the box to collaborate we
recently built a nice system add-on that
patches up specific websites then
vendors or companies don't want to fix
the website but it's like huge like
Facebook for example and people can't
use it we can we're able to just push a
patch and its component and it works
then for everyone which is super nice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
