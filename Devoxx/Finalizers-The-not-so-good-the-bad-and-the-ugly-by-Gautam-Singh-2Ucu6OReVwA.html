looked at the tread done and then I saw
something interesting what I saw was
these bunch of threats waiting on the
same object and among them was this
finalizer thread and when I look at the
stack trace what I saw was the
application threads were actually
waiting on finalizar class and it was
actually initializing instantiating an
object and during object instantiation
it was doing something with respect to
finalize your class and I had no clue
what it is doing so I started
researching about finalizes and I found
quite a deal about finalized errs and
i'm here to share that experience and
hopefully be able to explain the
performance implication of Pfizer's but
before we continue with my story let's
set some background first so what is
finalizar finalizar is a class on object
it's a class called finalized and it's a
way for your application to tell garbage
collector hey garbage collector before
you reclaim my object please do this
first and garbage collector calls that
method for you the finalize method for
you from a background thread which is
qualified by the thread and it's usually
used to do post-mortem cleanup so if you
have like a file handler you want to
relinquish after you are done with the
object you can put it in finalizar
finalize class and here's what happened
when an object gets instantiated so
first thing that Damien does is it
checks whether the object is finalized
above and the way HX is by looking at
the class if it has overridden finalized
method and if it finds out that the
object is indeed finalized about it
creates this new instance of type java
dot languor traffic finalizer
and associates this original reference
as a reference and then where it does it
registers this new class as a static
variable in finalizer class and then
your object plays an application
lifecycle and once the object is done GC
ron cey's okay this object is no more
referred from anywhere else but is still
referred from finalize the class in
which case what it does is it adds the
object to this queue and this queue is
processed by this background thread and
what it does is it picks up or an object
from the thread call finalize method
from the object and then be associated
from finalizar class so next time GC
dance sees okay object is no more
referred from anywhere else and it's
also not referred from finalizar class
now I can kill it so it takes at least
two GT cycle to reclaim a finalized able
object and that is just one of the
problem so coming back to our story when
I look at the finalizer thread and
finalize Ursula my lies the class in the
stack trace I kind of started figuring
whether this is my root cause and one
thing I also noticed was we had
finalized errs used heavily in our
application there was a pattern where
like finalizer were written all over the
place but I wanted to get some numbers
behind my hypothesis so what I did was I
did a benchmark so I used a match for my
benchmarking it's short for Java micro
benchmark honest it's an awesome tool
for benchmarking and I'm not going to
cover my the source code for benchmark
but it's available through my github
repo so check it out and when I ran it
on my system why found out was the
average time per object creation was up
to 7 times 2 600 times slow for
finalizes than for non fine lasers and
whatever where the sign was going it was
mostly going in doing GC what I found
out was the GC time for finalizer
benchmark was 50 to 200 times more than
non fine lasers and the allocation cost
per object for finalized errs are worth
three times more than non finalizer and
so just imagine just by adding a minut
method in your class could actually
start costing you three times more for
your object so it has a huge
implications but when I found out these
numbers i was kind of sure that this is
my root cause but then the other
challenge for me was to make this change
and we had these 50 plus classes which
has finite method overridden and all
they were doing was like setting this
member were you able to know most of the
time it's it it's like somebody is on
his deathbed and you are coming to claim
his state it's cool so don't do that so
what I did was I actually changed this
one class which was heavily used and
then I thought of running some load test
so this was the baseline before my
change when i ran the load test I
captured the performance metrics and
this is actually dinitrate that I used
and what I saw was the garbage
collection time was up this yellow part
is was approximately five percent of the
total execution time before my change
and after my change guess what garbage
collection didn't happen it happens but
like it's minuscule so it's like hardly
visible so that gives me confidence and
I put this change in production and I'm
glad to report that after we put the
change in production we never have to
restart the server
in P cars so as we see finalizes are not
only bad they can actually bring down
your application performance to its
knees so let's talk about the problem
and Joshua boy in his book effective
Java actually kind of condensed the
problem in this simple sentence
finalizes are unpredictable often
dangerous and generally unnecessary so
that object Reese erection is kind of
the root of all evil with the finalized
it because of this jbf has to handle
finalize the Bell object differently and
it is the fact that finalize the
finalize method can accidentally or
intentionally reset an object from dead
like in this class we have this static
reference and what finalizar is doing is
giving this pointer to the static
reference and making this object live
and that can happen and JVM has to
handle it and the way it handles it it
runs TCC's finalizer is no more in use
adds it to the queue call finalize
method on the object and then GC happens
again it checks ok finalize method
method is called on the object and
object is not resurrected so that's why
it takes 2 GC cycle to claim these guys
and then as we see in the benchmark it
increases the allocation cost and not
only allocation cost in terms of memory
it also increases valuation cost in
terms of CPU utilization because
finalizar are when finalizes are created
you have this new instance of Java dot
length or trackback finalized are also
getting created that increases your
memory utilization and finalizes are
actually called phylite method is called
from the finalizer thread which is going
to share
resources with your application thread
so if finalized the thread is doing too
much then guess what your application
thread will suffer and this is where
things started getting ugly finalizes
can cause more GC just by the fact that
fine lasers are held up in memory longer
at least 2 GC cycle and I when I say at
least it could be 2 3 4 money so what
happens is they can limit your
allocation space and if you have limited
allocation space that's what you'll have
more frequent minor GCS and when you
have these objects held up longer there
is a possibility that these objects will
get pushed to old gen if you are using
generational garbage collector and most
of us does so what will happen that you
might hit a full GC and you would never
ever want to have a full GC when users
are accessing your system it can take
pause of several seconds even several
minutes sometimes and then there is no
guarantee when finalizes will be called
or it could recall at all as there is no
guarantee in Game of Thrones who is
going to survive the season or this so
this is where things actually gets more
ugly like what will happen is if you are
doing any time sensitive operation in
finalizer there is no guarantee if it
will be called immediately means it
might be called several second several
minutes later as it's done
asynchronously and also there is no
guarantee which order they will be
called so for example here what we have
is we have this output stream wrapper
which has a reference to a file output
stream and when the parent object is
going to be available for garbage
collection the stream object is also
going to be available for garbage
collection and
team also has finalised method so what
will happen if screen finalize method is
called first you'll come here stream is
already closed you will get an exception
and what happened if there is an
exception for from finalizer it will
ignore everything else so if you have
anything else after that let's say if
you have a native memory you want to dsl
locate it won't be called it not even be
reported like the with finalizer one of
the problem other problem is it won't
even reported in your log so if there is
an exception it will be totally ignored
and this could be your finalizer thread
I'm blocking everyone else though
finalizar thread are low priority thread
like what I found out in our application
that the Java a year for jboss the
worker thread has priority of 5 and
finalize the thread have priority of
eight so finalize the thread are
actually little higher priority than my
vocal thread so these kind of things can
happen if any object which has finalized
method overridden is a multi-threaded
object because my lighters are called
from a separate thread and that's where
not where they are created so you can
have these concurrency issues and
sometimes finalizes are called earlier
than you think like here this code can
be optimized by compiler to convert this
dot stream into a single load and after
this line this is not going to be in use
and what will happen is if GC happen
actually this object can get garbage
collected and finalize method can be
called and what will happen here it will
blow up on you so these kind of things
are can happen it won't happen very
often but it will happen and what you
can do is you can put a synchronization
block around it in which case your
stream finalize method will
wait because this will have a lock on
the stream object in which case you will
be safe so what happened is a JIT
compiler has several optimization that
it does and one of the optimization it
does is it can actually convert if you
have multiple calls of the same object
it can convert it to a single load and
kind of cash it so this dot stream can
be actually converted to a single load
and then in this case this is actually
not going to be used in the second line
so it will directly use the cast object
and call right on it and then finalizes
are bad right they are terrible so why
would you ever use it unfortunately
there are certain scenarios where there
is no better alternative and one is
where you want to be allocate a non
memory resource where it's hard to
predict the life cycle of the object
like if for instance object is created
through a callback method from a
framework you don't know when it will be
call or when it will be de-allocated and
where there is no time criticality means
you never want to do a time sensitive
operation finalize method and the other
case is where you want to have a safety
net if you have provided a explicit
cleanup method for instance if you want
to deallocate a native memory that you
are using which is associated with your
object and you have provided this
cleanup method but client forget to call
it in which case you have the safety net
but it's very important to actually log
that as an error so that the client will
know that they forget to call it and
they go and fix it now let's talk about
some of the pitfalls that you can avoid
with finalizer one is if you don't have
to use it don't use it don't try to help
GC like this
and if there are other life cycle
methods available use it like for
servlet instead of having finalized you
can pretty much use destroy method for
that and provide explicit cleanup method
if you have control over who is going to
call and when they are going to create
an object you can provide an explicit
cleanup method and do your clean up
there and tell your client to call that
and if you are using finalizer it's a
good idea to avoid heavy objects with
finalizer what can you do you can do
kind of Java a normal database
normalization stuff so put bare minimum
which is needed for finalized in your
final I zabal class and everything else
in a different class and then refer it
back from the other class and finalize
bowl objects are expensive so cash them
or have a pool of them and we use if you
can then these are some of the
references that I followed and they are
good weed I have the link to my github
repo also I've put all the examples and
some nice graph and chart with benchmark
and to conclude finalizer themselves are
not bad the way they are used underneath
and the garbage collector the way it
handles is what makes it bad and that
had me thinking that we as a developer's
has to work under the abstraction of
abstraction created by languages by
frame works by runtime and it's that
makes is very important to sometimes
look under the hood and see how things
are done how frameworks are doing
certain things it not only makes us a
good developers it also helps us like
tuned to system strength and award the
weaknesses it doesn't mean it comes out
naturally means for me the challenges
the more I look I found out there there
is more to look because so but I think
like Han Solo from Return of the Jedi I
think
I'm getting better thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
