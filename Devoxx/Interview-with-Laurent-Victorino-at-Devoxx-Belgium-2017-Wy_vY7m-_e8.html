talking to Laurel Victorino
the game development know you have a
wonderful abstract so you're talking
about the forgotten anonymous heroes the
saviors of tomorrow trying to save the
world during during uncertain times with
outdated technology and practices the
game developers yes their game their
lovers because you guys at devoxx never
speak about us I try to show you a game
it was written in Java wasn't a game no
it's not a game if it's made in Java but
I can't make jokes about Java it's too
dangerous for me yeah I will try to okay
so let me ask you about these heroes are
they heroes no not really we just do
silly things that you guys don't and I
don't know why but yeah so how are you
what does the world need saving from we
are trying to saving you from working to
efficiently because we don't obviously
because we can't and for many reasons
but you guys are used to to go a jail
and to do fancy stuff using incredible
tools that we can do because we are not
allowed to plan too much her head
because of our work and and the fact
that video game development is changing
every time and you can't plan something
for let's say next week because the
technology will have changed or maybe
the game idea will have changed and it's
very complicated for us to to plan ahead
and to use all your fancy techniques and
ninja stuff
so how are you going to sabotage the
efficiency will try to not use get first
it's very important because we can't
because we artists that always create
you know
binary files that we can merge so it is
really inefficient for that and we can't
use it so we'll try to use you know
subversion trying to gigabytes of
branches and and useless stuff we we
can't use Trello or classic boards we
will use excel five years ahead with
long and long planning that nobody wants
to read and with fancy colors we will of
colors and and it's important and we try
to do that and and because you are way
too serious and way too efficient and
nobody needs to be efficient I think no
it's fine you can make video games maybe
maybe I can change yeah maybe you should
but it's just my point anyway into that
let's talk about AI mmm-hmm are there
any ways that you can use AI in game
development both to develop your games
and then to sabotage as the other
developers hmm yes we can create AI and
as we don't work efficiently it will be
I with bugs and these bugs may create
something new that will kill the
humanity and probably I don't know maybe
yes we artificial intelligence and games
it's always a great story because once
again we don't aim at having a perfect
artificial intelligence because it's the
only field where we don't need one
because we don't want to frustrate
players and if they start playing
against something perfect
win and if they don't win they won't buy
your game and they will say mean things
and you don't want to hear mean mean
things so you have to find the right
threshold in your artificial
intelligence and when you make it dumb
enough sometimes it creates life stupid
life but but it's cool anyway it's funny
you said about you don't like caring
mean thing that's because you've said a
lot of mean and hurtful things I never
said that
and you never said that and it's not
because we are live online that that
we'll try to say something like that but
yes you are boring anyway not you
personally but all the people here yeah
hi guys anyway no no it's just that we
have you think about us game developers
like I don't know cool guys making cool
stuff yeah yeah you too yeah yeah you
said that and anyway and we think about
you like boring people and I think we
are not rockstars
at least not all of us and you are not
boring at least not all of you and and
there is something about bias and and
false idea that we have each other about
and in the end we are something like
probably cousins because we are not that
far and even if we evolved in in
separate worlds these worlds are can be
connected and must be connected and I
think we can learn about all your fancy
technique and and and the way you work
and you can learn about our creativity
and probably drugs sorry
don't do drugs never never it's not good
for you talking about learning from each
other yeah we talked earlier about
control and
yeah I know it's a it's a bit of a lame
question after talking about drugs and
games how do you control the world you
it's the funny thing is that you
everybody think that it can't control
the world but we can I more seriously hi
I'm into the chaos theory and the
butterfly effect and and every tiny
decision and tiny thing can affect a lot
of values other things and we are the
total control on the future we just have
to realize that even with our small you
man brain and and it's very important
for for us to understand that we can
control the future and we have an an
impact on the future and I truly believe
that and it's the serious part of this
interview but that should believe that
educating people and and using
technology to to educate people is the
way to control the future and it's it
goes as well for the games because I
truly believe that every game and even
the weird one can teach something and
must teach something and educating
people is to me the way to control the
future
