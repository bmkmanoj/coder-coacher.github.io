we all know about DevOps is there's
loads of serious content but there's
some fun to be had as well if anyone saw
the keynote yesterday you would have
seen that Stefan Hanson came in on a
hoverboard now I done this earlier this
week don't play dangerously I've never
been on one of these before and I'm
probably about to fall off so let's give
it a go
Oh which way do you go either either way
come on come on fellas let's try this
okay whoa whoa I am definitely gonna
fall off right about now I feel like I'm
i feel like i may look like oh yeah
almost gone so Lawrence Krauss came on
to the keynote yesterday and what nobody
saw was him falling over and taking our
entire set out I think we need to see
Lucy Carrie give this a go now so I'm
going to hand the mic over to Lucy loose
come on over have a go okay okay so at a
time ok and ok and put you out the foot
I can't you on your honor your work that
you're doing guess ok sounds basic
happen ok so it seems that the this
isn't easy you want another go oh great
so I've just had my first go on a
hoverboard and a catastrophic quick try
on a monowheel as well Tom you're from
monowheel tell us about what what are
you doing here you're just showing
people the stuff and letting let him
have a go yeah yeah of course we are
making a bit of awareness as well
because a lot of people don't know these
machines so it's it's nice that they can
try it over here this new self balancing
technology on even one wheel so yeah and
I've seen I've seen a few a few people
falling have you had many accidents up
in reception where you've been showing
people no actually your priority is a
safety that's number one so it's really
important if the people get on the
machines that we can instruct them how
to do it and then we can do it in a safe
environment yeah and it looks really
safe up there actually kind of guiding
people along holding their hand as they
go etc I guess it takes a little bit of
time for people to get their confidence
up it felt like the help hoverboard you
could get in like 30 seconds or
something but the monowheel how long's
that really take yeah normally a real
monowheel it's going to take you up to
one two or three hours we have even a
client which is 80 years old and he is
doing mono wheeling so in this way i
think that the guy took him two weeks
time which is every day 1 1 hour of
exercise well thanks for letting us have
a play today if people want to get in
touch with you how did i get hold of you
they can have a look on the website and
this is a monowheel dots PE of course
it's in dutch so this is the cards</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
