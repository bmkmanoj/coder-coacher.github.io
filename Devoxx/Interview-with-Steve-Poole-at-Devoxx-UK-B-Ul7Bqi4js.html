DevOps UK and I'm here with Steve from
IBM and you talked about the anatomy of
Java thunder abilities yes which I've
just don't admit genero go yeah i
reminding you yes yeah I can Tim and
that's very interesting topic at the
moment well always yes machine in Bell
community that helps translate Khandava
I'm not T I say with the history of jobs
and abilities but in European what's the
the biggest historical one that is now
resolved ah
wait oh no this is so Java for a long
time had a really bad rap for security
and in the external world people say
don't you uninstall Java because it's
full of under villages what they really
meant was don't use the Java plug-in
because it had a lot of vulnerabilities
and a lot of that was design issues and
so there's no particular I mean did lots
of there's always one abilities and in
popular soft oculus offers always lots
because people are actively trying to
find them yeah so it's easy it's hard to
say that to killer
what we suffered from for a long time
was this bad perception yeah I know that
no we've fixed that because you know
Java plug-in which is the the main the
main vehicle for doing it for letting
people get at them finishes has gone
away
you know the browser's are stopped doing
it are all ugly during their supporting
as well so that's cool so now we're back
to having a runtime that you could look
at more objectively and again if you
look at there's the there's never a
there's a few vulnerabilities there's
never large number but we have I think
it's like please fix like 10 every time
to do release not massive occasionally
you get one or two that's a bit painful
and you should fix it but there's no big
smoking guns so it's not very gentle
undercurrent it's no worse than a lot of
other products though which is the best
way to put it
so my talk was about level setting
people's understanding of that but also
trying to make people aware of the other
side of the coin which is what's
happening in the cybercrime space
okay okay so I what I want to do is make
sure people understand the scale of the
problem so you can talk about job
abundance and abilities and abilities
you can ask people to update and they
see that as a chore does every time
every time you update to a new version
you run the risk of breaking something
but if you don't update and the things
that you're running on gets old or maybe
not even very old it's got
vulnerabilities in it which become known
so once they become known they can be
exploited and there are people out there
who are making serious money in hacking
your systems so according to some of the
stats that we've got the cybercrime
which is the you know that these wicked
away espionage and stuff like that we
talked about cybercrime is being the
most obvious one from a real day to day
point of view cybercrime 2016 Wars the
from a criminal profitability point of
view equal with the whole of the drugs
made and it's projected to get to
something like twenty one hundred
billion dollars now so it's going from
about four hundred fifty now to about
twenty one hundred billion dollars is
that American billion American well you
have no America didn't yeah but it's
just there's no end of it inside because
we've not really taken security that
seriously you know you see it all the
time in the press so my talk was wake up
and see this side of the problem and
then we were talking in through what a
vulnerability is and our processes are
managing it and then talking to a few
other examples of what our
vulnerabilities but without talking
about the codes because if I share you
the code share with you the code of a
vulnerability by showing you the fix or
I point out how the code that you've
written is just going to get hacked
if I publicize that then I've given away
those secrets to to the bad guys yep
next I would say it's the same as if I
was tweeting my credit card and PIN
number yeah I'm not going to do that so
we're not going to share the details of
the pixels given
so if you when you're looking at the
okay so we're not going to talk about
difficult exes I think of some examples
those are classics so people always
point at things like Java serialization
as being a really classic way for
vulnerabilities to be built round so
exploit vulnerabilities the the weakness
and the exploit is the thing that
somebody's created to make use of that
vulnerability can you intercept and a
database connection yeah in theory so
it's that way to do it money okay
actually the so the simple answer is the
answer yes you could but it depends on
the circumstances so serialization the
reason that serialization gets targeted
is because of the designers
serialization it means it's very easy to
instantiate arbitrary code so you can't
inject code but you can find codes that
people have already got on their system
and subvert it so if it's got if you've
got data-driven code which actually lots
of code is it's very easy to subvert
that and then double it doing what you
want to committing but the things like
you've heard about SQL injection yeah
so there are moral equivalence in Java
where you can see people where the
designer the designer of the application
has not checked the data so he's not
validating it somebody discovers that
out somebody connects his application by
his code another piece of code another
piece of code and next then you've got
this next one so it's not always a
one-for-one this vulnerability this
exploits it really the series of
weaknesses in your code combined
together assumably if you retain your
API is in a certain way yeah and then
just certain degree type safety your ap
so that will definitely help right now
I'd say most of the most of the
vulnerabilities that that turn up are
not obvious so they're not yeah they're
not smoking guns so if you
you could look at so an example that I
use today was above the phenomenal and
abilities been fixed for a long time but
effectively because somebody was being
helpful they were giving away
information so this was an instance
where you use some data to instantiate a
class and if the class couldn't be
instantiated you got a message back that
said can't instantiate the class you
gave the class mate and this all
revolves around Java properties object
which was backed by the system
properties object and the vulnerability
was that if what you were asked for
wasn't in that properties object it
would go to the system okay and the net
was and if you were to ask for some
random property it would come back and
say a few so if you said instantiate the
class that's called Java dot home the
property construction would go Java dot
home haven't got it it's in the system
class loader in the system properties
Javed at home try and create a class for
it that fails and you get back a message
that says Java dot home can't be coming
to a class because its value is this
okay and it's that value sorts that's
what vulnerabilities are those really
subtle things where either you didn't
realize how your code was going to be
used and you didn't think about it or in
other cases you did think about it but
somebody who was very intent inclined to
break your systems connecting your code
with somebody else's code side okay so
what we're saying really is right now is
it's a big problem there's a lot of
focus a lot of money being made by
people who are exploiting you so you
have to remain coming and the more that
you can do to keep your systems current
the more sleep so if you're going to be
and we appreciate that that means you
may end up having to your applications
may break because you put the latest
version or something on it but they're
down you know the the downside of not
fixing it is that the older your
software is the more vulnerabilities
will be discovered in it and the more
likely is you'll get there
make it do it makes it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
