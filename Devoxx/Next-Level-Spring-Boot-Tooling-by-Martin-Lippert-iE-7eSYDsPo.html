to this talk about spring boot tooling
so tooling for spring and spring boot in
the in the Eclipse IDE basically but the
stuff that I'm talking about it in one
way or the other you can find it in
other IDs too but some things are
special to it close buddy hope you can
make some sense out of that for you well
your environment me my name is martin
lipid I work for pivotal that's a
company behind cloud foundry and spring
and rabbitmq and all those nice nice
projects and makes it easier for you to
develop cloud native apps and before I
start I would like to ask you about
who's using spring already
okay that makes sense who's using
eclipse that's 90 or it's been tool
speed or some things like that
okay what are the others IntelliJ tell J
okay anything else
NetBeans di Emacs textmate item sublime
okay cool okay let's get started
so of course safe harbor statement right
don't don't trust basically don't trust
me there's no product announcement and
no promises be made in this talk and I
guess you know about spring boot right
who already uses spring boot not just
spring yeah okay that's cool so
basically the short sentence form a
drink okra from the spring ite keynote
hey it's let's go on with spring boot
and cloud foundry and get on with your
life so what my team is doing we're
doing the tooling for the IDE --xe
especially for Eclipse but we are
looking at at other other kind of
environments and editors in the future
too but that's what you can download
from from our website the spring tool
suite right but it's basically Eclipse
plus additional plugins that we think
makes sense for you if you hack on
spring applications
and that's what I'm going to use today
in my demos because the question that
drives me is how can I make your life
easier like how can i boost your
productivity when you heck spring bood
apps that's my goal and that's what I
would like to show you for the stuff so
it's a it's not really a product
demonstration is all open source the
stuff that I'm going to show you you can
download that for free and use that for
free so it's not not really it's not
nothing not a paper product or something
like that and you can even help us in
contribute code if you want so feel free
to go and get help and somebody pull
request or or help us hack the IDE I
think talking about tools is boring and
showing slides about tools is even more
boring so I will do demos all the time
so we'll be talked out of let's say the
remaining twenty five minutes will be
demo time only hopefully that's okay
with you
if you have questions feel free to ask
in between whenever you want raise your
hand give me a sign or kind of shout out
loud I don't know if I don't see that
let me know and let's dive in let's dive
in if I find the Escape key on my my new
MacBook Pro it's kind of a challenge
from time to time okay yeah not the
Escape key but that was close so here I
am it's a spring tool spring pools feed
populated with quite some stuff in my
workspace and I would like to get
started with the spring Buddha app we'd
like to create a controller thing for
the way up and get some kind of rest
services up and running on my local
machine and make that easy for you so
what you can do is you can always go to
something that's called start spring dot
IO and that's what what what Josh always
shows that's and that's an easy web app
where you can select the kind of the
spring boot starter modules that you
want and you can create a basic maybe
the greater project out of that for the
specific food version that you select
and you can download that and then you
can import that into your IDE if you
want to and that's that's pretty handy
because you can easily get all the
dependencies to all the necessary
libraries on your project and we've
integrated that so you can get there
directly from within the spring tool
suite just go to creating your project
using the spring starter project and you
get a nice wizard that populates with
hey look here we are let's change the
name I use a maven and Java 1a that's
all fine packagings jar that's all good
the interesting part is on the next page
of the wizard where I can select the
boot version and then I can select all
the starters and all the the nice little
modules that spring boot comes with if
you want to so in my case I have some
kind of frequently used modules that are
showing up right at the top so let me
use that one and if I would like to for
example hey I would like to hack on
spring data with MongoDB I can just go
here Mongo and see oh yeah that's kind
of a MongoDB shows up here I can even
even hover over that and see oh they're
guides and references some additional
information what these start is so you
can can take a look at and you can
select all of those but I'm I'm fine
with going with dev tools here and
actuator and that's it for me at the
moment you could if you want to scroll
through the whole list of spring boot
starters that we have at the moment
which is quite some kind of
comprehensive list here but that's fine
with me
if you create boot projects frequently
you can also set a few starters as some
kind of default setting for you so
whenever you create whenever you start
up this wizard it kind of pre selects
these kind of the five things because
you always want to have the dev tools on
you always want to have the actuator on
you always want to have the the web
module on you can set them as default so
they are all all there is default okay
let's go and you can see it uses
actually the the web service to create
the project so let me create that
project
here we are spring boot project ready to
use and ready to run so I could go here
and start what I would like to do is I
would like to hack and create a new
controller I would like to create let's
say my controller and I know it has
something to do with a it should be a
rest controller so I should put in an
annotation for spring that comes from
from the web module but I forgot to put
the web module on the classpath the
starter when I created the project and
usually you don't really know exactly
the set of dependencies upfront when you
create the project that kind of evolved
over time the nice thing here is because
I have a rough idea what the annotation
looks like I can go in here and and get
continent-sized
for this type and it tells me oh yeah I
can import this type but it comes from a
different spring boots daughter that you
don't have on your class path yet should
I do that for you and I can say oh yeah
do that and tells me okay
in this case I will change your pump
fire because I will add this starter to
you that's nice that's easy
so let's do that and I'm I'm here cool
that's great I would like to get a get a
get a get request mapped to this
controller so let me let me use a quick
code template that we put in for the
usual spring bootie spring boot stuff so
putting that on the on the slash reading
let's get I don't have any kind of
module here and I returned hello hello
from there box okay cool
done rest controller is done and I
couldn't I can just go ahead and start
it up and I can start the addition kind
of an easy way saying start a spring
boot application and I don't know how
you started up your apps and eclipse you
start them off as apps and they serve
something
and the next thing that I usually do is
I try to find out what port this stuff
is running on so I go to the lock file
and try to see oh is Tomcat really
started or not is it done already
oh yeah it's done take a look oh that's
port 8080 and so on in in case I hope I
find the right the right bits of peace
and I think that sucks searching that
all over the place in your log files so
let me stop that there's there's a new
component that we put into STS it's not
really totally new it's already in there
since a few versions which is called the
boot dashboard and the boot dashboard
gives you an overview about all the
spring boot projects in your workspace
so it shows them all up here
and that's quite cluttered so I have
quite a bunch of them in there so I
would like to work on my demo one on
everything that's called demo so I can
filter that one and I only see the
projects that are kind of interesting to
me at the moment which is boot demo 2
and I can just go ahead and start it up
and it starts up and I can stop it from
here so I don't need to go to the right
console and press stop over here right
it's right kind of start and restart and
then stop and it shows up the port oh
wow I don't need to search through the
log file through the console to see the
port it's it's right here and to make it
even easier for you to open up the web
browser and go to that port you can just
go there double click and it's open up a
web browser for that port for that URL
ok cool that makes it easy right tiny
little things that are usually quite
kind of you open up a browser you open
up a new tab you type in localhost and
you kind of autocomplete and hope that
you pick the right port that you found
on the console and things like that it's
it's getting easier for you right
especially and that's what we have in
mind when we do this boot when we
implemented this boot dashboard if you
start on hacking microservice apps you
do not have this one app anymore that's
huge that contains everything you start
out building
building blocks and potentially many
microservices so you do not have this
kind of one or two projects and your
works list that you start up and then
everything is started you start tiny
little pieces and maybe many of them and
the booth dashboard makes it really easy
for you okay
but it serves a nothing because I have
this kind of oh it is greeting oh yeah
there's this de box but I hate to type
that in and it sometimes I forgot which
request mappings I put into my app so
the good thing is I can go to a
properties view here we can see oh yeah
that's running and it shows me the
request mappings of my application cool
which I see the app is running and it
serves all these request mappings and I
can just double click here and opens up
greeting and when I forgot where I
hacked on this request mapping I can
just double click over here and it jumps
to the to the code with this request
magnets be defined so you can easily
quickly find the place where this
request mappings being served and
implemented ok so that's nice but I also
really like the double click on the app
in the dashboard so I would like to jump
automatically to this greeting one so I
can go back here and type in a default
path that it should always use when I
double click kind of the default thing
that I would like to use for testing and
oh I get get nice content assist here so
I type that in set it and whenever I do
double click here it opens up directly
that URL tiny little thing makes it
really easy for you right it saves you
this kind of five or ten seconds every
time multiple times a day maybe hundreds
of times a day and makes it really easy
for you really really nice cool stuff
okay that's great
I can also jump to the console output
quickly so if it would like to find the
right especially if I have multiple ones
right many consoles being open I can
quickly jump to that one so I see okay
here is the right one that matches my
application that's running over here so
it's easy for me to navigate between
different console views or jump to the
right will open up the right
for me really nice and you saw that I
filtered that one and let me remove that
filter again and that filter is quite
smart because it doesn't filter for the
name only it also filters for working
sets so in this case I have a working
set that's called chatter and there's
stuff in there it's not called chatter
but if I type in chatter it finds out
there's a working set with that name
should show everything that's in the
working set that's nice and if that
isn't enough I can tech projects so I
can say for example I would like to see
everything that's called that's tagged
with service well that has service in
the name so it shows me everything that
I tagged as a service or that has
service in the name really nice so I
don't need to put in different working
sets for all the different combinations
I can really easy tag them and pull
multiple tags and projects and see those
here so that's cool great so let me let
me stop my demo app and move on with
something more something more
complicated it's not really complicated
but it's it's a nice one the chat oh the
chatter app it's a kind of a chat
application
nothing really dramatic you spring under
the hood spring boot apps use a spring
data flow under the hood so
communicating with the rabbitmq the
exchange messages and things like that
and the good thing is because it's kind
of I have three apps I would like to
start I don't need to start every app
itself by hand I can just go ahead and
start all of them at once and I see all
some of them are starting up and it's
not the VM that starts up the VM is
already there this status indicator it
really tells me is the app ready or not
is it starting up a spring boot still
starting up and and starting the
application and initializing the
application or is the application
including the weapon embedded web server
really ready to
any requests so when the the green arrow
shows up the app is really ready okay so
I three apps it's kind of a I have a
lock that locks everything that goes to
the goes to the chat I have a ping bot
ping bot sends out ping messages every
two seconds maybe here and I have a UI I
can open up the UI and I see oh that's
the UI that's that's an easy one but I
think this is it's it's too slow that's
not fun fun to watch so let me go here
and change that and in the pink bot and
what we have in the ping boat it's it's
a it's a property that you can set that
we have defined at the project it's a
cheddar ping interval you can change
that and the nice thing here is that we
added support for all the properties of
spring bood apps and properties of your
project itself so you can get easy
countenance for example in this case let
me remove it if I type in server I get
continent sis for a server port for
example and it shows me all the
properties that are available around
what's been good I don't need to learn
all of them that don't need to look them
up on the web it just shows me
everything and it does validation for me
so I type in hello let me use the
English version hello for port tells me
no no no no no no no no no it's it's an
int right you I'm expecting an integer
value for this property and that is that
stuff is quite smart because if I go in
for example for a logging level it knows
about and knows about types so if I
would like to specify a locking lever
for a certain package or for a certain
type and knows about the types and those
oh this property expects a type or
package I can put that in in this case
here and it knows about the logging
level
and so on so it really gives me a lot of
a lot of lot of assistance here but let
me change that let me change that to 200
I changed that and I would like to
change it here I let me restart that so
it's just one click experience right you
can just one click and it stops the app
and restarts the app let me go back to
the lock to actually see something and I
see okay that's done could restart it
quickly so that's nice but it's not
enough for me because spring boot comes
with dev tools and dev tools allows you
to hack your app and press safe and
spring boot itself restarts the app
automatically for you without shutting
down the JVM which is quite effective or
quite efficient but that's not on the
that's not a my on my spring boot
project so I can go to the pump file and
say I added the starters and then
magically I get the same wizard again
for the dependencies for spring boot and
I can't just add one in this case dev
tools let me add one Steph tools
recompiles and let me restart that one
again oh by the way since the dev tools
is so special it indicates all the
project that has dev tools on them on
the classpath directly with kind of some
kind of an additional marker on the
label so in this case let me take a look
at the log oh it's still doing that
stuff when I change something here and I
press save it's spring boot that
automatically restarts the app for me
without shutting down the JVM and I can
do that and I can do that again restarts
the app under the hood so that's kind of
nice and it works for it works for code
too so it's it's not
it's not for it's not for properties
only or something like that so let me
change some code and whatever that the
message Oh what should i type something
in here I press save and it's there I
code has changed and I can do pretty
much any changes I want I'm not limited
to debug interface changes of whatever
you're changing method implementations
only I can do whatever I want the only
thing that doesn't work at the moment is
changed in past path so that's not yet
implemented so I cannot add additional
dependencies to the class path that's
not kind of picked up by a spring boot
not yet at least maybe in the future but
not at the moment okay so kind of nice
stuff helps you there was a question but
was the class path question oh it is it
is restarting the application but it's
not restarting the JVM so in the case
the dev tools are on the class path of a
boot at boot starts the app slightly
different so it Jerry M get started
spring boot get started and it creates
in a separate class loader for the app
so the app gets gets gets loaded with a
different class loader than the JVM and
when it gets triggered for these kind of
code change it throws away the class
loader and everything that belongs to
that creates a new one so reloads the
application and kicks that off so this
state of the app is of course lost right
it's not not keeping state therefore
it's totally different than hot code
replacement hopefully of the debugger
but it's more efficient than restarting
the JVM by an order of making magnitude
it's like I don't know restarting the
JVM takes five seconds and restarting it
the boot app takes just one second
something like that quote let's take the
simple ones right if you do a huge bunch
of activity when you start up your app
in in your code of course
it's being executed - but yeah depends a
little bit but you have the option right
to do that yeah yeah they still grab
it's not replacing J rebel or something
like that or no no it's not not a
replacement for that not at all it's
totally different different story okay
so since we like that that dashboard so
much and it makes our life so easy with
all these nice features coming forth and
back we also think that sometimes when
you work on Microsoft applications you
have many micro services running and
usually you don't have everything
running on your local machine so you use
some kind of cloud environment to deploy
your apps and to use your micro services
and to have the the database on or
whatever and we integrated that into the
dashboard to give you kind of the same
experience so what you can do here is
you can add you can add a Cloud Foundry
account
in this case we we start hacking that
for Cloud Foundry as a platform as a
service and that integrates as a new
node into your boot dashboard and it
shows you what's going on on Cloud
Foundry on your Cloud Foundry space so
it shows all the apps that are running
and shows what what's the status of the
app so it's running or not running and
all the nice features that I have for my
local apps we tried to port them to
cloud foundry apps too so you can you
can get the filtering that applies to
the to the apps and cut found it you you
can start them you can stop them you can
jump to the console output so let me try
to connect to the console of the of the
of the lock what's going on there so it
should should show up some stuff here
what's going on on Cloud Foundry so it's
directly integrated of course I can
double-click it opens up my app that's
running on Cloud Foundry in this case so
it's kind of a publicly available one
running on a cloud foundry instance on P
dubs pivotal Web Services can see the
the public version of Cloud Foundry
that's being hosted by pivotal and I can
tag them I can see the request mappings
and things like that it's really it's
really nice but the good thing is I can
also deploy them directly from within my
environment of course maybe not from
production right you should have kind of
a CI pipeline for the head but for
testing purposes and for dealing with
these in my local IDE and for quickly
trying things out it's it's I think it's
really useful and so I would like to add
those two apps to Cloud Foundry to my
Californians that would like to deploy
them and I just drag and drop them over
and it asked me how should I deploy them
and I find a manifest file that's kind
of the thing that you use if you deploy
at 2:00 o'clock foundry you can put the
configuration for Cloud Foundry in a
manifest file and we have support for
that manifest file put into SDS so you
can directly
select one or you can you can type in a
manual one right we know or usually it
looks like this and you get you get
continent cysts here for the Cloud
Foundry stuff right so we know we know
about that
we know about the different the
different things that are usually inside
of a cloud phony manifest so the schema
of the manifest is known well known to
us so we can we can deal with that say
oh yeah that's a disk or that should
usually be X Y Z and so on so let me go
back and I just use that one for for
this application and I is this one for
the other one so that's great and you
see those two apps being deployed and I
can see the progress in my console view
so that's kind of being streamed to my
IDE I can easily see that so that's
that's kind of nice so why that usually
takes a while it kind of uploads
everything and creates a container on
Cloud Foundry and and spins up
everything and there's really uploading
stuff to do some Amazon hosted PDFs
version now so I keep that running for a
while and while it's doing this
deployment I would like to show you that
I can do these changes to my apps on
Cloud Foundry too and I think that's
really really nice I have this ping bot
application and you can see let me
switch back to the to the bot here and
to my app it's kinds of things the app
and I would like to change that because
I have dev tools deployed with this
application to Cloud Foundry too so I
would like I would love to change my app
locally and then get those changes up to
Cloud Foundry quickly without kind of
redeploying the app all the time so just
use the same mechanism that spring booth
does locally but for the stuff in
foundry so what I can do here is I can
kind of connect to that app connects
bring boot to this app on Cloud Foundry
and now whenever I change something here
in my app it kind of finds out that hey
there is something something being
changed the app on cloud found is being
restarted so let me go back to this one
and I can see hey the change is being
active on Cloud Foundry immediately
because the app is being restarted on
Cloud Foundry in the same way as they
restarted it locally so quite quite nice
tiny little a lot of tiny little tools
that makes it easy for you to hack
spring boo devs locally and on cloud
foundry meanwhile those are being
deployed and I could go on and go on and
show you more and more of those kinds of
features the cool stuff is I could even
I could even press restart in debug mode
for an app running on Cloud Foundry and
connect my Eclipse debugger to that one
that's cool but it's really slow remote
debugging is not made for wide area
networks but it works in case you really
would like to find out what's going on
on the cloud platform so it could could
do that be back right into your app on
on the Amazon server things like that
okay so I think I'm I'm done with my
demos and done with with the time so
going going back to the slides
saying yes a lot of stuff that we that I
showed you creating boot as working with
boot abs and we we continue to do that
right we continue to add more stuff to
the dashboard and make it easier and
easier for you over time shipping a new
version of the spring tool suite so the
next one will be out in I don't know I
hope next week based on really a new
Eclipse version and then the next one
will be out in summer based on Eclipse
oxygen and so on and under the hood we
work on some kind of new tooling that
for spring butit's it might be available
on for for other environments to like
other editors may be like vias code or
atom or things like that okay cool
give it a try download the latest
version ask questions five bucks
let us know and think I'm done thank you
hope you enjoyed it more questions
really happy to answer more questions or
discussions or ideas stuff that you're
missing from the tooling so whenever
whenever you think a the tool really
sucks it should do X Y is that let us
know we'd love to hear about those
things yeah the question is how do we
find out where this class inside of the
Java editor is coming from and which
library should we add to the class path
it's kind of the question and that's
that's an index that we built up and we
uploaded that to a small little app on
cloud foundry and first time you hit the
continent sis that's been downloaded and
used inside and it indexed the types
that are coming from these spring boot
libraries and spring boot starter
modules and it doesn't contain
everything right it doesn't contain the
world it's really focused on I think the
main spring boot starter modules we
might add spring cloud modules in the
future or specific ones but we don't
want to kind of index the world or every
library that's out there it's really
focusing on the spring boot modules yeah
that's the way we do it it's very simple
okay more questions
cool thanks for coming hope you enjoyed
it and enjoy the rest of conference</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
