today I'm going to talk about Kotlin
next level of Android development and
you made no Kotlin right now as a
language that joins mainstream you know
it is announced as an official language
of Android development it is used more
and more often you hear about it on
conferences it was three years ago it
was still in beta and nearly no
companies worked in cuddling so when I
was when people were asking me what am i
doing they were literally thinking that
I work for catch-up company because
catch-up is a cotton is a popular
catch-up in in in Poland they couldn't
understand that I'm not doing cotton for
money I'm doing coupling for for passion
my passion by my passion basically led
me to cut lean and for me first it was
like a side project I was just coming
back to home after all these hours in in
work and I was exhausted with all these
stupid problems and well finally you
don't need all these no pointer problems
you don't know all these casting
problems it can be smart so it was like
a fresh breath something I was having
fun with after my work and I just felt I
have to work on that I found one I was
an early adopter I worked in one of the
first companies in Poland who had the
update Kotlin on production and I felt
like that all the time so I wanted to
share my knowledge I wanted to share
with other people we wrote a book with
you girl voice Android development with
Kotlin and it's you know explode right
now conferences stuff and I also started
a big portal called cotton academy where
we teach Kotlin and we write articles
about cotton we have multiple authors we
are preparing course and different
things so this is about me what about
coupling Kotlin is much longer on this
on this grant and I am interested in
cutting actually you might be all
surprised but Kotlin started at 2010
it was eight years ago actually
jetbrains heard it with world surely
news with word in 2011 and shared it
with open source open the code of Kotlin
in 2012 but a coupling is developed
since 2010 in a team not by some you
know random people so it is really
mature language if you think about it
but it took six years to release first
official version out of beta it is very
important the trait of cotton if you
think about it I've made a set of
articles about character of cotton and
one of the big trade of cotton is that
it is very well designed they it's
developed by jetbrains they're making
great tools they have all the statistics
how people use their tools and cotton is
very very well designed with a lot of
thoughts and a lot of experiments before
something is released as stable and
that's why it takes so much time there
are lots of great features right now
like quarantines
which are really really powerful but
they are of course still in beta because
they want to understand well how does it
work and until they until they will
block their possibilities to change it
freely and after this release other
companies started supporting Catlin
spring spring is right now cooperating
strongly with Kotlin team new spring
keys is designed to support cotton and
some features in coupling and designs to
support new spring so these words are
working very well together and this is
pretty important because spring is the
biggest Java framework in the world and
Java is actually the biggest language
you can say it's JavaScript but in in
backend is that the biggest language for
firfer development so this is quite a
big deal also great which is you know
that one of the most popular build tools
is having fluid with Copley new since
2016 and right now you can make
configuration in in Copeland in Gradle
and probably it's going to be the basic
way to make configurations in March 2017
they released 101 very very important
release lots of great features including
Kotlin joyous I will talk about it a bit
more later we are here and listen about
Android in 2018 square announced Kotlin
of the language they support and they
were developed in if you are Android
developer how much Android developers
they have in here quite a lot how much
of you have heard about square okay you
heard about retrofit dagger this is all
square like and all great other
libraries the best libraries for Android
are from square and a Jaguar Town Square
they supported cotton in there right now
in cotton community and it was very big
event and soon after that Android
officially announced Kotlin as a next
language as a actually first class
citizen in Android development but right
now even in Android documentation
cuddliness is you even see examples in
catalan and they are like by default so
they are shown before examples in Java
it was a big day for cutting community
and since I have a person from Google in
here I would like to thank Google for
for this announcement to a very very big
change for Catalan community very I
opened some pain this day this is how
Kotlin develops on a cotton community
develops on slack in the forum and on
users group and also how number of lines
of code grows in in Catalan you can
clearly see where Google announced its
news you can see it even clearer when I
show you Google Trends this is Kotlin
how much people search for Catalina this
is a day when Google announced it so
it's compared with Scala groovy and
closure as you can see Kirtland is even
after this it's growing very quickly
right now it's more often search than
groovy and it's slowly catching Scala so
I hope that in next time I'm going to
talk about it
it will be this is from today morning so
it's very actual lots of companies uses
Kaplan square of course like Coursera
Netflix a lot of companies actually on I
believe on there was an announcement
that 15% of projects were moved already
to Kotlin in in in Android studio but it
was like four months ago so I think it's
it's even more like now it's it's it's
growing really quickly after a purchase
announcement
so you see Kotlin is important the
question is why it is important what
what have it improved and I want to show
you a few important traits one by one
I won't display you everything I will
only show you very few trades because
you don't have so much time to show you
why cotton is great so first thing is
safeness and by by safeness i mean that
more errors can be prevented on
compilation time instead of taking place
on on production basically it is safer
for users because they don't have errors
and it's also safer for developers
because they are not fired because of
errors and production so safeness is
very accurate term and it's connected to
very popular very important gentleman
Sir Charles Carr who said on one
conference about his billion dollar
mistake this has led to innumerable
errors and vulnerabilities you can see
his British and system crashes with
which have probably cost a billion
dollars of pain and damage in last 40
years of course we are talking about
nullpointerexception
kopplin provided good system for no
safety first of all no property cannot
be an initial
all properties must be initialized
unlike in Java second of all when we
have some type
it cannot be now you need to specific
unique to explicitly say that this is a
label type using question mark but when
you have no label type you cannot use it
directly you need to unpack it first so
there are a few ways to how we can
unpack it first of all is safe call safe
call basically calls right side only
when left side is not now if it is now
it just returns now thanks to that you
can make all these snakes like if person
is now it returns now so everything else
is won't be happen if it is there is a
person but school is now then the same
it won't happen in whole expression will
return now there's also unsafe call
which is very bad practice in Kotlin
this is basically every call in Java
encoding is very bad purpose but
practice we are nearly not using unsafe
course it's throws an exception when
when person is now and there are all
smart casting I told you like coupling
is very smart it's very connected to to
link so you can smart cast in very very
smart I'm sometimes confused how does it
know that this property cannot be null
because you know some code before there
was some check and that already excluded
this possibility so if you check if
property is not now it smart casting
it's not not the same it works with
types and with some other things but
analysis it's the most important I think
feature in this in this case there is
also Elvis operator
I will be separator provides default
value when left side is now comes of
course from great house of Elvis Presley
but you can also instead of value you
can also give any expression so you can
give return so return from function when
this is now it's actually pretty common
thing because we expect some properties
or some elements on properties and if
they are not there we are just
finishing function we are not doing that
so it is a common thing to do
and we can also throw an error so it's
pretty powerful if you think about it
another part of safe team is to promote
read-only values they are safety because
when we are making well we are making
multi-threaded applications it's much
much easier to work on state when we
have less state in our application where
more things are read-only and in
encoding most properties are read-only
and that's why multi-threading is it's
very very simple when we use Val you
cannot change it's just like finally in
Java when you use var it's it's it's
changeable and Val is highly promoted in
in Catalan including all the lists we
can we don't need to we can desire this
is immutable list and you can attach it
simply without you know special edition
of elements and there is also so-called
I don't have time for del because it's
it's bigger subject that I have called
presentation just about property
delegation these are property delegate
that this one provides you value Liza
Lee so it doesn't provide it on the
declaration time it provides you for in
the first time you use name it
calculates it from the form but there
are much more property delegates you can
use so we can have more properties
read-only and also it promotes in
Motability in objects or collections are
immutable by default in coupling you can
explicitly say that collection is
mutable the same with other things so
thanks and you you can of course change
them both but when you have a mutable
collection you need to make property no
table so every time you add some element
you're actually creating new collection
if new element when you are adding here
you have mo table list where this
Motability is kind of hidden because
this well looks like in mo table but
here it is explicitly stated that it's
mo table so when you add some elements
or remove you don't change
is property you change this list so it's
still explicit that this is mutable it
is easier in in in terms of in terms of
multi-threading but but we have it all
explicit and clear and this is about
safety
another thing is object-oriented
programming and I know that functional
programming is right now cool you know
Scotland also supports functional
programming really well but functional
programming has no class and we want
classes since we design Java our
developers at first place this is a
simple bin in in Java you know you have
field setters and getters to set them on
the constructor it's huge
and it's very very ugly this can be
rewritten in Catalan and I will do it in
steps first step is that we don't need
setters and getters in Catalan
properties are having setters and
getters under the hood and you can
always change implementation of this
setter and getter so Saturday and guitar
are there we still have encapsulation we
just need to define constructor but
actually this constructor can be
provided as a in in class declaration as
a so-called primary constructor and when
we declare it this way we can use it
during class creation this pattern
should be known from new languages
including Scala but cotton made even
step further and since this is a very
common pattern to make make primary
constructor to make some property and
fill it you can just define property in
in primary constructor and you have the
same result so actually if you compare
it right now this in Java and this in
Catalan are actually the same things but
this coding class is much more clear and
you have much less redundancy just think
right now that you need to change
something in this class or you apply
some changes and you need to read them
you have a lot of noise in here that
disturbs you in in Catalan it's
an explicit another improvement is data
classes when you have this class we have
we can easily add data annotation that
provides set of very very common
functions how do I know they are come on
did jetbrains know they are come on they
have to link foreign air generating them
for Java and they are used over and over
again this is to string aqueous cash
code and copy it's not so used in Java
but this is a different story we'll test
it in a minute so first of all to string
when you have some when we have some
object let's say Johnny Bravo some age
in Java to string will gather generate
its name and it's rush so what do you
have no information about this object
actually but when you have data class it
generates two string which displays all
the properties inside so for logging for
debugging it is much clearer and and
thus much simpler second thing is
aqueous when we equal to object Java
default behavior is comparing if these
are exactly the same objects but I mean
they have the same ID but in terms of
data classes we are interested if
content is the same so when we annotate
it with data add modifier datum it
compares every property and since all
the properties in these two persons are
the same it returns true the first thing
is copy when you copy an object you have
another object with with the same
properties this is very important in
terms of immutability because cottony
support stability really well because
what if you have data classes with all
fields in Moe table it's very good for
for multi-threading but it's very bad
for our for modification you need a
function to change it that will return
new object with some proper
is changed so you can use copy which
also allows all the properties as other
parameters with default as narrow as
parameters with default arguments so you
can make a copy with concrete properties
changed so this way you can have
immutable data classes it's very good in
terms of what is reading functional
programming and this kind of stuff this
is about classes now about conciseness
and color usability this is very this is
important for me because my first
programming master were always saying
that if you're using control C control
fouling in the same project you're doing
something wrong but I was doing in Java
so it was impossible to avoid it right
now and I'm using cotton I I can forget
about this control C control foul and
and the problem with Java is that if you
want it to extract some common common
code you've been mostly using some util
classes but they were really ugly and
very very bad to use why they were bad
to use let's look at that this is a
common way how people were defining
lists in Java
later in Java they defined util for
creating this list but does it really
help it is arise as list you know it's
not intuitive it you need to remember
that it's arrays and at least and if you
static import that you have just as list
it doesn't look good in Catalan you just
use top level function list off and set
of values and you have list created
let's so can another another example
even more important in this in this case
this is how you set visibility in
Android so you need to remember that
it's visibility property you need to set
this view gun you need to remember where
it is what is its name and you don't
have suggestions it is it is integer
it's not an 'm so you need to remember
all of that
so it is a bit painful even even when
you are an advanced developer this is
how we would prefer to do it you'd want
to have vo and say hi did you know but
Android developers didn't include that
what we can do in Java is make view
utils hide and argument view it is even
worse than the first attempt you know
it's it looks ugly it's not helpful
and this modifying input this modifying
argument is a very bad practice so it's
something you don't want in your project
when you have string you want to process
it you want to replace some things and
capitalize it this is how you won't do
it this is this makes you happy but
using Java util is not helpful you know
string qts replace all it just it's not
expressive it looks ugly you would do it
differently
so how code link can help us in this in
this manner
first of all copying aloud functions
literally everywhere you can use
top-level functions you already see one
of them list off you can use member
functions it's just a method and you can
use local functions functions inside it
functions they can use all the
properties inside this function so they
are also very useful sometimes
second of all you can use extension
functions so extension function add
looks like it adds some additional
method into the class it actually
doesn't you cannot add methods into
class in Java but you can make it look
like it does so it is like a normal
method but you call it on on some on
some view so this view hide is exactly
how you can define it in Catalan and you
can make some view dot hide and it's
going to be hidden this is example a
very simple example with string
processing so I won't string no longer
than some some size so I take substring
can take minimal of length and and
Maxine
so when I apply it on strings string no
longer than it will cut our strings
after and element so this is a very
simple example in in general this
expression exponential functions are
very simple and and very powerful one if
who is familiar with with extension
functions in here okay only only few
people because in lots of languages you
define define it in totally different
way but this gives you some extra
possibilities for instance you can make
extension function two generic type you
can make extension function to nail a
butyl type u dot view and a question
mark and you have extension function to
an allowable type so this is a bit more
powerful than most language the problem
is that I don't think it was released
because there are two good practices
right by JetBrains and by and by Android
and they are all and they are both
pretty new I think like three four
months they both have and I'm not sure
it was included at least in JetBrains I
think I haven't seen that but I know the
community most common have like a
special file in in in package and that
is ending with X X T so in when you make
extension functions to view you most
often do you do view X so yeah this is
this is how I do it okay
you can also make extension properties
since I've already told you properties
are not fields properties are getters
and setters so they are functions so
they can make extension functions for
for objects so extension property for
inflator on context since then on every
context you are just in an infinite
inflator and you have all this long
structure made simpler the same with
visibility instead of hide and show you
can make is visible and set it to true
false you notice that you both can
provide getter
Center so gather is checking if this
view is visible or not
another thing is functional programming
basics of a functional programming when
we have two functions these are two
functions that are very similar they are
having a bit very similar behavior but
it is hard to extract its behavior
because we have operation that differs
them we using functional programming you
can actually extract it very simple so
you just pass this operation as a
function type and you can you can
extract this common code and this is a
general pattern that can be that is very
powerful and can be used in in
higher-level so for instance when we
have some list list of elements using
this kind of functions we can change
from imperative style which just you
know iterates over list and if something
had something we can change it into
expressive declarative style we'll just
say I want to filter these elements just
two elements that starts with some
letter it is very powerful pattern that
is used in lots of languages in general
let's say that we have list of students
we can say that we want to filter just
the students that are passing wants to
filter that the ones that average grade
is above four we want to serve them by
average grade and we want to take and
wants to take ten best among them so
this way we can say we can find best
students to give them some some reward
this is very it kind of looks like
transformation you just say what you
want to achieve and you just have it you
know it's it's much easier way than
explaining every time hi how do you want
to connect it all it is very simple to
implement it using extension functions
and this is exactly this is simplified
code from
in standard library this is map and this
is filter under the hood all it does it
just create does the same as who you
would implement every time thus makes
collection iterates over that and add
some elements to new collection this is
inline function so it is it's called our
replaced with actual code inside so it
is very effective effective this type
function type is never created actually
because it's it's body replaces its
calls so it's very effective way the
same with filter so this is how we have
all our our things or our our methods
for collection processing implemented
and note that it is really powerful that
they are implemented this way excuse me
if you look again at that you see that
it's not it's not collection in here
it's it you're able iterable is
everything you can iterate over so
actually you can make any object make it
iterable it in terrible has only one
method it's an interface and you can use
filter map everything you want on this
object a very simple example strings our
iterables because you can iterate over
letters so you can use map filter at
chatter on string so you can make this
kind of operations also the result of
the fact that these are extension
functions is that there are lots of them
and you can very easily make your own
extension functions so you can you have
a lot of tools for collection processing
and you can very easily add your own so
collection processing in cutting is very
powerful very very expressive and you
can extend it however you want you we
want to make library go ahead you want
to I don't know make your own collection
you can use all of that as long as you
implement iteration interrater so it's
quite cool it also works for string
processing I mean there are also special
functions for string processing like
join to string generates a string from
list this where it is
funny example how you can connect this
with another feature that is that is
arguments default arguments and argument
naming named argument convention so you
can not provide any property at all on
default default default values will be
used but you can change some of these
values like here I change prefix and
postfix so instead of instead of nothing
on the beginning and on the end I have
these brackets
it is also allowing some functions like
transformation so it is it is very nice
thing and also yeah you don't need to
use these names but it's just better
when you use this name suits more
expressed explicitly also sorting really
powerful you can make sort by some
property but you can use some comparator
comparator are made using top-level
functions so compare by surname name you
have you have sorted by surname first
when they are the same by name and
instead of this lambda expression you
can use explicit reference to the method
so it's it's making it even simpler okay
this is basically about syntax of Kotlin
one very cool feature I am involved in
is multi-platform development in Catalan
this is a very new thing actually it was
announced like I don't know three four
months ago it is not yet really mature
but you can already make some
application and I made one quite big
application and developing right now how
does it work the point is that coupling
is not just jvm language Kotlin can be
compared to cotton andreas and since
last months it can be also compiled to
Kotlin native so you can basically make
android application code in JVM which is
compiled to JVM bytecode can make server
in whatever you want including cotton
JVM spring kata or something you can
make your browser application
in cutting-edge is I've done it and you
can make a iOS application in Kotlin
native also among that you can claire
common modules modules that are not
specific to any platform that are
compiled to both that can be compiled
basically to any platform so Copeland
team provided an example of that example
application they made a common module
which is shared among everything come on
Jess come on JVM with platform specific
declarations they made Android web
back-end application and iOS application
all in coupling pure cuddliness so it
was like four months ago and it's
developing very quickly I myself decided
to make a big application to present how
can it work so and I made an
architecture and I described it in
Academy where you can share common parts
that the the most important part in here
is common client because it contains all
business logic for all our specific
clients the point is that when you have
Android iOS these are different at firms
but they supposed to behave the same way
so if you have good architecture like
MVP you can have short presenters and
other elements are just cases and stuff
so when you do it well you can actually
have most of your application the logic
that is that needs to be tested in one
place and and have one test for them and
it is it might be very profitable in in
bigger project to show you an example
how does it work first common module
here we have an example data model class
for common module and thanks to
Surrealism invitation it in there are
servers are generated it is Kotlin
library we can also provide declarations
that are declarations in
modules that supposed to have platform
dependent implementations so we declared
them in common as an expect in and in
this is one of the implementation I
think this is from JVM so in in common
in in platform modules like I've seen
common JVM come on Jas you provide
actual declaration for this expected
declarations so he was a date/time it
was it is implemented differently in
every platform you know every platform
has its own library for that so I want
to have it expect it in common module
and in actual declarations I will
provide actual objects for that and this
is common module example do you need to
stay for that because I see you all look
at that okay I think we can we can move
into into into common client part this
is a present or in common client at the
very simple one to have it clear on our
slides that is used in my application
and this one works for providing
feedback but the point is that it is
used by coming in our web in our web
application which is written in react in
cut in layers in react and it is used in
Android application but it is sure it is
common logic code it just sends feedback
goes back to to news it uses view that
is a an interface so it is typical MVP
and thanks to that architecture I just
have to implement it once I just write
test unit test once and I can reuse it
in all in all the code and this is
example okay and this is this is an
interface for that and this is an
example activity since this is
presentation about Android that uses
this presenter I could show you similar
component for for Catalina Jas our
ambitions are bigger we want to
implement other clients and basically
it's all possible
it's a bit more challenging right now
but it's all possible it just needs some
time for us but we want to make like
Android TV Android car we have already
Google watch we want to make from and
Firefox plug-in if there are already
projects in written in Catalan for for
Firefox plug-in and chrome magic plug-in
it might look for you like a magic but
it is not it is actually pretty simple
and it works good but it is one way we
can we can do it one approach with
platform-specific code but there is
another one since cotton allows Kotlin
native so it is compiled native tied
code every device basically has some
processor so you can write to every
device using Kotlin native you know even
to browser since we have web assembly
which is a system for you know running
native application on your browser I
always assume the simplest Android you
also can can my games are basically
write written native normally you know
they use the libraries for for graphics
the same with with server so when you
have everything negative you can make
one framework which is all cuddly native
and uses native dependent features and
it gives extra possibility so these are
two approaches you can you can do I mean
there are more but the most popular most
promising approaches they are both code
native but they are native in different
terms this one is native from
development point of view this is
exactly we develop applications how it
used to develop them we make Android
applications using Android libraries iOS
applications using iOS libraries browser
applications using react or any other
frameworks and libraries etc etc this is
native in terms of bytecode so it is
native for processor this compiled
native bytecode they are both powerful
of course this one is easier this one is
faster
so I think this one is just now asking
for some good game development library
to make it that is written fully in
cotton from top down so it might be very
powerful thinking long term but in terms
of normal development I think that this
is going to be popular much much faster
that's about multi-platform development
I hope that some of you are interested
in coupling
supposing QR I want to show you how you
can start your adventure with coupling
so the easiest start is to go into code
linear Apple try cut in line at org you
have some cones over there you have some
examples you can just play with this
language also if you are more ambitious
there are lots of ideas that that
support Scotland Android studio since
free Xero has it built in I think also
in IntelliJ IDEA sea lion is for Kotlin
native Eclipse also support since the
beginning support Scotland so when you
can just use just some one of them and
it's very simple to start coupling on
basically every one of them when you
choose Android studio since we are on
presentation about Android development
since free 0 unit need you need just too
thick include coupling support and you
will have everything in Catalan you know
all this well the templates basically
everything cutting is also very simple
in terms of interoperability you can
basically change one file in your
project into cotton from Java and it
will work fine I've tested it like
multiple times you can have mixed Java
coding projects I know that JetBrains
intentionally keep some projects mix
Scotland Java to be aware how do they
work together always
even after lots of changes also when you
switch into Catalan IDE supports you
very well there is called and Java to
Cortland converter it changes your code
when you copy
Java into Catalan when you can just
click convert to Kathleen and everything
is converted it it works really well
I've converted a lot of projects into
cutting believe me and also an IDE
support Scotland style so when you have
imperative structure you're just having
suggestion to change it into functional
style so it's it's also very cool about
resources if you want to learn more
about it
we have copy and have a lot of resources
there are talks there is forum slack is
very very active it's one of the best
communities I've ever seen so if you if
you are interested in you like
communities join Kathleen slack is
really cool
we have also active reddit talking
Kotlin and then other resources I think
the greatest resources for learning
easily is if you like Android coupling
on Android to commemorate the
commendation if you more interested in
cutting cut in documentation is really
great if you like puzzles and challenges
cut Lincoln's are also really nice I cry
it was one of the first thing I do in
coupling coupling cons I mean I solved
them if your Android developer you want
to me great to cut lean Android
development in Catalan rookies it's also
a good start and also we provide
possibility some uncut lean Academy the
most popular product right now it is our
quick call it blog but it's actually
medium because we have multiple authors
right now and lots of resources about
coupling and lots of news from Kathleen
world we also explore a multi-platform
development very deeply so if you are
interested in these parts of Catalan we
have a lot of articles about that we
also have other services like we give
consultations we give trainings if you
if you're interested contact cotton
academy.com
and today I've introduced
never in here don't worry about it I
will just skip it if you are interested
I've just introduced brand new feature
I've done it today in 1 a.m. in the
night
so after speakers party I've released
that so it's a new thing I felt that I'm
missing like news and puzzles for for
for Kotlin you know they are they are
everywhere in use and puzzles on Twitter
and summer but you need to search from
them and spend your time and I prefer
like a short place when I can see very
short but important news from this world
so I decided I will just implement it
again very easier to our portal so I've
started in the Friday I finished it
today in the morning in the night and
right now we can add to cut in academic
portal you can add news is you can add
puzzles this is an example news and this
is about cutting documentation is quite
new so I've added it as a first news but
we are going to keep the brand new news
from cutting word on our cut in Academy
and also we want to provide at least few
puzzlers like quizzes like challenges
for programmers every every week so I
hope I think it is going to live well ok
that's it from for me for for from for
today thank you for your attention we
were very great audience</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
