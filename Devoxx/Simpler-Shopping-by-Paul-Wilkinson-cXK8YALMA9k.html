make sure thank you all for coming
I'm sure you're all eating your lunch no
maturity dribs and drabs of people
coming in as we go - Paul I look after
technology research and open innovation
at Tesco labs Tesco labs where you've
hopefully all heard of Tesco we're one
of the biggest retailers in the world
half a million people 7,000 stores that
sort of thing
we were also pretty much the inventors
of getting your groceries delivered
online and we have a 50% market share of
that in the UK and what I'm really going
to rip through today at some speed is
some of the different experiments we've
been doing recently to look at using IOT
to help people shop so it's using as
people get more and more connected
things in their houses and their
kitchens in particular what we're
looking at is experimenting with that to
try and make their lives easier really
by taking a lot of the effort out of
having to do the grocery shopping will
touch on various things in different
topics and that's more or less so what
I'm going to cover in the next 15
minutes I just wanted to start with this
really this is kind of a picture of the
ecosystem I'm going to go back to
ecosystems at the end but really we've
got the customer at the centre of this
and then all around the customer you've
got all these things in their lives that
are starting to be more and more
connected we've got over to the stores
that delivery vans of products we've got
people's Health's and you know the
monitoring that people are doing these
days the quantified self stuff you've
got the thermostats and the things in
the home
you got this fridge there as well
because the smart fridge is almost been
like this poster child of IOT
but everyone says oh the smart fridge
that's going to be the bit that's going
to be really clever it's going to order
all my things and so far even if you
drop 4000 pounds on a fridge from
Samsung it's not smart at all it's
basically taking a tablet and stick on
the front of a fridge that it's not very
clever it's not very smart
it obviously got phones people check
them you know between 90 and 300 times a
day so we're kind of into that and then
we've got cars as well although it's
probably a bit further away before your
groceries maybe go and get collected by
your car by itself but it's a sort of
thing that might impact our business in
a pretty big way so we sort of started
off with the simplest bit really with
buttons and you might always see in the
Amazon - button and a couple of other
examples but my favourite example in
this space is the Domino's button so 80%
of Domino's orders are the same as last
time so you just push this button and a
pizza
is that ultimate in one-click shopping
yeah you push that and what half an hour
an hour later your regular pizza arrives
you've paid for it you've tracked it all
that sort of stuff so we actually went
ahead and tested buttons and that I've
got one because we thought it was
interesting we thought that people might
want to use buttons to do their shopping
so we had some made Tesco logo on it
we actually that customers change the
products that they wanted to associate
with this button actually by email
because we couldn't be bothered to write
an integration at that point so they
could have one product or many products
and when they pushed it there we go the
light flashes red in a minute it's going
to beep again because it's failed but
because it's not on the Wi-Fi here this
connects to your Wi-Fi and it puts
products in your basket so we sent these
out to a lot of customers everybody push
them in the first week like I'll call a
button I'll push that yeah after the
first week anyone want to guess how many
people push the button 5% you're not far
off
it wasn't many right we'll just leave it
at that there we go it's not works which
is good because then it's not gonna have
anything extra in my shopping basket the
end of the day which does happen I once
got a whole crate of milk delivered and
three crates of apples actually all
those part of experiments that I hadn't
necessarily noticed and that were
happening in my life
so we did the button thing and we we're
not sure about buttons partly because
nobody used them and partly because this
is only half of the buttons you can now
buy from Amazon and there's no 300
brands now on the Amazon - button store
and you're not going to have that many
in your house you know our customer
research said you might have two or
three you're certainly not going to have
this many and actually our research show
that no one wanted to push them some
Amazon products are shifting through
buttons now some brands are seeing a lot
of volume 3 buttons but still half the
buttons that get sent out don't get
pushed and it was a Forbes article just
before Christmas with some stats about
that a lot of these buttons are going
unpunched Amazon don't care because they
make profit when they sell the button
the brand pays for it
it's a really interesting ecosystem but
it's there and that's the important bit
about the ecosystem I'm going to jump on
to barcode scanners now so again Amazon
you might have seen with the - actually
launched before the button especially a
stick that's a barcode scanner this one
is actually from
French supermarket carful actually the
French really have taken to these little
barcode scanners it's like a fridge
magnet there's one thing it scans a
barcode puts that thing in your basket
Carrefour into marche and casino and
france of all tested or rolled out
barcode scanners like this and again
we've also tested these and you probably
see something from our set later this
year with a better look and but
customers love this stuff like you just
push it it goes straight in your basket
anyone can use it in the house just say
it's one scan a lot of customers putting
it near the fridge or near the bin so I
had something runs out you just scan the
barcode go straight in your basket and
that was a really big success and
probably see something along those lines
from us later in the year but what I
really want to move on to was of rules
and ecosystems and one of the things
that we launched I think about a year
ago now is if this then that and if you
heard of if this and that if ifttt.com
I'm going to call it ifs because it's a
lot faster to say and so it allows you
to connect all of the different online
services you have together it started
off in a world where really it was you
know if you change your facebook profile
picture change it on Twitter at the same
time and a lot a lot of social media
used for it still but more and more
different brands of time to experiment
with it and so we so this shows you a
snapshot of some of the rules that you
can set up with Tesco we were the first
retailer in the world to let you buy
stuff using rules on if this then that
and there's some examples here some
other ones that are quite like but the
most popular to begin with was
automatically add a product to your
Tesco online shopping when the price
drops so we just monitor the price with
why was there trigger and then the
action is put that product in your
basket
so quite straightforward very popular
and we've also got things like you know
with just a tap put Donuts in your
basket there's quite a lot of wine and
champagne ones on there too that people
have done if there's a birthday in your
calendar make sure you've got champagne
so I walked by more champagne that sort
of thing you can do things like if you
hit your Fitbit target buy a cake you
know reward yourself
undo all that really good work you can
do very basic time-based subscriptions
like add milk on Thursdays so that's
quite a quick way of you know just
making sure you've always got some milk
but not a very smart one and what was
really interesting with it is a couple
of things as well
the first one is on the ecosystem front
there are now six different washing
machine manufacturers that have
integrated with EFT six different ones
that holds more than half of the market
between them and ok at the moment you
can only get a connected washing machine
if you buy a really expensive one you
know has a Wi-Fi module in it but we
know from the white goods manufacturer
is that they're all going to start being
connected over the next couple years and
then if you've got really long term in
about 20 years time once everybody's
current washing machines have broken and
being replaced
actually most washing machines will
probably be connected to the Internet or
certainly have the capability to be
connected and that's really interesting
for us because if your washing machine
is connected we know when the cycle is
finished then we know how much powder
you've used or how many tablets or
liquid tabs or whatever it is you've
used if you look at some of our
dishwasher as well it's exactly the same
dishwasher has a much more one-to-one
relationship though so my dishwasher has
been ordering its own tablets now for
about a year and a half through this
sort of mechanism where you know every
time it goes on we have a holder number
in stock that says this is how many
tablets are in my cupboard and then
every time the dishwasher switches on it
turns that down by one when it gets to a
threshold was about five which is the
average weekly usage we put it in a
basket so I'm at the point now where I
completely trust that it's only missed
about two over the entire course of that
year and a half and I just see
dishwashers tablets my basket and I know
that it's right I don't actually think
about ordering that so what we think a
lot of the potential in the connected
home is to enable people to well to do
that automatically to not have to worry
about it to make sure you never run out
of dishwasher tablets there's always
more automatically delivered as and when
you need there's other interesting
things in this sort of space too in
terms of things like electricity
monitoring so my dishwasher isn't
actually smart I have a lot of smart
stuff in my house that sort of guy but
the dishwasher isn't actually a Wi-Fi
one I've got an electricity monitor it's
a bit like a smart meter on steroids
and actually using the sort of signal
disaggregation on that pattern you can
tell which appliances in your house have
switched on and off at any given point
for most things over about 100 watts
I think the dishwasher is included so
from a single sensor that's in the
cupboard under the stairs I can actually
see when most the appliances in my house
have switched on and off and I can use
that there
to reorder stock capacity all through
platforms and ecosystems a bit like gift
as well
the final thing just to mention here is
actually we're the only supermarket that
currently has an API and if you've got a
dead fold at Tesco labs calm you can
sign up and you'll get approved within a
day to actually get information about
the products we sell that where our
stores are and we've got a lot more
planned to the API as well in terms of
actually letting people add stuff to the
basket may be launching affiliate
schemes and that sort of thing on the
back of it so we're really keen to drive
a large developer community and we've
already got about 1,200 people using
those API eyes as well so a lot of
interesting stuff there right pretty
much finally I might talk a bit about
voice so we've seen voice impact
shopping quite a lot and actually
earlier this week we launched an
application again kind of through it
it's a bit of a workaround at the moment
so that you can do your grocery shopping
on Google home
so I'm just gonna show you the video
then I'll talk about a little bit
hopefully this will have some sound
and
hey Google and eggs to my tester basket
I'll add eggs to your Tesco basket
hey Google get more hand wash it's on
its way
you
hey Google add AAA batteries to my
online shopping sure thing
integrate your chest go online grocery
shop with Google home through is TTP
comm there we go so you can see that was
some completely live that absolutely
works if you have a Google home you can
connect it to it today and audio
shopping it does a couple of things that
we've never actually released before as
well
if you really personalizes research so
if you say a milk it will actually first
of all looking your usuals which are all
the items that you buy know pretty much
weekly or regularly certainly if it
can't find anything they're they're not
looking at favorites which is kind of
all the things you've ever bought in the
last year and a half and then after that
it'll just go to the default search
results which are based on popularity of
product so if I search for milk I don't
get the default I get four pints of full
cream milk which is what my daughter
drinks and pretty reliably if you say a
common phrase like milk or bread or
something that it will stick the right
one in your basket the one that you
normally buy so that's quite exciting
the first is the most personalized
search we've ever done and it's fairly
basic but it works really nicely the
second thing it does is in the past if
you wanted to amend an order so a lot of
customers booked a slot and then they'll
change the order up until the day before
if you want to amend it you had to go in
the app you had to present you have to
search for all the different things then
you have to save this changes actually
this will just have a look in your
basket see if there's anything in the if
you've already gotten order books if you
do it will amend that order and save the
changes send you an email to remind you
and then if you haven't gone order
booked already it will just put it in
your basket for next time so a couple of
little tweaks to this actually which
make it almost better than the website
so it's quite a successful afternoon of
coding for Jamie who built this over the
Easter holidays yeah so voice we think
is going to have a massive impact on the
home and actually we've already got
quite a lot of users of that considering
that probably aren't that many Google
home devices out there in the UK yet so
that's really interesting to write think
that's basically my time not really get
your wave or anything so any questions
quite a few lines or a couple of
questions
gone
yeah
yes oh we don't currently offer a public
API to let you put stuff in customers
baskets but that is absolutely the top
of our list for development in that team
yeah we're planning to make a completely
public absolutely so in the next couple
of months watch this space it's
currently our top priority and we will
be adding all that sort of functionality
to the the API as soon as we possibly
can the best way to find out about it is
to sign up to the existing API portal
and then we always alert users there
first of new functionality in the
question somewhere
yeah well I guess the way that most
people shop today is you have to
basically go online or on the app to
actually the checkout and you can do
that up until midnight a day before your
shopping comes and actually most
customers do go on and check at that
point so you can you have a quick scroll
through and you can see that nothing
ridiculous has happened well now we've
seen in the US Google have launched the
ability to tell who is using Google home
so I think that problem will be solved
quite quickly it'll just be only these
people are authorized to do it oh that's
it oh okay call anyone any questions in
it's inevitable I think yeah we try and
do a lot of the things we do first we
were the first ones in a lot of
scenarios with the first ones to do a
mobile app it was the first one to do
online shopping there 21 years ago the
Tesco online supermarket launched so I
think it's 1984 when mrs. snowball made
an order through Ceefax on a TV in
Gateshead
and that was like the first ever remote
grocery shop so hopefully we can keep on
doing so so these sorts of things it's
inevitable that everyone else will do it
too I think let it set trend Oh anywhere
else great thanks for listening
