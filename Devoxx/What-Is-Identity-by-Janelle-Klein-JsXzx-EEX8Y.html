have a very interesting Kino coming up
so this weekend I was finally starting
to think about the conference because it
was about time that I did and I said
okay so what's the keynote on the first
day well it's something about identity
so the first thought in my mind was
there are sponsors there are big
sponsors for conferences like this
because it's really difficult to put
them on especially in venues like this
without sponsors you actually need money
for the infrastructure to do this stuff
for you so I thought well it's obviously
a talk on authentication by one of the
big companies that put forward
sponsorship money and then I read the
description of the talk it is not that
at all this is the talk on identity that
is not what you would expect when people
use that term at technology conferences
so I want you to come to the stage now
climb who is going to tell you about a
completely different aspect of identity
that which are insightful huh love that
what is identity so this talk was
inspired by a conversation I had last
November with one of the most incredible
people I've ever met in my life Jason
Huggins and we were at dinner in London
which was awesome in itself and I've
just never seen someone get so fired up
and excited about robots and when he
talked about his dreams of these
collaborative robotic art projects and
how we can take all this collaborative
software stuff and bring it into the 3d
space and do these amazing projects
together it's like the coolest thing
ever and he just lit up like a little
kid at Christmas it was beautiful and
then he said something that I haven't
stopped thinking about sense but art has
no utility and I watched his heart I'm a
sink is he started talking about all
these rational things he was going to do
to make money other the things that
other than the thing that was obviously
his heart to do and I spent the rest of
the evening arguing with him about why
he needed to pursue his dreams and then
the next morning he sent me a text and
he was like I forgot to ask why purple
which is obviously a commentary on my
identity right and I was still upset
about the night before so I was thinking
about how do I answer this question in a
way that shows why I'm right and he's
wrong and so I started working on this
effort of purple as code you know here's
me and my identity and my little sparkly
self in the middle and when I have my
consciousness asked me what should i do
and i have all these emotions that shine
out of me my dreams and my fears I
picked the purple one an identity is the
operating system of the self and as I
started working on this identity
material it started kind of colliding in
metaphors with all this research I've
been doing on idea flow and pain and
development and if I put all these
models together I ended up with an
explicit theory of consciousness which
is what we're going to be talking about
today so this is the dreamer operating
system and identity you can think of as
the memory model in the middle and
you've got ideas flowing into your brain
and a vector with dreams that you're
trying to achieve a pain signal an
awesome signal and a feedback loop for
making better decisions and our goal in
one case is to move toward dreams or
we've got this other variation where
we've got kind of this cheap loop when
we move away from nightmares but there's
not really a whole lot of movement going
on we more so just create a little
bubble world in our mind so a lot of
this material comes from personal
experience that I so I'm going to share
my story with you on where I came up
with a lot of these ideas so when I was
growing up my mom always told me to find
your passion and follow it wherever at
least and don't let anyone ever take
that away from you and so when I grew up
I was really into music played guitar
and
saying in wrote music for my high school
choir in orchestra and so when I went to
college I went to school to be a
songwriter that was my dream and then
when I got in school though I kind of
got a reality check of what a career in
music would actually be like and I was
like I don't know if I want to do this
and I was kind of feeling a little lost
and my boyfriend of the time trying to
cheer me up he's like let's take a class
together if I would be fun and he starts
looking through the catalog and he's
like Oh x86 assembly let's do that one
now you gotta keep in mind that my only
experience with computers at this point
was playing kings quest ok so here I am
in this assembly programming class and I
you know flipping through the book and
realizing oh this is kind of like
programming my ti-85 in math class I've
got some basic instructions I could do
this and that weekend I read for the
entire assembly book and that I found in
front and I realized I could change the
screen to graphics mode and I could make
the PC speaker beep and I started making
all the game break out completely an
assembly with little colored blocks a
little ball that bounced around and made
the PC speaker beeps and I showed my
teacher what I was working on and he's
like uh why don't you just show me what
you're doing and you get a day like I
like this class this is awesome but
that's gonna hit me you know i had to
work on something but i could work on
anything i wanted to i could create
anything that I could dream I mean how
amazing is that that we can take our
ideas and bring them to life in our
tools and the friend of mine I think
said this perfectly of software
development is the closest thing in this
world to magic and if you think about it
it's true we are the magician's of the
world so I was really fired up about all
this software stuff but then my life
took a bit of a turn and I kind of went
into this downward spiral and at 18 I
decided to get married not the smartest
thing to do when you're 18 and my
husband
it was an abused child and he was deeply
afraid all the time that you know
somebody was going to find out about
this crazy world that we lived in and so
we started isolating me from everyone I
loved and I just got sucked into this
crazy world of Lies and shame and it was
a really dark time in my life and then
one day he said if you go to school I
will leave you and here i was you know
in this dream world own was gone just
you know on the edge and wondering what
I'm going to do just feeling miserable
with all this fear and depression and
not knowing what to do and in that
moment I kind of screamed in word up
myself Who am I and I heard this voice
inside me that said I am an engineer and
I felt its love in my heart for all
these things that I wanted to do in my
life you know for software in my dreams
and all these things that I wanted to
create and there was no other option but
to choose the thing that I loved and so
I turned to my husband and said I'm
going to school and screw you for trying
to stand in my way and in that moment
you know all this baggage that I've been
holding on for years its kind of melted
away and I made a commitment in my life
to always live my dream and so you know
this is one of those experiences that
fundamentally changes your life this was
15 years ago but I very much still live
by this today so what I want to focus on
though is how our crazy brains actually
work that makes all this stuff happen
because it's something that we all need
to understand because we are people and
we have to work and have intimate
relationships with other people in our
jobs so three of our operating system
how do ideas get inside of our head so
this is kind of a sensory input system
and we're going to talk about the
sensory to cement it kind of a MapReduce
function you can imagine it as so this
is a synthesis based on the research in
on intelligence by Jeff Hawking's
metaphors we live by by George Blake
often Mark Johnson so think of a concept
as a metaphorical shape so imagine that
your brain is a shake toy with a face
and when you look out into the world you
see all these different shapes right and
when you're looking at these shapes you
ask do I know this pattern and if you
recognize the pattern you take the shape
and kind of shove it into your shape toy
brain but if all the things you see out
there you don't recognize you don't see
anything no shapes basically equals no
recognition so for example let's say a
friend asks us what is closure and
you've got this concept of closure in
your head that you're trying to
communicate your friends so you take
this message and put it on the wire to
communicate it over to your friends but
your friend only hears gibberish so the
way this works recognition is a
bottom-up process you imagine you've got
these sensory signals on the bottom
layers of your brain in these summary
summary summarize and get this concept
of closure but same thing happens with
recognition failure that's a summary
summary sunrise but because we don't get
into any resolution you get confusion so
because of how our brain works this way
new shapes are always defined relative
to old shape so if you want to explain
closure to your friends and your friend
understands Lisp which is a functional
language and understands groovy which is
a jvm language you can kind of put those
two concepts together and go okay I've
gotten that new foundational idea of
what closure is now so the key thing to
remember here is kind of this derived
knowledge principle is that everything
we understand is in terms of other
things we already understand with the
exception of that sensory to semantic
mapreduce everything else is at it is
everything is a metaphor alright moving
on how do ideas turn us into who we are
so this is the outer layer of identity
or what I think of as tribal identity so
we've got three different types of
contents we've got same patterns
relationship patterns
process pattern you can think of these
as different shapes that you shove into
your shape toy brain and base classes
for seeing patterns we've got a physical
object and I a personal reference to our
self based classes for relationship
patterns we have containers so like in
group and out groupement and he put
things and containers together and you
get a foundational model for identity so
here we have a human identity and an
object identity and the fundamental
difference between a human identity and
object identity has nothing to do with
whether it's actually a human or an
object so for example class cat extends
I and class chicken extends object and
in one case we have empathy and then the
other case we short-circuit embassy and
this is why we can eat a chicken but not
a cat and then Direction metaphors give
us things like rake so we can rank
people we can rank objects and we can
rank categories and humans love to rank
things we've got the 30 healthiest foods
of all time top 10 restaurants or who
has the highest dps in Warcraft so the
important thing to remember here is our
brain is a sense making engine we can't
turn this off like all these different
ideas that come into our mind we're
categorizing all these things in terms
of shapes and directions and containers
and that's how we make sense of it in
our brain and this has some really
fascinating effects when we start
looking at human behavior pattern so
collectivism which you hear a lot more
about these days is basically thinking
in category so we've got two things in
the in group we look for similarities
between those things and we've got
something in the in group and in the out
group we look for differences and this
has some really interesting effects so
for example we're pre wired to model the
in group with the similarity seeking
behavior so in this case you extend
survive you're like me than I belong in
your group and so for example here's my
team and on my team we write you a test
and we pair program and I ask you do you
do these things and what do you say yes
right we know what the right answer this
it's just wired into our brain that if
we want to be part of that group that we
do the things like the group does we
model that behavior and the flip side
also happens so we're pretty wired to
objectify the out group with different
seeking pushing them away far away from
ourselves as we can so in this case you
extends from object you're nothing like
me so for example developers and testers
testers extends from objects testers are
a tool for us to use and often we've got
this superiority complexes Lincoln we're
better than testers to write or another
example smart people idiots idiots
extend from objects idiots are a tool
for us use right or how about managers
and employees employees extend from
objects employees our tool for refuse
now same principle here but now we're on
the other side of the wall and it's not
quite so funny anymore because nobody
likes to be treated like an object so
the point I'm trying to make here is
that whenever I decide someone is not
like me I short-circuit empathy and this
is why we act like assholes so brain tag
number one how do you stop being an
asshole and the trick here you rewire
your brain for empathy so here for
example I've met with this person and I
have all these feelings of disgust maybe
they're our tester and they support a
political candidate I don't like ah so
here's how you rewire your brain ready
this is the answer for world peace step
1 stop and think is this a person or an
object steps to choose person
and what happens here we shift into this
similarity seeking mode and these
feelings of disgust sort of
transformative feelings of pity which is
not necessarily great but it's a better
place to start a relationship right so
we're also pre wired to extend identity
to offspring so this is me this is my
baby my baby always extends I my baby is
a part of me and we're also pre wired to
extend identity to soulcraft this is me
this is my code my code also extends
from I and so we run into a problem here
because if somebody tells us our code
sucks it hurts right so brain hack
number two how do you stop feeling
defensive you can use the same kind of
trick and rewire your brain to disable
empathy so here I am and somebody just
told me my code sucks and here's what
I'm going to do step 1 stop and think is
my code a person or an object steps to
choose object and you know just sitting
there going I am NOT my code I am on my
code over and over again you can start
to disable that feeling of empathy for
your code and start shutting down those
feelings but the problem is it's unlike
the other example we can only kind of
temporarily sort of fool ourselves of
this trick and those feelings keep
coming back and that this is basically a
lie that we tell ourselves I don't
actually love my baby it's not really
true but you kind of turn them turn your
feelings off temporarily so you can have
an objective discussion about your code
but this is something we're just we're
just wired to love on our code and
that's just you know something that we
should think of more of a design
constraint all right let's get into
feelings where does gut feel come from
this is where we get into the sealing
machine so the way I think of this is
you can take your orbital frontal cortex
and limbic system and think of it like a
summarized body responds where you get
this pain signal or an awesome signal or
all these various colors of it all right
we don't normally think of feelings
that's coming from
the body but it's basically how it works
so if I ask a simple question do I want
fruit or salad and I got to make a
decision so what do i do I think fruit
and stimulate the body experience and
then I get the signal back of us not so
much not feeling like fruit today same
thing think salad simulate the body
experience fairly awesome feeling like
some green pink today and this basic
mechanic we use for making decisions all
the time for these gut feel instincts
and we do the same thing when we
encounter people do I like Sally think
about Sally simulate the body experience
mm like Sally a lot apparently do I like
George same thing simulate the Bonnie
experience not feeling so much and this
is why you get feelings like discuss
which is you know associated with rotten
food associated with people if these are
actually feelings that are coming from
our body now it's for complex decisions
it works a little bit different so if I
imagine in the moment I'm making a
decision I can think of my decision like
a function I've got some inputs to my
decision I've got some logical
evaluation in an output and in those
moments I'm making that decision i can
imagine all these different feelings of
these that go with these different
options so like for example should i
write a test maybe sounds like a good
idea skip the test probably not delete
all the code that always sounds like a
good plan right but where are these
feelings actually come from and this is
where we get into the base classes for
process patterns you can think about
this journey as having a beginning and
an end and we're hopping over obstacles
and we've got this rollercoaster of
human experience that were expressing
through these stories so for example
what are the challenges on the journey
and I can imagine constraints or walls
that I run into I might have feelings of
frustration or i can imagine friction
like mud I have to trudge through that
might have feelings of pain or i can
have strategy this path that I go around
the mud and have feelings of victory and
so you can think about the journey is
being constructed of these chainable
parts of situations
strategy and consequence so for example
let's say I brought down production
after this unfortunate chain of events
this sucks right that's no fun so how do
I avoid the pain next time so what do we
do when we start doing what if analysis
and thinking about alternative paths
that we could have run right what if I
had reviewed they could fix what if I
had written a better test you start
thinking about all the things that you
could have done instead and then where
you're happy in that hypothetical world
of the things that you could have done
differently you're like all right I'll
be better next time because I've got all
these hypothetical alternative but how
do we actually do better next time and
basically what happens these alternative
hypothetical scenarios get wired
together into this prediction machine so
you can think about if I see this
situation that is similar to the one in
the past it's going to recall the sense
of all the pain that I happen for my
past experiences and through the simple
heuristic of minimize pain and maximize
awesome I have intuition about a
strategy that ends up coming to mind and
the gut feel basically arises through
this basic mechanic of pattern
reinforcement all right and then this is
where things start getting interesting
what is cognitive dissonance so this is
this moment we get a pattern that comes
in that we don't recognize more like
what should I do and we get into this
learning loop behavior where we have to
make adjustments so this is based on the
research of Thinking Fast and Slow by
Daniel Kahneman so our brain you can
think of is constantly making
predictions so I've got all these
patterns that I've recognized in the
recent past and then in any given moment
I make a prediction about what I expect
to see next and the key here to remember
is that we only update our brain code
when predictions fails so for example
imagine you're walking down the stairs
you're just thinking about something
else everything's just fine at this
point all your predictions are confirmed
trains is going through that loop and
then suddenly one of the steps isn't
quite where it's supposed to be and in
this moment your predictions
are violated and what happens in our
brain is this runtime exception of fact
where we're like sub PS that would be
supposed to happen which alerts our
consciousness to come in and do some
analysis on the scenario and figure out
what to do and I say this as this dub TF
event because it's the same thing that
happens when we code when we run into
something unexpected the same pattern
fires in our brain and what happens as
we go into this troubleshooting process
where our consciousness gets alerted and
asked you know what should I do that
fires up all this extra machinery where
we're going to search all these long
distance neural connections where you
can think of indexes into all those
metaphors and then we analyze what do I
see why is it happening and how did I
solve these problems in the past and
then when we integrate this historical
information into the current context we
get insight or what we think of as know
how some strategy that we're going to
apply then we apply motor energy to
doing these things and then at the end
there's this thing of dopamine which
says basically we're done and at that
point we've got these two conflicting
models from the distance that sort of
collapsed into one we have this
experience of synchronicity which is
associated with release and then the
dopamine signal basically means remember
this which is basically our brains
automation mechanism so back what we had
before we had this recognition bottom-up
process then something wasn't recognized
we get this alert process where we have
to troubleshoot the problem and that you
know brings up that cognitive dissonance
in our mind and then when we respond to
the particular solution to the problem
and then we get that ding of dopamine
what happens is all those active
networks that were you know lit up in
our brain in that moment get wired
together and this is how we end up with
autopilot mode or continuous decision
automation you can think of all of that
gets baked into our subconscious so you
can think of consciousness as this kind
of on demand service so we've got this
automated thinking that has all these
feelings that come out of our brain and
then we've got this signaling mechanism
that triggers effort from thinking
that's kind of summon on demand system
that is really really expensive and so
we only want to use that when we
absolutely have to you know try and low
on run on low brain power what happens
if you have lots of demand for effortful
thinking you have this happen right this
is common problem we have in the
software development world we need lots
of sugar to sustain all that trouble
shooting we have to do all day alright
so what is self-deception this this
cheat loop in this dream world where
we're trying to move away from
nightmares yet don't do so very
successfully so this is a synthesis of
the research in leadership and self
deception and rewire your brain and i
love that these books like don't go
together it all looks like psychology
and brains and we just merge them and
cool stuff comes out so social rejection
is also a violated predictions so you
can think of my identity predicted I
should be included in this group and the
group said no dub TF that wasn't
supposed to happen right so the same
response of our brain happens we you
know have this pain associated with this
experience and then our consciousness
comes in to troubleshoot identity
because clearly our identity is broken
how do we troubleshoot identity well
here's me and here's this group that I
was expecting to be a part of it said no
that I couldn't be part of the group and
so the first thing I'm going to do is
think of all the reasons why I didn't
actually want to be in that group and
think about all these differences and
how I didn't want to do that and turn
that in group into an out-group Matthews
feelings of pain the feelings of disgust
but usually in order to do that I also
got to come up with a pack of lies to
tell myself so then our friend comes
along and is like dude what are you
talking about well how do we fix this
it's because it's bringing up all these
painful memories now that we had in the
past well maybe our friend isn't
actually our friend and say we're just
not being very nice and we think about
all the things that they did in the past
and why they're not our friend so we can
turn them into an out group and shut
those feelings
so self-deception you can kind of
sleeping as a coping mechanisms that
stops the pain immediately and so we can
rely on these you no easy solutions to
solve these problems of experiencing
pain so what happens when we try to be
what everyone else wants us to be
because you know being rejected is no
fun and so one of the alternative to
that is to move for is this acceptance
seeking behavior and which is largely
driven by fear because who wants to be
rejected and so what happens is this
fragmentation effect which is kind of
the other side so here we are in this
moment of dissonance we're trying to
resolve what should I do you can think
of we've got our authentic choice or
heart's desire what we actually want to
do and then we've got these feelings of
fears that are driving us into a
different direction and as we deviate
from our authentic choice we have to
rationalize the reasoning for our
decisions come up with you know all
these reasons for stuff and we create
this kind of memory barrier so we can
block off the stuff that doesn't
actually make sense and this is how we
end up creating this dream world so that
we can feel better about it but the
problem is is this memory barrier kind
of deteriorates over time and now we've
got this cognitive dissonance that's an
eternal from you know the self-deception
and then our sensory memory kind of on
the inside and all this anxiety comes up
from you know this internal distance so
how do we solve that well this is where
dopamine comes in we find some way to
distract ourselves which kind of works
like a drug and what it does is it
reinforces those walls to make those
feelings go away and then we end up with
a reinforced dreamworld so the problem
with this pattern is all that sensory
memory is also associated with our
internal self and so if we keep doing
this distraction mechanism over and over
with dopamine we end up falling into the
state of deep loneliness where we end up
getting depressed because we essentially
cut ourselves off from the world so
brain hacks number three how do we
escape this is where we get into
identity to point oh so I mentioned this
experience that I had 15 years ago and I
went through a major transformation at
this point and what I realized is I was
thinking about this is I am the guardian
of my light I am responsible for
protecting and defending that little
sparkle inside myself if I let that
little sparkle get snuffed out there's
not too much to go from there so you can
think of identity one point O as i am
the sum of my past or the data is me
versus identity two point oh I am the
one who chooses in the moment or
consciousness is me so the way I think
of consciousness is as a pressure system
that's always moving from the state of
distance to the state of synchronicity
and it always goes in that direction
there's no option there that energy will
move the only real option or question is
what type of energy is going to drive us
to some kind of closure and so if I
think about consciousness as the
director of focus basically I've got to
neural networks that I could potentially
light up and this is me the one who's
making this choice is which direction am
I going to go the only other option we
have here is self-awareness which is
kind of focusing on yourself and you can
think of this as sort of leveling up
your crystal and getting XP that gives
you more increased executive function to
be able to make these kind of decisions
so the way I started thinking about my
identity is myself being this crystal so
you can think of your eternal self and
the way I wanted to kind of try and
define a concept that I could wrap
myself around as this identity I started
asking what are the choices I can make
every day that define who I am as a
person what are the choices I can make
every day that define who I am
as a person and what I came up with is
54 principles that I call the clear
mindset courage leadership empathy
authenticity and respect so the way I
think of this is identity 2 point 0 is a
principle of continuous choice so
courage isn't the absence of fear it's
the decision to do it anyway despite
fear leadership is the decision to carry
the torch to commit to the journey
however long the journey takes empathy
is the decision to be patient in
understanding each other in patient and
understanding ourselves authenticity
isn't the lack of a filter like a lot of
people seem to think authenticity is the
lack of self-deception it's the decision
to seek truth and respect is the
decision to see other people as humans
with thoughts and feelings similar to
our own rather than objects to
manipulate for our own game essentially
the no asshole rule and so the way I
started thinking about shining my light
as this is me and I've got my past
lessons learned and once these patterns
are braked into my brain they basically
become part of your body you can kind of
think of it as a database and then
here's my vector of dreams that I'm on
that I'm trying to achieve and here's me
and getting XP and leveling up my
crystal and I'm kind of writing on the
front of the boat choosing in the moment
and what I've learned is that
essentially momentum on this journey
ends up resulting in joy in the moment
and so because of that my first
principle in life became optimizing for
joy and to treat purple whether it's my
purple or someone else was purple as a
design constraint the problem is this is
actually pretty tough to do in practice
you know it's easy to say simple
principle but really hard to live by and
so what I started doing was wearing
purple on the outside is a way to remind
myself on the inside of who I am and
what
I stand for and what I believe in so in
those times when I get scared and go
crawl back inside my shell when I come
out again I can be like okay this is the
decision that I need to make and I need
to live by my authentic self and the
reason I was so upset with Jason is that
when you find your passion you know that
that thing that just makes you light up
like a happy little kid it's it's
beautiful and it's once you find that
you know it's it's not only about you
anymore you bring that joy to everyone
around you every life you touch and if
you give up your dream it's not only you
losing out everyone else that would
benefit from your awesomeness in sup
missing out too I what's thinking about
this comment about you know aren't
having no utility and art actually have
one of the greatest utilities in the
world so let's talk about the utility of
art so here I'm in the state of deep
loneliness and having lots of challenges
in life and one of the things you find
about joy is it's the one thing that's
able to penetrate for all this and make
a steel that radiates radiance on the
inside that's when we glow it breaks
down these walls and then as opposed to
deep loneliness we start feeling the
sense of human connection and that's the
awesomeness thing about joy and what
greater utility is there than healing
people part you know but the problem is
we define our definitions of utility
based around money in this business
machine right in the business machines
and our concepts of about money are
totally out of alignment with what
actually feeds our souls as human beings
in the business machine people are
objects where the reality is
we're more like a family now you're
never going to think about your coworker
to the same way again after this huh and
so what happens we have this massively
dysfunctional relationship in our
organizations that kind of looks like
this where on one side is all about pain
on the other side is all about money and
we drive our projects into the ground
over and over again this is
heartbreaking experience and if you zoom
out a little bit we see the same pattern
you know it's larger and larger scales
we're on one case it's all about money
the only other case it's all about pain
and we just can't seem to talk to each
other so what if we started optimizing
all these organizational structures
around this purple round this principle
treating purple as a design constraint
letting the people do what is in our
hearts to do and then we built our
organizations around that what would
happen if we built a purple world you
know the free education no more taxes
that would be better right so I'm
someone who is actually crazy enough of
a dreamer to think I have a chance in
hell at pulling something that's like
this off so a few years ago I started
working on open mastery which has some a
double meaning here so mastery being the
continuous pursuit of awesome and open
referring to learning out loud so we're
an engineering guild that's working on
learning how to learn together and
helping each other to be more awesome as
a community but we've also got this
double meaning of engineering a purple
world and we're working on a strategy to
make mastery level education free to
every human in the world so there's two
major challenges with this one is going
to cost like a bazillion dollars right
the other major challenge is it's going
to take unprecedented levels of
cooperation but how can we actually pull
something like this
off so here's sort of the master plan
five steps right we're going to make
mastery level education free to every
human in the world all right so we start
small and iterate this is kind of how we
do things right so step one measure your
pain so these are tools that we're
working on right now and based on kind
of the idea flow stuff you can imagine
these are you know plug into your IDE
and you're in the moment working on some
code you get an unexpected crazy error
message on your screen you're looking at
the code going sup TF what does this do
so you highlight the code that's given
you a problem and rotate it with your
questions and then basically what we're
doing is pulling you know background
data of context of what's going on when
you're working and with all these
overlays of information you're adding to
the system and we're building kind of a
visual profiler of these things so in
this case 5 hours and 18 minutes of
troubleshooting this painful
configuration error it gives us a
universal definition as a team of what
pain is so tools here these are open
source so should be out really soon I've
learned my lessons but deadlines and
open source projects don't really go
together very well so if you're
interested in helping out with this
effort i would i would appreciate it too
looking for some angular to help right
now and then next step here transforming
your pain into an automated faq so we're
basically doing statistical process
control on this developer experience
data so when you get something that's
out of bounds say a troubleshooting
incident that took longer than 20
minutes you annotate with your pain type
add comment parrying to things and this
becomes basically an automated FAQ and
so in this case you can imagine all the
things you might set up various
thresholds and rule for and then
annotating and talking about those
incidents as a team and so we're
targeting this for June fifteenth of
this year kind of team level faq
platform and this will be more like JIRA
pricing and then this is where things
get interesting so we're translating all
the metrics
into a semantic graph you've got all
these feelings over time and you can
imagine this is the periods that you're
spending in cognitive distance and the
big ones here we're going to label with
a pain tags and then you've got context
tags in terms of the tasks and subtasks
on things that you might tag in
different ways and then the context tags
get pushed down the pain kags kind of
bubble up to the top like a profiler and
then we can basically put together story
points with you've got an object you are
I the tags on it and those are attached
to the metrics and all the data that
happened for those incidents and what
we're doing with that is building a
automated insight platform so I've got
the story point feed coming in in real
time and then I've got this cognitive
dissonance incident now dreamer OS is
wondering okay how can I help the
developers have in some trouble here and
so we can search for insight based in
the story web faq that we've got from
past experiences and look for what
patterns do I see why is this happening
you know how did I solve similar
problems in the past and then once we
integrate here we can ask you questions
or insight so you know remember that
time you worked on the reporting engine
and spent you know five hours debugging
that configuration error what if there's
a configuration error here and give you
some questions that can help guy your
troubleshooting based on the patterns
and your current experience plus you
know what you ran into his historically
in the past then once you solve that
problem and mark it as yay this becomes
our dopamine signals that ties us to
automate this cause and effect pattern
and what we're going to do with this is
wire this up to one of Jason's cute
little robots which will amuse me to
have on my desk I don't know if it will
you but he does dance the robot right
now but we're going to we're going to
make them even cooler with with all
kinds of fun machine learning stuff
anyway so we're going to bring them up
with a mic and speaker so you can kind
of ask you questions and act as your
pair programming buddy and then as you
train him up with more and more data he
gets XP and you get a level up his
little crystal and as he gets better and
better at asking questions he'll start
to act more and more
like you know a little human so we're
working on the inside platform for jun
15 2018 all right so basically the best
way I can think of to describe dreamer
OS is as a automated Socratic inquiry
system so you can think about we're
asking what questions should i ask next
and applying you know the same old
machine learning type of logic but just
with really strongly structured data so
we can simulate that type of gut feel
system to create a really good question
asking solution all right so next
challenge is building a purple
organization so at that point y'all are
going to have to read this book I think
this is probably the best sort of rough
design template of where we ought to be
headed with respect to trying to design
our organizations around people's
natural abilities gifts and learning how
to learn together as a group and one of
the key paradigm shifts in the book is
moving from machine thinking about the
organization as a machine to an organism
to an organism or I like to think of as
a business creature whose purple and so
we can imagine my business creature has
these past lessons of the past it kind
of works like a database search body of
all these lessons learned and then we've
got dreams that we're trying to achieve
and then we've got a pain signal that's
going to be wired up to all the pain
signals within the organization and an
awesome signal that you can wire up to
say customer metrics and then we've got
an innovation loop on figuring out how
to do do better and operate our business
creature more effectively and then money
becomes like the food we eat in order to
survive so we have to eat to live but
our purpose in life is not to eat we've
got we need to have some kind of bigger
purpose of what we're trying to achieve
as a group of humans and so this
basically becomes our cash cow for doing
all of our educational efforts
and then we start working on
re-engineering the game of life so as an
MMORPG with a gamified education
platform so once we've got this massive
industry knowledge base and our little
robots become smart enough to mentor
people we're basically going to retool
our entire core platform into this
really awesome game and since one of the
best ways to learn how to develop
software is to develop software we're
basically going to turn the development
of educational modules into the game the
game itself and so we'll set up purple
monster guild that work on educational
modules for adding things to the
software where guilds then can invite
folks to their guild and work on these
things and then we'll give awards away
for all the awesome awesome is you know
was creative purple contributions in
subway see and if you want to know about
somebody else's purple contributions
kind of integrate this Pokemon go style
right and so you can imagine you know
other things you might do you see
somebody on your team that made some
really creative idea or or mentored
somebody or whatever kind of purple
contributions you see in the world we
can basically build this culture of
honoring each other and honoring all
these awesome things that we're doing
both locally and then we can you know do
award things and stuff like that as well
so building out this educational game
will will basically be about
incorporating all these people into
these fun projects and our team and then
mentoring people in the context of an
actual development project to totally
change the way that we do education and
crowdsource peer mentorship across the
industry and so we're planning on having
our first mentor bot out at november
eight 2020 and hopefully create you know
some hope for the world to go with the
event of the next election so I've
committed my life to leading this effort
and all my IP I'm basically doing this
all for public benefit and I'm really
concerned about the direction right now
that are we're going as a country and a
world but the thing that I realized is
that you know if we if we want a plan B
we're going to have to build a plan B
and if you think about our industry you
know we are the engineers of the most
powerful industry on our planet I mean
we write the software that runs the
world and with the next major
technological revolution we're going to
have the power to build the future that
we want you know the power to
re-engineer our entire world it's going
to be in our hands and so the question
is what are we going to do with that you
know we've got an opportunity to kind of
come together and define the next
generation of the world that we're going
to live in so this is a pivot I think on
the way we need to start thinking about
this with respect to taking ownership
but we take ownership of designing the
game and we make up the rules and then
we invite the world to play so I'm
Janelle flying founder of open mastery
and if you want to join me in standing
up for purple you can sign up for our
tools beta here at tools open mastery
org I'll send you a free copy of my book
too but remember now is the time to
start living your dream thank
thanks Janelle did you hear the part
where she mentioned business and then
she talked about technology the entire
time awesome sorry though it was way
more interesting than any authentication
talk I've ever been to I'm going to do
this really quick we have the next talk
at ten-thirty 10-2 talks there's EE
there's there's some Kotlin and scala
stuff there's RX java so tons of stuff
to learn couple of points please visit
the exhibit for lots of stuff to see out
there and also please do rate the
sessions it is very helpful to the
organization to understand how well the
content is being received for
conferences to make it better and better
so thanks very much enjoy the rest of
the conference and get to that next talk</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
