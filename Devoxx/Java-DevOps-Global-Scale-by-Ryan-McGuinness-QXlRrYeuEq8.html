loud today we're here to talk about
DevOps one of my favorite subjects
because every time I ask anyone about
DevOps they said they initially follow
up with what is death ops it's a good
question so today we're going to talk
about what it is at walmart and what it
means to do devops at scale and what it
takes to actually get there here's our
agenda for today we'll go through an
introduction what is DevOps what does
scale scale to walmart is a little bit
different than scale too many other
companies will talk about sustainability
because one thing we can we talk about
DevOps we talk about the community
around us we'll talk about our
development practices our quality
assurance practices and our operations
hopefully by the time they this
conversation is done we'll all come
together and be like okay this makes
more sense or we'll all leave a little
bit more confused sofa leetle bita for
the first so my name is ryan mcginness
I'm a principal architect of Walmart
labs nice to meet you all thank you very
much for coming I've been doing
programming for quite some time as you
can see up here I've been under for 20
years or as we equate it in dog years
you know seven years for every one year
that we've worked on the internet my
first year was on the internet it really
wasn't invented until the next one or at
least is popular so what I'm responsible
for at walmart is taking care of all of
our platform and that's what we actually
build Walmart systems on so when we talk
about our internal cloud practices and
our internal services that's that is
that falls into my responsibility domain
so what is DevOps this is the Wikipedia
definition of DevOps right now so you go
out there and you say it's a software
development method that emphasizes the
roles of old software development and
other IT professionals with an emphasis
on IT operations did anyone else just
read that and go what does that mean
that's i read this I'm like okay that's
really confusing because it's missing
some very key information
I looked at this and said this is
woefully incomplete this definition
focuses on IT why do we do IT the
fundamental question is is why do I wake
up every day go to work and actually do
something DevOps isn't about us as IT
people it's about who we serve our
customers so when we look at this
situation we say okay I've got this
definition that Wikipedia gave us now
I've got the reality of I go to work
every day I have to solve problems I
have to do things I have to actually
affect my customer what does that mean
to me what does it mean when you
actually have to do it at scale you know
what does all of this come down to so
when we talk about scale for Walmart
Walmart was founded in nineteen sixty
two by sam walton you guys know we have
85 brands worldwide just it's not just
Walmart we have ads in the UK we have
several other chains around the world
have 2.2 million associates so if we
just served our associates alone we
would have a huge audience to talk to we
have 11,500 stores that's in 28
countries worldwide we do ecommerce in
11 countries we have 198 million unique
users 20 million users are on our site
every day so scales big right so if we
say we heard this morning we said our
scale we were really happy when we had
300,000 people at our site right that's
great scales differ it really is its
scale is important to our companies it's
what we do for our customers that
actually make our scaling problems
unique we have 31 virtual clouds and
seven data centers our data centers are
both on-premise and off we do it we have
currently in our just our gec our global
e-commerce we have about 3417
applications and services this isn't
just an application it's not just a
front-end web site it's how do we
actually enable our website and enable
our customers to do their work we
currently do approximately 1,000
deployments every single day
going to dev QA prod stage right we have
every one of us we work in the real
world we have lots of environments that
we have to take care of DevOps is
supposed to help us enable those
environments with very little human
interaction so it was kind of
interesting I was having a great
conversation last night and in someone
introduced me to the calms acronym about
community automation what's the lean and
butts um sorry a little broken up there
but and new to me it was great because
I'd actually described all of this
inside of my inside of the topic that
we're talking today without actually
knowing the acronym because it's not
something that we've we've really
focused on an acronym to solve these
problems what we have focused on us what
does it mean in order to get these
things done so one of the first things
we talked about in our company is
sustainability our sustainability
problem at Walmart is we have a lot of
code you just saw how much how much
we're actually doing and pushing into
development but code in itself doesn't
make a successful world it doesn't make
successful DevOps sustainability is one
of the key tenants of making sure that
we can do things right shareability is
one of the one of the is the s and comms
sustainability should probably be there
also because when we talk about how we
interact at work a good a good
presentation not very long ago was the
CTO from caterpillar came on station and
he said one thing that was very
important he'd come up there and he'd
said every day culture eats innovation
for lunch right culture is one of our
key problems with everything that we do
in sustainability becomes part of our
culture because without it we develop
and we slowly wither and die on the vine
or we end up costing much more money in
order to keep that sustainability when
we talk about the environmental concerns
we talked about our workplace our
management
right how many of us are engaged in
pushing the envelope with our companies
or with ins with inside of ourselves
every day everybody everybody really
gung-ho about changing things is it hard
to change things yes it's very difficult
because culture is hard to overcome
culture is a sustained being it is
someone who actually has habits and we
have habits as companies at walmart when
we spun up our gec division it was all
about change Sam Walton one of sama
mountains tenants in his company was I
have caused change constantly throughout
my company to ensure that we grow so I'm
fortunate enough to work at a company
where change is easy I used to work for
the financial industries change is not
easy there but it's up to us to actually
work in our environment and grow those
environments especially as developers
and especially as leaders in our in our
company sometimes as a developer we
think Oh someone someone came down and
said I had to do it this way I did it
this way it worked really great for like
five minutes then we added load to it
and it failed well without that
reciprocation and talk and discussion
and push our environment stagnates all
right anyone here have fish yes no lots
of fish owners none you put a fish in a
bowl and you do anything to that
environment the fish died right it seems
true with our environment at work when
we talk about the social side of life
what are we doing at our companies to
actually promote what we do internally
to the social world around us are we
participating in talks are we
participating in our javaone community
our local jug have we actually
established a community at work where
it's good to grow where we have
foundation do you guys have a local Java
group or any type of technology in your
company have you tried to establish it
have you tried to push the boundaries to
adopt so one of the I'm sure everyone
hears
if you're if you're a Java developer
anyway I've gone through the Java 8
update have you pushed Java 8 into your
environment or are you still on java 6
yeah that that's okay a lot of people
are but to get there we have to
continually push in our social side and
use that social site to help educate our
managers to move to the next level the
next side of sustainability is economics
without an economic backing side to
anything that we do what are its odds of
survival all right they start to dwindle
when we push things even in 20 into the
open source community if we push it out
there and there's no champion for that
it dwindles when there's not backing to
the things that we do they dwindle what
does all of this have to do with DevOps
because without a sustainable future
everything that we're doing today to be
operational has a limited life span
unless we continually push back into the
community around us and help learn from
the community around us on how to guide
our companies
so culture this is one of those things
where again this may seem this is a
philosophical debate about what it is we
are inside as people and how we interact
with our companies and how we interact
with our peers or subordinates all the
way from the top down company leadership
is a big step in everything that we do
if your company's culture does not buy
into an operational excellence model if
your company's only goal is to get
software out as fast as possible that's
great it has very limited lifespan we
get into this model where we have
explorers town settlers and town
planners when we initially start
projects we're on that exploring side
we're going out we're building things
we're building it quickly it's really
great it's fun it's exciting but as we
start to continue to grow into that
settler motion where we're actually
building something that people use our
model becomes more important to be
usable and to be sustainable and to be
monitored but that has to come from the
top of the company if you're in a
start-up we'll get into what you need to
do to actually plan for that future so
Java users group for part of a culture
if you haven't found it one or if you're
not a part of one I highly recommend it
if you're not dumb just to two slots
back there was a JSR there's another jsr
communities there's lots of jsr talks
today about how to do adopt a JSR is
anyone in here part of the jsr community
yes I know you guys are so we have j SRS
and we have them for a reason it's not
because it's outdated or it's
old-fashioned when we talk about a JSR
or doing implementations with the jsr
especially as a company who is larger
and wants to actually not own everything
for technical debt we adopt a JSR and we
help get our ideas and so that other
people understand the scale that we're
trying to achieve and understand the
problems that we've had and how we've
solved them so that other people
face it excuse me don't face the same
problems we have only grown they are
able to quickly adopt it based on what
we do in this jsr s not all j s ours are
clear some of them are very vague about
and they leave a lot of wiggle room for
implementation but without that
community involvement there people don't
know what you've been through and then
of course the open source community
patching communicating and working with
people and open source is a big deal
everyone in here I'm going to bed uses
open source yes excuse me so if you use
open source and you don't commit or
communicate or work with the community
that's provided it how valuable is that
going to be in a year two years ten
years it starts to dwindle and those are
the things that we need to we need to
actually work through so here's some
very notable people that are actually
here as most of them are here at the
conference and Oh Trisha can't make it
this time but people who you actually
want to look for in the world and say
wow and this is not all of them I could
have you know we have an entire speaker
debt we have slides of people we have
all of the folks down on the booths
downstairs but community and getting
getting intertwined with the people who
are making a difference helps us get
excitement into our company it helps us
drive change this is all important for
DevOps because DevOps if you're not
doing it is about change it's about
changing the way that you think it's
about changing the way that you practice
development in order to make something
better fair so just just out of
curiosity how many people are doing
DevOps today awesome not very not as
many as I would hope how many of you
don't know what DevOps is yeah fair
question so if we tackle it from
breaking it down into its components and
we say okay I am NOT a pie-in-the-sky
architect so first off from doing a
little bit more of my introduction I'm a
practicing architect
I code every single day I love what I do
I believe in what we do is developers
and when I code I make sure that it can
actually run in two run in a production
environment even if it's just a
prototype because any time you commit
code to a repository someone is going to
look at it inevitably and copy and paste
it somewhere else so if you're willing
to take that risk and just throw code
into a repository that's fine it may
have ramifications so as a development
team we actually have to do some
standards depending on where you're at
in your world some folks go overboard on
governance they have standards that make
no sense they have standards that tell
you where and when to place a tab we're
at a place your spacer who cares what we
actually have to standardize on is what
are we going to do which patterns are we
going to use how are we going to ensure
connectivity what happens when
connectivity fails what happens when I
need to recover what is my mean time to
recovery instead of going well I think
you really use the wrong for matter for
your code today you've all heard that
right so standardized practice is what
one of my favorite terms and all of this
is just enough governance just enough
standards to make sure that you're
fitting your business needs the thing
that was woefully missing in that in
that whole conversation about what is
this thing that we're calling DevOps we
were missing the customer who do we
serve we serve a customer and we serve a
business need and oftentimes as
technologists we get caught up in our
own dogma we get caught up in everything
that we do is IT focusing on IT for IT
sake none of that leads to anywhere
except for a bunch of IT dogma and the
business says hey we need to turn in the
IT guys go I'm sorry we can't turn right
now because our policy dictates that we
can't turn until
after November that's our policy and of
course the business comes back and they
say what are you guys doing so that
development side has to serve a purpose
the philosophical boundary of
development is to serve some type of a
purpose the folks who are spoken
speaking here before me they said how
did we start they started with a dream
right how do we start our days we start
with the mission we're developers we
should be starting with mission some of
us don't some of us don't have that type
of leadership or guidance but we can
bring that to the table everybody in
here is actually responsible to bring
that to the table the other side of
development is making sure that you have
the right tools for the job and this
one's hard because part of DevOps is
making sure that whatever you're working
on you have the capabilities to make it
useful you have the capabilities to make
it troubleshoot you know the ability to
troubleshoot it you have the
capabilities to automate what you're
doing with it and a lot of times we
start off in this world with the tools
that are out there an open source
because our manager comes to us or
someone else's it's free there's big
price tag behind the free for how to
actually implement that and we bring in
X Y or Z to automate our systems we may
finally get it done we might go out and
buy up you know someone someone above us
and said hey we're going to go buy a
solution that gets dumped in our labs
there's a lot of things in our tool set
that we don't control but a lot of
things that we have to work on with the
goal of automation when we talk about
deployments and we talked about moving
our code through the system all of it
comes down to automation at the end of
the day and knowing your tools a fellow
from Tommy tribe named Andy he's
actually sitting right over here said in
his last taught in one of his last talks
he's had no your tools no your tools and
learn how to work with your tools
because if you don't you're not actually
using what you have if you're trying to
jump ship and go find something better
over here you end up actually wasting
time instead of learning what's in front
of you and it's a very important thing
for us as developers to do the other one
is
the promise of agile development this is
this is a catch-22 how many people are
actually doing agile development quite a
few you you so at the end of every
sprint you do a demo maybe maybe not
some folks yes yes I we do that
religiously agile is a wonderful tool
and we use it to succeed and we use it
to actually bring value to the business
sooner so the promise of agile
development and the DevOps community is
so that we can get our work in front of
our stakeholders sooner with delivery
and feedback without that feedback loop
we don't actually know how to do the
next few steps which is monitoring
metrics and training on the tools that
we've developed so once we get past
actually the promise of agile and truly
working in an agile way versus you know
wag I'll ever say it's really waterfall
and we might have some kind of agile you
know we call it agile but but at the end
of the day we're still waterfall
waterfall has its purpose it is very
much for the town settler it is the town
planning meeting to actually use what
waterfall because you can't build a road
agile in an agile fashion right you
actually have to know what what you're
going to you have to know what you're
building on but when you come down to
how to develop software we have to do in
an agile manner for our business
training is important and I usually I
stress training training training
training because a lot of times whenever
we start a project or a product for our
business in our development side I have
found that most of our developers in the
world and this isn't just at walmart
this is everywhere i've ever been has
been developers who have been doing a
consistent job for n number of years in
the past and they haven't broken outside
of that box so we have to bring training
into this because we have to get to that
next level of how do i actually use a
circuit breaker pattern what does this
mean to us how does this affect our
customers how does it affect our users
and more importantly how does it affect
me is it me as a developer
these new fangled lambda things and do
they actually mean anything to me those
are the things that training actually
should bring to the forefront open
source from the start is that it's this
is a mindset and it's something that
when we look at how we do development
there are a lot of great practices we
can learn from our open source
communities a lot of great things like
limiting our third-party resources
making sure that we have a focused
product set making sure that we're broke
out modular ly all of these things will
aid into the operations side when we
actually get into doing the deployments
so today when we talk about open source
we say okay yeah that's that's over
there but you can practice open source
internally by actually following their
best practices that goes down to
actually how you commit code how you
work with each other in your coding
products right how many out you actually
fork internally and have your own
versions and do pull requests and make
sure that you're actually doing things
very well in a good distributed way so
that when it comes time to do operations
you don't accidentally mess things up
it's a very big step for all of us to
look at what the best practices around
those are and there's a lot of books on
that just just one thing that's how to
actually establish a good work flow with
get so those concepts that are actually
in that open source community are places
that we can look for additional patterns
to follow this last one metrics driven
from the start this one's very important
is everything that you ever do need to
be metered or have a metric wrapper
around it the answer is no but you do
have to consider how you're going to do
your metrics metrics from the start
means that you sit down with your
business unit and your pen and who
you're designing the system for and ask
them what is important for you to
measure how do we measure our success to
the system is it transactions per minute
maybe is it mean failures per hour maybe
it depends on the business strategy that
we actually get into if you go off and
you instrument everything that you do so
in inside of spring for example I create
this awesome point cut and that point
cut says I'm going to instrument every
single method and I'm going to know what
methods are being called and which ones
are being used in them and how much time
is being spent in each method and then I
get into this really big problem storage
now I can't actually I'm spending more
time on the network writing network
traffic out because I've over
instrumented my package with data that
no one cares about that's a big deal so
when we talk about metrics driven should
be purpose-built metrics we actually
need to come together with our business
teams to figure out what those
purpose-built metrics are now not all
metrics are derived from the business
some of them are important to us where
we talk about the difference between
eventing and erroring we say an event is
something that happens that is
actionable an error may or may not be
actionable it is just something that we
capture has static detail associated
with it we're technologists we would
like to know that information we'd like
to be able to find that information we
still have to do that but do it in a way
that won't cause problems your initial
construct on a smaller scale writing to
disk is okay we all do it we all push
meters and metrics out somewhere whether
it's to a database whether it's over the
wire somewhere where they're catching it
initially that seems fine it does not
scale well as you guys know we've been
having a lot of conversations about
stream in the conference and how to
actually use strings meaningfully and if
you go out and do any research on the
history KPIs or anything that Netflix is
created you'll find that they were
actually pushing things through streams
from day one i'm going to create a
stream source and i'm going to register
with an upstream stream consumer that's
how we get to scale faster is by
actually providing the ability
to do something without equating it to
ephemeral disk or disk that we may not
have as we start to run into clouds okay
so from the development side before we
get into automation this is I'd
originally labeled the talk java and
DevOps I'm trying to cover a bit more
Java in here but DevOps is its global it
doesn't really apply to any single
language we use a lot of java at walmart
to do all of our business centric
services matter of fact we use nodejs on
our front end and our web services or in
our website to actually render the site
talking to our java side that's the way
that we like to work so we have a nice
polyglot on our store side we have a lot
of dotnet so we have everything across
that gamut but everyone follows the same
practice of when I build within
alimonies the java example here to
finish this out when i build i do
everything that I can to monitor and
metrics locally first so I ensure that
when i omit metrics they're emitting
correctly on my local machine before i
do any check-ins i do everything with
maven locally we make sure that our
developers know their tools so we do
training around maven and we do trade
training around the Nexus and what it
means to get into those areas if we
can't do that locally then no one can
ever reproduce it right we get out to
the to the world where we do the old
throw it over the wall technique which
is what DevOps was originally you know
the original poster for DevOps if you
haven't seen it is the developer
throwing their code over a wall to
operations and saying good luck that
can't succeed it doesn't succeed so we
make sure that our developer practices
are good from the get-go and what that
boils into is test-driven which means
that before you do anything with your
project you're writing tests to ensure
that they work you make sure that you
have the appropriate metrics defined for
your development staff the appropriate
metrics are important right and I say
this boundary because not everyone is
going to ever
it will ever achieve one hundred percent
line coverage one hundred percent method
coverage right you have to understand
what your business needs are and what's
important to them and then define them
on a per team basis and figure out how
to enforce them so today when you
develop with maven or you develop with
any of your tool sets you want to ensure
that your maven plugins are actually
capable of mutton measuring how much
test coverage you have what that test
coverage means and then whether or not
it's actionable most of us we may
instrument these things we might even
use the tools that we have to get the
numbers but if that's all it is is a
number and that number does nothing for
your company or for you like stop you
from doing something crazy then it's
done no good you've got a great number
right numbers without methodology
numbers without philosophy behind them
are just that they're just numbers their
numbers floating around somewhere so on
this particular site I like I just
covered through the standard workflows
as far as what it is we do for
development and test driven test locally
first test locally again merge test
again make sure that you don't break
anybody then create pull requests very
big fan of pull requests when so on my
team alone we currently have three
thousand developers across the world
that report into everything we've got
somewhere in the hundreds of
repositories just for my team if they
were all merging to master it would be
chaotic because you know it people break
things I break things I'm guilty it
happens but we do it locally before we
actually get it up into the branch so
that all happens before we check in and
what I have down here on this uh on the
on the bottom of those the purple and
red there is some tools that we have and
that we use can fairly religiously does
everyone here use sonar yes yes that's
awesome sonar is a great tool and if
there's any managers out there your team
should be using sonar you should be
looking at their progress because
sonar can actually tell you if people
are doing their job sonar is important
for us because what we've actually done
is we've gone above and beyond sonar and
we use the metrics that sonar emits to
then help us determine whether or not we
can do releases it also helps feed our
technical debt dashboards that we
actually assigned to each of our
development teams have you been doing
your job we have that report and view
sonar is just one tool that can help us
get there that's the one that we've
chose there are many others out there
that you can choose to use the fact of
the matter is if you've noticed the
theme yet everything is metrics driven
absolutely everything can be measured in
a way that is meaningful to you and your
business otherwise again we have this
sense of I'm developing with feel good
in mind instead of developing and
getting something done that I've
measured in trapped this gets to be
extremely important in dev ops does
anyone know why why are all these
metrics necessary for DevOps because
without them you will not effectively
establish trust you will have a sense of
trust that is well I trust him he's
built a few times and he hasn't broken
the last week or she's done a really
great job and she's pushed everything
into the repository we've never had any
problems with her so we trust her right
that's that's human trust but we cannot
build systems and DevOps or automation
unless we actually establish metrics
driven trust something that actually
helps our business come to terms with
the fact that we want to get to CD
someday continuous deployment continuous
deployment that's still a unicorn for a
lot of us right we look out there we go
wow CD looks awesome in our business as
no way you are not going to just let
some machine push code to production
because they don't trust us they don't
trust what you do
we haven't provided them the data set to
be trustworthy just so you guys know
we're working on CD we've been working
on it for about three years it's still a
unicorn okay we're a lot closer to
automation we can push a button and do
it but there still has to be trust and
those are things that we actually build
over time in order to to get the
business to let us do our job and all of
us have to fight you know security
concerns especially if we have any type
of payments payment gateways customer
effects when we talk about DevOps we
talk about trust because the trust isn't
for us it's for our customer in today's
day and age our customer can go anywhere
we lose that customers trust and we've
lost a lot more than anything else on
the one of the first slides every one of
my favorite quotes from Sam Walton was
was the customer can fire everybody in
the company from the CEO down all they
have to do is stop shopping with us so
that's why we don't have full CD yet
because we don't trust that we're not
going to affect our customer do you
anybody does anybody do CD out there no
one just you guys I didn't see one hand
so that's out one okay i sell one the
fact of the matter is is that when we
talk about this continuous delivery
system it is a unicorn and we have to be
able to get to the tools that we have up
here so if you look at the farm far
right hand side here as we say we're
fairly far along we have tools at
walmart that manage our CloudStack
that's that's that back one there that
actually tells me what my deployments
look like that that big pin wheel on the
side that tells me what my entire
topology for deployment looks like
that's great I have a little bit of
information there that I can take some I
can be actionable with the very top one
is that this is the topology recipe this
is what you meant right and then the
bone behind it is actually are built to
which is metrics driven and it will not
let you do a release it will not
actually let you
the physical button or do anything else
unless you're meeting your code quality
because most of our tools no they're
really they're sharp knives you can run
as fast as you can with them because
they don't naturally put checks and
balances in place if you're building
with Jenkins for example you can build
push a button anytime there's not
necessarily a check and balance in there
unless you go through and enable it and
do a lot of work with it that makes it
useful to your company so those are the
things that we have to do in order to
get to becoming a better shop for DevOps
is making sure that we actually have the
information available to us so that we
can make metrics based decisions bad
transition my apology
alright
operations so this is the as we work
through this progression of conversation
we started with us the developer we've
moved to how we actually move things
into production and now we talk about
operations and windows operations begin
most people believe that operation is
only applicable to production is that
how your shops work operations is
production only the fact is is that
operations can't be production only
because if its production only once they
once it gets out there they have to have
everything in place in order to support
and maintain your software if we
actually throw it over the wall to
operations we're missing a tenant of
agile our stakeholders weren't in the
room with us and that's what this slide
is supposed to help illustrate
operations should be a part of your
delivery schedule from dit from the
development environment upwards so they
know actually what they're doing and
they know what you're doing and they can
provide input as a stakeholder they can
help you derive what metrics are useful
to them as most of them actually run the
NOC so if we don't take in if we
actually look at this and we said our
operation staff they're on board with us
they're actually a stakeholder we have
them in the room when we're going to our
quality assurance environments so that
they can help us define the metrics that
they need in order to sustain the app
they also want to know what does this
have to do who does it affect if you
look at the dependency graph today of
your applications that you deploy do we
actually have a view of what the
positive and negative effects are
upstream and downstream do you know what
the effects of your service architecture
are without the implementation of a
service bus if you don't have the data
odds are good that you don't so when we
look at this particular set we say we're
enabling we as the development team are
going to enable our operations team by
getting them in the room as a
stakeholder to run this in production
doesn't take me off the hook by the way
I wrote it I own it so because I wrote
it and I own it I'm still going to be in
the room if something bad happens that's
imperative that I actually have that
capability but it's also very important
that they don't call me in the middle of
the night when when it just has a hiccup
or I'm not on the phone 24-7 once we
move it into our pre production
environments we follow the same role why
do we actually want people there why do
we want our customers are where are we
going to load test this thing before it
goes to production do we actually load
test religiously before we do anything
or do we just load test before you know
the holiday yeah that doesn't work
either because then everyone is in a big
panic great once we move into production
this is actually the dangerous territory
this is where this is where operations
lives and thrives and if you saw our NOC
our NOC is amazing because they have a
wall similar to this one here it's
actually a giant touchscreen it's it's
pretty amazing they can move they can
move their widgets around they can
actually see what what places in the
world are being affected by specific
outages but they do it all based on the
metrics that we deliver it to them we
gave them a billet e to bring it into a
stream to bring it into big data stream
so that they can actually look at their
walls and know what's happening where
production affects the customer so
getting to the meaning of what I was
saying earlier you can see the customer
all throughout my slide this is a very
important aspect of life in retail I
hope it's a very important aspect to you
as developers to is that the customer is
by far who were actually doing all of
this for so that we can release new
features so that we can do things very
quickly and have rapid change to
positively impact the lives of our
customers so DevOps is about being able
to get to this trust scenario where we
can do these releases and do things in a
timely manner so that
we effectively have established trust
through metrics we have delivered them
all the way up to the customer and we
have done so in a quality way and an
automated way that doesn't actually
cause us to lose a customer that's the
worst thing that can happen even worse
than that is actually releasing you know
getting that headline in the news of oh
yeah somebody site was down for two
hours right we've had that happen
recently we're not perfect we're not
perfect at dev ops yet but we're working
toward it in order to make sure that we
actually don't have those outages right
when you talk about we actually have a
slogan on our wall changing the world a
million people at a time right and you
saw the numbers 20 million logins per
day that's a lot when we mess up people
tend to notice so we don't like that
when we talk about that DevOps
experience we want to make sure that our
developers understand that from the top
down and really our culture does because
DevOps is a cultural change from the top
to the bottom your managers have to buy
in the developers have to buy in and
everyone on the in between so that
Wikipedia definition and IT personnel
everybody still too vague for me though
so in these definitions here I'd like to
actually you know if you guys can
provide me feedback afterward Brian
McGinnis five on Twitter I'd love to
hear from you because when we talk about
DevOps like I said I've broken it down
development is about programmatically
solving problems to make your customers
lives better this is in business terms
it's a value proposition why do I want
to do DevOps your manager asks you this
is why my operations therefore ensuring
that my company's image by providing
customers with good experiences this is
value perception so when we talk about
the interaction side of our developers
weather or customers for their company
they only see that the public-facing
image or they see the public API or they
see whatever it is we're delivering if
we fail them the perception starts to
decrease there's a great paper released
not too long ago Bible when we develop
software what has to be great especially
if it's free and effectively all IT
software to a company is free they don't
actually see a cost to it unless they're
unless they're up and up in the larger
number crunching area going well you
know this project actually did cost us
money but most people perceive it as
free so if you don't follow these rules
what they actually do is they go look
for software somewhere else right if
it's free it must have a good user
interface it must be stable it must be
predictable those are things that are
very important in the moments we get
into that DevOps I'd we say it's a
culture for ensuring the customer
experience by providing automated
measurable operational excellence
through business meaningful metrics but
you guys agree with those that statement
yes no pretty important that that last
part business meaningful metrics because
I can have metrics all day long that I'm
dumping out into my big data store that
if the business doesn't have any idea
what they are I've delivered no value to
them so that's what we're trying to do
in our DevOps department says do that
and sorry that was the measurable and
purpose-built so if we look at that the
in this one is camps it's not the not
the original because I said its culture
automation measurable purpose-built not
lean lean doesn't make any sense to me
lean means small you know somewhat there
but but really its purpose built each
one of our systems must be purpose-built
and then it must be sustainable so if I
go off and I deliver everything that I
want in the goal Aang because I'm a
super guru a-goin or because I'm really
good at Pearl I did everything in Perl
does it make it sustainable no I can
write some really ugly pearl totally
compiles it totally works it might have
actually solved the need but when I hand
it off
no one can actually sustain it it is not
something that we actually invest in all
right so we've actually got a lot of
time left we've got about 16 minutes and
this is really my last slide on on what
is DevOps I hope I've answered your
guys's questions today hopefully no
one's leaving confused more confused
than they did came when they came in
anyone okay I've left one person totally
confused and I'm sorry for that see me
afterward okay so thank you guys thank
you for coming if you have any questions
come see me afterward I'd be happy to
answer anything that we have for a
company okay thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
