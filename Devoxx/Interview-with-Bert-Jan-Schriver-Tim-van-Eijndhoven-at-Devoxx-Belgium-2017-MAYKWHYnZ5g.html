you Burton Tim he'd been working on a
self-driving car project so last year at
Burton I spoke about a self-driving car
and how you built it in the project at
your work to race them against each
other so this year we thought it would
be interesting to talk about how your
self-driving car project differs with
what's already out there so I know that
this is this is a project that you
started in your spare time it's perhaps
a little bit unfair to ask how it
compares with
toeffler but let's place let's ask
anyway you start okay so when you when
you look at a first set of skill right
so our car is a lot smaller than a Tesla
and the consequences are a lot smaller
than a Tesla or a Waymon car when it
goes wrong as well so we're in the in
the happy situation that that for us
I mean safety is an issue but I mean no
deaths will occur when our car does
something wrong so that that's that
makes our life a bit easier worst case
we need to start running and run after
the car to fetch it from a ditch
somewhere and this happens every now and
then yeah very true so when you look at
how they do it they have a lot more
systems that are that are designed
especially in order to create safe
conditions to drive so they have like a
multitude of sensors and all sorts of
built-in limitations to their systems in
order to create the most optimal
situation in which the cars have to
operate and that well that that ensures
a certain amount of safety for them so
on the subject of safety and he talked
about running after cars and pulling
them from ditches what kind of ethics do
you have to consider when you're
thinking about self-driving cars with
your project and then maybe with wider
projects no so in terms of our project
we don't have that many ethics because
the chance that we all hurt a human is
fairly small
you know maybe hurt someone's toe or
food but that's that's about it when
compared to two bigger cars they have to
make choices when for example when
you're driving somewhere and you can't
afford an accident you can only drive
maybe left or right and make choices and
where you run into
Tim she had a couple of examples there
are kind of like moral dilemmas so
you're driving on the road he can't stop
left of the road there's a couple of
dogs the right side of the road there's
a couple of cats
you can only steer but you can brake so
are you going to do hit the dogs or cats
so Tim is more of a cat person
Ultimo of course I would say the
audience we had a slight preference of
running over it gets but so that well
that's still a choice that you can you
know maybe give some thought but then
then she had another example which is a
bit more when you take when you take it
one step further I mean this is I mean
this is laughable right I mean cats
versus dogs the classic problem but when
you look at the situation in which there
are people inside a car and the the
whole choice you have to make is to
either drive the car through a group of
pedestrians right which are killed or
you have to swerve and kill the people
inside the car if you run into a wall
for example if that is the choice you
have to make I mean which one which one
do you make that's that's a really
different difficult ethical question and
especially when you look at it from a
perspective that when I mean plenty of
people would like to buy an autonomously
driving vehicle but if you are aware of
the fact that the autonomously driving
vehicle might actually choose to
sacrifice the people inside of the car
your family for the greater good what I
want to have a car make that decision
you still want that car I think it's
even a hard choice to make just when
you're driving yourself you know will I
save my family by not running into a
wall but but hit pedestrians on the
sidewalk or will I save the pedestrians
but hurt my family hitting into a wall
so there's our impossible choices to
make luckily there are some some
governments that are given get some
thought and the German goes make some
rules for example yeah it basically you
know it comes down to I don't know if
you know the the the famous science
fiction writer Isaac Asimov he wrote
this is free loss of robotics and
install ecosystem and and that's that
every robot has to follow a certain set
of rules in order to prevent them from
harming you and being human beings and
those type of rules are actually very
applicable nowadays when you when you
come to these cities self-driving cars
because when every self-driving car is
programmed to always save its
the driver right and always sacrifices
the people around you then it might
actually be a lot more unsafe for
everyone else that's walking around with
all these self-driving cars around so
that's there wouldn't be a for the whole
of society that would be a bad thing
of course he saw the devil's cartoon and
by there the commit strip guy yeah right
yeah that was very applicable at the
moment the cars more valuable there are
so few self-driving cars you choose to
sell you save the car yeah yeah exactly
I wouldn't really be comfortable
stepping into a car at that the said
yeah thank you very much thank you thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
