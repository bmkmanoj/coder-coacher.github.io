see the auditorium's almost full and
everybody here on the last day of divx
we are going to share a little bit about
adding eyes ears and mouths your IOT
project so I would like to ask you who
is already engaged with IOT in somehow
okay lots of people probably doing cool
stuff so welcome to this talk Vinny and
me we are working with education since
2001 we have a training company and we
run a big event in Brazil we are bored
of soul Java the Brazilian java
community we also have a duchess chapter
there and run the Vox for kids events we
just moved some years ago to IOT and
start building some new hardware as well
so now we on the frontier of software
and hardware for IOT we had the pleasure
to get the Duke choice award in 2011
with our first IOT project it was a
automated coffee machine but we were
paying lots of attention on the
framework that evolved it since that too
now most important on our mini mini
biography is that we have to a son and a
daughter Maria and Rafael we are
important attribution I must say thank
you to this great program colored Java
champions I'm not aware i'm not sure if
you all know about this but this is a
program that helps people to spread java
knowledge around the world so it's a
and a program kept by Oracle but its
independent it's driven by the java
champions by themselves by ourselves and
with that we got support to travel and
go to conferences and help to spread the
knowledge around the world so thank you
for the java champions program just to
share a little bit about our background
we did some cool projects with IOT so we
work it with horse telemetry just for
racing horses to know when they were
jumping or what were the there's little
meter and GPS and lots of sensors for
people that were interested in buying
those racing horses we have also worked
with smart boat so Vinny is passionate
about sailing and all our families so we
put lots of sensors and a broken
automatic pilot so lots of playing with
the boat it's a giant robot but very
cool to play with we also tried creating
up smite helmet for a Brazilian startup
so on this helmet we use it Raspberry Pi
and the camera and gps and lots of
things just to we are the community is
growing around bicycles so the idea was
to connect these people in a community
and on a social network behind the
helmet we also did some cool project
with kids so we helped with a public
school to implement low-orbit satellites
called tube shot and this were
fifth-grade kids that were having their
first experience with creating their own
hardware and doing programming on top of
it we also created a minecraft robot so
it was a robot that has bi-directional
communication you can inside the
game turn on or off the lights from the
real world and from the real world the
real world you can make change inside
the game so when you enhance the
humidity on the real world it can range
inside the game so lots of cool stuff
for kids to play with Minecraft but
using adults technology to do that
bi-directional communication we also
create of course some home automation or
a smart building project for local
companies in Brazil to control infrared
and other appliances so we would like to
i would like to vinny would like to do a
little introduction to basic concepts
for IOT good morning everybody thanks a
lot for coming to our talk the concept
will be very fast just to introduce you
the architecture that is behind out
destroy so I need to show you which kind
of software we are running in the edge
devices in our Arduinos in our gateways
we have here also the gemalto concept
board that runs java me and i will be
explaining the architecture and the
software and the hardware that we
developed the last few years so oops
okay so we have four layers in IOT space
the first layers we call as edge device
which is the very low energy and limited
a computer in the border grabbing data
from the sensors controlling relays
controlling transistors controlling
motors and things like that so the edge
device most of the times we are supposed
to use microcontrollers inversion stead
of micro processors is really low energy
so you can survive in a min batteries
for months
you have all the sensors and controllers
may not support tcp/ip you may have some
magic device using like a zigbee or a
z-wave x wave I don't remember they
standard here but uh infrared you have
many types of devices that they they
can't run tcp/ip because they have a
very limited memory but the edge device
many most of the times you don't have
operational system which means that you
are running your software in a bar mat
away so is a direct communication
between your software and the hardware
with that you can have real and hard
real-time operations which means that is
not something that will perform great
but is something that will not allow the
lace that's the concept of real-time
devices and next to that we have the
gateways the gateways we are going to
use micro processors or cistern on ship
that aggregates microprocessor video
wireless technologies and much more they
are low energy not very low energy they
may support something then beyond tcp/ip
the edge device we we used to have just
a few responsibilities for edge device
in the Gateway we can have many
responsibilities like a persistence
security integration and limited real
time supporting the Gateway because most
of the times you are running Linux and
for real time is not that good so we
have the cloud layer so once we have the
Gateway connected to the Internet our
idea is to send all the data that we
capture in the edge device and make the
intelligence so once you start grabbing
the data you can start making the things
it smart and you have social network and
now the integration over the Internet
and finally we have the consumers the
consumers can be a low level consumers
or machine
to machine consumers using protocols the
most famous r NQ TT &amp;amp; Co app when we
have machine to humans we used to use a
rest and web service so we can have
phones tablets and we can have devices
more sophisticated devices like cameras
like connect or intel realsense that is
the camera that i have here in my laptop
and i'm going to to show you today so
the edge device we have this guy running
zigbee so it's something that I have
this battery and I can are this device
can rest for many many days with this
battery because Ziggy is very low energy
consumption and so I can have a very
very different topology of network with
Zeb because Ziggy work with a mash-up
network so one device can talk with
another that can talk with another and
so you can have a very long distance
network based on Ziggy be so that's our
edge device for today quick question
already its familiar with zigbee great
well so the Gateway is the entrance
point we are really used to have our
Gator in our houses for the television
and for our internet access we have the
router that connect you to the internet
service provider this is the most
important part of the IOT for me and
Java performed great in the gateways and
the gateways they are responsible for
converting data data and protocol and we
can have different types and size like
very small edge devices with
microcontroller Bluetooth Bluetooth Low
Energy gb Wi-Fi or 3g is more
system-on-chip
like raspberry pi you do board Intel
Galileo winter wet some medium like the
powerful single board computer we have
many many single boards that are coming
with imx6 which is a very powerful
system on ship and Intel is doing a
great job in this space they just
launched at the Intel Watson that has
three CPUs to quarks and well not on cpu
and you can have big computers like plug
computer or even using your pc or
desktop your notebook to be the gateway
when you are in the development time so
here we have the this device that I show
you the zigbee we also have here this
would surfboard this guy is using our
board together with gemalto concept
bored so I have in the back of this
surfboard the gemalto concept board
running on 3g so this is a great
experience this is a great model from
jamaat oh and i really recommend you we
have many many years working with EHS 5
and EHS 6 which is the main module from
this board and it runs java me the old
one old but go to the java mitra true
but it just work you have updates over
the air you can have security and it's
amazing technology and we are going to
show this today and on this case and the
big the most important thing of using
Java ME instead of Java s ii is that you
have api is for accessing all the
cellular meter sensors and everything so
that's on Java ME and it's school from
from this board lots of people have been
using gemalto around the world so it
makes your your project independence so
because it has its own internet for
so we have used cases on amazon for
monitoring trees for instance the forest
no not the cloud computing yeah they are
monitoring the treason they have a sled
ohmmeter they have the 2g connection and
if someone just cut the tree the tree
cannot fire someone is cutting trees in
this space so it's a way to take care
about our forest a very nice internet
sure thing implementation we also have
here a a gateway running with raspberry
pi and java 8 which is Jesus would
laptop as you can see I love to work
with wood and high OT so we on a CNC
machine in our house so we replace at
our dining room for a cutting machine so
so when they cut the tree we get not
tired okay and we have here inside this
laptop the Intel watson also running
java c ja ve but intel ads on our ad
comes with bluetooth low energy and
Wi-Fi connection which makes a great
device inter watson like raspberry pi is
all about having the best technology to
make IOT I guess you are using something
that is 10 years old in terms of
microprocessor in terms of hardware
architecture when you talk about Intel
Watson is the future devices future
technology so we did this guy we call
this guy as I'll tablet it has the
interwebs on the Raspberry Pi Wi-Fi
Bluetooth Low Energy and we also have
the Zeb module here so it's a very nice
development gateway so that's how it is
inside our idea to build this tablet is
to have a mood board computer instead of
have one computer if four cpus running
the same operational system we did a
kind of laptop that we can have
different boards running different
operational system and jump just
pressing
button you can switch from one
operational system in one board to
another board and another thing that is
good for people that smoke is that we
have a smoke lighter here I looked at
Apple never did a laptop like this and
on this project Raspberry Pi is
responsible for rendering right oh uh
yeah Raspberry Pi provides all the the
user interface and the the screen the
HDMI because Intel Watson doesn't come
with a video adapter and we are using
our startup project colored IOT
surfboard we just landed in Brazil it
has many sensors it is Arduino base it
and we can have connections using zigbee
Wi-Fi bluetooth we have temperature
humidity alcohol sensor real-time clock
relay and infrared so is a very nice
board for prototyping and start playing
with IOT we are launching this board
next year in the Kickstarter the u.s. in
Brazil we did a crowdfunding and it was
very successful so it seems that we are
in the right time and all these all the
demos will be based in this board but
all the demos you can do in your house
replacing our board for arduino splits
up rattle board so you can have
something simple but very useful to try
our api's and try our software and just
one one quick thing here lots of people
ask us sometimes should i use Edwina or
should I use raspberry pi should i use
arduino or should i use Intel Edison and
as Vinny explain and they have different
proposals right one is the edge device
who controls the sensors and actuators
and all that and the other board is a
more stronger board that has an
operational system has lots of abilities
has linux and and you can do that you
use that as the brain of your project
and integrates to the internet and
filters data and work with data before
send
to the internet so I OT surfboard the
IOT surfboard doesn't replace Intel
Edison or raspberry pie but it's
designed to work together with any of
those richer board so our menu today in
terms of devices we have the IOT
surfboard number one which is this one
this one is plugged using the USB cable
which is a serial connection direct to
my laptop so I have my laptop working as
a IOT gateway running out the Java
service the next one is the zigbee
device this one and this one is talking
with the the aisle tablet and this guy
is the gateway and this these children
are talking to zigbee right yes they are
talked about on Wi-Fi we are using this
different protocol for people that are
not familiar with zigbee is different
protocol that made the communication
possible but it's not Wi-Fi and we have
the last one that is the the surfboard
using the IOT surfboard + 3g connection
and the Gateway is the concept board so
we have different types of gateway we
have a regular laptop we have raspberry
pi and Intel wetzel single board
computer and we have the Gemalto contact
board which is a very is more gateway so
we have different sizes and types of
gateways here so the gateways are all in
Java yeah but the two first are running
with java SE and the gym out who's
running with java yeah in the adjectives
ice we are using Arduino base at board
so we are using in surfboard the Arduino
Nano which is the small or do we know
that you can buy is a very production
Arduino go to production Arduino and we
have an API that we developed the last
five years for our colored IOT surfing
API for arduino
and here we have the IOT surfing
protocol which is JSON base it and in
our gateways we have the IOT surfing
service which is a java microservices
colonel very good that support
everything that the IOT surfing services
is the guy that will integrate the audio
system takes two to speed video video
recognition and so it's the it's the
manager of all the IOT ecosystem that we
have here let's look at the edge device
code so we have some arduino code here
and we are saying that we have a red a
red LED plug it into the port number 10
which can make a pulses so i can control
how much rad the intensity of the red
light the green the blue I have a relay
I have a speaker I have the alcohol
sensor relay and speaker they are
digital just 0 and 1 to turn on and turn
off and the alcohol sensor is analog so
I have the value if between 0 and 1023
and so we have more complex sensors here
like temperature and humidity sensor
they are not like just reading a digital
port or just reading an anal log part
here we are sending the function that
will make all the complex process to
read this sensor and the boards that we
are working they have multiple behavior
so I can choose the behavior by pressing
one button I can change the behavior of
the board like I can make my edge device
if I want to booze very fast just one
sensor or I can left my edge device as a
kind of cereal listener so it will be
waiting for requests about the sensors
and controlling the things so it's very
easy called Arduino is easing the
beginning but once you start putting
many
many different types of sensors you can
have problems in terms of timers
concurrence in terms of a multiplexing
like the analog ports in Arduino they
are multiplexed set and we try to solve
it to solve all this kind of problems
that we we are having the last seven
years in this nice piece of software and
just want to add something here this
multimode framework he told for people
who are familiar with I'd wena we wanted
to create a playground right a place
where you can play with the sensors and
and all that but as f 00 as all kids we
want to change the toy we are playing
right we don't want to play with the
same toy for the entire day so when you
are programming to add we know each time
you do a program like I just did a
breathalyzer then I'm playing with the
breathalyzer but then you want to play
with the relay so you need to connect
your Arduino board to your pc and upload
a new sketch and this is very annoying
so this idea of modes that Vinny showed
it's just to you to be able to upload up
to 10 different sketches to Arduino and
then when you press the button you
change the mode so you are able to play
a little bit with the breathalyzer then
change the mode without uploading and
change the sketch again and change it to
a relay control or a Twitter machine or
any other thing you want so that's the
beauty of this and we used to show the
Arduino but we have a version of this
framework for x86 boards and we have
also a more low level framework based on
a gmail AVR studio so we take it out
there do you know so we can have more
control over the resources that is very
limited like in my key in our case here
we have the ran the free ram that we
have here is
around two thousand and eight bytes of
freer and so that's very few so we have
the JSON protocol base it on the sensors
you have in your board we are going to
work with JSON protocol to read the
sensors so you will see that this code
will affect all the other all the other
layers of our architecture so after I
have this guy plug it in our gateway I
would be able to send the rest a rest or
MQTT message saying rad to 5050 and so
rad will be will be a on and so the gist
Jason protocol make it very simple to
start reading the data from MQTT or rest
and build your own web interface because
Jason is very easy to do in a hdmi and
jquery so that's the relation between
the what you are declaring in your
device and so with that we have
discoverable devices so i can plug the
cable and the gateway can ask who you
are and what do you have so we have this
framework to make it more easy to manage
in the in the real production and from
the edge and the gateway so here we have
the edge of the gateway and the JSON
messages coming through the MQTT and
rest protocol and with that we can have
any kind of MQTT client or subscriber we
can have any type of rest client android
java script no drat no dradis one
clients that I'm really enjoying so to
start playing with our devices in our
first demo we are going to use a client
for MQTT colored and qtt effects that's
from our friend gems and thanks to dance
for
doing a great job with Java facts and
this is the best MQTT client in my
opinion is free to download and this
javabe is eclipse abajo using eclipse
abajo api should to work with MQTT so
let's go to the demo before showing the
that gateway I'm going to connect to the
to my MQTT broker as you can see here we
are using the IOT dot eclipse.org which
is a public and open MQTT broker anyone
can go there actually if you know the
name of my kills you could be able now
to control all my devices is not good
idea please don't do it at least now but
just for people that are not familiar
with MQTT if you are familiar with JMS
then they said it is the same right but
for IOT so it's published subscriber we
just publish things on a certain queue
and if you are interested you subscribe
to that Q and get information so I'm
going to connect to the broken and i
have my queue here and what I'm going to
say is surfboard 0r at 255 and publish
and for sure doesn't work ok let's try
another one surfboard one ok here we go
this is working so very fast if you if
you keep in mind that we are going to
the cloud and back in here so publish
very fast let me check here just don't
mean it sorry
so let's do another demo like I'm going
to say surfboard 3g relay 1 so now what
we expected is to turn on the light so
we take more time because we are going
to the cloud over the 3g connection so
we have some delay so again this
surfboard is on on 3g on 3g because it's
using gemalto surfboard which is behind
and have the sim card yea unsigned let's
try to turn it off publish here we go we
can see the delay ok and since we have
different devices let's play with like
this guy rat 255 and let's try to turn
it on publish read here right this guy
don't want work for some reason ok right
here and read here perfect and now let's
turn it off so we can see that this guy
is very fast and there we take more time
to turn off the the red light it's not
my fault and let's do some noise here
speaker 1 now other three devices are
working and you can now you can list
them to the to the Layton's look that
the 3d the 3g was the last one so thanks
like a mobile it's performing great at
least until now they like a mobile is
the the sim card we just buy for nothing
like 10 euros and amazing so that's MQTT
effects and I'm controlling my stuff
here using MQTT in a very easy way now
let's look at
subscribe let's subscribe some data from
a surfboard one which is this one so in
the surfboard one each five seconds i
have a new sample coming so here we go i
have the JSON data and now you already
understand our talk now we are going to
just make interfaces between twice MQTT
and our gateway that can talk with our
edge device so it's very simple it's
just seven years of work and looking but
it's very simple now so we are
subscribing and receiving the date of
the data here for like a surfboard 3g we
are receiving each sample for each 30
seconds to avoid spending a lot of 3G
connection so it's amazing that when you
start doing iot projects you start
thinking about green energy green data
and green process because in the future
we are going to have so many devices
that you are going to buy a refrigerator
that set up this is green energy green
data and green process it means that it
the data grams that it that the
refrigerator sense to the internet is
not heavy if you start if everybody
started doing internet your things using
rest the internet will be very very busy
so sometimes j-zone can be heavy for
internet of things so you need to
calculate especially if you are running
on 2g or 3g so you can see here all the
data from our from our yamato surfboard
okay thanks God for the first demo
we have the IOT surfing service these
guys the the Java service is our code
and our hardware data they are open
source so if you want to use to
replicate and to help us to develop
please well you are welcome and IOT
surfing service we provide many types of
service like scheduling timers camera
audio video sensors MQTT rest ftp so is
a collection of very small services and
integrated services that makes a lot of
sense for most of the iot projects we
have in the market so here is a piece of
code so all the services they can extend
different classes depending on which
type of protocol you want to answer in
this case and showing a service that is
colored my service we have here we can
have some rest method here and we are
overriding the process message in the
process message is the message that we
are arrived through the NQ TT and for
each class sfc class you right you must
do a config file is a plaintext config
file and uh so here I am saying that
it's enable I don't have any kind of a
timer process so the interval 0 0 mean
that I I don't want to have something
running each 10 seconds and it will be
listening to the NQ t TQ global coach /
things / audio so in my net means you
can see here that we have many oops
which is surfing service we can have
many many different types of service
administration out your camera i square
CJ zone and q
cheese so is a very large collection of
classes that we have been developed and
the last year's so let's do a live demo
to show how does it work i'm going to
say now too i'm going to publish here i
will need the how'd you know and i'm
going to say audio and i'm going to call
a service that is colored my service
simple my service i'm going to call this
service what I'm going to do here is
just receiving the message with the name
of some sensor and I'm going to the
colonel to the colonel i'm going to say
give me all the devices and an a search
inside out devices for a component
colored like alcohol or colored light
and so if it finds it can find it will
say the value of the the censored father
so let's see if it's working so what I'm
going to say is to read the humidity
I'm doing something wrong here
immediately okay let's pass system
problem i will show this demo using the
google voice so so far doing the eyes we
are going to use today the intel
realsense which is a very nice camera
modern camera that's supposed to replace
your frontal camera in a few years with
gestures voice and a face recognition
for years and listening and a voice
recognition we are using android so the
google voice and we are using the tasker
and a tasket is a very nice a
application for android automation and
we are using auto voice and for the nose
we are using sensors like the alcohol
sensor and to the mouth we are using the
east peak which is this guy is peak is
an open source software that runs on
windows mac and linux support different
language and we r is a cuting using
shell commands we don't have any kind of
java api for that and what i'm going to
do now to show this guy i'm going to
stop my iog surfing service and i'm
going to start again i will need out you
again welcome to surfing IOT services
yeah it seems that you are pairing with
Stephen how so but it's a great service
and now what I'm going to do we have our
service running and what I'm going to do
is to plug my surfboard again and you
can see the process of boards discovery
running in background so it will find a
try to find earth at the port so
connection established
starting to hug you but one plugged into
surfing elt so it could say the
surfboard one plug it so it's very nice
because a very useful to this guy
because if you have a raspberry pi
probably you have the problem that I
used to have that is you get into a
network and you don't know your IP
address and you don't have any screen to
plug in your Raspberry Pi so I did a
customization in my initialization
process in my linux initialization
process once the Raspberry Pi start it
it says they the IP address to me so
it's a very simple and useful thing to
do with this guy so now it starts
sending each five seconds the data so
actually the Java is saying to the
Arduino Arduino sensors and Arduino is
answering the Jays own content and we
are publishing the messaging the MQTT
for voice recognition we are using this
guy Tasker Tasker total automation
someone have a red user tasker okay okay
we can we can make a usergroup Tasker is
very nice you can like do anything if
this then that if the CPU is this
percentage and I'm running I receive a
message you then do that so you can
combine any kind of thing we just use it
at the outer voice plugging and MQTT
plugin for tasker and let's try to this
is a very critical demo so I'm going to
open my Tasker here and ask to recognize
my voice
humidity humidity values 28.00 so we can
start talking with my computer let's try
something different here noise let's see
oops start noise
stop noise
thanks God so cool stuff the voice
recognition I tried with intel realsense
we we have the support in the inning the
camera but it's not that good for me the
only one that is really usable is the
google one so i'm having very good
experiences with that I can do
automation saying move the server to 10
degree and I can extract the number in
the sentence so you can do very complex
applications with a tasker and a google
voice recognition congratulation to
google for such nice work sure that if
you have a good a very good internet
quality like the internet here is
amazing for a conference of this size
and you will have better results the
precision really depends on the quality
of the internet connection so intel
realsense intel realsense you can a
sense hands face speech and also the
environment is like connect but is much
more for short distance recognition like
faces Express a face expressions and so
you can you have multiple points to
recognize your hand like you can make
gestures like click these these these
these so you can make gestures like
these so it's very very nice a toy
especially because if you think that in
three or four years they want to replace
your tablet camera for this camera so
this project is not just from Intel the
camera actually that is who is building
the camera is the creative but it will
be in the markets very very soon it will
be very popular so if you are writing an
email with a very high
we expression angry expression you can
have some intelligence saying okay keep
this email wait 30 minutes more and so
you can't do this kind of intelligence
you know which can be very useful for
people that have a heavy fingers you
know I colors have fingers so in the
face you can you can recognize movements
and expressions and you have the SDK
this is a very new product from Intel
and we are partner from Intel d they
used to give us the hardware other hype
harder they produce in Brazil they give
us to test and we have the SDK the SDK
is working with Java but is much better
nowadays with C sharp but they these two
making good progress in the Java SDK so
you can do unity c-sharp processing and
Java interface with intel realsense so
let me show you the java fax integration
with intel realsense so I have here some
samples no my friend colored Philippi
Pedro's he is from the zoo he works for
Intel and he is one of the guy that is
very specialist in in real scenes all
around the world so I'm going to execute
this guy and so now with my fingers I
can move the cube and like DS and DS
like it
very simple but just to show the concept
so how the code is available if you call
up if you google real sense demos
application and credits to Philip so
what we are doing we did an application
that converts the gestures to and qtt so
what I can do is use gestures to control
my stuff and the gestures will send the
commands relay one speaker one red and
so you can make this kind of combination
this is the the user interface sorry is
still in dotnet but we are migrating to
Java since the last sdk for java is very
good and very stable and so let's open
this guy and let's so i want to connect
to this server this is the queue I want
to target my surfboard 3g no I want to
target all the surfboards and if I make
this I want a speaker if I make this
speaker off so let's open the debug
window and let's start recognizing let's
see
I the 3g other 3g was the treaty here so
and this to exit okay and now let's have
more fun let's say that my first talk
here in 2011 I was it was all about
turning on and turning off a lampe using
Java I show many different ways to turn
on and turn turn off a lamp I'm still
doing the same thing with different
technologies and so now let's start try
to turn on the lamp using this mile and
turn off the lamp using the surprised
expression
it's all about fun but you can really
have you can really have a commercial
applications for this kind of thing we
are just showing to inspire the people
here let's turn it off again good
sometimes when we have many lights the
camera can be like more sensitive okay
so that's the eyes of your i OG project
and so to finish we have the last with
with in our top we said iced earth and
mouth but we have the nose and we have
the alcohol sensor and i was thinking
that going to bilgin the beers land and
not drinking a beer during my top would
be a fail you know so i prepared a
demonstration here where we are going to
have the concept of reading the data
from from reading them MQTT sensors data
from your website so the pahu api for
MQTT for javascript is very very easy
and powerful this is the code that you
can use to start your connection and
once you connect you can subscribe so
i'm subscribing the things surfboard one
and so once the message arrived you can
just make all the JSON parsing and grab
the data that you are looking for and
analyze the data so let's open my
website so i have my very very regular
website i'm just going to refresh index
/ devoxx this is a special version of
our website
and I'm going to drink a beer a name of
science so okay thanks God that's a nice
beer hey oh here we go someone is
drinking alcohol at devoxx so that was
our our demos I'm very happy that
everything is working now what I'm going
to do is to open this guy here and here
just to be clear we could do it
bidirectional communication as well so
we could you know make that board
clickable and then from the web you
control the board and from the board you
control the website okay so we have some
shown you today I know today is two of
them no today's friday 13 13 notes are
no questions here so how many are dis is
from yesterday yes I was here so we are
open to answer your question here we go
you can have many strategies for that
like having airplane mode having a sleep
mode and once you stop accessing your 3g
connection it will put two asleep and
once you have some new sign up coming it
will take a little bit more to start
communicating after that it will be hot
again so you have many many different
types of configuration that you can do
for that okay fine on a presentation
presentation so our github I have my
personal github where I do many things
in an organized way sometimes and the
github from surfboard is a is being
organized and publishing nuke the new
versions of our code so you are welcome
to clone our codon start playing with
that and so if we don't have more
questions I would like to say thanks for
all the audience see you around next
year thank
but we still can handle questions if you
want if you have yes here we are just
showing several different connections
but in the helmet we we were using 3g
teetering for instance so that's really
nice to have as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
