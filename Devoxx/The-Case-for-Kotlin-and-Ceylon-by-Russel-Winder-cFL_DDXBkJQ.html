the case for cotton and salon so you're
obviously in the right place because
that sign was up initially I had thought
actually of calling it jar very stagnant
thankfully we have cut and sit on
actually stagnant was a pleasant word I
thought something else but wasn't
printable but now I thought let's just
go with the case for cutting and salon
sounds all vaguely legal though in a
courtroom type thing so let's present
some evidence well first I guess we have
to introduce the person I involved in
this and you will notice I am very ex
yeah okay so I'm not yet an ex person
I'm still being nailed to the chair to
sit upright not very many people into
Monty Python okay right well that's the
whole load of jokes are gone
yes I'm retired therefore I have no
agenda I'm not trying to push my
consultancy or a particular product also
this is pure opinion in some sense that
I'm giving evidence and so I don't care
who I offend and the defense of advocate
as you can see is completely and totally
missing so if you feel I'm being
over-the-top do come in and say no
that's wrong or something of that sort
no rotten tomatoes no swear words but
you are the jury I'm here to try and
convince you at least to go and have a
look that's that's really the purpose of
this so it's to convince you that there
might be something for you to go and
have a look at so that's my goal
first though we need a bit of a prologue
not everything there is a huge
difference between Java cotton and salon
and I'm just skimming the surface we've
only got like forty seven point five
minutes so it needs to be a surface
coverage I hope I've picked out a few
points that really got me interested in
these language differences so let us
begin the case for the offence Java is a
tedious the old programming language
it's been around since I know 1991 okay
it was called oke then it wasn't even
called Java then Java really 1994-1995
therefore it's 22 years old it's allowed
to drink beer clearly though it's not
old not in the sense that I'm old
mostly because I predate Fortran which
most of you probably don't so old here
I'm using as a relative term in terms of
the history programming languages over
the last 20 years but he's very
definitely steeped in to the imperative
and object-oriented histories and I'm
kind of assuming that you folks know a
bit of Java and the terms imperative and
object-oriented pull on your world
knowledge so I'm no real intention of
trying to explain those terms and Java
as we know how many years between
releases
yeah a few it used to be like Fortran
and C++ you got a new one every 10 years
at least they'd sped that up a little
bit though
one hears rumors that Java 9 won't be
appearing in July I think my most
important point that I'm going to
present is that Java is not keeping up
with the progress in programming
language design and what software
development actually is having said that
though the Java platform the JVM itself
I want to separate from Java the
language ok jar JVM was invented to
enable Java but I think as we got here
it's not just Java
we've got scholar we've got the cotton
insulin I'm going to talk about and
Frager anyone interested in that I'm
doing a two hour session tomorrow
morning that will involve Frager and I
don't think many people actually use
phantom nor gosu nor Golo anybody using
jython is doing it wrong ooh
groovy appears here and here anybody
spotted what the top line is versus what
the bottom line is
I can hear people sort of trying to
mutter the right words it's all about
static compilation versus dynamic
compilation as it were and so yeah the
lower line is the dynamic languages
where what they really mean is compile
time type checking and the top line is
compile time type checking you do it all
and and groovy appears in both and I'm
just going to leave that hanging okay so
we've got to have a little bit of
philosophy because you just have to do
philosophy and so we want to ask the
question is change good so a bit of
audience participation because how many
people think change is a good idea
quite a lot of you how many people think
change is a bad idea
yes I'm kind of split down the middle
here really and but it has to be said
not many people thought change was a bad
idea let's unpack that a little bit
though is change good well I'm going to
claim that change threatens backward
compatibility and as we know in Java
language even and even more in JVM
development backward compatibility is
seen as a sacrosanct thing if in Java 9
you cannot compile and run 1995 Java 1.0
something is wrong apparently on the
other side of the fence of course change
new knowledge new techniques new tools
new ways of doing things how do we make
software development easier and nicer
for ourselves and so we've got yes and
no I'm going to actually challenge this
backward compatibility thing basically I
think it's a crock of f
where would be be if we didn't go with
some change well how many people
actually like coding in machine code
yeah not many III used to know the pdp-8
and pdp-11 bootstrap loaders and you
just sort of toggle them in and that was
it that was the end of my machine code
like assembly language yeah I guess if
you're doing really really low-level
things like trying to in operating
systems trying to do context which means
really quick you don't do it in C
because C is just too damn slow you do
an assembly language but out of that
people say we've got to develop we've
got to improve our languages improve and
we ended up with or on this side Fortran
and no wrong Fortran Fortran is not the
same as Fortran Fortran 1 1957 I think
Fortran 95 1995 they're different
lengths well now they're not different
languages but now forget that one up
here of course we've got the one true
language the last language 1954 I think
so you know the world ended in 1954
really yeah okay but change where have
we ended up well Java comes along in
here yeah it's not procedural and I
suppose you've got things like Pascal
and I go you've got C++ in here C in
here I guess though actually C is really
down here so this assembly language it's
portable
whatever but where do you go from object
oriented given it's wrong everyone when
night when late 80s Early 90s everyone
said object oriented is the only way to
do things you have to be object to it
and nobody knew what it was
well some people did and they charge my
underpants an hour trying to tell you
about it and of course during the same
time we got miranda kcl kid sorry KRC
hope language like that led to Miranda
sewing room Haskell and Haskell became
if you like the poster child of the
functional languages even though this is
really the poster child functional
languages and then which language filled
that gap people afraid to speak out but
yes absolutely
I heard the lips move scarlet is trying
to be a step on from Java by changing
things by progressing our understanding
instead of just being object-oriented
we're going to say well those folks over
there I've got some good ideas Haskell
was doing some good and so we've got
actually a move now pause I went too far
I got carried away
apologies backtrack a little bit
remember I said backward goo I will use
the word backward compatibility is evil
because it's the enemy of progress if
Java was all there was and we were still
stuck with Java and one we wouldn't
actually have Java not well we're
probably not going to get Java 9 yet but
we wouldn't have Java right and Java is
a significant improvement over Java 1
but we had to have change in order to
get there so if everything was all about
backward compatibility then we wouldn't
do anything we just have this with
backing machine code to be honest
because we wouldn't be allowed to
progress any further because of backward
compatibility I just as a footnote on
that if any of you know Fortran or COBOL
you can get a really good income from
either NASA or from the British
government both of whom have an awful
lot of Fortran code and all the Fortran
people who know Fortran have retired
either that or they're already dead and
so there's a desperate urgency for
Fortran programmers Java Platt it's an
air never mind let me be honest backward
compatibility is all about companies
refusing to move stuff on oh we've
compiled it it runs don't change it
leave it there forever more who are the
worst offenders of this CPD people
computational fluid dynamics and weather
people they've still got 1967 Fortran
codes that they require to run and so
the Fortran compilers have to in 2015
still have to be able to compile 1962
Fortran code now that is the death
caused by backward compatibility you're
not allowed to move on and those codes
you're not allowed to change break
because other people do progress
software doesn't exist in isolation it
exists in the world and there are other
things going on the latest one is going
to be HML HTML one HTML two there's
another that good compatibility thing
there's going to be a problem so
hopefully I've encouraged the idea that
backward compatibility in Java are
progressing Java is mutually
incompatible in
self and that we need to have breaking
changes and we need to move on so moving
on I want to reinforce this separation
of Java JVM and the Java platform and if
Java is not going to change and what can
we do aren't back to the question was
answered over there
scarlet see I moved too far on I was
going to put Haskell in here Java in
here and say what was that and it's
Carla but I already did that bit sorry
about that
lost the plot a bit back on track so
scarlet how many people actually use
Scala quite a lot ah we've already got
the yeah I mean a number of we shall not
name them but let's call them banks
throughout some of their Java code
pooled in lots lots of Scala code and
are now a bit worried because there's
not enough people who actually likes
Carla to fill the jobs that they've got
available so there's another place to go
Scala however can you stand it correctly
I quite like scar I just ignore 40% of
it many people actually really love it
that's great
that's fine I have no problem with that
at all and but many people really aren't
with it in the in the scalar sense and
that's the genesis of these two
languages thanks is that Scarlett didn't
become the successor to Java in that
little spot with the question nog so
here's a these are not necessarily the
best points for some people they're the
points that come to my mind when writing
a slide so we've got Kotlin you can
intermix Kotlin and java source codes
however you want and just compile it
that is a very nice big win for cotton
so it's lon on the other hand willing to
work with job but really they want you
to have a salon code place and treat
anything of Java as an external library
I think it works but it's a different
viewpoint of replacing Java and Collins
one is about incremental replacement
whereas salon is a little bit more big
bang :
influenced by Java groovy and Scala
groovy being the second best language in
the universe biggie okay I think I was
not able to be here this morning so I
didn't hear what happened about the JDK
9 and jigsaw and all that sort of stuff
hopefully it was good hopefully it was
memorable
what's more memorable is that salon has
had modules for ages the very outset of
salon was we want modules and we want
modules now we don't want to wait so
they didn't wait they put modules into
the language from the start
whether you like JBoss modules I don't
know but they're in there that's what
you get and that's a big plus for salon
for big systems it's already modular
Kotlin really nice type system in
comparison to Java and what's the big
thing no how many people like No yeah I
thought that would be the answer
occasionally we have to use it to get
out of band data from our calls you have
to return null to say fail or something
like that if you don't want to raise an
exception
well cotton
hits no head on and says most of the
types in katli do not allow null ability
if you want null ability you say it
explicitly in the code in the type
system and it's your problem so for
example in Kotlin there is a string type
you cannot null it so if you get a value
of string value of string type rather
you know it's non null if your if you
want to be I said I was going to be
aggressive partially insane you say oh
it might be a nullable string to be
perfectly honest you previously don't
want to go here unless you have to and
when you have to is when you're talking
with Java code directly and Java is
going to say oh here's a string it might
be another blue I don't care
encoding you care a lot in salon you
also care a lot so idea of nullable is
removed effectively from the language
and that is a huge win in my view may
not be in yours in my view it's one of
the big things about the type system
salon has taken actually further and has
included things like union types and
we'll have a look at those in a few
minutes I'll show an example so those
are just a couple of height well three
highlights from each language that
really get me excited about those the
other thing that untold get people
excited about these sort of languages is
that you can target either the JVM or
JavaScript apparently this helps with
end to end single language systems and
apparently that's good from those
people's point of view sadly I believe
in polyglot programming
so I'm not as sort of I must have the
same language end to end type person so
I'm I don't know ashamed to admit I
might actually be doing some es 2016
programming shortly because it's in the
browser actually to be honest I'm going
to using Elm
but I simply different topic but that is
an issue up there for cotton and salon
you can target the browser if you want
but most importantly their languages of
the last six or seven years and they've
had all past history to build on and so
they are as the saying goes standing on
the shoulders of giants so let's have
some code examples for the next twenty
minutes you've got to start with hello
world is traditional you just have to do
it sorry so here we have I am gone
you've got to guess the language so
what's what's the one over here okay
Java it's probably Java 4.3 or something
oh no that doesn't exist 4.2 I know
something like that I have no idea I
haven't written Java in like five years
okay anyone want to guess what this one
is excellent it actually shows you're
reading the code I love it
only which programmer reads comments
okay and so you know there's a little
pointer over here top-level functions
does Java have them no is Java ever
going to have them no backward
compatibility sod off I want my
top-level functions because I think in
functions I don't want to have to build
their class simply to have a function
that's the compilers job getting
compilers doing their work rather than
us the programmers doing if I want a
class I'll write a class if I want a
function I should be allowed to do that
if I want global data I should be
allowed to do it
it may come with red flags and warnings
saying are you being totally stupid yes
that's probably a question that needs to
be asked when dealing with global data
but are the times when you want it
sometimes yes
and if it comes with a final in front of
it that might be allowable because it's
immutable you'll notice that Salon have
taken a sort of more Ruby esque view of
documentation and stepped away from a
documentation comments so that actually
if you like annotations function calls
annotating the top level function that's
cool hello world's only got so much
going for it we could spend another ten
minutes on it there's a good 10 minutes
worth of stuff there but let us let us
move on just by summarizing that point
about the compilers and summarizing the
point that it's all about what I want as
a programmer the tools I want to put
into my program so another one we have
to do i you know flick a coin is it
Fibonacci is a factorial and so it's
factorial and at this point we cease
with the slides so you'll be glad we're
Nazis we'll come back to them but you
know death by PowerPoint slide is not
going to happen mostly because I don't
use PowerPoint joke didn't work never
mind
right so I changed glasses at this point
and the knife rose colored ones which
try and stop me getting me grains from
these
to these so I can actually see what's on
the screen the font size big enough at
the back cool so let's do some factorial
in salon first before we actually look
at the code itself oh I've already
compiled it that was a bad idea but it
does leave us with the source so we
don't have the standard maven rules
about you must have a followed by a main
or a test whatever slightly different
rules and the salon compiler wants the
source in sauce and then as we see here
UK or Grindr because I happen to own UK
door grinder so if anybody else uses
that as a package path I can can I sue
them now I can certainly go smack them
about the head with a wet fish or
something like that the important thing
is here that you don't actually need
package studies in your code now Java
1.0 why did they demand that you have
your source in a particular path and
then a package statement as well saying
the same thing twice what happened to do
not repeat yourself well that's a bit
unfair because you could have put all
your source in the same directory the
source wasn't structured in Java one it
still isn't in Java
eight you know backward compatibility
and all that sort of stuff
so the still on folks said well if we go
to structure our source code as well as
the compiled code and well that defines
the package that's cool so we actually
don't need this file which defines well
actually we don't need that one we do
actually need that one I'll show why in
a moment
here the definition of the module so you
your module structure is in the source
code it's not in the build system so
hopefully nobody's using ant know that
few of you're probably still using maven
even though it's sort of 1990s
technology some of you are probably is
in Gradle which is probably the right
thing to do I told you I was going to be
opinionated
mostly because I still think there's one
line of mine in the Gradle source but
never mind we want to go and have a look
at this source knowing note that we
don't know if it's sort of a story we
get down to there and get down to there
and we can have a look at this so more
the package and so it's just it's not
drawing it's still having to state the
package name but this is the interesting
bit
the shared by default packages are not
shared in other words they're only
within the module so shared says oh this
package it case viewable outside the
module modules directly built into the
language from the start what about the
module okay so we are targeting the JVM
with this module we are calling it or UK
or Grindr maps and of course zero point
zero point zero because the first item
it's okay now most people call it naught
point nor point one don't think when you
do the first one which is bad counting
because that's the second one I would
love to use Java nine but there are
still some issues with salon Gradle
calling with Java nine but I'm importing
salon math so salon dot math is a module
where is it
it's in the hood so
even has maven well actually suppose
maven has maven grade also has maven for
Gradle usually goes to J Center yeah
because Jason is just that much faster I
am told
anyway salon has heard
so when you say compile my module well
look at code minute it looks at the
module specification this module depends
on still on math go and get still on
math from the herd compile it and put it
in the place so very like maven and
salon maven and Gradle so what about the
actual code itself only call no record
it factorial in Ruby collies now we
could it factorial for some stupid
reason okay so there and do you know
that's a little bit too yellow I think
we deserve some coloring so we are going
to use the one through editor which is
we've got a remax sorry Sandman I bash
the volume ok so proper Emacs try doing
that in VIN okay so we're importing
salon math hole that's not the whole of
salon math that salon math holder
package from which we get whole whole
number zero one two yes big integer if
anyone of you thought we were going to
do factorial with integers or Long's
wrong we want to be able to calculate
factorial for the thousand and I bet if
you try doing that with integer Long's
you probably wrap round overflow about
20,000 times so prop
integers here ones you would use in
finance or proper maths we are involved
in big big numbers
I forgot my mouse rats never mind can
only wait so long
look here an example of this union types
this function can take a type which is
an integer or a whole why do we need
overloading when we've got proper type
system well that's that's actually could
be argued we could go the bar and
discuss that for about four or five
hours it is that deep an issue me I hate
overloading when I've got union types so
I I just fell for salon as soon as I saw
this the type system just works for me
it may not work for you personal
differences and obviously if you've got
union types you've got to be able to
distinguish them and so we have a way of
saying you know am i the whole number am
I the integer number and why is that
because at times whoops
you can't whoops
panic panic
if you're going to do that or that you
know the operators only louver loaded a
beat you can't in this particular
language say is an integer less than a
whole you can say integer less an
integer or hole less than the whole I
could have done it a different way but
for this example I wanted to show the
switch statement and so it's been a
little bit of an artifice no no okay and
what else we've got that's just validate
let's get down to a an iterative thing
when you get most people saying do me an
iterative version and you get four loops
now we don't like four loops we don't
like them a lot unless we absolutely
have to and you don't need them here why
not because you can reduce things okay
so I'm not going to go too deeply into
why this is bad and this is good if you
want more on that we'll have two hours
hands-on tomorrow
discussing the word declarative and it
will be discussion about both two really
depends on the word declarative have I
done a great enough sales job for
tomorrow 11:15 okay and variable salon
doesn't like variables so you have to
say variable if you don't say variable
it's a binding one-to-one binding
immutable forevermore so if I just said
hole total equals one you know like big
integer 1 equals whatever in Java you'd
have been able to change it you'd have
to go final
now despite me banging on about it for
ten years most programmers using Java
still don't use final anywhere near
enough so salon has certainly said
normal variables effectively a final
binding because that's the right thing
to do in a language which is worrying
ongoing about concurrency and
parallelism and very few Java
programmers don't do concurrency and
parallelism we could go on a little bit
further down here and have a look at the
whoops no way that the two recursive
things and anybody who thinks this one
is a good idea
okay the kind word is naive the other
word is first-year undergraduate anybody
seen doing this out there claiming to be
a professional programmer should
contemplate resigning and taking up a
new position in a completely different
field why because this is not tail
recursion and the only sane way of doing
recursion is tail recursion and that's
why we got this thing but it's still not
cool because JVM doesn't really do tail
recursion so recursion just a generally
bad idea scholars got a tail rec to try
and get rounded Kotlin has got a way of
trying to get rounded groove he's got a
way of trying to get around it don't
bother what you want to do is whoops it
is to go there higher-order functions
implicit iteration immutable data okay
that was factoid is three or four more
hours of stuff we could do on that this
is just a glimpse of the programming
language to give you an idea of a code
in a trivial example the
example itself the algorithm itself
doesn't need thinking about we were just
looking at the code so I am going to
switch not editors I'm just going to
switch from there - oh I can use -
kindly yes after so many years I still
can't cope with bash right Kotlin call
in very much a Gradle oriented language
or IntelliJ and I'm not going to get
into the jet brain sales thing and in
fact the JetBrains folk wouldn't either
Kotlin is a language separate from
IntelliJ it's just that the IntelliJ
people have really good support for
coming why because IntelliJ is being
rewritten in Kotlin bit by bit and
that's one of the big things for Kotlin
notices build.gradle dot kts none of
this groovy stuff the build script is
Kotlin so we can have a look at that so
here are Kotlin as a build script
replacing groovy what's the difference
Kotlin is compile time type checked so
this script as you write it will be
compile time type checked in a IDE that
supports that sort of thing in I don't
about eclipse I'm used in Young's but
certainly JetBrains
IDE idea does a very good job of that as
you can see I've got a whole load of
good stuff in there like test frameworks
if we had longer we could discuss test
frameworks salon is a very good one
colin has a very good one colin tests
and they both support the one true way
of testing this stuff which is property
based testing again hours and hours of
stuff's as a throwaway signpost property
based testing really important
these sorts of codes do you want to see
a little bit more than that and so we've
got a tree again and so back to the
dreaded maven structuring the separation
of main and test and cotton and all that
sort of stuff
but we live with it really it sort of
works and so let's let's use Emacs
because it's obviously the one true
editor so you go down to maths here and
we'll have a look at factorial simply
because no that was the wrong thing to
do that is a better thing to do is that
font okay cool so yes we do have package
statement not very dry very consistent
with Java so again highlighting that cop
in a stayed closer to Java salon has
done things a little bit more pure from
the outset we're pulling in just
straightforward Java things showing that
although Colin has a nice type system
it's doing things very harmoniously with
Java who look big integer 0 yeah we know
about that big easy to one room to dot
big int no we like that and if we got
chance we'll go and have a look at that
code
there's the validate here because
everything's being swapped into begins
so rather than work with whole or
integer as I did in salon and here I'm
going to enforce some overloading so
that we can deal with big integers
integers and longs for each of the
algorithms and tears that's just the way
it's done in this particular way code
code base and there's the for loop for I
in range in in a range
so I don't know where they got this from
Python or somewhere else I sort of think
I write Python it just turns out B
Kotlin sort of and notice total x equals
I big integer try doing that in Java
yeah and we can say
here is saying here's a complete
function it's a single expression and
that's again the pool salon has it in
some places I have didn't have an
example of it in that code but salon has
also picked up on this idea and then
scarlet championed it really and so they
were they were the first one in the game
2000 forage instead of always having to
have a open curly closed curly block you
can have a single expression so here's a
pool from the functional languages where
everything is an expression immutable
values create a value by evaluating
expression move it on and so we're
seeing that in these two locations the
overloads are defined as evaluation of a
single expression which calls the begin
to diversion yeah seems really nice like
it so that's the recursive one we can
move down fold I didn't show the fold
one in in the salon I showed reduce
reduce fold all very much the same idea
its internal iteration it's about being
declarative spam perhaps saying and I've
got a start point I've got the fold I
want to do in the initial condition and
I've got the closure or lambda
expression and that is to be evaluated
at each time around the loop and it's
basically a totalization
so T is the total Iser
and I is the instance for each time
around the loop yes sir sorry the
question there was why do I need the int
and the long overload and then is
because if you have a strong type
checking and you say zero so if I was to
say fold I've of zero zero is going to
be an int or long it won't convert up to
a big integer well this is the one we
need and you you don't get any built in
if I only had a long and gave it file
fold even zero it's a type error because
there's no automatic conversion from
Institute along with the literals you
have to say zero ale and I think we can
dispense with the threats about the
recursive stuff hopefully you've gone
away with that as a measure and how
about something ooh
ten minutes yeah okay so we've got a
choice let's throw it open to the
audience and a quick look at some real
stuff from some definition of real
anagrams program word count program
those in favor anagrams a few those in
favor of word count less in anagrams it
is then so we will have a quick look at
an aground as you can see I've done it
in a few languages not many Solano
Kotlin those in favor of salon 2 or 3
those in favor of cottage bloody hell
sorry guys I did try to get something on
their bottle now I think this is like
the Briggs it vote Cooper we've got the
will of the people
so Collins is a rat clean oh no no we're
not allowed to have No there we are
no detritus allowed so we've got in here
and our anagrams program and some
testing tools if I've got chance we can
open up the testing I'm going to ship
all of these codes onto github subtly
morning so everything will be available
on github all of those languages I just
want to keep them slightly secret until
after tomorrow and so anagrams so let's
let's have a look at the actual source
code again its summary
I'm not going to massive detail but
these codes will be available you can go
and have a look at them some more so
what's the most important thing about
dealing with anagrams is that you've got
some main function and notice the word
fun I hadn't stressed that before
so we've Kotlin you always have fun you
do not have an option and here is
following the scale of Pascal I think
people notice that before types
following a colon after the name of
variable and vowels
I'm sorry valve are scarlet Colin you
got it wrong there's just not enough
cognitive difference between Vallon bar
the variable thing in salon so much
better
but anyway Valon bar it is Val a binding
immutable can't change it VAR variable
you can change it it's good that we have
these things explicitly
no type specification but strong type
checking at compile time so the masses
of type inference going on here so we
can guarantee that dictionary is a
mutable set of string because we said so
you've initialized it that's it you know
the type and some if statements else is
yeah we just selecting between whether
we're choosing a file or doing some args
mapped file i.t how low sequence of
files from the command line
or just one but then you get this
chained thing you know in Java right
finally got that stuff with streams a
little didn't go far enough
call insulin Scala we're already there
already had it done properly but notice
here we've got a dot filter so we're
doing the standard filtering out just
give me the files and then for each of
those files do something so that and
fluent way of working is very much core
to call in and salon and scarlet and
streams processing in Java
we've still got Wiles and all that so
that's all fairly normal type stuff and
we just say find the anagrams of some
word in some dictionary and then print
them all out so the hard work is being
done in the I'm not sure what's going on
here right okay let's essentially do it
the hard way so those were the the fun
permutations right no mind and we doing
it with a word we're delivering a set of
strings and so if we've got some ifs and
else's but in the end you've got a
couple of for loops permutations is an N
squared thing and you can get get out
but it is fundamental in end squared
thing so you're going to be having two
four
one way or another and I've chosen to
express it as full of because for me
that was the natural way of doing it the
you could have done it with foreach but
I chose this way that gives you an idea
of these these are the functions that
come out of it
find anagrams oh why didn't I do that as
a single equals evaluation of expression
I don't know I'm going to go and hit
myself over the head off with a fish a
few times after this session and then
you get the dictionary of pads and
things like that you know reading a line
if I O in Java why all those caches and
finally is and for goodness sake it's a
failed experiment give up on it checked
exceptions out go not wanted so anyway
we read a line I'm just being a bit
blase here not worrying about the
exceptions because I don't actually care
whoa no new key word just a trivial
little thing but coming from my Python
background love it why bother with new
just yet in the way the name of the type
specifies you're going to construct an
instance of the type why bother with a
new keyword very very 1960s which fits
with the music we were hearing earlier
oh well and so just quickly I've gotten
about a minute just to show you a few
tests so if we go to source test and do
the anagrams okay so here we have a nice
way of testing these anagrams so Kotlin
test and
and you serve for all generate set of
word like strings okay so the function
somewhere that gives me an iterable over
word like strings ten of them of length
10 and for all of those make sure that
this expression is true now this is the
one-off example we'll see of effectively
property based random data generation if
you're not doing this form of testing
you should there are actually ways of
doing in Java I will leave you to find
that out I will tell you this way way
easier in : it's also ways you're in
salon but it's way way easier in : and
here we are
string spec from Kotlin tests huge width
throw away all your Java tests do
everything in Kotlin you can test Java
codes we call in just like you can test
Java codes with Java where's the loss
however my time is coming to a close so
I must bring this to a session because
you're all thirsty and there's beverages
outside and I'm absolutely certain that
you offer I know I am and I may even
well have a beer ok so a big 8 C++
Python got operator overloading it's
good in the 1990s the progenitors of
Java decided that you the programmer
were incapable of dealing with operator
overloading that I find complete absurd
arrogance so they took it out the
language and every other JDM language
since has put it back I think
this tells us something
language evolution by language evolution
is hard because of backward
compatibility and the people who insist
upon it so let's do the get round it and
say let's just replace it so let's go
for a new language instead of using an
old language and the JVM is a beautiful
place to do this and salon and Kotlin
are two of the examples that do that
there are some headlines here and sorry
I've got flashing red light here so I'm
just about to be yanked off stage I'll
put the slides up so if you need these
you can get them and yeah I mean Java
rayon and Android maybe in 10 years time
I don't need to say anything to that one
I bet nobody's going to do it you just
need is coding and I believe that that
is the case for Kotlin and for salon
