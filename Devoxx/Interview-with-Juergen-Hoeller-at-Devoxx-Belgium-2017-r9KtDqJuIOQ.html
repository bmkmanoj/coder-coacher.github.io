to you again halite we're going to talk
about spring so we have a lot to talk
about
indeed we'll keep it to a few things so
maybe and so Java this morning in the
keynote Mark Twain wrote about changed
the cadence of the releases so we're
going now going every six months we're
going with a minor release of Java or
not necessarily minor but not long term
a release family so how does that impact
spring how does that impact your project
it is it will impact everybody right in
one form or the other in particularly
the open source ecosystem we've already
been trying actually with each ad
Catania on the excess billed from last
week so we already know a little bit
about the impact it it is it is a very
ambitious effort on and and could also
the opportunity a team for kind of
stepping up to the times and and having
a more agile release model but
personally my my impression is that II
it's a little too radical at this point
I would have appreciated a one year
cadence over a half-year cadence but it
is what it is right and I'm very openly
embracing any outcome of of what they
end up with next year so we are planning
already with the assumption that JDK 10
comes out in March and JDK 11 in
September that's going to be a new
bytecode version in every one of those
releases so we'll have to be prepared in
terms of all the byte code generation
libraries and in the stack they have to
be able to handle being deployed to JDK
10 this is non-trivial right there's a
lot of traditional assumptions in the
Java ecosystem like ASM rejecting
unknown bytecode versions the we have to
get more lenient they're like the tools
and frameworks and libraries that we're
providing have to assume that there
might be a new JDK coming up underneath
them without them without the revision
at the framework or library level so
just an open-ended lenient assumption of
try to do your job even if you're
running on an unknown new JDK I guess we
can get there but it will need a little
bit of a bubble through the ecosystem
where this this approach towards running
on utility conversions
aligns with the open JDK plans with the
half-year iterations but in any case to
me it is a very from my perspective and
from a spring application developers
perspective this has to be seen as a
very good thing we're going to get new
language features while we're knocking
getting more new language we just we're
getting language we just in between
right where we know we don't have to
wait an entire full 3/4 year period we
can get them if we are interested in
them more more eagerly in between that's
the one side of the coin the other side
of the coin is of course we know it's
all about production right and we know
that in production decision-making in
production just has to take into account
the support timelines I I have the fear
that the decision-making out there in
the industry is going to be between
long-term support releases only sorry
this model of in between you have to
update your JDK and to a new bike
conversion everything that follows every
half year it's not it's not feasible for
a production scenario so my assumption
is that it's JDK 8 JDK 8 is basically
the new JDK 6 now the one baseline that
everybody works with for a long long
time even in five years we're going to
have plenty of JDK 8 deployment and mom
it's out there I'm sure and the next
chance is JDK 11 18 September next year
being a long-term support release again
hope hopefully at least that is being
being adopted more more easily I hope so
but it's not in our hands from from a
spring perspect if we take these
decisions as they are being made right
if the industry at large decides to stay
at educate level in in production then
so be it
we're going to support everybody where
they are right we're not trying to force
them anywhere
it's a balanced strategy right and and
the same the same of course applies to
to other infrastructure out there so the
I mean the with Java EE it's less clear
where it's going but it's it's just
clear that we are seeing the end of Java
EE as we know it so Java EE 8 probably
was the last traditional Java platform
revision and the the continuation of
those those specification efforts is now
to be found in foj at eclipse my
assumption is that it's going to be a
more individual affair now servlet spec
the JPA spec bean validation checks RS
they are going to see more of a life of
their own than before that can be a very
good thing I mean previously some of
those specifications were not allowed to
release to go final before the platform
went final right so now hopefully once
the servlet for that one group decides
that it's worth releasing so--but for
that one hopefully they just can write
in a reasonable time frame not waiting
on anybody else I see that as a very
positive thing I hope it materializes it
has yet to happen it's still in the very
early stages the decision-making
processes are unclear it's let's see
what this is going but our Tomcat group
is very actively engaged in the Soviet
spec of course and so we there's
definitely some some goodness coming out
of this but it has yet to be seen how it
it will work in practice without this
overall governance that Oracle used to
provide it means that there has to be
more individual contribution more more
abilities they called thinking in there
that that traditionally wasn't there and
it's a Oracle did a reasonably good job
in in in guidance as well right there's
now a lack of guidance so it means that
every every stakeholder kind of needs to
make up their own perspective in terms
of what they actually want out of the
further evolution of e4j and then
aligning that aligning their own
perspective with the interests of others
that is a not an easy exercise
interesting social dynamics waiting to
be uncovered there I'm sure
and just stay cold interests between the
likes of redhead and and IBM of course
and so let's see where well this is
going but the our our strategy in in
spring land is basically the same as
always we we we just take the industry
as it is in particular the production
landscape currently everybody's on an e7
baseline there's basically other than
Tomcat nine known ei production so ever
really out there yet and we'll we'll
just observe where it's going so
currently seven baseline e8 supports if
we encounter it at run time that will be
with us for several years I'm sure and
any further updates in in the irrelevant
specifications are to be yeah to be
adopted when they're out we are always
there very early but in practice the
only thing that matters is when people
actually use it in production that's
usually years after us supporting them
so let's see right it always goes in a
circle I personally believe that the the
the the critical part here is the
availability of products right how can
you expect anybody to upgrade to a new
trade ek or a new application server
generation if they don't get proper
support for it first of all there needs
to be a proper product release and the
support online attached to it then and
only then decision makers can can start
up start planning for the upgrades that
applies to application service just as
much as to the JDK it's not taken then
yeah but interesting times a big task a
big task on the on those on your part it
certainly is but not just on our part
right so the that that's a key that's
the key message in its own right this is
really an ecosystem effort those things
can only work out like JDK Basin
operates application server or server
containing upgrades whatever they can
only work out if the ecosystem as a
whole kind of moves in that direction
so it's not just we're trying to do our
part and we're trying to to help others
right or push others a little but we can
only go so far in the end we're very
pragmatic about this and actually pretty
happy with the baseline that we have
there's a lot of innovation to be seen
on JDK right it's not like we absolutely
require operates at that level the
reactive story functional API design
there's so much innovation to be to be
uncovered still perfectly working on a
JDK it's baseline right so let's let's
not be a net let's not feel constrained
by by the unavailability of new
generations in production we don't we
certainly don't wait on anything in
particular and just do our thing for the
time being and adopt new new
infrastructure generations este este
materialized and now looking at spring
boots you have a major release of spring
boot coming up in December
oh yes how's that going heavy lifting
they're still it spring boot to the
dough has scheduled to go GA in December
still probably as a Christmas present
literally we have our spring one
conference in the first week of December
so it's going to be in the release
candidates they just stand and hopefully
GA before Christmas till spring boot to
the dough is our single most important
deliverable this year and I'm saying
that that's the spring frame of project
right Spring Framework five to Tokyo of
course was an important a very important
step in its own right but we we
understand that a lot of our ecosystem a
lot of our user base has spring booth as
it's starting point right so the
availability and of all of this in
spring boot to the dough spring from at
five spring security five integration
five all being all coming together in
spring food to the dough is an essential
step to take
but of course take a deep breath we need
to take a deep breath right then and
just go there I'm really looking forward
for spring boot to the dough to be fully
available and in the meantime I just I
recommend trying the latest milestone or
the
coming released candidate one they do a
perfectly fine job for everybody in
development but I'm really looking
forward to its production availability
