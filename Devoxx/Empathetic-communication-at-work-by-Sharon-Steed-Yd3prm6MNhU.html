am extremely tired I had to fly all
night and then yeah it has been a long
weekend but I am you know just really
pumps to be here and I'm excited to talk
to you guys so let's just jump on in so
everyday communication is incredibly
chaotic we are constantly bombarded with
so many different types of just weird
information right like I saw this
headline and I'm like are you kidding me
really are you kidding me right and then
there's other things that we see that we
probably you don't totally agree with
right so all of these things are coming
at us all of the time and we see these
things and we're like oh look I have
more information now that has to go in
this brain and I have to hear these
things and it's in here and then I have
to do all of these other things in my
life right like I have to you know like
hang out with my friend I have to go to
work I have to do things I have to be
productive however we have all of this
information all the time and it is just
completely insane all of this chaos it
comes at us all of the time right and so
chaos is going to kill productive
communication because chaos is only
going to breed more chaos right so how
do we fix this how do we make
communication just a hundred times
easier well I'm going to talk about that
and you know some other things as well
but first I'm going to tell you that I
have a speech impediment I stutter and
so I talk about stuttering and
pretty much yeah hmm pretty much every
single talk I give because first of all
like I just have to you know help people
about it right it makes me feel like
very uncomfortable and insecure and so I
have to just be like look here is you
know this uh
thing I know that it's weird I know that
I sound weird and so I just have to be
open about it
right I have to be transparent because I
have to feel more comfortable right
and so yes so I I you know do that
because I am you know taking ownership
right I spent I would say 25
you you you you you you you you you you
you you you years just being like oh no
no like I'm fine I don't stutter right I
tried to conceal it I try to you know
has not talked to people because I was
so uncomfortable about it
right and so I was trying to you know
like avoid this thing however it was
just causing a lot more insecurity it
was causing a lot more fear and I was
giving it all of my power and so by
taking ownership I am taking a lot of
that power back and the other reason why
I talk about it is because I can you
know talk about it right I know that I
view it as this like weird thing I view
it as this thing that just makes me feel
awful about myself how
where I realize that you know it can be
kind of interesting and people do you
know have questions about it
right and so and so and so the other
piece there is that if I'm talking about
it I make other people feel more
comfortable also talking about it and so
the reason why I like being parents
parent is so important is because you
know that conversation right I'm
allowing people to be a part of that
conversation as well I know that there
was a time in my life when any time any
person would try to talk about
stuttering I would just be like no no no
I am not comfortable talking about this
I'm not going to talk about this No
however like that just makes all
conversations incredibly awkward and
incredibly uncomfortable and so if if if
if if there is a conversation then you
know people just feel more comfortable
and then and then being transparent it
also you know like makes people feel
comfortable to talk about you know to to
talk about and in insecurities and and
the and the things that they struggle
with and this is important because um
because being able to talk about like
these things being able to talk about
you know vulnerabilities like that is
going to open the door to keeper
conversations and to better connections
okay and so this is me and I'm around
three years old I know I am totally
adorable and this is around the time
that I began to stew stutter and so I
show this picture because you know
here's me then right I'm like you know
like this tall I'm you know just a kid
and I'm just like hanging out and I'm
having fun and even you know back then I
was concerned about my communication and
so I had already begun to kind of form
these communication peers and
communication you know pricks who we're
like okay I can't say you know key words
and so I am going to completely avoid
all words that begin with T I'm not
gonna say teeth I'm not gonna say Tom
I'm gonna find any other way
to say yeah you know I'm I I I thrust my
piece right it's really hard I'd be like
yeah like I brush like these things
better in my mouth right like it sounds
weird when you are you know a kid and
you're trying to you know figure out how
to communicate and you just can't say a
ton of words okay
so again this is me I'm a kid this was
about I don't know 30 years ago and all
of that time in between like then and
you know here I have always had kind of
these fears around communication I've
always felt that you know I couldn't
really be a part of great conversations
because of my speech impediment and so
instead of talking to people I really
just paid attention to people and so I
just invested I would say all of my
energy into you know figuring out the
you know conversations styles and the
communication styles of pretty much
everybody right so a lot of that stuff
kind of came in the form of me just just
completely avoiding situations where I
where I was going to have to talk to
people and I know that that sounds weird
I know that that sounds like well how
could you get anything done like how
could you do anything well the answer is
that I didn't get a lot done and I
to a lot much because I was so afraid a
talk right and so and so eventually I
had to kind of you know come to terms
with with the fact that like okay this
is me I am I'm going to who's stutter
I'm going to sound weird and it's going
to take me I don't know probably 10 or
20 seconds longer to say things then you
know pretty much everybody else out
there and so you know I decided to you
know like try to quote-unquote like
overcome the fear of talking by pursuing
public speaking opportunities I know
that sounds weird as well like hey like
I'm afraid to swim I'm going to jump in
the deep end with a ton of sharks but I
guess that's just who I am I go bigger
or I go home and so I began speaking
about this about it was in 2014 and so
the first couple of talks I gave were
about just stuttering and patience and
and stuttering and like creating content
and stuttering and scales okay right
like like yes talks on stuttering as
it's
as it as it as it relates to business
type of concepts okay and so I gave I
would say like four or five talks and so
people you know they kind of kept coming
up to me and saying like hey I you know
I appreciated
that you talked about oh sorry it is
again really jet-lagged and I'm not
breathing so I'm not gonna breathe for
the next like two and a half hours this
is going to be great so so um people
would come up to me and and and pay that
they just appreciated that I talked
about the importance of empathy and I
thought that was weird because I had
just spent like you know 40 minutes
being terrified and being exhausted and
stuttering in front of like a hundred
people and talking about everything else
and I never said empathy one time and so
yeah and so I just didn't like
completely understand like okay like how
did I get here like I don't see how you
got anything about empathy out of you
know out of a talk I just gave about
scales and patience but eventually I
kind of just was like okay well it
doesn't matter like what I talk about
there is a concept empathy that people
just keep you know coming back to and so
I decided that I was going to you know
just just to everything I could to
to to figure out like what this whole
empathy thing was and and yeah I am now
here talking about empathy so what are
we gonna do today it is going to be a
deep dive on communicating with empathy
and so I'm gonna start big right like in
order to communicate with Impa the-- you
have to know what communication is and
and and and you know figure out what
empathy is right and so I'm gonna talk
about those big concepts first and then
I'm gonna go down into the weeds and
talk about different you know types of
communications yeah and and so then
we're going to do a couple of you know
exercises on a couple of the things that
we talked about so you are going to have
to talk to people but only twice I
promise and only in the first half of
the workshop so so
why don't you guys go ahead and just
talk to a couple of people and just you
know tell them you know your company
your job position and then who things
that that that you would like to get out
of this deep dive so I'll give you guys
until nine fifty five to do that thank
you
okay we're gonna get back into this how
was that like was it fun I know I get
like like oh god I have to talk to
somebody like it makes me really nervous
but was that good for you guys
good awesome glad everybody liked it
okay so the first thing that we're going
to talk about today is the definition of
the you know the the big topic the big
idea right so I go to a ton of
conferences I would say probably at
twelve of them probably in six months
every single years that's what like 20
to 25 a year and so I hear like - you
know pretty basic definitions of
empathy right and so the you know the
big one I hear a lot is is to is to
understand you know people right so um
you know so and uh I'm gonna try this
again okay so the first one is is a
basic dictionary sort of a definition
right and then these second one I hear
and I hear this all the time I would say
ten times more is that it is a thing
that you have to do in order to not make
your company the worst place ever and
people get passionate about this right
and look I kind of agree with it however
I don't think that it you know has
anything to like push people to be to be
could be better empaths right
and so um something kind of came to me
like okay like how do I teach people
this right because like because you know
because empathy isn't really like a
correction right it's this kind of like
big idea it's this thing that like
people you know can can can kind of
comprehend however it's pretty difficult
to be like
okay right step one step two step three
and so I you know tots of thinking I'm
like okay like comparable concepts right
like there there has got to be a
comparable concept okay and so I was
like okay cool I've totally got it and
it's being in love and so yeah like I
have been in love I know that probably
you know people in here have have have
have experienced it and like in the
beginning it is the coolest thing ever
you are so excited you're so happy this
is the greatest person in the world and
you have to tell them every single day
and you write stupid ridiculous 8,000
character text messages because this
person is so great like look at this
this is complete nonsense but it's
really sweet and it's being in love and
we've all been in love right and then
you do things like this you just wear
dumb ugly outfits because you think it's
gonna be cute but it's so much fun
because I'm in love and this is the best
person ever ever hashtag period amazing
and then you know some time goes by and
all of a sudden it's like wow I'm kind
of annoyed by this one thing you know
that you do and I mean no I mean like I
still think you're the best person ever
but it's like this one thing that you do
it's kind of like oh it's not really
cute anymore and then we eventually come
to a point where we are just like why do
I have to deal with this person every
day because I choose to deal with this
person every day I love this tweet I've
actually told this to my partner like no
I'm not gonna eat that for dinner and so
after some time it's like oh hold on I
have to try at this thing I have to work
at this I have to you know to to choose
to you know be with this person every
day I have to choose to be patient I
have to choose to be kind I have to
choose to be in in tested every day
right and so if you if you if you if you
think about it right as a noun it's this
big idea it's this awesome
you know oh my god I feel amazing right
as a verb it's a choice right and it's a
choice you know
that you have to make Kaylee great and
so if we take this back to being
empathetic right empathy as a noun it's
a big idea it's an awesome idea right
empathy has a verb it's a choice so a
lot of people confuse you know like this
big idea this big concept with sympathy
however I just want to clear some things
up now right being sympathetic is just
feeling sorry right it's like oh I'm so
sad for you because x-rite be king being
empathetic is a a personal understanding
it's like oh wow I have pin in your
shoes and I completely understand
exactly how that feels
okay sympathy is you know seeing a
situation through you know like your
personal own experience eyes like oh
like if I was doing that same thing like
I would feel like this and that really
sucks right empathy is you know
considering like hey hold on a second
like they are going through this
experience and they already have their
own you know like Skilling's and and
opinions and so I'm gonna try to see it
from you know like their perspective
sympathy can be incredibly judgmental
right because we see this person and
it's like oh I would never do that
right I have said that a million times
and every time I do it I have to catch
myself right because like I'm seeing
them in like oh well I wouldn't have
done that and that's just not you know
that's not fair
because you know you know perspective
just isn't there
so being empathetic isn't point to be
judgmental
ever and then finally sympathy is kind
of just like a you know hang right it's
a like oh right like we can't control
when we feel sympathetic right empathy
takes practice it takes you know it's
using it every single day it takes work
and and and and focus all right so
bottom line here empathy is
understanding a person's
killings I identify you know egg
exactly where those feelings are you
know coming from and then in in her
analyzing you know like their feelings
as our own okay so how do we do this
right it is you know a choice it is you
know pursuing you know that
understanding every single day
especially when it's hard right it is
extremely easy to you know like see like
our our parents or see our friends or or
he you know like those people that we
have chosen to to keep around and and
and see their perspective right and and
and and and so you know like we've
chosen those people and so like they
probably share similar experiences and
so
and so pair perspective is going to be
you know similar to ours okay so that's
not you know so it's you know pretty
easy you have or or to be empathetic
then however you know getting apathetic
towards people who are from different
cultures or or from different places or
have you know differing political views
it is way harder right and so um
the other way to be empathetic is to you
know just kind of shift how we you know
focus on and approach conversations okay
so we are going to do a quick and fun
because there's an exclamation point
empathy activity so um I want to talk to
a couple of people and tell them a you
know insecurity or a
or a a a laugh or a
vulnerability that's a professional one
that you know special co-workers have to
you know be be
empathetic towards and then you know
tell them give them the corrections as
to you know
okay I'm just gonna abort mission you
guys can read so talk to a couple of
people about this and then we're gonna
come together and then I'm going to see
how it went so I'll give you until 10:17
to talk to two people
okay has everybody talked to two people
one person one person did you guys want
to talk to two people if you didn't have
time no cool
okay so who wants to talk about what
they talked about anybody want to share
anything go ahead okay we talked about
shared okay gotta yeah that's really
interesting I don't know if you guys
heard oh you can go ahead um actually
you have like a handheld mic right there
alright let's let's do this it's not
Wireless okay so could you go to the
microphone okay perfect
right
Oh interesting
hmm is it possible to learn empathy I
mean obviously I think yes like I
wouldn't be up here if I didn't think
like hey like I can help you or or you
know people can be like hey like here's
how you do it right yeah I mean so you
know people that have perspective like
it's very easy could be like oh yeah
like I completely understand that right
like I've been through you know a
similar thing however the people that
you truly have to be you know be to the
people that you really have to try with
like really have to try really hard to
like to to you know like to truly get
are the people who are on the other side
of the spectrum from you right so yeah
yeah that was good that was interesting
anybody else wanna share you were first
if only it was that easy for everyone
you're very lucky and somebody over here
raised the hand
oh good oh go ahead it's on right okay
so first of all I do not speak too loud
that's why hey that's okay it's why it's
there thank god oh technology is
something that you learned yes so it was
very nice that I had a good talk with
the person next to me Carsten and I have
sorry I have some for me it's also very
hard to speak in public but coming back
to empathy we realized that we shared
some common language although we are
from different countries and most of the
time I think we are not actually
listening the person next to us so it's
pretty damn hard to talk about empathy
when it's you do not create the space
between you and the next person to be
able to actually listen the other person
because all the time we have this waste
in our head when we say okay what is
this other person say is that true is
that false is that or are they
trying to fool me
we're okay that's a nonsense er you know
you always have this voice in your head
where you're already always listening is
the process in which you are not able to
cut off from yourself from your opinions
to be able to create the space the
possibility to meet the other person so
it's like you're not actually listening
to it it's listening yourself about what
he's saying in triangle ways to
indentify what you've already lived were
you were afraid to live so you're not
actually listening to him you know he's
liked your phone calls and you see oh
not again my mother she always talked
about the fact or the other and it
didn't even answer the phone so you
already have these things already in
your mind that cut offs from meeting the
other person it could be even someone
from your family or from co-workers and
do you are we are missing that of the
space of possibility to meet the other
person because we are always in our head
trying to look better trying to avoid
looking bad you know oh I don't know
about that new feature in spring five
okay what am I doing here what should I
say to look smart or something like that
you know you're always trying to to
avoid looking bad and in this process we
simply cut off the intellect from the
heart so we are not letting ourselves to
feel to be able to be empathetic with
the other because the way our education
system was created for instance in
Romania was that either you take that 10
yet you're first in your class either
you're no one or in the second place
just just irrelevant only though the
first person in class should date the
first prize and have the thing on the
head so you know even in a team
we are also in a constant struggle to
look better and we are not pretty much
interested in what other fields we are
all who is concentrating ourselves so
it's pretty damn hard to talk about
insecurity or vulnerabilities in a place
we're just trying to you know be
stronger in intellectual way yeah yeah
well you have pretty much given all of
the rest of the topics I'm going to talk
about good for you yeah I think that's
really interesting though right like
we're you know constantly trying to be
the best and we're constantly trying to
be like no like I'm cool I'm strong I
got this I completely understand
everything and I think that's a a big
problem because because then you know
like if we don't like totally understand
something oh no like it's it's it's you
know a problem and it's bad and then and
then yeah like we just aren't good
enough right so yeah yeah that was that
was amazing that was really good does
anybody else have anything they would
like to share or talk about that they
talked about with their partner no one
no one all right cool okay so you know
the
final part of this here is this quote
where I it kind of speaks for itself
right being empathetic it fuels
connection right so the and the basis of
that connection is going to be you know
just the the patience and and and the
enuine understanding of your co-workers
your your your family your friends and
then just you know people out there yeah
so I'm going to give you guys a break
it's gonna be what times and now it's
10:30 I'm gonna give you a break until
10:40 and then we're gonna come back and
talk more about empathy all right so we
are going to get back in it
it's fixed we're good thanks
okay so we as people are programmed to
to to you know focus on communication as
as a survival and and arrival right and
you know
this is a thing that you know just we as
a species have been doing since way way
way way way way way way way back in the
day right like here you know these
symbols and the carvings are you know
you know communication tools right you
know each of these you know spindles
communicate some you know thing or some
opinion or or or or some idea right
another way that we communicate is
through you know like dancing or
painting or or or you know source
pinging or or playing things right like
even though
these people aren't like because at
least spaying anything they are
expressing things right and so you know
like through different you know chances
and songs right
like people are expressing things right
like they are expressing feelings they
are expressing ideas and so as as a time
kept going we created you know like
physical physical
you know letters and just physical you
know communication tools right and so
you can see him here like he's painting
down like expressions and spangs okay
and so then it was like hold on a second
I can communicate with tons of people in
in this new way right and then you know
we got you know mmmm-mmmm-mmmm
mmmm-mmmm-mmmm mmmm-mmmm-mmmm
mmmm-mmmm-mmmm mmmm-mmmm-mmmm
mmmm-mmmm-mmmm mmmm-mmmm-mmmm in the
media out of it and then you know time
kept going and you know communication
via telephone and and you know
communicating
with people who were you know like
across the country across the state you
know across the globe became possible
and then we eventually came to a point
where we have a device now we're either
you know talking can happen or we can
completely avoid talking to people all
together and just text them or we can
blog about it or we can email them or we
can tweet them and you know even two
hundred and eighty characters which is
almost like a novel these days so yeah
so communication has been you know the
cool and the thread that truly has
connected us all four countries for tons
and tons and tons and tons and tons of
years right through you know sales
through expressing ourselves with you
know there's pinging with dancing right
we're constantly you know trying to find
you know improved ways or like fun ways
to you know truly connect with with
people and so communication at its core
is you know supposed to be you know
pretty empathetic right however it
oftentimes is absolutely not right
so here are two pretty big numbers here
sixty percent and that is the you know
time in our conversations where we spend
talking about our
selves 60% of the time right and that
jumps up to 80% when we are on you know
Twitter Facebook and and that is a huge
problem right that so okay so if we're
talking about ourselves you know all of
that time how much of that time are we
actually thinking about ourselves how
much you know in conversation are we
only thinking about us because it's
definitely way more than those numbers
if you know like those are the times
that we're talking about us and so you
know you know our conversations like we
are doing them completely wrong so I am
going to tell you exactly what you're
doing
so this is you and I don't know if Parks
and Recreation have you guys heard of
that yes this is Andy lovable idiot Andy
and that's who you are lovable idiot
Andy and you are like hold on I have an
idea so this is you and this is your
idea and so you're like hold on a second
like I think that this idea I think it
could have some legs and so you think
about like okay how am I going to tell
people about this idea right and so then
you you know figure out like okay like I
can you know say you know like these
things I can use this inflection and
then I can say this and then everybody's
gonna laugh and then I'm gonna keep
going and I'm gonna say more and I'm
gonna blow people's minds and it's gonna
be amazing
and then you go to a person and you tell
them about this idea and you just know
that they're gonna think that your idea
is the best idea ever
they're gonna think you're so smart and
so interesting
and so funny and really great and then
they look at you like this
I don't know if any of you know about
this show either Arrested Development
anyone
god I hope everybody you guys have got
to google this show it's amazing and so
yeah like they're just kind of like no
I'm not really interested in what you
have to say and it's because you don't
care about having a conversation around
this awesome idea you just want them to
love you know like this idea the way
that Kanye adores Kanye and that's the
problem right
like we approach conversations from away
or it's 100% about this health okay like
we are viewing it as like this is my
time to shine this is my time to tell
you a thing and then you're talking
right now but I'm pretty much just
holding on until I can talk again and oh
you're done great let me jump back in
more with my genius right so we have to
fix how we are you know approaching
these conversations and so I actually
have a story about this because I'm up
here and we have three hours so I'm
gonna tell you so back in two thousand
four or five I worked I worked at a
nanana nanan nanana nanana nanana nanan
nanana nanan in a newspaper and I'm
talking like an actual physical paper
again this was like back in 2004 when
those were you know a thing still and so
um I was the person I was the I was the
I was the
the liaison between advertising sales
advertising creation and then the people
who who hid like the you know like blog
posts and those things and so I was kind
of you know like always in between all
of the compartments until I and so I
pretty much I've talked to almost
everyone and so again like this is 2004
and so out of a building of about 200
people there was exactly one person
doing IT again 2004 and so every time
anything would go wrong it would come to
me first and then I would go to him and
be like hey I'm having a problem can you
help me and every single time he would
be like did you turn it off and turn it
back on again except he wouldn't be like
yeah well could you just like turn up no
no he was like did you turn it off and
turn it back on like he was so annoyed
that I was like essentially asking him
to do his job and I didn't really
understand why he was so annoyed and so
I had kind of come to a place where I
did not enjoy being around him every
time a person would come to me with an
idea or or or or a problem I would just
be like no I have to talk to this guy
and he's a jerk and I think he hates me
and so yeah and so every single time I
would go up to him I'd be like hey I'm
having flank issue did you turn it off
hey I'm having flank issues did you turn
it off to turn on again hey I want to
kill myself did you turn it off and turn
it back on again like it was literally
all the time and so you know I was
having a rough day once and we had like
ask the deadline everything was going
crazy and so I had come you know like to
this place where I had like a really big
problem and I knew that he was gonna be
a jerk and I was not in the mood for it
and so I went to him and I was like hey
here's the problem I'm having here's the
error code I turned it off I turned it
back on again I tried to do the process
again I got the same error code right
and then I got cute I'm like and then I
went to another computer and I did the
same thing and I got the error code and
I turned that one off and put it back on
again and I did it again and I got right
and he was like oh yeah cool I can help
you and it was like cool like it was it
was just very chill he was you know
insanely helpful he came over and then
he like explained write every single
thing that was happening and he was
really Pleasant and I really enjoyed
talking to him and then he was like okay
look
if you have you know like other problems
here's my you know direct line and then
he goes away and it was like a really
nice you know
Pleasant x.x experience and so I thought
huh well this is weird he's usually
really annoyed and angry and I kind of
hate him however today he was great and
he was helpful and I don't understand
like I guess he's just having a really
good day right and then I paused then I
thought oh I approached him you know you
know like with the problem in a way that
was beneficial for him right so I
approached that entire interaction that
entire conversation in a way that he
could completely comprehend and
completely understand and so that is
when it totally dawned on me like oh
this is how I should probably approach
all of my conversations right I finally
paid attention and I finally talked to
him in a way that was like cool right
success so we're gonna do a conversation
activity it's gonna be fun again because
there's an exclamation point so uh how
to a person about a time where you know
that co-worker who is awful and you hate
them however
the conversation only once was just
perfect and great so talk to one or two
people and it's 10:57 now I will give
you two 1050 1011 54
all right we're gonna keep it going so
how did it go does anybody want to talk
about what they talked about or what
their partner talked about go ahead
if you wanted to talk about what you
talked about
yeah yeah I know that now
like politics is now exactly like that
where you hear another person's opinion
especially in America I don't know if
you've heard you hear another person's
opinion and you immediately are just
like go away like you you you can't talk
to them about it because it's such a hot
topic right now and people feel very
very angry about anybody on you know on
that other side right and so it takes a
lot to you know have a conversation
where it's just like okay I don't agree
with you in fact I really disagree with
you and you kind of make me sick
however it's okay right like I'm going
to try to understand you and then
everything's good almost impossible for
that to happen so good for you
so anybody else want to share
but they talked about any experiences or
just any experiences in general of
trying to have like a good conversation
and like with a co-worker that you don't
agree with good of course yes so we only
came from Lisbon here and we only wanted
to add our to sensitive conversation so
we feel humor is a great tool to make
the whole thing more hard lighthearted
let's say so there are topics who are
really delicate let's call it like that
and we got we actually got a guy we
brought him here and he's really good at
just you know taking that all away and
just off it just so friends you directly
and from that point on you know oh this
guy's is a joker
come on I think that has a very positive
effect so if we're talking about women
we basically offend the women directly
just go we just go away
and of course people sense that we are
indeed kidding obviously and we don't
believe in any of of that we have said I
think that helps so the humor angle yeah
yeah I definitely think though like that
can go wrong and it can offend people
even more it's like I'm telling you my
opinion and you're making a joke
you know like that even further exactly
yes and then it's you know like it's
really hard and then like come together
and have a conversation so I think you
just have to be careful with it but I do
that as well so I I get it I make sense
you're a bully then me I'm harmless come
on I'm gonna go back I'm growing
affectionate Sosa's if somebody else had
their hand raised in the front oh did
you want to still did you want to use
the mic er yeah Oh could you talk trying
to you know tell them what you said by
having a little trouble just go ahead
I'll try to do you want to use the micro
know we have totally bullied him into
using the mic good for us guys okay so I
was saying that initially we've both had
difficulties in finding someone that we
didn't really like at work and this
changed after conversation but when we
thought about an example we both
realized that it was easy to relate to
the other person when talking about
things that are not really work specific
specific so for example I gave I've
given example of a colleague of mine and
when we talked about personal hobbies
things went much better because
initially when discussing about work it
was
always like power fight but then when we
speak about hobbies or what we like to
do in the in our free time we understand
that we like the same things and yeah
that was much better
yeah no I mean when you're in like a
company setting like everybody feels
like you know like they're you know like
they're like opinions and their ideas
you know she could be heard because they
are amazing ideas and no no like I've
done the research and and and I have
like the agrees and I've been doing this
for 10 years and right and so it can be
hard to kind of come together as a team
if you know people feel like you know
like well I should be in charge because
of you know like XYZ right so yeah like
that's um that's pretty typical where
it's you know challenging to really hit
along like with a co-worker when you
both feel like no no like I'm better and
you and every other person so yeah
that's uh yeah it's pretty typical
anybody else wants oh go ahead go ahead
yeah hi I work in a DevOps team which
means it's actually we work developers
and ops people so in the my current team
we have four developers and one oops
and when I came and when I was not
working there I'm a developer and I have
basic and DevOps team they expect you to
work for that you have knowledge of both
of them depth and hopes works so when I
start working there I had basic
knowledge about what Ops does because
they do because I am actually an
developer and we have one option one guy
who does everything about ops and for
developers and and when I want to do
when I want to pick up a task and do it
so they expect for me also to do ops
things so because I am I'm pretty I
considered myself communicative and and
this actually maybe it's a main part of
me because I ask questions really easily
before I go and study what I have to do
so I was asking him always how to do
that how to do this and he's kind of
person who is like very getting easily
angry and he was like why you don't do
it yourself you don't have the video as
your as your as your head empty don't I
did why do I go and read the manuals so
it was for me actually really hard the
beginning and but after a while after
like couple of days and weeks I start
actually to look at the manuals to study
actually before I asked him the question
and you can and when I want to ask him
about something I was like I searched
for this one I am really in a position
where I cannot go further
so then I go to him so I will search for
this one I'll search for this one I show
them but I couldn't find a sir
can you help me and when I did that I
realized that he was like really willing
to help because he saw that I actually
did my job I said but I couldn't go for
any further so he helped me so I learned
actually from him even if he didn't do
it didn't actually do it
really he was that not aware of it but I
learned of it actually to to do my job
first and then after that to go and ask
people so it was really helpful for me
yeah that's great yeah no I mean um I
think it is important to you know like
do as much as you can right just so it's
like you know like with you know the hi
that I was trying to work with right
like I wasn't really doing any of the
work I was just like hey I have a
problem fix it and then I would like go
off and just be you know done with it
and so yeah like I think that you know
approaching people you know who do
things we really need to you know like
first invest time into it and then be
like okay look
I've done all of this and here's my one
issue and then it just goes a lot easier
yeah so that was great great story
anybody else want to share anything
thoughts ideas opinions feelings no
awesome alright so now we are going to
talk about the true you know benefits of
like really paying attention to people
and really really really really really
listening because I think that a lot of
us you know like we don't really pay
attention right like
when we're in conversations we're like
talking and then we're just like hanging
out until it's our turn to talk again so
oh I forgot I put that there
yeah so why it's important to just be
quiet for a couple of minutes so I
really love this quotes because you know
because it you know like pulls it pulls
it pulls listening into you know like
this this this feeling that like people
can you know truly understand right like
I have been loved all of you have been
loved and so and so like this quote like
it kind of um assumes a couple of things
about you know paying attention to
people right the the first one is that
paying attention it makes people feel
incredibly important right and and and
and you know like empowering people like
that is so you know that's doing that it
gives people confidence right it makes
people feel like their opinions and
their ideas are incredibly valued right
and so if people feel you know that
their co-workers truly value them then
then conversations are going to be a lot
more productive right and then
people are going to be more patient
because you have shown them one patience
and to that you know that you know like
they are you know that that you know
like that that's that's that's Wow
let's try this again so it encourages
people to be patient because you are you
know empowering them and you are you
know in encouraging them and so they are
going to do the same things you know to
you as as as you know what also and then
finally it you know encourages people to
be kind right if we're paying attention
to people then you know like they feel
like hey this person thinks I have
something to say and so they you know
probably aren't you know terrible people
right so the problem though is that it
is incredibly hard to like truly pay
attention right because you know we are
constantly surrounded by a ton of other
things right we have so much
conversation going around we have tons
of things that we could you know
be talking to we're communicating with
and like all of that stuff it's so hard
to really pay attention to people when
we have so much noise okay and there are
tons of different kinds of noise right
there's you know the physical noise and
that's things like like the prints are
going in the background or like car
horns or or like people like talking on
the phones right so yeah like those
things like we are constantly constantly
hearing those things all of the time and
so you know paying attention is you know
just that's a tad bit harder and then we
have psychological noise and you know
and so like you know these are things
like you know you cut into a car
accident and you are concerned about
like the price of that productive all
and it's you know like kind of like oh
god right or or or or like you know
something is going on at home right you
know like those things it take up space
and we're constantly you know in in
caging you know and then we have
physiological things right so you could
have a cold you could you know have
shoes on that are like you know tearing
up your feet right
so like you know those are the things
where it's not you know in here and it's
not you know surrounding us
however it's taking you know our our
attention you know you know two
different places and then there is its
semantic noise and I think that you know
so this is things like you know like two
people aren't totally speaking you know
the same language right a lot of times
especially like people who are are are
brand new and companies like they don't
hear you know like you know the tiny
things because of this semantic noise
right like all of us have our own you
know kind of um vocabulary have our own
you know conversation pipes and so a lot
of the times you know we can't get past
the semantics of conversations and so
it's just you know like really
challenging to pay attention so um
another reason why paying attention is
so hard is because we have the worst
attention spans probably in history why
because we live in a world where we want
things done like know like I want it now
actually I wanted it like like you know
like like like like
like like 20 hours ago but you know now
it's fine right and we're constantly you
know skiing things as as as as as as
trying it again we are you know
constantly you know being being like
told about things as you know as as as
as as you know as they are transpiring
right I know that there was a shooting
in Texas and I was on Twitter all day
just trying to get all of the news I
could I could not wait I needed to see
things you know like right now right our
attention spans are completely awful
right and then you know an extension of
that is that the person talking like I
don't know if I'm actually going to want
to hear them I don't know if I'm going
to want to hear like you know like their
ideas on things and so I don't want to
be patients and I don't want to hear
them out another reason why is because
we are highest and we are incredibly
biased right studies have shown that you
know like we you know
consider if a person is competent within
the first it's heaven its seconds of
them talking think about that for a
minute okay I'm going to count to seven
and that's how long it took you to
figure out if another person is
competent seven seconds and so um there
are a couple of type of biases in play
here the you know first one is a is a
highest against this speaker okay so
hypothetically you don't like Donald
Trump and so anything that comes out of
his mouth it doesn't matter if it's you
know like smart it doesn't matter if
it's dumb
it doesn't matter if you know you could
be like okay I could see your point it
doesn't matter you're already gonna be
biased against him because you yeah
because he's Ronald Trump and you're
like no I know right
you don't want to give him a chance and
then there are biases against certain
topics right so I don't code I'm not a
developer however I've I've kind of
gathered that there are people out there
that hates
javascript and so there's like this big
like like swell of content online of how
like uh it's an awful framework and no
one should ever use it yet there are
tons of people who use it and it's
completely fine right so you know there
are biases out there and you know being
just you know just just keep considering
like okay like I you know can't be
biased against this topic or this person
because you know it's going to be
impossible to just you know pay
attention to them right if we have these
biases and we are you know like
constantly kind of in caging them then
we aren't gonna have an open mind about
things right and we aren't going to be
able to hear these other perspectives
yeah and so if we can't consider
different perspectives then how are we
ever going to grow how are we ever going
to connect so how do we make this easier
how do we make paying attention how do
we make listening as easy as possible
well the first thing hmm is that you
have to be 100% present and look I know
that that sounds like be present be yoga
and all that stuff but no it's about
just quieting all of the noise okay put
your phone away I know that that's
really hard but just turn it over and
don't pay attention to those things
right so um figure out how you can just
kind of shut down everything else around
you and only pay attention to this one
person
all right and then you know focus you
know just just the proper amount of time
and and and and energy into just only
this person right like pay attention to
every single thing that they're saying
every single word right a lot of the
times like we hear like you know like hi
I'm blah blah blah blah blah I'm not
really paying attention and I'm from
blah blah blah blah blah oh cool that's
awesome
and then blah blah right we have to pay
attention to every single word and you
know try not to just take in the key
points and so then we have to consider
like what our speaker is trying to get
here right so like how do they
communicate things right I know that you
know like here like me I'm going to need
like a couple of extra seconds to say
things because I stutter
right so you know but consider that they
might consider that they don't have the
the same sort of communications style as
you know like you and then um
how do they you know consume information
right so you know some people can um you
know talk about a thing that they've
only kind of hemmed a book about and
they could talk about it for hours and
hours and hours and hours and hours
however there are other people who you
know like they consume things at a much
slower pace and so and so as they are
communicating them right like it's going
to take them just you know like a little
bit more time a kind of you know
decipher okay like I want to say this
and then I want to say this and so on
and so forth and then this final point
is kind of just a courtesy thing right
so like dealing with you know someone on
on their you know on plane it doesn't do
anything to compromise you know your
plane okay and so the
the final way to pay attention to people
is to you know tell them you know the
key points and that they said okay so
there are a couple of reasons why here
the first reason is to you know be like
okay I just want to make sure that I
like heard everything that you know you
were saying correctly right
I feel like communication breaks down
you know because clarification issues
can just tear things apart right so if
we are clarifying their comments we
aren't going to have a ton of those the
communication issues and I said to
clarify any confusion obviously and then
and then the so studies have shown that
when we are talking through something
that's considered you know like
brand-new information studies have shown
that you know talking through that helps
us really you know consume it cutter
right and so and so you know frequently
you you know don't really like pay
attentions things and you don't really
like truly hear things until you you
know say them out loud yourself
and so finally here I just want to say
that you know taking a couple of moments
and causing right and just kind of you
know like in M racing and internalizing
you know the conversation like that is
going to help you kind of hit to the
bottom of things a lot faster
all right one more break this one at
11:42 we're going to come back in ten
minutes
at 11:52 and then we will close out
all right so we're going to finish this
up last half an hour ish so I've talked
about you know paying attention to
people that's a very important part of
the conversation and so now I'm going to
talk about speaking to people all right
and so before I talk about that I'm
gonna talk a little bit more about me so
um the really interesting thing about
stuttering is that it kind of you know
formed my like entire you know opinion
of a communication right and so um I
know that I talked about how like you
know like I would avoid situations where
I would have to talk to people so likes
stutterers like we like we have a
problem with paying our names and so if
the you know
if the first thing you know said I'm
saying so someone is hi I'm Shay and I
can't pay my name it's a very
uncomfortable situation and it's a a a a
a a situation that you know like I had
come to a point where I was just like no
like I am going to just you know like
not talk to people right I'm going to
avoid those situations and so you kind
of like you know break down what what
stuttering is like it's kind of like
like okay like you have you know
something that you know like you are
trying to communicate you know you know
exactly the you know the sorry you know
exactly you know like how you wanted to
come out and and and and and so for
people who are are are fluent you guys
just start talking right for a a a
person who stutters you don't you are
like okay like I'm trying to say this
thing I'm not going to be able to say
that word because it has a a w in it and
so I have to think of another word right
and so as you're trying to kind of you
know have this conversation you are you
know just like you know just in here
right you're not you know trying to
connect you're just trying to survive
and so and so you know I kind of like
come to a point where where where I had
to just kind of a slept like okay like I
am approaching conversations in an
incredibly awful way right I'm only
talking about myself right like here the
numbers again right this 60%
you know like us is just talking about
us right and so I was at something like
you know two hundred percent of the time
I was just one hunt I was just like
consumed with with you know stuttering
and just and just trying to say words
right and so you know I tots of thinking
right like I can't be you know the the
single person who is like all about me
in these conversations and it turns out
that all of us really really love
talking about ourselves because it makes
us feel obviously pretty amazing right
and so I found tons of articles and you
know like tons of things that you know
just prove that you know when we are in
conversations and talking we really love
to you know talk about us yeah one more
I mean we are just so consumed right
well I mean it you know like it if you
consider it spend like it you know like
kind of makes perfect sense right who is
so yeah so like our Wow so
who is your you know favorite person
it's probably you know you right and so
like we are constantly talking about
ourselves and you know thinking about
ourselves that we don't ever consider
like hey like I am talking to a a a
person who isn't in here right I'm
trying to have a conversation and I'm
only considering about I'm only
considering the you know communication
tools that are best suited for for for
me right I'm not considering you know
the the person I am talking to who
and so we approach our conversation from
the same sort of you know health health
spinard place right and so you know our
conversations kind of turn into like
well here I am this is me and if you
don't like it well I guess I can't talk
to you right and so we have to really
like consider you know our co-workers
our you know corners in conversation
their communication its styles and so
the best way to do that is to you know
figure out if they are you know and and
introverts and extroverts or there's
somewhere in between so extroverts
are you know more sort of external
people they you know like build
relationships in a more conventional way
right oh they are gonna be more like
talkative just in general right and so
like they think out loud right go with
thee yeah so what they asks if they pay
something in the beginning and it
doesn't totally you know like it isn't
you know comprehending well just give
them some time and they're going to you
know process their thoughts and then be
able to communicate them you know as
they sort of you know talk talk
talk talk through them right and so um
these are the people who who arrived a
lot of their energy from being around
people all of the time and so you know
it's going to be pretty easy to a
approached them with things and talk to
them about things because because they
are going to be able to really you know
keep up with the conversation so on the
opposite end of this spectrum is
introverts and so introverts are more to
the point right they arrive their energy
from from from being alone and so if you
just kind of give them some time to you
know process things on their own it's
going to be you know a pretty easy to
you know communicate you know certain
ideas to them yeah so and so the final
category is ambiverts so a lot of us
here we are you know like eggs
dreams right and so amber verts are
going to be you know scum where you know
in this spinner of this spectrum right
so you know we have they have they have
crates of both and so because of that
when you have conversations it's going
to be you know pretty easy to have
conversations because because because of
their flexibility
okay so we've figured out some
communication styles however I feel like
the best way to kind of you know figure
out you know conversational approaches
is talking about you know conversations
failing and so that happens when you
know we are in conflict I'm gonna skip
through a few of these because we're
running low on time we're just gonna
tell you that I love Twitter Oh actually
this is funny I love Twitter because of
tweets like this so it was great
here's another one that I really like I
think it's really funny and all that
stuff clever oh sorry did you guys want
to read it there you go um really clever
so um the point I was going to use here
is that you know
like we we feel so like empowered it's
kind of a fight with people like on you
know Twitter and you know Facebook and
stuff because it's really easy right
like I can say my point and then I can
find people who are going to be like yes
all about my point and they're gonna be
so into your point and so in in in
Preston right and then it's people on
the exact opposite side who are going to
be like I I I disagree with you and then
it's you are the worst person ever right
and that isn't you know going to help
anyone so arguing is pointless
there's a bunch of reasons here I gave
I'm going to go through these really
quickly okay so to you know really
determine you know fighting pair we have
to first determine you know the
specifics of you know of arguing right
so we are
confronted with a person who disagrees
right and so we have two choices
right the you know first one is to be
like okay I don't agree with you but I
would like to hear everything that you
have to say all right
and so you know the the product of this
is is you know hitting some perspective
one and then who is you know a us a
spirited debate right and you know and
and so debates are good because you know
when we are baiting we can really you
know like understand like okay like I
don't you know a three with this and and
and I have a counter points however you
know I'm going to try to really hit it
I'm going to try to like truly
understand okay so that's the you know
first you know like way that you know
arguments could you know come about but
then the other option is the one that we
all probably actively engage in more
it's like I don't agree with you done
listening to you right and and the the
problem here is that you know first of
all you aren't going to be paying
attention to this person and then kind
of a a a high product of you know I
is you know is is standing a lot firmer
and this leaf right so you could be like
yeah I think chocolate is okay and then
a person comes over and it's all know
I'm all about you know vanilla and it's
you know the the best thing ever and
then all of a sudden you're you know
chocolate is okay chose to you're wrong
it's the best thing and I'm done talking
to you right like it doesn't help
anything you know like fighting you know
things don't get you know accomplished
things don't get resolved as a result of
an an argument right and so you know I
would say like you know we actually
apart that height you know even even
even angrier then you know we began it
animations are off that's fine
so um you know like things don't get
accomplished because like yeah like we
you know ski that they're talking and we
can you know like here you know the
[Laughter]
things out there spaying however we
aren't really embracing those things
we're not in journalizing those things
right we're hearing so we're not really
really really really really listening to
them right and then you know um you
don't have the perspective right so like
we're you know just you know we're
fighting you know
four hours skyed and we're so interested
in in in in in in in in our sky that we
aren't getting any of the perspective
that you know if I can help us you know
kind of come to that common ground so
arguing is pointless
however differing opinions are so
important to team's success right like
you know diversity and inclusion you
know there's a reason why like you know
people are so passionate about you know
he and I efforts because you know
diversity it you know forces people to
have perspective right it brings in you
know your friend I is from from people
who are from different cultures
different backgrounds different hinders
right so you know differing opinions can
be incredibly empowering our teams and
and and and
improve you know what team's success
rates right so how do we fight fair okay
the first thing that we need to do
what's okay the first thing that we need
to do is to pay attention and you know
put away our our biases so how do we put
aside diocese well the you know first
way to do that and the biggest way to do
that is to you know just I in safai them
right if you have a pious you know
against you know females if you have a
bias against males if you have a bias
against people who you know are from a
like culturally diverse background then
you can tell yourself okay like I know
that I'm going to go into this
conversation I know that I'm gonna be
biased so I'm going to first you know
just point it out and then I'm going to
pay attention to them as if they were
just another person who were just
talking and not a person who I am biased
against for all of these you know you
know particular reasons right so after
they're done talking cause the key for
you before you jump into the
conversation so a lot of the times like
when we you know say the first thing
that comes out of our mouth it is a
couple of things right it is you know
our
emotional reaction
and it's not our you know actual you
know thoughtful opinion right factual
opinion yeah whatever I'm going with it
right and so and so you know taking a
couple of seconds I really like process
you know the you know their thoughts and
then to kind of gather ours it helps us
to put those emotions to the side right
and then you know we can have a more
productive debate okay and then you want
to us summarize you know they're there
you know ideas and opinions right so um
the you know the problem with you know
fighting is that we tend to kind of jump
to conclusions right and so every single
thing that they say is a threat every
single thing that they say is you know
Petra mental because everyone is you
know like pissed right so if you just
kind of
a second and you you know summarize like
their point of view a lot of that
confusion can kind of be a effused
because you know there is you know a
playing field that is now like fair
right and then finally um you know when
you do talk talk to them in you know in
in fair language and you know this is
important because when we are you know
arguing we tend to kind of you know
defeat you know the other person right
like we are trying to outsmart them
and so like we are speaking to them you
know kind of you know with condescension
and we're just being like you know we're
kind of being jerks right so if you
speak to them in you know a in a patient
manner and in a respectful manner then a
lot of the fights can be confused
and then a couple of keys to two on
fighting fair here you know like we are
people and so we have you know feelings
we have ideas and and and and I'm being
upset by somebody else's actions or
somebody else's ideas like that is a
part of being you know people right it's
okay to be angry it's not okay to be
insulting right
and so the tote hoe along to get along
that's kind of swaying for you know like
don't just try to to pacifies someone
right like again like it's okay to
disagree and it's okay it's a kind of
freeing up your point to you know to to
a person that you are are disagreeing
yeah
and so don't pacify them just approach
them with you know patience approach
them with with with laugh one more time
approach them with patience approach
them with respect and everything is
going to be fine
and then again you know healing with a
person I
and you know their level it doesn't do
anything to compromise yours and um I
think this is just a you know really
important point here because like we you
know are very competitive people and we
are you know constantly trying to show
that we are the smartest and we are the
best and we are you know qualified times
ten however you know you know you know
talking to a person who doesn't have the
same you know in in elegance level or
talking to you know a a person who
doesn't have as much as experience um we
can still you know talk to them in
elegantly we just have to you know be
patient and respectful so I have two
minutes left that is all that I have so
I mean the bottom line here is that you
know communicating is supposed to be and
and and
empathetic act right if we just take a
moment if we just pay attention to
people if we just you know consider you
know who this person is
consider the you know communication you
know things
that they have to have you know from us
then you know connecting is going to be
you know just just just a lot easier
thank you
because anybody have any questions or
comments I know that we have like
absolutely no time but I'll be around
for another couple of hours so find me
and I would love to talk with you and
hear what you thought thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
