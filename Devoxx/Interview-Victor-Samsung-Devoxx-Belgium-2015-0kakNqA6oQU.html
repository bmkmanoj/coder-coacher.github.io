the pleasure of being joined by Victor
oconee rescue is a developer evangelist
for samsung and yeah can I can you tell
me what brings you to this conference
because Samsung is a new recruit for
that works right yeah that's the first
time for samsung to be on this
conference and what brings us here is
because we have something to offer to
Java developers you know of course we
have androids tech and you know running
on our phones and we have some
interesting ap is that we would like to
propose to a development community so
they can build something awesome with
those api api yeah so those api is
specifically used for building
enterprise and b2b solutions ok they
unlock the amazing power of our hardware
and what kind of things can develop its
you with these api is what's so exciting
about them for you Oh for example if
somebody asks you to build an in-flight
entertainment system what do you do well
you can order a custom build hardware
which is a really painful and expensive
way to go or you can take an awesome
android tablet made by samsung and
customize it using our api's and make it
into you know a what we call a pro kiosk
mode so people can only use it as
in-flight entertainment system you
cannot do it anything else on that you
cannot hack it you cannot you know
download the copyrighted content it's
very secure very protected so these are
the kind of tools that we offer and how
people be responding to you you had a
lot of different interesting questions
yeah people well the first question is
you know since not everyone here is
Android developer right yes yes so
people come here and say yeah so so what
is it and and and whooping she could
start explaining and then we see their
light they'll have their eyes starting
light up and they say yeah that's it
that's really yeah and so we don't
expect them to use our tools right away
but what we hope that next time when the
uh you know enterprise or b2b mobile
project comes their way they'll remember
the conversation they say Oh Samsung
Knox yeah that's that's the way to do it
and so we just hope that that message
candlesticks and if we do a great job
that you know that's something that we
hope is going to spread through
developer community this kind of
knowledge so you kind of hope to do more
work with relatives down the line as
well are you going to work on more if in
source projects kind of more and you
have any ideas and your thief what you'd
really like to do for for them or yeah
well we are we actually have a lot of
partners who already built some awesome
stuff with our you know tools without
hardware software stack and so we always
refer developers to you know come to a
portal we call samsung Enterprise
Alliance Program and we have a portal
and this is where they can look at all
these existing solutions and maybe get
an inspiration so there's a lot of
there's a lot of interesting products
like point-of-sale systems our
hospitality applications you know people
check into the hotel and there's a
tablet on on on on the table and you can
use that tablet to control the room
environment and you know turn on TV the
lights the the temperature they kind of
hell IIT everything as well yeah so we
have a lot of these kind of solutions
and you know when people ask us we share
with them of course and what's
interesting you know when one of our
partners builds something cool as this
you know their success is our success
because that proves that our technology
works the way we advertise it right so
on that's why we have a program where we
invite those partners to co-host
presentations with us we have samsung
code event you know any event that takes
place in San Francisco we invite our
partners and they can share their
solution you know it works as
advertisement for them it works as an
attachment for us it's a mutual
beneficial relationship and it shows the
world what you can do with these tools
something that you can't yet achieve
with the stock Android you know devices
and stock Android
it's probably gonna get get there but
for now Samsung Knox is the way to go
you're just making it that a little bit
more rich yeah exactly thank you
personally as a technologist I know we
were talking a lot of drought the
keynote and what was spoken about today
Wallach what things happening in the
Java ecosystem or indeed Android for you
we're going to sniff out that one what
excites you minute what things are you
most excited about what developments
have you seen in the past year or that
are even coming for example in Java 9
that you're really kind of eager for
well we were basically all our efforts
they you know we stay focused on on a
mobile platforms and what excites me is
that you know how this technology
progresses how rapidly it evolves how
faster the devices become how richer the
interfaces get how are you know how seen
was the experience getting and you know
if you if you if you look on the street
everyone walks with mobile devices and
this is huge happening it almost like
looks like a next step in human
evolution hey because suddenly every
human gets attached to a little portable
device right who knows what's going to
be the implications of that but we
certainly right in the middle of that
happening and we hope with steering it
an hour in the right direction and well
at least we provide the best you know
hardware the best software tools and and
it's it's kind of exciting to be right
there in the middle gonna be an
evolution you want to be the catalyst
right yeah sir and we'll see you know
where we're going to end up as a
civilization wow thank you very much for
taking the time to tattoo thanks for
thankfully see you next year to talk
about the developer projects that may be
fallen from this event definitely be
happy to thanks lad listening</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
