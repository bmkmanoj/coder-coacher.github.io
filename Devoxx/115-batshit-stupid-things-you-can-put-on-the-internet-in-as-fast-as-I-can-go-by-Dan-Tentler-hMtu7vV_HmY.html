eight I'd like to begin very very
quickly just by doing some very simple
measurements on the audience who in the
audience could argue that security isn't
important if not one of the biggest
parts of their job not bad how many
people in the room know what Minimum
Viable Product is a lot of people fuck
security ship it ah right your guys guys
are gonna love this so um yeah I hope
you brought helmets I didn't bring
enough for the whole room but oh boy uh
so yeah I about me I'm my name is Dan on
the internet I'm vist and I make a hobby
of finding silly things connected to the
Internet and then shouting about them
belligerently I might add some
information about me that usually I skip
over because in most cases I'm
presenting to a roomful of people I know
and this is actually sort of interesting
for people in the security communities
in the security circles we are pushing
to try and stop shouting at each other
about security things and start talking
to everyone else because it helps when
we talk about things that we find we
talk about problems that we notice and
things like that so this is really not
technical in terms of a presentation
it's very low-tech if you know how to
operate a browser and you know what an
IP address is this should be super super
simple but before we get started since
this is very recent in the news who
hasn't heard that there was a major Java
vulnerability in the last like two weeks
that came out all right so some dudes at
Qualcomm found this like nine months ago
and presented it at a computer security
conference in Southern California called
apps at California and it was kind of
vague but about two weeks ago
this dude weaponized it so something you
know take a picture if you don't know
about it already this is going to be a
big deal
Monday mornings gonna suck keep those
helmets on right so yeah basically
remote code execution if you if you lob
serialize Java objects into the right
place so to get into the meat of things
I'll ask everyone the question if there
can be a thing and you can put a web
server on the thing should you put a web
server on the thing
lit right so let me introduce you to
today's mascot totes mcgoats oh yeah
what a web server on it who cares do it
shipment right so in 2014 I was on stage
at Def Con with several other people
that also scan the internet for fun and
we did a we scan the internet live on
stage it took us about 12 minutes to do
10 ports which is kind of mind-boggling
it took seven boxes and each box was on
a gig link during that time all we scan
for was open unauthenticated VNC so it
might come as a surprise some people in
the crowd it came as a surprise to me a
bit that there are certain pieces of
equipment namely skating equipment and
other types of embedded systems that
come with VNC installed by default with
no creds and no off so yeah that guy
right um yeah what could possibly go
wrong on authenticated VNC controlling
you know a power plant connected to the
Internet
rad good job right so let's start out
with a really important stuff a
television station why somebody is
something this is this is a workstation
of some sort or maybe it's a touch panel
not sure that's controlling video clips
that's connected to television it's a
television station based on the
complexity and the stuff that we found
so far so there's at least what seven
machines and like HD cam pal systems
like if you look at it you say this is
this is like a maybe it's a news station
or television stations like that open on
the Internet anybody can talk to it with
VNC make it play whatever you want have
fun don't get caught right Spanish
chicken technology why can you control
chickens over the Internet somebody
thought this was a good idea or they
just didn't think before they plug the
shit in chickens right so like if you're
keeping track this is not the first
series of animals we're going to be able
control over the internet today
the second are cows um this is a cattle
ranch in Canada that's just online for
fun I guess why I don't know um anybody
remember the news recently oh man this
is must've been last year about um there
was all this hubbub in the news about a
steel mill somewhere getting taken over
and
I don't I remember the headlines and
everyone sort of chuckled about it turns
out you can actually do that this is um
yeah right so this is a an iron smelting
system in Japan that has 24,000
kilograms of liquid steel at 1215
degrees Celsius and it's on the internet
and you can tip it over why again
somebody thought was a good idea or
somebody just wasn't thinking before
they plug the shit in right um there's
gonna be a lot of these and I have to
say this was sort of geared towards an
American audience because we're all very
short-sighted with little tiny brains
and we only normally speak one language
so there's going to be a lot of this I
don't speak this language what the hell
is this kind of thing going on um so
there's several of these um also if
there's anybody in the room from France
you guys are going to get a special
call-out and hopefully nobody lives in
or near Phu Mel we'll get to that but
roof helmets right so something German
interesting fun times
um they're certain when you're finding
these things on the internet there are
certain key words and phrases to look
for kilowatts and megawatts namely are
two of them also anything that has you
know a thousand twelve you know twelve
hundred agrees centigrade in liquid seal
so that yeah um first why is there
windows see II directly on the Internet
why okay - um so there's a term we use
very frequently in computer security
land called OPSEC which is short for
operational security it it involves
exercising your ability to just be
observant so if you look at this
particular screenshot there's some
interesting things here that you can
point out that um you can probably abuse
if you were to connect to this thing via
BNC so this is a thing I have no idea
what it does it washes something but you
can see it's got my II command prompt
RDP and WordPad like available so
wherever this thing is if you're going
to do some shady sheet on the internet
you can proxy it through this and then
CNN will go like oh my god people were
hacking for Windows EE and every one of
the room will just
Yeah right attribution I have
attribution dice that I bought from a
friend you do roll the dice and it's
like China at a PT one and just roll it
for like oh this one okay window cee
right anybody want to make a phone call
we can make a bunch of phone calls
anybody no white guy yeah as it turns
out fun thing the asterisk you can spoof
caller ID so yeah if you ever run a sip
server just let it go public on the
internet and watch the logs well again
with the helmet right the your mileage
may vary all right here's a great fun
when anybody in the room speak Korean I
don't I can't read Korean but uh some
interesting stuff uh I was told that
this was a step-up converter so it's
something to do with transferring power
from one sort of shape into another it's
got fuel cells connected to it and
there's ratings in megawatts so yeah
good job Korea um so you think you know
you get a lot of these right a lot of oh
it's somebody's desktop oh what can you
possibly do the desktop you know oh it
looks boring there's some stuff with
TeamViewer
or whatever old stuff that's kind of
cool except for that that's a little bit
more interesting um this this is okay so
this is publicly accessible
unauthenticated VNC um somebody
connected to it and like blindly sent
keystrokes into it and like on a Mac if
you just like hit enter somewhere in
like finder or in like a window it'll
try and open the dialog on a file or
like a shortcut on your desktop to
change its name so something hit
carriage return and then change the name
of the main drive for the system to
system route like five system root 5
which is silly because in a Windows
environment like the percent symbol
which is shift 5 percent symbol system
root percent symbol is typically like C
colon whack Windows but somebody fucked
it up oops
but yeah system 32 commander exe on a
Mac good job hacks or script kiddies
fun times um this this another great
object one that you just asked you RDP
I'm sorry RTP UV and C to an IP address
and this is what you see you just get a
shell like you don't even have to hack
anything you just get a shit you go
yours route good job
what could possibly go wrong right like
that one I know I saw a lot of linux
desktops like well I was shoulder
surfing everyone in the crowd before the
last guy was on the stage so yeah
I won't I won't expect that I have to
explain that just look look the private
keys all of course I'll just keep going
so if you want to learn some dentistry
there's a lab that I'm aware of that's
apparently publicly accessible as well
since my all my endeavors ongoing and
screenshotting the entire internet are
effectively read-only like I use a tool
called VNC snapshot at the command-line
and I push it through Python a bunch of
other stuff so I run a tool it does some
stuff and the JPEGs come out the other
side so this is not it's not interactive
like I look at the JPEGs usually a
couple of days after they come through
because you know you scan the whole
internet it takes several minutes or
maybe an hour and then going all the
secondary process of going and taking
pictures of everything is day's work
because you have to have like worker
processes that go out and run VNC
snapshot and take pictures of all the
things so that's fun dentistry on the
Internet good job uh this is good a
Python in Windows I guess um this one
doesn't have any particularly scary or
nefarious things going on but kind of
interesting that you just see this open
like why and the other thing is like
people aren't opening firewall ports
these are machines directly connected to
the Internet which boggles the mind like
it's 2015 who's connecting Windows boxes
directly to the Internet why would you
do that you just like in it for the pain
speaking of pain I can't read this but
we did several I think with the DEF CON
audience we pointed out it says like
love stage number six over there we're
not sure what to make of it but we're
guessing it's like something television
related or maybe it's looking at I can't
tell if this is just like a TV Guide
thing or actually a box that's
controlling some sort of television
station no idea there's something really
important down there that Windows is
trying to notify is about
if you want to go to college in Las
Vegas
it appears that several other machines
are just public accessible on the
Internet
this might be a kiosk somewhere but if
you if you want to mess with the help
desk at the University of Las Vegas
there's the phone number oh here's a
good one
anybody know what SCADA is right people
ok some people know what happens if
skate it takes a selfie might look like
that like the machine in the building
that's controlling the HVAC or the
lights or the alarm the people that run
that conveniently put a picture of the
of the building on the controller so
that when you find the thing randomly on
the internet you know exactly what
building its in like I found it on the
Internet I want to mess with that one
specifically I will push here to start
and then we can go back to college again
because this is a second machine like
different IP address but same exact
layout yeah there's several ladies it's
going to be a recurring theme more
window seee
which is really funny this is like a
lying tester I think I can't tell if
this is one of those like handheld units
that you used to test TCP and traffic in
either in a datacenter or what but it's
a it's a Windows CE II machine that
looks like it's already pre conflate
pre-configured to denial-of-service Bing
so surprise those guys but that's kind
of cool you can just change that to
whatever you want denial of service
whoever you feel like right under the
guise of load testing yeah so there's
lots of these online though I'm not
really sure what kind of nefarious or
evil evil stuff you can get up to with
it it's basically a system that defines
the output of a solar collection system
so you know somebody has solar panels on
the roof or business has solar panels on
the roof these things start to get
interesting when you start getting up
into the higher energy consumption
ratings because usually they'll have
large lithium like lipo batteries that
the power the power comes out of the
solar panels goes into the batteries and
the batteries users like a capacitor or
a buffer before they go into the home of
the business and fun thing with lipo it
kind of explodes if you don't treat it
right if you breathe on it wrong it
blows up so just you know fun times with
power haven't found anything like that
in terms of I can blow it up over the
Internet yet
with solar but there's several of these
and there's just fun to know about
because they're public and there's
graphs and we like graphs because math
grain silos are neat I don't know if
people can get into them and you can
press the button to make it empty de
silo but I presume that it's using like
a worm drive or a bit ya get really ugly
be like pieces of people oh man nothing
could possibly go wrong it's a great
idea take the grain silo and put it on
the Internet nobody will lock you know
we'll just not tell anybody and nobody
will find it right we'll just put some
shit online and like no nobody scan
Singh who scans the Internet this guy no
um this is somebody apparently using
MATLAB to do like open CV style tracking
of people playing soccer all right I'm
not a sports person myself but okay
that's kind of cool we can just sit here
and watch them like it's not creepy or
anything or though if you do find
yourself in Sydney any time in the
future I know of a really good dessert
place um
this falls into a very category of very
few findings like this where I found it
on the internet and then entirely by
happenstance sometime later in the
future I was able to walk up and touch
the thing in real life so last November
we did this big family vacation to
Sydney and this was probably this
finding was something like six months
before that it was like DEFCON like a
middle of the summer and it turns out
this passionflower place was like 15
minute walk from the hotel so I had to
go like that touch the thing and people
are looking at me quizzically like what
are you doing to the cash register I'm
like just let it happen
they have no idea I've fun OPSEC stuff
always look at that bottom right hand
like look at all that shit going on
there that windows box what is all that
like you got VNC you got TeamViewer you
have some other stuff poof yo there's oh
there's um MS defender there in like
second from the second from the right
like I kind of safe he's running AV
right you can buy squid too that's kind
of cool this is a squid shop literally
like calamari fisheries all in the
internet there's a bunch of these um
there's a whole bunch of brands of a
cash register that run like basically
Windows and some of them are embedded
some of them aren't but some of them I
don't know I don't know why I have them
I've no idea what the reasoning is maybe
I should run a squid shop and figure it
out but like I don't know what the
reasoning is why would you want
unauthenticated VNC on a cash register
like that that sounds like a decision
made by committee right here's another
one here's somebody buying avocados with
food stamps what are the chances of that
like what are the odds right
it just it boggles the mind but this is
this is what hacker nerds do till 5:00
in the morning they just they find this
rabbit hole and I just go then they
they're doing stuff and then the Sun
comes up and I go oh shit I'm gonna be
working three hours right some day I
want to have this guy's problems though
this guy has so this is a home
automation system it's used to control
stuff in the house again like what could
possibly what could possibly go wrong
um he has a master bedroom master bath
exercise room guest room TV TV room a
game room hearth a library a dining room
a living room a kitchen a porch and
sound cast I want this guy's problems I
just want to press all the buttons and
then watch the news and see like this
dude's house is haunted rare never
thought I'd find car washes on the
internet though that's why why what
possible reason do you need to have a
car wash online there's another one in
there too I won't spoil it much but like
there's oh god there's another one in
it's even sillier I don't know what an
oil tank is used for outside of like
silos of actual crude oil I'm not in
this sort of
business but this just doesn't sound
like a good idea like you have strobe
and horn buttons just use your
imagination like you're just three in
the morning and you're sat like in your
underwear on the couch and you find this
what do you do look really really just
more just button pressing and then watch
the news just don't get caught
use that go back to that window see E
box and then proxy to that you'll be
safe right so apparently this is ride
Pierre is in England I think and I
somebody else I gave them I've given a
version of this presentation in the past
and somebody shouted and said this is
they know where this is it's near where
they live it's somewhere like near
Brighton or something I get in England
it's a substation that's attached to
appear so I don't know enough about ride
Pierre or its substation to say how
scary or evil this is but like again
what are you doing like this is
electrical like municipal levels of
power that anybody can mess with like
what are you what are you doing like
people see it still seem to think that
you can connect something to the
Internet and just not tell anybody
well now there's like me and three or
four other dudes that routinely find
this stuff on the internet and we do
talk some shout about it a lot so
there's that if you put something on the
Internet I might actually find it and
you might actually end up in to talk so
just saying like these guys this made
the news when I found this people like
pants were shat like actually pants were
shad um so colleg have ariane is
actually a very famous like caviar
company and sweden i think yeah sorry go
ahead
okay i go so yeah um but yeah i I put
this on Twitter and aside they go
friendly skate on the Internet and then
like news articles began to happen um so
yeah apparently I got somebody in
trouble because this obviously is not
supposed to be public it's not supposed
to be on the Internet
and I don't know like what the caviar
market is like I have no idea if there's
like espionage levels sneaky sneaky like
caviar company versus caviar company
James Bond shit going on but like I have
an active imagination sorry like here's
great one there's another example I have
no idea what this is
no I don't know language that is it
could be Swedish it could be Dutch I
don't know maybe feel free to throw
things because those things in shout so
like I should say in the spirit of
DEFCON and other sort of hacker
conferences these sorts of presentations
are very interactive so feel free to
shout and say things and throw stuff
just don't make me bleed that much until
the talk is done you can beat me up
afterwards um but like ever it's all
it's like what we call like a it's a
level playing field it is flat hierarchy
like everyone can say stuff like you can
tell me I'm wrong
yeah feel free to shout and be
belligerent cuz that's you know it's a
last talk of the day what can possibly
go wrong um yeah I don't know what this
is what it's got temperatures and pumps
so could be fluid could be gas could be
I don't know Oh another fun thing that
I'll point out is there's a button there
says that says alarm that might be alarm
I don't know but there's a variety of
these buttons and I'll point them out as
we go because they get a little bit more
interesting a little bit more amusing as
we go so I never thought like you could
put a coal mine on the internet somebody
thought this was a good idea
somebody was like what could possibly go
wrong fucking allow star enter I don't
always test my code but when I do it's
in production yep I filled up /var
fucking uh yeah there was like a dozen
of these and they're all they were all
like Czechoslovakia or something like
that
I forget Romania I go okay yeah but
there's there's you see that thing under
sector 3 that big yellow looking thing
it's actually a lot bigger in real life
it drills holes in mountains it would be
really cool if you could control that on
the internet someday
someday right this is really interesting
except for like this screen that it's
using like if you actually like slide to
unlock like an iPhone it's potato
technology it's actually it's a it's a
system that was built to store it's like
a it's like a humidor for for potatoes
it's it keeps temperature and humidity
at a specific level to make sure that
the stuff you're storing and presumably
the grain silo you can kill people with
is safe until you cover it in people
entrails anyway yeah
potato technology so we're up to what we
have we have chickens we have cows we
have squid now wave potato right so
there's a lot of this we're going to
have a whole grocery store at some point
Italian hydroelectric plants again um
this one appears if I recall correctly
to actually not be doing anything at the
minute because the two gauges are both
zero there'll be more but uh these sorts
of things you know they're measured in
in KVA and and kilowatts and megawatts
so when you get into these large these
large sort of the huge scale industrial
systems you get to the point where you
have enough electricity that will
vaporize stuff if you if you if yeah if
you turns out if you put like four
hundred thousand volts like I don't know
five hundred amps through something it
turns into like atoms and it usually
makes the news to again more fun times
with Windows XP what the focally doing
XP its end of life what are you doing oh
my god anyway this one is another great
example of a power station or like
indoor energy control oh this one has a
large bill arm and has seal arm I'm
curious what they're for right so I saw
that like that's good but if you look at
the little gray box there at the top it
says six thousand seven hundred and
sixty point four 300 megawatt hours
that's kind of a big deal megawatts like
it's on the internet like you think that
one of the alarm bill armor seal arms
would have gone off right like
oh my god what are they what are they
doing this is like I said let's do me a
lot of shouting a lot of like yeah this
is great but not quite as amusing or
interesting as a power station this is a
presumably this is a Windows box or
maybe it could based on the font maybe
it could be Ubuntu machine but it's a
it's a it's a system that's keeping
track of meetings for a meeting room so
some business somewhere who knows like
you're controlling their little display
that talks about like maybe it's a
boardroom maybe it's a maybe it's a big
fancy maybe it's a small fancy room who
knows maybe it's a closet I don't know
but you can mess with it
there's a dinner meeting apparently at
5:00 you can end the meeting you can
start a new meeting and then just like
tick or one equals one or like putting a
bunch of a bunch of terrible JavaScript
to like send document.cookie home or
whatever do bunch of you'll hacker stuff
be bad guys put in our bad guy had every
once a while and break things it's a
good time like this one there's several
of these as well again another skate is
selfie right you have a picture of the
building that the thing is in so if you
want to go find it on Google Maps you
know what to look for really good if
you're if organization in this building
because presumably it's one of these
sort of multi tenant business buildings
if one of them hires you to do a
physical assessment or a security
assessment then like you can control a
component of the building so you can you
can say hello to people like if they
have a security staff and you'd be like
oh hello Bob from security I'm watching
you come in but yeah it's just it's a
machine that's connected to a television
display and it's available on the
Internet what can possibly go wrong you
know you just Ebola alert and they just
turn the news on right um I just kind of
cool I'm not a ham radio nerd myself but
there's a you can put a D star repeater
on a Raspberry Pi just kind of neat and
then you can put it on the Internet and
you can like let me find it
good job there's there's some more of
these things too but in certain
circumstances I'm not sure that this is
one of them you can actually transmit
and receive TCP / ham radio so you can
use actually it's terrible bandwidth
it's like 9600 baud or something but you
can actually do TCP / ham radio there's
another office directory
again use your imagination a fun time to
see if you can guess where these places
are it's a good OS inter open-source
intelligence exercise is to find a
screenshot I guess and try and figure
out where the building is you can search
for the business names you can look for
the weather you can get some eye you can
get an idea of like so how much
intelligence you can gain about this as
a target based entirely on just what's
in the screenshot so as it turns out
that's a rapid hole in of itself
entirely I can give a whole the talk
just on OS int but this is a great start
if you find the sort of stuff you're
doing client work what could possibly go
wrong
Jenkins log in you know Jenkins totally
secure totally safe uh-huh
so yeah I learned a couple years ago
about groovy script I'm not a developer
myself by trade before I did security I
was assisted min but it turns out you
can do remote code execution with groovy
script so if you find a groovy script
box just get a shell on it do some fun
stuff you can track boats that's kind of
cool
it's another another fun time and
examining what you can learn about a
place or a thing by the screenshot you
have GPS coordinates which tend to be
very useful and then you have street
names and Port of Oakland United and
international service in the screenshot
also Acrobat wants an update
so yeah that's good secure day traders
bunch of these don't know what to make
of it you can mess with these guys you
can mess with them bad oh and look it
even says in the bottom right like you
have a random person anonymous is
connected to you
no fucks given they just alright good
job
oh it gets better don't hear another
solar power thing right this one is a
fourteen point six six six kilowatts
that's that's not bad that's a you know
I'm like my condo I use like 50 or 60
kilowatts a day so if that thing's
producing 14 kilowatts that's not an
insignificant setup for solar is
probably 20,000 H dollars worth of solar
power good to know maybe they have a
battery who knows
we got Echoplex which is this is a we're
just say oh one of these is in Oakland
164 1 Worthington Road cool another sign
you can mess with you can know you bowl
alert we're like Isis has taken over the
building people go running right like
you can do a lot with just a sign like
you can go man put on your bad guy at
for a minute and just think of like how
much evil you could do if you just
controlled the sign and lobby of a hotel
all right um there's a lot of this too
I'm not gonna put my cameras directly on
the internet no no no that's not safe no
I'm gonna put them on I'm gonna attach
some via coax so that they're not even
connected via IP and then I'm going to
route them all back to windows box and
then I'm gonna put that on the Internet
good job yeah and there's oh god cameras
I actually literally have a whole other
talk just on cameras anybody here use
reddit redditors let's find this guy I
want to find this guy and mess with him
some guy browsing reddit like open to
the public how amusing would it be to
like take a screenshot of his desktop
and put it on that thread while he's
reading it
pants Shack right so this one's really
fun there's a like 4chan meme that comes
with this but like so anybody familiar
with diesel mechanics at all no
so as an emissions as an emissions thing
they have tanks of urea which is used to
be dispersed into the exhaust when the
generator is running to help reduce
emissions as it turns out if you have
full control of that valve you can drown
the motor by emptying all the urea into
the motor into its exhaust which is
doubly fun because like this one is
generating 162 kilowatts at the minute
which is quite a lot but yeah so this
seems like a generator that would be
used at a data center or something else
that needs that kind of power that you
can mess with fun times turn that thing
off and watch the news it's in Germany
up I guess or it's in a german-speaking
country or really Germany Volkswagen I
ought to be good oh that's right oh I
see what you did there that's good
that's good like I sharp right
sprinklers I used to see these as a kid
like you see the little the little you
know they pop up and they you think now
they're on the Internet somebody thought
it was a good idea to be like the
sprinklers they're not on the internet
yet let's get to that somebody glue a
Raspberry Pi to this thing yeah so yeah
um we're back to the ham radio stuff
there's a like Internet chat you can do
over ham radio like if if doing like
regular internet is not enough for you
you can pipe it through ham radio and
you can chat over ham radio on the
internet with these guys in Japanese
kind of neat I don't know enough about
the system to know how to mess with it
but this one seems pretty
straightforward um you have Kiara's
birthday you have Arya's picture there's
a resume doc what can possibly go wrong
oh he's running AVG right so like he's
obviously secure no problems here he
safe good job guy like again why I don't
know but he's really proud of his car I
guess um some dude in India shopping for
massive chassis switches and I had no
idea that we way made stuff that big and
based on what I know about we way that's
terrifying
that thing's full you how much malware
can you fit in a box like this right
like it's probably a lot of malware
right I don't know what an oil seller is
again I'm not sort of in that industry
but it seems important probably not a
good thing to be working on your oil
seller dock like publicly exposed to the
Internet just saying you know whatever
this one's really fun what could
possibly go wrong here and you're gonna
shout and this has happened before
you're gonna shout and be like fuck you
vist what are you doing no it says it
says demo like what are you doing you're
lying to us you're making a big deal out
of nothing this is it's a fucking demo
what are you doing calm the fuck down no
here's a live one and these are baby
monitors these are pregnant ladies
connected this is on the internet what
are you doing like and and the really
dumb part about this is um when you
already pee into a Windows box you are
to pee in and in some cases you are
given the display and it gives you a
little dialogue that asks you for login
right typical windows login as if you
were physically at the machine newer
versions of RDP realized that this is
probably a bad idea and they started
changing it in the register you can turn
it back on by the way for fun times on
hacks or LAN later you can turn it back
on but the newer versions of this
actually prompt you for your
credentialing before they give you any
visuals in this case this is what
happened if you already peed to it and
then just dragged the dialog box for
login off the screen right like that's
bad like people should lose their jobs
for that that's good um so remember I
talked about big batteries that store
solar power there's one huh that looks
kind of big based on the handle and the
display that's probably got a lot of
lipo in it also the fact that it's got a
really poorly edited iPhone a graphic
indicates that we should probably be
worried about giant remote control
batteries that can if blown up can
probably take out part of the building
you know again what could possibly go
hit the
and watch the news and just see what
happens this one this one is great so
it's a Japanese uh yeah Japanese Mac
with somebody putting commands into the
shell that doesn't understand the
difference between a Linux box and a Mac
so it's just all failed attempts at
stuff and it looks like it's the same
fucking guy right it's the same guys the
last screen shot where so you get to
start you start to think like is he just
dense like you guys drinks paint as a
hobby I write this again needs no
explanation what the hell like why what
are you doing
slap that guy same deal this looks like
a train station but yeah incidentally
and when you look when you walk on the
building such as the one we're in and
you see those dome cameras based on the
logo on the camera you know some oh I
sense a little bit of observation power
there you can look and based on the logo
on the camera will tell you a lot about
the system on the backside what it's
doing and what it's running in this case
geo vision is a really popular brand
that does the sort of thing the cameras
are coaxial cable din to a system and
that system laughably is on the internet
publicly good job we can watch some
movies in Spanish
some guys XBMC install this like
probably his living room media computer
on the internet you know this one I
thought it was a pharmacy I was
corrected I don't speak Israeli I can't
RS to say I can't read Hebrew but this
is a good one this is purportedly
Windows 2000 if I had to guess yeah
Windows 2000 with a system that's I'm
going to guess it's like an ass 400 like
mainframe kind of deal but on the top
right you can see the date and that
presumably the date of the last build 10
8 1994 which seriously at some sometimes
I think the internet is a time machine
and this is one of those times there was
at some point there was a burrito eating
joke and some sort of toilet Joe
made here because there's a lot of agua
para flushing which is Spanish for water
for flushing but somebody had indicated
that this could be a reverse osmosis
system and the flushing water isn't
actually for toilets it's to wash away
the the leftover water that didn't make
it through the filter I could be wrong
maybe I'm remembering incorrectly I only
have two functioning neurons to begin
with but yeah fun times
agua para flushing on the internet fun
times this one was just fun because it
said net coffee and at the time I found
it this must have been like four or five
in the morning so I was like yeah net
coffee I could use some of that and kept
going anybody watch Breaking Bad las
barras Romano's Lal mspaint is a service
right or you could have three hundred
and four thousand dollars for something
I don't know what again you know a
little bit of operational security
probably not a good idea to tell the
whole internet you have three hundred
thousand dollars like available to you
and some application just you know piece
of advice fun stuff though it's in
Spanish so I have no idea how much it's
actually worth because we're talking we
could be talking about like three four
different currencies this this is a fun
one because I have no idea what it does
it looks like it could be I mean it's
electrical to some degree because the
symbols are symbols but without an
understanding of what it does I can
really just speculate there's a
lightsaber in the bottom left corner
though so that's kind of cool
like that's about as far as I get with
some of these like it's kind of neat but
without any kind of surrounding
information about what it is it's
difficult to sort of put your finger on
what it is what it does some dude
playing Minecraft yeah what does it do
it's a hospital or a retirement home and
you can change the temperatures nice see
every time I do one of these talks I
learned something new thank you very
much that's amazing I'm gonna have to
that's glorious haha old people cold for
you right glorious good times
so yeah fun times Spanish guy on skype
playing Minecraft fun times you know the
same sort of thing you can you can gain
a lot of intelligent intelligence about
this person and maybe do nefarious evil
things to them then there's Phil Phil
has an office and you can control this
office over the Internet what could
possibly go wrong Phil you're gonna have
a bad time you can catch people watching
movies like I think this is like full
screen Netflix guys watch an Ender's
Game or girl who knows another Italian
hydroelectric plant except this one's
Team Viewer license has expired
this one again the interesting part here
is four hundred eight point three
kilowatts that's almost half a megawatt
that's kind of a lot of power that's
yeah that's like we get into the big boy
like that's yeah that's a big deal um
another set of sprinklers because we
didn't have enough for the first one
this one's interesting I've actually
have friends in Oakland so this was
particularly amusing to the friends of
mine that I had in Oakland or another
you know use your imagination it's a
public it's it's a kiosk to pay your
parking fines somewhere in Oakland a
voltage sensor for something I don't
know enough about EE to to be able to
say but kind of neat could come back to
it mess with it some more you know
sensor stuffs got a lot of stuff open at
the bottom PDF some other stuff I don't
know yeah we put that on the shelf and
come back to it later a circuit board
printer which is kind of cool I've seen
them but not connected to them over the
internet so like maybe this could be a
thing where Brad baked and Co so who
knows maybe you can look them up and
find him and go mess with their I found
this thing on the internet like don't
call the cops
um so there's been a lot of speculation
in in the security community or not even
in the news I should say about like evil
hacks
from China well the fun part here is
this is a box in a well it does actually
say no maybe it's not in actual China I
don't know what the IP address is but
like Kali Linux if anybody in the room
is unfamiliar
it's a Linux distribution that lives on
a live CD that's packed full of like
hacker tools that you use for like pen
tests and security assessments it's it's
like an armory of evil hacker stuff
well then maybe not evil um well maybe
it is evil or whatever I'll take that
all I'll take it for that I'm evil
hacker man so um yeah you can just
connect to it via VNC over the Internet
and launch attacks from this machine
because this machine is full and
pre-configure you configure tools it's
like what could possibly go wrong like
you're gonna go attack stuff on the
internet don't do it from your house do
from this guy's house is he'll take the
cops that go to the cops to go to his
place or you can just spin off a bunch
of copies somewhere in some
spanish-speaking country yeah this is
the touchscreen on a big printer
somewhere which is again why on earth is
this on VNC like who who thought it
would be a good idea to put this on the
Internet
whoof yeah oh here's a good one just
I'll just let this sit for a moment
let's just bask in daus on VNC on the
internet and it gets better it's that
same fucking guy again it's the same guy
like this can't be a human being typing
commands in the keyboard just like
really like first you're opening ten dot
107 like that's not a routable IP
address at all okay echo something blah
who cares where ever I explored I exe
yeah there's a lot of that and das in
there woo
so um ceramic printers I have no idea
what they actually print but apparently
they're very big and very expensive and
this is one of them so take that for
what it's worth I guess a Durst gamma
direct something there's probably some
stuff you google here but it's good like
at the top top right-hand corner on
another user is controlling your desktop
no fucks given like security alerts
matter and like this is a great example
of like I'm a guy who found some stuff
on the internet and somebody got an
alert and that went in like it says what
happens when you look at it alert and go
and I find your chin and I do this right
I thought this was very apropos
providential occurring as a favor
occurring at a favorable time or
opportune if somebody's Mac screensaver
VNC fun times this one is even better
it's that same guy again if you see the
text in the top left the same fucking
guy um this is McAfee Antivirus catching
whatever this guy has apparently once
successfully installed on a Windows
machine so like he went through all
least all this trouble of like blindly
shoving commands into a VNC connection
across the entire internet for all
unauthenticated VNC that this guy could
find to like land on like terrible AV so
yeah this is this is a recurring theme
like it's this guy again um this I think
I've actually already shown you guys but
it's interesting enough let's just
pretend you didn't see the first time um
Hotels again yeah this is like number
six easily um but this one actually is
really interesting because there's
there's some friends I have that live in
Boston and work at security companies
and like oh I know where that hotel
isn't like what we should go mess with
the hotel because it is actually a lot
of fun now so I do I do like bad guy
stuff for living like I get paid to
break into places and hack things and
like like what happened to Sony Pictures
and what happened to Ashley Madison I
get paid to simulate those attacks and a
lot of that requires physical access so
like you can collaborate when you have
like a guy in the van like I do it in
movies it's actually quite a lot of fun
that that part of it the reporting not
so much but this part yeah right this
one's great um white team who this this
happened recently what was it um anybody
read the news about a UH uh like
currently unknown hackers that were
compromising consumer wireless routers
and like DSL modems and cable modems
fixing them like bringing them up to
patch level and then fixing the problems
changing the default passwords notifying
the users and then going away that was
these guys like it's accent like good
guy bad guys like vigilante like patch
your shit but they do it for you yeah
that was yeah so that's that's them this
one I just I login as zeros default
password Cubs win you just like you're
just setting your cell
on fire at that point like what are you
doing uh but you can see like somebody
somebody did some shady stuff here
because like you can see updated sh
Beauvoir that looks kind of shady Google
like every time you see history - see
somebody is clearing the history that
means they don't want you to find what
they did
um but yeah cat cat the history cat the
history you move the history exit exit
so like somebody did some shady shit and
is covering the tracks but because
they're derps like they left the the
history the visual history in VNC so
like that kind of sorta had the right
idea but not really back to the paint
drinking this is basically like so like
if you if you want to talk about the
noise floor of like gin generic random
bullshit attacks coming over the
Internet this is basically what you're
up against if you can defend against
this you're better than like a 90% of
people on the Internet and that's
generally this is the sort of stuff
you'll see in your IDs logs and your you
know other logs that you're keeping
presuming you're have logs or even look
at them that this is the sort of stuff
that lands in them and it's like if
you're a security analyst on the blue
team person that's reviewing stuff this
is the sort of stuff you see you just
roll your eyes and keep going uh this is
another great one something in German I
have no clue but I suspect there might
be one or two people in the audience I
could read that so if you can see what
that is please shout or throw something
a water delivery system what could
possibly go wrong
yeah so that's like a municipal
reservoir good time right like again
somebody thought it was a good idea to
put a web server on a thing and like
don't get me wrong like there's been a
lot of amazing talks at this conference
about putting web servers on things just
don't put them on the fucking in it like
that like I'll find them and I'll shout
about it right so for anybody anybody
that's familiar with the show regular
ordinary swedish meal time yeah
something in swedish that's doing
something i don't know
otto pro automation processes like the
only thing but there's LARM again right
that's about as far as i get with these
sadly i haven't taken the time to learn
language but when you scan the whole
internet as it turns out you run into a
lot of languages you don't know these
guys however it's pretty straightforward
no more
there was a box that I found like this
that was something like 16 or 18 VNC
ports and all of them were open and each
one had a different desktop with a
different person doing trading like
that's that's a lot of cross-pollination
like cross contamination like one guy
fuck some shit up it gets like a key
logger installed or something like that
everybody on that box suffers good job
you know right wait way to evaluate risk
um something no idea I don't know I I
got nothing
could be cool could be silly but I do
like that all of these come with these
silly like mspaint like 1985 style
graphics like somebody really worked
hard on that
um this is these are these are fun
sometimes you have I guess it's just a
another VNC to a Linux box but in a lot
of cases you'll have a certain control
port like on a Linux box ctrl alt f7
control is f6 something like that you
get like raw syslog so you can just sit
here all day and then watch this machine
and see what it's doing before you
actually try and get into it or do
anything or you can just no touch it you
can just sit and watch and scroll and
maybe something interesting goes by this
I do I got nothing every so we may not
be able to see in the back but like
every single building has a bunch of
kanji on it it's all it's either
Japanese or Chinese I'm gonna guess I'm
not I'm not sure I can't tell maybe
Chinese oh so the Japanese have building
names instead of street names which that
Explorer that's cool again learn
something new every day
so that's pretty cool I have no idea
what this is or what it does is it's a
map of something kind of cool it's
Japanese I got nothing fun times I'll
post a slide deck and you guys can tear
it to shreds um a hot parlor wash I
don't know what it is but I don't want
one yeah uh yeah I don't know what a hot
parlor washes for I'll I'll I'll keep
the hundred and fifteen degree probably
Celsius away so yeah any BSD nerds in
the crowd beastie yeah uh in the hacker
circles like half the rooms
pS geez more secure thing and planet
yeah being except for when it's on the
internet public like that good job I
still maintain like in the mid 90s I did
I was part of the OS war the OS like
religious wars but I still maintain that
any OS is as good as its admin if you
can secure BSD rad you can support I've
seen Windows boxes secured to be
fortresses but yeah it's this is
generally a firewall usually um when you
see stuff like this
sometimes it's FreeBSD but this is very
similar to the pfSense
bsd firewall login screen that you see
so yeah what about now right um this I
originally thought was a dairy plant I
thought this was like a giant cow
milking setup and I'm like yes cows and
milk on the internet but it turns out
that somebody pointed out that I just
can't read which shouldn't be a surprise
to anybody in the top left-hand corner
said hide types Jersey dairy cow beef
cow blah blah blah ox grain-fed
Boltzmann this is this this takes the
cows after we eat them right or maybe
after maybe them after they remove the
delicious steak the rest of the cow goes
to another system and this one turns
their skin into leather huh okay hide
loss ninety seven percent that doesn't
read like it's doing very well just
saying like I get if I get like thirty
seconds a slide to look at these things
so I'm like okay yeah so yeah now we're
up to like two different kinds of cows
at this point right I was gonna say like
oh it's his fucking guy again no it's
his friend uh Jenny
Jenna Jenna Jew Elite 3 1 3 3 7 X echo
binary and he can't spell regedit he
spells rage at it is it really angrily
editing that registry where is it
there's another one echo you got owned
yeah hot shit you win guy take my shells
oh man and this is a red hat box fun
yeah so as it turns out if you just like
if you want to set up a honey pot open
VNC let it go on the internet open up
notepad and just wait
did you get this sort of shit it's
ridiculous
so this is another one you get a lot of
these um the TeamViewer update box it's
like Oh your license is expired or we
want you to pay or whatever it says you
get these in like a dozen different
languages and it's always the same every
time because generally speaking you'll
have they'll do a twofer you'll have
like TeamViewer and VNC on a box and
allow you to connect via either so if
like one breaks you can still get into
the box both public good job this is a I
can't tell if this is a TV station or
this is just like something but it's
it's a Adobe Flash media server and it's
live streaming to somewhere so you know
if this is like maybe a movie theater
maybe a television station you just stop
and you choose like you go choose meet
spin or goatse or whatever l the
traumatising media you want you'd play
and then you watch the news right and
then here's a Brazilian television
station which I think that this is like
viewer ratings I'm not a hundred percent
sure what this is but when I looked up I
bought media it's a it's a Brazilian
television station it's kind of cool
this I get to wrap my head around um so
I Qi is a is a manufacturer of cameras
they're like they're big surveillance
cameras are like this big they go on
buildings under like weatherproof
somebody like duct tape to one to the
top of any TM why why would they do that
and they took me for a while like this
again I can't read I'm an idiot to
working neurons i watch this for like an
hour and I kept watching people like
walk up and they put their face in the
camera sometimes they'd smoke and I'm
like what the fuck are they doing like
there's the camera this is the thing is
this big like what are they doing how do
they not see this camera and then
somebody said look retard it's in the
bottom right hand corner says ATM
alright yeah it's an ATM camera so I was
fun I found that in the green room
before I went onstage to give a talk
similar to this at a cut at a conference
in Amsterdam called hacking the box
which is fun times oh yeah so found that
like 15 minutes before my talk but right
in again so the hairbrained like what
are you doing like this some of this is
face-slapping lee bad like wow how would
you let this happen
admittedly on this one you can't
actually see any financial data you
can't see any financial transactions but
there's there's actually a whole topic
of hacking camp
is because generally these cameras are
just embedded Linux on MIPS and you can
shell that and if you can show that you
can pivot through it and if you can
pivot through it you own the ATM so you
know just saying you can also tell that
into hydrogen fuel cells what the hell
just what are you doing and this is like
it this is pre login right so as asking
for user name and password look how much
information this thing gives to people
that are telnet again before they give
it credit San it's like a half half rack
19-inch rack like with blades but the
blades are like these reaction like
chemistry blades and you have tanks of
hydrogen you pump hydrogen into the
thing and for each blade you get like
200 200 watt or something like that and
it's used to be like it's used as a
replacement for the big diesel
generators that we've already seen this
these things tend to live in like cell
towers like you go up on a hill there's
a cell tower this thing lives at the
bottom of the cell tower so if like
municipal power goes out because we were
messing with something else earlier then
you can still know a god the power's out
on the cops are coming on phone and then
you can get to the internet that way if
you can speak Italian I'm all ears
I got nothing I've seen this for two
years I have no idea what it is it's
something it's big like this is what
happens when Mario eats too many of
those mushrooms like who like this is
Mario's worst nightmare yeah I got
nothing a bio digester interesting oh so
so maybe oh it's a it's a gas production
facility that takes gas and pumps it to
turbines to burn the gas for electricity
oh so it's like a landfill
maybe rad
yeah awesome you learn something new
every day that's awesome
you guys are amazing okay who knows what
a Libra is I'm gonna know where to leave
it is in order UPS is right the things
you connect to the computers to you know
the power goes out the computer
maintains power anybody mess with those
before like try and rake them you don't
have like you can put them in test mode
when you put them in test mode they test
the circuitry to make sure that nothing
is burnt out or everything is
transmitting power the right way and it
tests the battery to make sure the
battery can still hold a charge to do
that you have to disconnect the battery
from the load the load is the computer
these things go into data centers
click data center goes down rad a good
job and these things SNMP everything
completely public suss publicly
accessible snmpv2 fun times you can
actually modify systems if you have SNMP
to snmpv2 enabled you can you can talk
to these computers and say hey go on a
test mode from like the command line you
can use snmpwalk to do it
you're like tap any type of company
enter and like suddenly Amazon goes down
mm-hmm um so this this could be
interesting
I found this several years ago there's a
system called I'll on and I'll on uh
they're stackable like Devo hats you can
have like one major controller and it
controls a whole bunch of other
controllers this is a company that it
the service it sells is to go to your
business install one of these I'll on
controllers and this controller it
controls your power your lights your
alarms your HVAC your air conditioning
your ventilation garage doors everything
it controls all the guts of the building
and then what they do for maintenance is
they they have one of these i'll on
machines in their infrastructure and and
it talks to your i'll on machine so they
can control it remotely so it's like
managed HVAC facility building services
um this company had like you see this
list on the left these are all the
businesses that they are attached to
so all those there were those are
password-protected right you couldn't
get into those but the one at the top
that controls look at everything public
rad good job who's what you watched die
hard for remember the fire sale you'll
be like Boop copenhague Copenhagen
or out by yeah or these like this um
gigantea which is a place in copenhagen
uh there's an oh well you can control it
it may not be in copenhagen but you can
still control it with the system there's
a an ice rink under that under that
platform they're like they're playing
maybe basketball on maybe rugby who
knows they're doing something on it but
under that would there's an ice rink and
you can defrost it if you feel like it
so I thought was pretty fun right um
people putting oh this is this is great
um converting an iPhone app on an
Android phone to be being a personal
webcam by just running an app right and
it's a Java based app and it allows you
to control the phones
somebody took like a phone and they just
duct-taped it to a wall and now it's
there like web cam or whatever and you
can like click here to play audio you
can surveil the room and the really
funny part about this because I went
offline shortly after I did this um it
gets dark and there's like there's a
little uh one of these buttons Oh open
camera controls up there that button at
the top gives you controls to turn the
flash on and off so you can like and it
comes on like a flashlight so like 3:00
in the morning you're like Boop and the
light comes on and suddenly they realize
maybe putting their camera on the
internet publicly with no credentials is
a bad idea this one was really creepy
and has gotten a lot of attention from
the ACLU and in the recent past um a lot
of these are like in Louisiana in the
United States a system that takes a
picture of every single car that drives
through it for apparently not even law
enforcement purposes just it just it
takes a picture and it records the
license plate I thought that was at
first when I found these things I
thought it was a red-light camera but
it's not a red-light camera just taking
pictures of everybody so people were
like that's really bizarre why are they
doing that why are they tracking normal
people haven't done anything wrong so
there's like a lot of shouting about
this on the internet that's not coming
for me but yeah that's pretty shady um
remember I asked earlier about people
that lived in France
anybody live near foo Mel because they
have a dam that's public and if you
google for this if you google barrage
Defoe Mel you'll find articles where
this this dam has flooded people in the
past so I put this screenshot on Twitter
and the DHS called me the next morning
like no shit like us down there oh no
but turns out the guy was really awesome
and him and I worked together to like
call the ISC cert people in France like
we found the French government people
that are responsible for dealing with
like horrible stuff like this and we
gave it to them and they said no shit
we're on vacation like right what do you
do what they tell you like Oh see
something change something reported to
the government the government like back
to you or vacation all right fine fuck
you we'll find another one right and
then number three and then like not it's
not hydroelectric now it's switching it
was like France what are you doing oh my
god it just doesn't end but yeah I
should go back and see if they're all
still up because oh man like this this
one that one nine months went by before
they took it offline nine months after I
reported to like my government and their
government now on a right fun times
right um if you search for laser wash
you can find more car washes go figure
this one has little like safety like
metal plates you can trap a car on the
inside and you can turn on a little
alarm I didn't actually try it but I
thought it was amusing um speakers that
you can send mp3s to that will play the
mp3 again great idea on paper but like
when you connect it directly to the
Internet maybe not such a good idea
because when we all find out about it
everybody's gonna crack open their
laptops and suddenly you get a cube of
like Rick Astley like never going to
give you up coming out forever
right um is another another instance of
problems that I wish I had a hotel with
a refrigerator just for the champagne
and it's got an alarm happening cuz the
Ilia yeah this is some big hotel in New
York I don't remember which one it was I
actually like cut it out of the the
screenshot in the past but um yeah fun
times certain may want to not do that
that's bad I they have a certain
Department and I contacted them and gave
them like I have like a hundred and
sixty-seven findings just for certain
but yeah you typically don't want
remember I talked about OS int and like
operational security probably don't want
your course switching fabric public
right like I know that I gotta talk to
them they said no but we're a we're
a academic organization and we like
sharing all this information oh that's
great that's cool you can share stuff
like when bad guys find this they're
gonna break it or they're gonna exploit
it so it's probably not a good idea to
advertise all your course switching
fabric or you know all of your compute
nodes in in in you and how much CPU
they're using and how much resources
they have and what they're connected to
and you want a VM because you can just
spin one up and have a VM this one is a
really interesting one if I'm reading it
correctly its ASCII left in France
somewhere that will allow you to stop
the it's not just a regular ski-lift
it's a gondola you get in the gondola
you get it halfway up then you stop it
you open the doors and then you shout at
people like what could possibly go wrong
right like why why is this even online
um so a little bit physical or
geographically closer to where we are
now um this is a cooling system inside a
shop in the Oxford covered market in
Oxford um you can you can mess with
lobsters on the internet like like no
shit you can control lobsters so we're
having we're working our way up to a
small store at this point of stuff we
can mess with over the Internet this one
is just ridiculous um it's a swimming
pool that you can control over the
internet you think why why why would you
need a swimming pool of all things to be
on the Internet until you see that why
right so it's is it again like a lot of
shouting and arm waving whooping fuck
were they thinking like really an acid
pump like you just push the button and
dump all muriatic acid into the pool
what could possibly go wrong
so after my rant I'm a little over time
and I apologize um I just like everyone
to consider the following stop putting
shit on the internet or at least count
to ten before you do it right thank you
very much uh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
