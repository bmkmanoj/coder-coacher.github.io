michael ii would like you to get to know
the audience a bit better as well so
just to make sure that everybody's awake
who we're in the room currently is a
software developer just raise your hands
give that's most of you and who in the
room is like a senior software developer
so maybe have like 10 years of
experience still a lot of good that good
and then final question who of you guys
are currently working as a technical
league so you have a couple of
developers that are working in your team
that's a bit less and and have you ever
worked with other technical league
that's different people none the first
question that that's really interesting
now if i if i'm going to be if tips on
my own technical leadership i should
probably start with an explanation what
i think that technical leadership is so
i believe that the technical each has
the responsibility to help a team move
forwards so in general the person who is
assigned as a technical league has a
sound technical experience and also
strong communication skills he or she
will probably be accountable for the
technical direction of the project and
it will also be the go-to person for for
other stakeholders like your business
like your project management's etc let's
dive into some details first and
foremost the technical guidance is very
important when it comes to medium or
larger teams it's not uncommon that you
have a dedicated technical lead who will
be taking responsible responsibility for
certain leadership activities like
guiding the technical vision so for
example which technology are we going to
use how are we going to deploy our
project what are the particular patterns
that we will use etc next is analyzing
risk and requirements so another example
imagine that the new version of a
framework came out or you want to you to
discover something new here at the
conference and say are we really need to
use this issues right the best thing
that I've ever saw which are the risk if
you go implementing those new
technologies within your
application and how can you of course
mitigate these risks it's also about
about coaching I hope most of you don't
have to deal with with boxers but it
makes a lot of sense in projects that if
like a mixed audience you will have
junior developers you will senior
developments and that just it makes a
lot of sense because it's most more cost
effective you will train the junior
developers so there's also a very
important coaching role for the
technical leads and then finally it is
about bridging the communication gap I
mean most of us here in the room we are
we're we have a pretty technical
backgrounds you just show me that
earlier and business stakeholders
they're less technical in nature so you
will need to find a way to communicate
with these less technical people so do
we really need technically what do you
guys think do we need technically raise
your hand if you think that we really
need a technical lead at it's actually
like 70% I think there is actually like
a lot of discussion on technical leads
on the internet if you just Google you
will come up with tons of links and many
of these links have actually pretty
interesting points in in like the ideal
world wherever you have well a team of
well-functioning developers that can
make right decisions that can prioritize
their work maybe it's not strictly
necessary to have a technical leads I've
never seen the ideal world before so do
we really need a technical lead
everything is awesome if you have seen
the lego movie you will actually know
that everything is not always that
awesome so even if you have a context
very where everybody talks to each other
and you can make decisions it is very
easy to do to disrupt that that the
delicate balance everybody s has seen
these kind of discussions right and even
if you have a really well-functioning
team the business will still be looking
for like a single point of contact
somebody that they can put their their
requirements and just have somebody else
handle it
so but it's I think it's important that
the the technical lead role is just a
role it's not important to discuss
whether you need one or not I think it's
more important to make sure that's the
the
the job of the technical leaders fulfill
the responsibilities that he or she has
now as the the the job title states
there are two sides to the story there
is a technical side of the story and
there is also the leadership part of the
story and unlike my diagram this will
never be balanced like equally on each
side I hope to provide some tips for
both of these we're going to start with
the the technical part but just one
warning like any leadership function a
bad technical lead can make things worse
so with these tips I hope to prevent
that so the first tip is be an advocate
for change so that means that you create
like an atmosphere a culture of positive
evolution so when you notice that a
certain process is slow or cumbersome or
maybe just stupid if you have ever
worked for like a large corporation you
have seen stupid I'm pretty sure that
you have you should embrace that you
should see that and we will try to make
it better
now that's pretty easy to say but how
can we do this how can we advocate for
change and one way that I particularly
like is a pattern called double Oda it's
called observe orient decide act
actually Co also called the the Deming
cycle now what does this mean in the
observation space you will be looking at
from within the project what's happening
in the projects for example you have
tested like sometimes they failed and
run the test again and they don't fail
anymore or build that sometimes fail
that's like it's an annoyance in the
orientation phase you will use your
experience or the experience of your
teammates to look at that particular
problem why are these tests sometimes
failing it might be raised conditions at
things like that so when you have
identified the the cause of the
observation that you made you should
make you should decide on how you're
going to solve these maybe you need to
appoint someone specific to look at okay
this is the errors that are being caused
by the bills you will look into that and
that also might be technically of course
and then if you make that decision of
course you need to act upon it and
what's really cool about the Deming
cycle is that it's a reentrant loop so
if you do certain actions it is
perfectly possible it leads to new
observable
so maybe the test that was failing in
the past doesn't fail anymore but all
the other tests are failing so then you
should probably have taken a different
decision how can you achieve this by
experience the same pain as everybody
within the team a technical lead should
be part of the team it's not somebody
that comes from outside and just looks
at the problem maybe once a week you
should be in the team and experience
everything that everybody else is
experiencing and I personally am a big
fan of this continuous evolution and
continuous evolution also means like
changing the name of your presentation
when you have already started so welcome
good morning to my talk called 11 tips
to become an awesome technical lead so
the second one is worked through failure
and success things will fail you need to
prepare for failure both will break new
pointers will happen it will happen but
when these happen don't finger point and
just look for the solution and take
ownership stay accountable for what
you're doing and also learn from this
failure something that I always try to
tell the the people I'm working with
don't fix the same work twice you need
to have unit tests or integrations as to
make sure that whatever cost your
replication to go in the state of
failure that it doesn't happen again now
if we say that things will fail it's
also very important to like to celebrate
successes and I will share a personal
story about celebrating success because
I think that you should celebrate
success often and early so if you have
finished a sprint or a feature is
complete then maybe do something fun
with the team like happy hour drinks
team-building things like that because
the team will be very motivated and it's
just plain fun
now the personal story a couple of
months ago I was working on a project in
Belgium for a customer and we finished
the project we were in time surprisingly
because that does not happen very often
and we do a demo to the customer and the
customer looks at what we're doing and
he is really happy but after the demo it
all evolved management has decided that
they're going to a completely different
routes so the project never made it to
production and if that's the particular
moment in time that you're waiting for
to celebrate bullets that's like really
not very very fun that's really
disappointing especially since the team
who did most of the work worked very
hard and in making sure that it was a
successful project so congratulate the
team when the Sprint is successful but
also congratulate individuals so you've
been at the conference for two days
already you've seen a lot of cool things
when you go back to the project that
you're working on it's a are this new
feature maybe we should try to implement
it has added value for us if that idea
if it delivers then you should also be
congratulating the individual person
because it will lead to more creativity
it will lead to two innovative IDs state
technical I think this is very important
tip since there will be a lot of
responsibilities and things that you
need to do so technically it has
non-coding responsibilities but I
believe that you should still keep on
writing codes you should do code reviews
you should have your code reviewed as
well of course and I believe it will
probably be the case that you will have
less time to write coast and then other
people on the team but that doesn't mean
that you should not be doing like proof
of concepts maybe look at what can be
reused identify interfaces that might be
useful to split off etc I already talked
about code reviews and I also think it's
very important that a technical vision
for your project exists and this
technical vision needs to be shared by
the team if it's only in your heads then
it's not really very useful
but I also believe it really works if
you share how you guts do that technical
vision with the team and maybe try to
encourage them to work together with you
on technical vision the adoption will be
become a lot easier and then the last
part is also the evolution of the code
at a certain moment in time you will get
like a lot of confidence in the team you
will trust their decisions but that
doesn't mean that you need to be looking
at the constant evolution of the codes
because there will be other
opportunities rising arising from
looking at the codes and now in general
most developers they're pretty keen on
looking at frameworks or new versions of
things or new ways of working doing my
grocers doing G RPC but but these topics
like networking security deployment and
consistency of the codebase there are
less lot less like sexy
ah quit yeah well that's working
somebody else will probably figure it
out so also pay a lot of attention to
these points and I sometimes find it
kind of strange that so many people
don't really are blight obsessed with
deployment I mean we're building
distributed systems there has been I had
tons of micro services talking here yet
the deployment stops whenever it's
running in doctor on my machine that's
absolutely not true it's worthless if it
doesn't go to production tip number four
always available this actually pretty
difficult tip I believe that as a
technical lead you should try to be
always available for your team for
questions for remarks for guidance for
assistance and things like that but
since you also have other
responsibilities this is basically about
time management and what I tend to do
and what works for me is I have four
charts technical design business project
management and code and I try to assign
a value of percentage of my time that I
want to be spending on these topics now
um you do this upfront before you start
with the project and most of the time it
looks like this with me but when the
project is ongoing you should also like
fill in what is the actual amount of
time that you're standing because that's
something that you will learn from if
you're doing project management all of
the time then you're not doing the other
things you're not talking to your
business now that doesn't necessarily
need to be a problem if you have a
strong team if the other roles are
fulfilled but I think it's very
important that you know about these be
realistic you don't need to be able to
answer every question I talk sometimes
it's just okay saying okay that's that's
a really good question I want to take
some time and look into that maybe look
at alternatives there's also really
forms works really nicely with the
double-o ba but what is very important
is that you come back to the initial
person who asked you the question it's
just a sign of respect a sign of showing
Kay you came to me with this problem
this is what I've thought maybe we can
work on it together and also be very
aware of your team and other people
might have faced a similar problem so
you just might need to be connecting
people this is especially true when
you're working with with larger things
and this time management it's not easy
but but believe me over time you will
get better in it be a mentor for your
team I have a couple of supe
responsibilities from mentoring so the
first one is a mediator role you should
facilitate discussion and also bear in
mind that when people disagree with you
or disagree with each other that's
actually a good thing because it means
that they're passionate enough about the
project about what they're doing to come
to a good solution and so try to make
sure that everybody in and in the team
can participate in the discussion and
that the decision is formed at the end
unfortunately if there is like no way of
coming to an agreement that maybe should
Park the problem and if you need to make
it a decision then you are accountable
to take that decision the next one is
mentoring and like I said earlier be a
teacher and I personally do this in the
same fashion all the time at the
beginning of a project or when new
people arrive at the project I will
virtually review every committee that
they do I will write tests that make
their code fail this will not make you
very popular but when you explain to
these people why that you're doing this
and the reason that it should be changed
they will adopt it they will say okay
but it makes a lot of sense because this
situation it's a real situation it's not
some some isolated thing that will never
happen and people who start picking that
up and then you buy yourself some more
time to spend students on time to spend
time on other things effective
delegation you do not need to do
everything yourself it will become easy
to identify who are like the the people
are more strong when it comes to to
database related things or when it comes
to queueing and you just delegate to to
these people if you have these kind of
problems so do not try to own all the
responsibilities just make sure that
these responsibilities are taken by
someone matching goals every individual
developer every junior developer they
have certain goals maybe they want to
become a technical lead or maybe they
want to do something related to to
certain new technology and you should
like what I call specifically targeted
dynamic coaching so specifically
targeted means it is for the individual
what does he or she wants to do
and dynamic it means because it will
change I'm pretty sure that when you
leave the conference here there will be
things that you saw oh I absolutely want
to learn ARCA or whatever so
communication is always very important
but even for like matching goals it
becomes more important because it shows
that you value the people in your team
and last but not least optimize for the
group you're working on a project as a
team it is important that you spend a
lot of time with the individual try to
make sure that he or she feels happy but
in the end it is about building a
project is about the group so I know
this is going to sound a bit corny but
when the when the team is working good
when the team is happy then all the
developers will be happy as well so
summarize no one to give in but no one
to make decisions but also important no
one to take step back surround yourself
with other technical leads I was asking
the question at the beginning of the
talk if you have ever worked with other
technical leads and this is surprisingly
that there's more people who are
technically but they have never worked
with other technical leads and actually
I think that it's very valuable if you
start surrounding yourself with others
technically within your company within
your project between your customer I
mean just surround yourself with these
people and look at how they are doing
things so what are they spending time on
how do they they do their time
management how do they gate they give
feedback or inputs when something
happens without like coming across as
very dominant because we don't want to
come across as very dominant well most
of the time but listen to them and learn
from them don't just blindly adopt
whatever they're saying and because
every project is different every team is
different but I think it's very
interesting to to learn from each other
this is on a personal level but there's
also like the organizational level and
are there any any any grand objectives
within the customer that you're working
for is there like a clearly overarching
objective of the software at your
building maybe there is an architecture
that you want the different teams to be
working on together and also like
interoperability and dependencies and
dependency is also a very important one
because there is dependencies on
resources like the server needs to be
available but there's also dependencies
on things so imagine that your request
do something like two-way SSL but you
have no idea how security works but that
other guy like Tim from the other
projects it's just the guys given one
day and it will be implemented so you
have a dependency on other teams and
dependency on what the project is also
possible as something that I have
experienced earlier this month there was
a project that went to production and
they have a dependency on us we have
actually zero production environments so
that is a kind of an issue you are not
alone for technically it is very
important to develop sound networking
skills as well so when you see somebody
struggling with a certain problem go to
them speak up to them try to come to a
solution together even if that
particular person is not even working
within your company or within your
customer this is really valuable if you
can like a help each other okay
leadership these are the less technical
tips and one thing that I value a lot is
interviewing new people and you can
interview new people for to work on the
projects that you're working on but you
can also interview new people to work at
the company and those are different kind
of interviews and interviewing the right
people and making hiring them that can
be very rewarding but unfortunately you
will also get it wrong sometimes so I
have a an interesting video about this
although I appear to have closed it
that's over there
like your dad do they have matte nail
together many years yeah hey hey yeah no
I did maybe getting funky black
dick Milton meanings it in the beginning
ten would be a year after to me leave a
guitar playing with man you chew we
don't try takes it out
we did what you say you guys did you
diminish his ass good god don't do that
day
so um have you ever been in the
situation where you need to interview
like ten people in not that much time
it is not very pleasant so I'd like to
give some tips on how you can make sure
that you hide the correct people it's
know your goal
I mean prepare for the interview I
really hate it when someone from from
from human resources come up so oh do
you have five minutes we have an
interview absolutely not I have no time
for I have no five minutes for an
interview what are you trying to achieve
are you looking for somebody who will
join the company for a longer time or
are you looking for somebody who is just
going to increase the bandwidth of the
project that you're working on right now
now for the people who've read the the
mythical man-month by by Fred Brooks you
know that two women will not be able to
deliver a baby in less than nine months
so be very realistic when you do any
interviews and also I think resumes are
interesting as well but you should be
worried about what's useful about
resumes you should like try to look for
patterns so for example does the the
person that you're interviewing does it
normally do a project for a long time
maybe like shorter assignment I mean
both are possible and both are good as
well but when you're looking for
something in particular and you know
that because you have prepared for it
then you know if there is going to be
mix and match if it's going to be
something that they you can offer to to
the people and you should just be
upfront and and talk about it I mean we
are going to we're looking for somebody
for like three months we don't have more
time than three months you'd like to do
project at less for two years we cannot
offer you that then you have very almost
two discussion I don't really think that
you should be focused a lot on tooling
especially when you're looking for
somebody for the longer term
I think it's more important that you try
to identify if the person from the
dislike the mindset of a developer will
address problems logically we start
talking about the latest spring
framework or the latest release of akka
or we will be looking at the problem at
hand again this really depends on your
goal if you're just looking for somebody
to increase the bandwidth to go faster
then the Thule becomes more important
than when you're looking for some for
somebody for the longer term
and I was really care about the
eagerness to learn because new tools
will appear new frameworks new libraries
we are in a really evolving profession
very important do not use Stack Overflow
to find questions you should try to do
this actually if you look at Stack
Overflow you look look
questions for senior developers that
makes no sense whatsoever I mean if
you're not implementing bubblesort
every other day then don't ask people to
drive bubblesort on whiteboards
US Customs do this and but makes zero
sense just look at a problem that you're
facing within your project I mean what
are you trying to solve and it's very
easy to say what you should not be doing
but I actually have a pattern of listing
works on how to do technical interviews
I always start by comforting the person
who is doing with taking the interview
because in general people who get a bit
nervous they are a new company they see
new people they're there for a job
opportunity so they will get a bit
nervous and comforting I do this by
asking like very simple questions to
start with so one question that I always
ask and some people in the room will be
able to verify that it's true it
explained to me what is the difference
between an abstract cloth and an
interface now this is a very simple
question everybody should have some idea
on how to explain this but it's really
surprising if you if you notice how
people are sometimes having trouble to
cope with that question and that's why
the second tip is very important it's
about offering options so some people
like to draw on a whiteboard some people
like to give a theoretical explanation
other people just want to implement
something so when you prepare for an
interview make sure that you have a
whiteboard available maybe have a laptop
available so that you can comfort them
and a tin in their way of responding to
your questions because there is no wrong
or right way when they do a good job you
should also be building on their
response on their experience because
like that you can go to more difficult
questions again focused on the problem
that you are trying to solve within your
project and show interest so a genuine
interest in people because it will make
them feel at ease it will make them
loosen up and they will give you a lot
more and then you can make sure ok this
really is the guy or girl for our
problem and I would always what I like
to do is ask like a bonus question so
what was happened what happens during
your project that was really really
really complicated it took you like week
to be able to solve them and also tell
them there's a prompt summit it's okay
if you don't are not able to answer this
question I mean we were enabled we did
took a lot of time and if you have
somebody who comes up to the team and
just like immediately answer your
question you know this is like match
made in heaven
tip number eight embrace cultural
differences so I was really curious to
see how that's going to show up that
little green dots to the left
that's Belgium where I live and the
bigger green dot is Poland and if you
see the entire world it's still very far
small part of the world what am i what
am I trying to say about that is all
people are different we all go to home
to different to live different lives
some people are married some people are
not
some people have kids some people don't
and this is something that you should
really try to embrace because your users
your customers they're not like the the
geeky developers that you're working
with every day
all your users are different as well so
this is really really valuable and
opinions matter when people have
different opinions I touched on this
briefly before that's really good
discussions are good because it means
that they're putting their energy in
discussing with you and looking for all
terms if so really try to embrace this
especially with all these different
times mindsets that people might have
very important because in the end we're
all working toward the same end goal
which is a working system this is not
about egos is about the working system
and having a good time in what we're
doing so try to keep in mind that you
have a shared end goal and try to
surround yourself with passion of people
try to surround yourself with people who
have like that the developer mindset and
then that that really brings a lot of
value to the project I'm very curious
what's your response to this will be if
you have worked with offshore you're
going to notice that that it might
sometimes become more difficult there is
like the time limitation if
you work with somebody who is in a
completely different continent it might
be that when you're working he's leaving
or she's sleeping or vice versa and that
can be a positive thing because work
will get done while you're sleeping I
mean that's it like really good thing
right
but on the other hand it will make
communication a lot harder if you are in
that particular situation I think that
maybe sometimes as a team you should
take the night shift and also vice versa
because then you will show the respect
to them say okay we can work on it
better together that will create some
kind of bonds you know Indians
developers are are people work best at
night anyway so this is a good way of
communicating and I communication is
really key because some words have
different meanings in different areas of
the world so if you should just look at
the word yes it means something
completely different in Europe or for
example in India and that's actually
something that you can cope with as well
you just say what are you saying yes oh
yes I understand that that interface
needs to be whatever so make sure that
you make the communication clear and one
thing that also really works is just
instant messaging it is a lot easier if
you have a chat room for your project
and just can ask questions over there
it's easier than to pick up the
telephone at that small particular
amount of time that you're both awake so
just have a message room use it like
that integrate it with your your CIC be
integrated with your ticketing system
and things like that it also is a
benefit of datasets when there are more
people in the room it's easier to help
each other as well so definitely
something that you should need this of
course it also works for for onshore I
think most people right now are using
some kind of instant messaging really
specific for their project maybe that's
an interesting question who here in the
room is not using instant messaging in
their day to day work awesome I will
skip this from the slides next time so
the next thing that I want to talk about
this preparing work because in general
when you work with offshore developers
they will not we have the opportunity to
talk directly to the customer so you
should maybe load like a technical
design or make sure that the user
stories that you've created or are very
clear because it will be their main
of communication and with your project
with the work that they need to be doing
and then the last one is very important
everybody is part of the team I've
worked with project managers who really
see offshore development as like cheap
labor and I really hated that actually a
personal story I've worked in in Belgium
with with like a group of a Polish
developers and some of these guys were
up until these days one of the best that
I've ever worked with
so everybody is the same everybody
should be a part of the team but this
goes all this goes all the way so don't
make sure that this is not the only
takeaway that you get from from my talk
but you can also be pretty angry at
somebody over instant messaging and so
everybody really should be part of it
estimating I'd like to start with a
quote by a Douglas Hofstadter saying
Hofstadter's law it always takes longer
than you expect even when you take into
account Hofstadter's law estimating it's
hard when you do it more often you will
get better at it but just like with
interviews you will still get it wrong
from time to time mastering estimation
is really like a lot of a lifelong
journey but this is also something that
will like set you apart this is
something that people in general or
stakeholders in general associate with
like professionalism if you can make the
estimation really good there are a
couple of ways of doing this so one that
is called planning poker so if you're
working and annan HIO or scrum or Kanban
or whatever we're working at planning
poker is used very often and with
inclining poker you first need to define
a sequence and you get some playing
cards like you see on the image and each
point of the the card represents like an
estimation of what you're trying to
achieve so there's like somebody who is
explaining the user story somebody's
saying okay I'm going to count down one
two three and then you play your cards
and if everybody in the room play
something very similar then you can be
quite confident that the estimation will
be good enough but when people are
playing something very different okay
then then you have identified a
potential problem that that's good as
well and in other issues like do re
replaying
and allow people to be reason so maybe
the the database specialist knows that
it's like data model from hell I know
you just want to do cross on that
particular table but you need to have 10
views and data model from hell and then
you can play again and you will see that
eventually the estimations will like
come together nicely and this assertive
DD is normal when you are integrating
for example a third party service and
their documentation is really bad and
you actually have no real clue you don't
even know whether it is the rest or soap
or something else then you will need to
play hire cars because there's
uncertainty and there's two ways of
coping with uncertainty so the first way
you you delay what you're doing and look
at like doing more technical design
looking out what's the protocol that
they're using what is the communication
mechanism what kind of messages do they
expect but it might be something that's
that's right really a priority a
business once it's right way and then
this needs to accept this uncertainty
and if you communicate about this very
openly they should listen to what you're
saying as a technical leads you will
probably also be doing something that I
call solutioning so that means doing
estimations before the project actually
starts or doing estimations for like a
contract when when governments or banks
want to have do large projects they in
general they submit a request for
proposal and then you need to send them
customers can sent their proposals to
this bank or government and then you
need to estimate whether exactly it is
that you're offering and one way of
doing this is with the above formula
where you do it's called three T
restaurants where you do an optimistic
estimation you would do a best guess
estimation and you do a pessimistic
estimation and then use that formulate
than if some like of weighted mean and
then you see you in general a good idea
of what you're doing and it also gives
you an idea of the certainty that you
have so if the difference between the
optimistic and the pessimistic
estimation is like huge then you know
okay this is this is a project where
some risk is involved as well and
something else that is important are the
unknown and knows
due to the nature of estimation you're
not doing something hands-on so you are
all the time facing unknowns and there
will also be a note that you just have
you have no clue that it was going to be
a problem so the you will come across
this and I think it's very important
that if you make certain assumptions
that you document your assumptions then
nobody else will ever be able to tell
you oh but you said it was going to be a
week of work and it was five months yeah
but please look at the estimations at
the assumption excuse me that I have
done and then at some time for testing
debugging etcetera because you're
working on a real project when you do an
estimation you're estimating for the
team not the the best possible the
shortest possible time that you
personally can do the the project and in
perfect conditions because first and
foremost perfect conditions don't exist
and you're not writing something for
yourself this is like realistic and this
somebody people will be paying for what
you're doing so just at a percentage for
documentation for like the I don't know
if you can say polish so the
what the moment I did it twice
anyway so and also be sure that you know
what your deliverables are if your
deliverable is also a documentation or a
manual then you should also factor these
in within the estimations so any
estimation is rather than no estimation
even even if it is completely off or all
your peers really disagree what you're
saying and it sparked some kind of
discussion that's already a good thing
because then you're working towards a
better estimation
don't forget the bigger picture people
are in general have it can make
estimations easier when they're focusing
on smaller parts of the problem but
never forget like the bigger picture
sometimes just like a very high-level
estimate can already be good enough to
to know if you want to go in a certain
direction I think it's pretty obvious
share your estimates with your
colleagues with your business with your
stakeholders so that they can give input
on them as well and if you want to
become better at estimating just also
reuse your estimates this is not the
most pleasant work out there and but if
you look at what your you did before the
projects and after the project then you
can see where you you made the mistakes
become better in the future interfacing
with the outside world since we're
nearing the end of the talk I thought I
should add a picture of kittens and the
dolls always works so most people here
in the room they're pretty have a sounds
technical background but in when you're
working with business and they will not
have that background and that's that's a
good thing and a bad thing at the same
time you should try to look for
analogies for from making sure that when
you're communicating with them that they
can relate to what you're explaining so
maybe you use other terms to make sure
that you're in the same page and work
very closely together with your business
because they will have requirements and
they will not explicitly state what
their requirements are but you should
always be looking for for what they're
trying to do I'm always trying to make
sure oh but he is talking about this and
maybe wants to be dead it's like what
the Japanese call like a Kaizen state of
mind that you're always looking for
opportunities always looking for
information and then making sure that
the evolution of the project goes goes
very well be the go-to guy or ghost girl
for management's the customer and other
stakeholders I don't think that you
should be like the single point of
contact for a project because then when
you will become a liability but be maybe
be the first point of contact because um
when you're working on something when
you're in the code your focus on one
thing only you really don't like the
interruptions but you should also try to
make sure that in some discussions some
people of the team are integrated as
well that it's documented very very
nicely as well I'm another personal
story I used to be working at a
government in in Belgium and I was
working on a fairly easygoing project we
had a large code base with some really
cool algorithms doing a lot of
mathematical stuff but it was it was we
had a small user base and the customers
really happy what we're doing is like
not really really a lot of stress but it
was a very large code base and it was it
was very mathematical so at a given
moment in time I get the opportunity to
start working for different projects for
the same customer for government and
this was like really like the fairytale
project they had the best tools they had
the best people they have really large
budgets so
I applied for that function and I was
really happy because I got it I yes I
going to work on the fairytale project
and as it turns out I was not allowed to
go there because there was nobody who
could do the work I was doing on the
previous project which is what again
this is a very very annoying situation
so again don't beat a single point of
contact but maybe try to be the first
point of complex no I was really aiming
to have the slides with the least
letters on it for the entire conference
I think I might have done that more is
know is that the magical words in
general people tend to think or
developers tend to think I can build
that yes we can we can deliver yes we
can do everything and that's good
because it really shows that you're
motivated that you care that as a
technically you're sometimes making
decisions for the entire team and I know
is something that you really should like
try to say more often when when customer
comes to you with unrealistic
expectations and say again no we cannot
do this an example for when my you look
back at the estimation part and when a
customer comes up to you see although
these estimates know I know a guy and
then my my nephew we can do a PHP much
faster than what you're trying to do
make the estimates smaller just say no
I'm being a professional this is the
amount of time that I believe that it's
going to take so it's not realistic
just say no last tip facilitates a gel
thing work so here we're in who here in
the room is using some kind of a gel
wave working so maybe scrum or Kanban or
who is not okay okay that's good some
people are still doing a waterfall and
maybe that's not not even a bad thing or
have no methodology that's that's
probably a bad thing and there's not a
talk on a gel but I believe that when
you facilitate a gel as a technical
leads that your project will have more
chance to be successful so I think that
you should create a backlog and the
backlog is like like your garbage bin
for everybody the product over the team
member somebody is just passing by
everybody should be able to add stuff to
the backlog and there's only one rule
for the back
needs to make sure that it's a user
story it's from the users point of view
it's not some technical requirements
like resilience that's not a backlight
and I mean that's that's that's a nice
word but its capability since your
backlog is going to be your your garbage
bin you also need to have a prioritized
backlog and in the prioritized backlog
the technical eat and the theme business
project owner everybody sits together
and start deciding ok we have certain
budgets to do something what we'll be
working on when the price went back up
is prioritized you can do a sprint
plumbing together with your team and
looking on who will be able to do what
what information is available it's like
the classic classic definition of having
a definition of ready use burned our
charts do retrospectives I'm standing on
cable because these are these are really
these feedback loops and again there's
another talk on a gel but feedback loops
short development life cycle they really
will facilitate a lot of things if
you're not doing a child's make sure to
facilitate an awesome team we really
have one of the coolest professionals
out there should just try to have some
fun gift ownership show trust just make
sure that you're having a good time and
that was all for me thank you if you do
you have any questions it's really
difficult to see from here questions no
questions okay thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
