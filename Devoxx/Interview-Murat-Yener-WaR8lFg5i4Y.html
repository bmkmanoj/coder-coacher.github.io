by manana can you just enjoy yourself
still hopefully are amazing I sure I'm
am jela and web guy for a long time and
lady I'm more working on the Android has
stated job at Intel your fresh from job
or not you where you've led a
mobile-focused presentation which
sounded very interesting when I don't
even worry about people record like
Lester javaone I feel mm-hmm can you
tell us the mean about that um yeah I
mean Joe Amy used to be a separate track
which took like a good portion of Joe
one and since Joe I me is not that
strong right now it's much less sessions
on mobile track but yep what
specifically when you're interested in
well now that it's done Remy have kind
of a bit diluted are you more android
now yeah i'm currently more on Android
side and working on the android apps and
what are you speaking about at devoxx
this week um i had my talk yesterday it
was on android as expected oh no android
sent the seven dwarfs so i had a fairy
tale phone can you tell us a little
creepy though yeah basically it was
about the Seven Dwarfs to help the
Android princess to fix their issues so
it was about third-party Android
libraries in seven topics to help and
fix android development process think
it's challenging for pure java trellises
to jump into android do you think there
are any issues that people kind of run
into your things they don't expect oh
that's a good question um well for me it
wasn't really a big challenge but well
yeah that's a good question probably it
will depend on which part of java your
expertise is on if you did some
or desktop UI development then probably
it's not such a big issue but if you're
just a Hawaii guy my things might be a
bit different and looking Smosh mother
were there any kind of developments and
that you're kind of excited to see I'm
happy about seeing better stuff with the
power management damn and just one last
question oracle recently announced that
they'd be contributing to a project you
get pure full-blooded java on mobile
have you seen this oh yeah kind of
what's your opinion on this do you wish
the dirt orica was the pope joan miró
more yeah i mean i mean i've been a java
guy since from the start of my carrier
so i would love to see java to stay
alive on mobile worlds but do you think
it will stay at liar yeah hey well thank
you very much for say there's doctors
today thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
