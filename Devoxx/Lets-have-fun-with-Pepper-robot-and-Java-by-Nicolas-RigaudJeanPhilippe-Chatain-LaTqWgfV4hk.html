there so we are going to start this
session as you can see while walking
with Otto F so we need the other way to
be set up before we can start this and
since everything is in this computer I'm
not sure we're gonna have the slides
anyway i'm going to start this while we
finish setting up trying should be good
you can national but so we're going to
launch the presentation with the robot
oh yeah now that my robot hello pepper
it's so nice in here yes I'm having so
much fun with Java expect that much
people do you think you can handle it
well you know my 3d sense or only
reaches so far as the first or second
row Blanc room for me no real pressure
ok that's to give you an idea of the
kind of dialogue that we can build with
the robots jean-philippe is going to
give you more insights on that later
honda stock i'm going to start it my
name is Nicola I go maybe you were
turning the quickie I gave two hours ago
and we are both working for al de baran
al de baran is a French company and we
are building robots no surprise the
first robot we built was now which is
kind of pretty famous even in the box i
think it's the salvia that we are
showcasing it and for the first time in
Europe at the developer conference you
can also see pepper that was on stage
this morning for the keynote and we are
going to give you a another of you on
the programming side for our robots but
i just want to give a few words about
the reason why we do that and what we do
so as you can see this now that you know
that's pepper and we also have another
sub 1 which is called Romeo and Romeo is
more research project anyway the common
point in all the robots that we are
building is that they have this human
body form factor that is definitely
making sense for us we
robots that are dedicated to interact
with humans we don't focus as a
companion performance our robots are not
going to carry heavy load for you and
cover long distances and stuff like that
that's not the purpose for us for us
what we want to do is robots that people
want to engage with an interact with and
that's really from our point of view
where the value lies with the robots
that we are making of course they're
also programmable robot so the idea is
that we deliver has a company a platform
that as developers we can take advantage
of and fine-tune this platform so that
it can be used in some industries of a
special use cases now has been widely
used for education mainly pepper is a
robot that is due to his size you don't
have to choose between an interaction or
autonomous behavior for the robot for
now or you have it on the table and you
can interact with it toys on the ground
you can be mobile but it's harder for
you to interact visit with pepper we
really have the size that allows you to
take advantage of mobility and of
interaction at the at the same time now
has been mainly used in education but
pepper at the moment is mainly used in
b2b context and more specifically for
retail it's a robot that is already in
use in shops in Japan facing customers
and interacting with them so we can
discuss later on during the Q&amp;amp;A session
the use cases if you're interested in
part in this part but I guess that the
part that is the most interesting to you
at the moment is the technical side and
how we program a robot otherwise singing
so now has been available at the moment
pepper is on your robot that is
available for Japan but we start
investigating the European market so
expect in the 12 months to come to be
able to buy this robot and use it to
program it for yourself or use it for
your fire company rafa lip is going to
give you more details about the other
way the kind of sensors that we have on
the robot and how to program them but
that was just to give you a brief
introduction we are at the bottom we are
building robots that are dedicated to
interacting with humans thank you and so
a few more details on paper and now the
little guy so paper is 1 meter and 20
centimeters high it's really the first
humanoid robot design to live with
humans in the way that customers in
Japan are already buying peppers and
living with peppers at home we have wide
range of functional is between we will
talk about that more later on the
technical side move recognize people
torque and everything now basically hmm
okay the brofist crashed that's funny
sorry for the little delay i will talk
in the same time that i'm trying to did
like that yeah so now it's the first
bone let's say that in al de baran the
first real version of now date back from
2006 and we've been mostly using it in
academic as nikris said so on the
technical side we provide access to the
functionalities of the robot through now
key something that we call now it's the
main somewhere that that runs on the
robot and in terms of structures
everything is handled by a session that
will give you access to modules which
has functions how to use it kind of
sorry for that the native language for
using now is patent but you can use it
in other languages thanks to middleware
that we called leaky and which adds a
layer additional layer which is an
application that will endure sessions
and which will initialize basically the
key frame work so you have api is of
course in python c++ java script and of
course java if not we wouldn't be the
architect so you have a java sdk which
is available so it's no available for
everyone if you want to try what we are
going to show you today at home you can
and it uses the C++ API and it tells you
to create your own services your own
applications that can run the book
either on your computer or on the robot
if you want to use it on a robot you
will have to instead the Java Runtime
environment as its not installed by
default on the robot but it's doable so
let's talk about code so that's the code
that we used just a year for the
introduction but we start from zero and
it would be easier to a screen little
bit closer lets us form form scratch
yellow the box so it's a bit to agree
that we don't mind hello world will need
the SDK adding that and we're good to go
so as I said the first thing we want to
do is to create an application okay
which will otherwise to access the
session then the modules and the
functions from the makers application
and to initialize the obligation of
course you want to connect or what if
you have a vehicle robot on you're
running on your computer because you can
simulate a robot on your computer so
that's why you will be able to test
things by yourself at home if you want
to if you don't have access to a robot
but in this case we have robots so IP
161 we have to provide the application
our IP
so TCP and the pot difficult it's not ex
comfortable a fault there you go of
course if we want to use dzk we have to
import it so important the Baron key
application okay that's the first thing
we want to do we are going to create our
application then we need a session to
access the modules session and we'll ask
our application photo session don't
hesitate to ask questions as we go along
they go so Edward basically some tires
usually you do that in the console mode
and we have robots that can call that
can talk so hello world will be using a
text-to-speech module let's create a
link to our module I'll text speech
and we'll give it we give it the unload
to the station little bit different in
this case every modules is stored in a
helper proxy for liver all right it's a
bit ugly but just draw the exception we
are not here to deal with exceptions mmm
there so that's the first thing to do
let's try that now yeah this argument is
right thank you
you're good stretching me your big
number of people oh you'll be killing me
the robot lost the Wi-Fi yeah the robot
plus the Wi-Fi 192 168 1 248 my battery
is now fully charged good point what
would be my problem then speaking about
that hmm forgot your own obsession can
you spot the difference sorry all right
you see that's why we need people from
the outside we are kind of diving ETA
into over robots we spend all day with
them and we forgot the essential things
that newcomers canít nice
all right the poem would be maybe more
cooperative whoo so surprised it was
like a quiz session okay I'm making
mistake after mistake and you have to
spot them it's not real conference it's
like more training okay so when you come
out you will do everything but the
little mistakes right cool so be
attentive because I'm not going to miss
you I mean to miss your mistakes you
know what I mean okay so finally our LOL
and nothing else no it's the end of the
quiz and to that mm-hmm all right
and the IP address is wrong oh you know
what i think i will just bring that a
little bit closer again yeah I can see
it a bit more let's try again finally
it's your work it's all your work oh
it's on paper yeah thank you hello world
I think you can upload yourself because
it's all your code they're awesome okay
at least the boilerplate code is there
will sear it a bit more about other
things so Nicholas said that we have a
lot of kept a lot of sensors on the
robots I will just make a short list of
them on paper we would have on paper we
would have first tactile sensors on the
head that you can find also on now
little one what
okay stay calm and would you mind
looking at the front we won't see your
cameras there no no it's fine it's fine
I'm just teaching it to be nice okay
you're awake fine so send sound on the
head be nice i said anyway so tactile
senses on the head that we will learn
how to use just after that you would
have cameras in the mouth in the front
on the forehead sorry and you were the
tablet of course which is tactile so you
will you can use that as an input you
have initial inertial sensors in the
legs that allows people to know in which
position it is if it's falling but I
never saw people for anyway it's there
you have tactile sensors also on the
hands a bunch of infrared cameras there
there there in order to detect obstacles
combined with lasers send saunas in
front in the back and finally don't pass
there there and there and of course a 3d
sensors in the eyes that's the little
red dot that you see shining in the
right height so for the front row maybe
you see it for behind I don't know in
the cameras I think you would see it if
with a little bit anyway 3d sensor in
the eye and the interest in these
sensors is that with the API you don't
well you can grab the raw data and
exploit it after but we've now the
functionalities that that are provided
with no key you can use high-level
functionalities so with the 3d sensors
you can extract directly via functions
that you have a certain number of people
in front of pepper you can detect for
with the cameras you can ask directly
now key if the people are smiling at
which distance they are and this kind of
things so if you want to exploit your
own algorithms with the raw data you can
but basically you have a high level API
so let back to a code we have another
world and we have sensors let's try to
use the head sensor so in this in this
case the sensors are raising events that
we are willing to catch and to react to
to subscribe to allens you need a module
that is the memory of the robot so let's
import at first and Baron key error
process and memory alright then we want
the connection to this module an aura
man new I'll memories
okay well we won't make the same mistake
because we learn from our mistake and we
are not going to launch something right
now and expect something to happen okay
we'll add some lines ok let's subscribe
to knit and man subscribe to event and
the event with that we are willing to
catch there is attached on one end of
the of the sensor let's take the front
one basically you have front middle and
rear and even it if it you cannot see it
on the head of pepper it's there you can
better see it on the end of nowhere you
have three areas front middle and rear
so here front tactile sensor and I can
hear you mumbling it's not an error that
there is no yet tactile we are just
French people very bad at English anyway
to catch this event we have another
functionality and object in our SDK that
revels to create a call back so let's
create that and the value that comes
back from the sensor is a float so let's
grab that and define what happens it
screaming at me because it doesn't know
about heaven car back so let's teach him
what is it what it is and the root
helper look
oh my god there you go okay override
omitted the big void on event and we are
catching so a float which is going to
throw away some exceptions that we don't
want to deal right now and could
oh my god interruptedexception would be
better and Colorado's know about it
import the Baron keep that I was sure
about that okay so we cut our event what
do we do with the value if you touch the
door what the value would be 1.0 if you
don't touch 0.0 so if all value is equal
to 1.0 then we would do something and
know that you will react because there
is no point in doing in console if we
have robot that can talk right so let's
forget about system app will use again
over 2 GS say something like then touch
my head let's make that final so we can
use it in our inner class and we should
be good to go
okay next with no really you really
thought it was going back on track with
a conference yes and expecting a lot
from you so cut review you know peer
review we have a lot of Tears the
application terminated right you're good
you're good if we want our application
to be your or to be there when we touch
diamond we have to ask the application
to keep running up the printer world
you forgot something you forgot
something I mistaken it was to trick you
world don't touch my head upload
yourself okay so that's what you deal
with sensors if you're interested in the
list of valence that you can handle I'm
just showing you a bit of our classic
IDE which is khoa graph and in which you
can if you connected robot have access
to all the events that are fired by the
sensors and the other modules so
basically our front tactile sensor and
touched are there that's why I've been
is taken from tactile sensor does exist
but it's not this one okay so with
choreograph the idea is that you also
can control the execution of the actual
robot that's what we were singing
earlier that once at home you will be
able to after up being after having
learned that much during this quiz
session you will be able to not make any
mistake at home using a virtual robot
the only thing to do would be to replace
the robot url url by a local connection
okay what could what could we do more
well we started the session with a
little bit of an exchange between the
two robots i wheeled out with the
interesting to know what kind of
mistakes not to do with this kind of
functionalities so as you see
there has been a little bit of lines to
code so we won't go writing it all we
are just going to see a little bit what
happens there basically if you want to
control two robots in parallel you just
need one application liquid because it
will initialize the new keyframe work
they are key on your computer you don't
need to initialize it separately for
robots the only thing that you need
twice would be the session one to
connect now when to connect to pepper
that's why you have one now session and
one pepper session it's also the
occasion to introduce you to some other
modules like I'll motion that will allow
you to give orders displacement orders
robot to control every joint one by one
if you want two or more globally and one
interesting thing over there would be an
animated animated speech as you may have
seen the keynote robots are not speaking
standing right there looking blankly in
front of them etro it's allowed by this
module animated say it will take
whatever string that you fill it and
generate random moves for the robot in
order to have an animated speech kind of
speak by itself let's replace that
hmm
just to show you this bit of
functionality forget about that and
replaced it
oh yeah Congrats thank you what do you
think about this guy she teaches you
that much we have a little bit more move
yeah thank you and this time I did it
all by myself anyway so let's back to
the synchronization between robots you
have an application global application
that allows you to access sessions you
have to say shins 141 robot another one
for the other robot the only thing you
have to do is to create proxies to the
different modules and basically you're
done so if we want to have a basic
interaction between robots will remove
everything from there not that we don't
need we don't need with known in wake up
say and we forget about the rest so we
create a proxy on the narrow animated
speech one of the paper at MIT speech
and we can ask them to say something 110
let's try that for now and for paper
hello everybody I am now okay that's
something but it's basically one after
the other after the other of the user
the g20 and generally I like when
conversations are dynamic when people
are interacting each other and this kind
of things so if we want to have that
with a word to robots we would need to
make a synchronous course in this case
we can just add a neat sinkhole not that
much
let's write it again hello everybody I
am now so Wi-Fi raishin time different
but it's there we have an S synchronous
course to the two modules so we can
imagine putting the right temper is a
shin we can imagine to have a dynamic
conversation between two robots
interacting each other and interacting
with us hmmm interacting with us another
functionality that we like to use now
robots is the speech recognition okay if
we want to use this kind of module
basically it's different imports and we
already have them order going with them
let's try something about that and now
let's focus I'll speech recognition in
this case with speech recognition okay
now and pepper are using neurons
technology for speech recognition and
there are Bay in their speech
recognition is based on pattern matching
okay so if you want one robot to
understand what you are saying you have
to give to give it patterns of the the
triggers that you want to use if you
want you're about to be able to respond
to the other good rest you have to
specify go to rest how do we do that
right
speech recognition are you focused there
will be a lot of mistakes speech
recognition provided eundel to the
session and we have to set the
vocabulary that the robot will be able
to understand we specify that as an
arrest of string words you're a list of
three and we had good rest speech
recognition we set the vocabulary
vocabulary words nope mmm sit sit sit
sit all right come on behave yourself
enable word spacing yeah why not by
doing that you basically allow your
robot to match patterns in the middle of
a big sentence so you don't have to just
choose the trigger you could yet you
could ask pepper please go to rest which
is much more natural and which will
allow you to a robot that is capable of
interacting with people that dude does
not know your triggers okay boom boom
boom the next thing to do would be to
subscribe to this module because the
voice recognition is not always active
so you have to trigger it subscribe and
you have to provide you on the name of
your application so let's define that
predate stick
okay if we just launched a lunch that
mmm well let's do something else if we
don't unsubscribe at the end of the
application then your robot will be
always listening which is not something
that you want okay so we launched that
just that and nothing much will happen
at this time it's normal yeah I should
have changed that so poker wiggling
recognition is active active go to rest
the green indicates that the robot is
analyzing what it had but right now it's
not doing that much remember about the
events that are fired by different by
the different modules in this case you
have another event which is watery world
recognized that we will be able to
exploit so let's look about that we have
memory imported but we didn't have the
memory initialized memory
okay then let's subscribe to event and
we want the world recognized create our
car back which will this time provide us
with a list of string let's go right
yeah you know the spot a big void an
event and we handle our list of string
directed exception career
nope
my god hmm sorry backspace oh right name
of the perimeter vodka oh my god ok so
now what we'll give you a list of words
that it thinks it at work it has
recognized followed by the confidence
level in this case we are just
interested by the first word that it has
the most probably recognized so
recognized word its word dot get and if
our recognized word is equals to go to
rest then we wonder about to be able to
rest i'll just say no I don't want to
hmm tts let's say I loved one
yeah you're right and I'm so far from
the screener hmm sorry or it's so
different from an office you know anyway
hmm so in this case say what doesn't it
didn't say something haha of course its
first and subscribe from that because we
didn't unsubscribe before stop listening
don't you want to stop listening
pepper if you don't do your best it will
be difficult go to rest now okay this
one is my very big mistake is that as I
said you don't want your wat to SP still
listening at the end so don't forget to
and subscribe because in this case I
will not know how to deactivate the
speech recognition without rebooting the
robot anyway there is still 13 minutes
left I would propose you to ask any
question that you would have I think you
learned a lot I learned a lot that's the
big thing anyway so if we do just stop
listening thank you anyway so as I said
that if you want to try by yourself if
you want to be largely better then what
we saw today you can download
choreograph which will allow you to have
a visual robot running on your computer
and the Jedi SDK which will give you
access to the different modules of the
robot some things won't work with the
virtual robot like for example the
speech recognition because it's from the
neon state technology but everything
about moving using moving using the
basic interaction that you can you can
trick using the sensor you can raise
your own event to develop your
application so everything like that you
will be able to try it by yourself and
thank you for your kind attention
attention
who's got questions so we got one over
here so so how much does it cost us
those robots those robots what is the
pay increase if you want to I was sure
that I was going to be in charge of
answering so far now now we sold around
8,000 something like that and it sold
worldwide for pepper at the moment I can
give you an answer but just about the
Japanese price because it's only
available on the Japanese market at the
moment so I cannot guarantee that the
day we have pepper available in europe
it's going to be the exact same price
model the idea is that you pay upfront
first and then you can register and have
monthly fees in order to have additional
services so pepper is about sorry it's
about 2k at the moment aprende but just
like you got the robot you go back home
and we don't want to hear about you so
in case it breaks or anything then you
are you charge full price in order to
repair your robot then it can also come
with a subscription that is about 100
euros a month where we take care of the
other way for you during 36 months and
same thing there's another plan where
each month we give you new content for
the robot that is about the same price
so Indian you get a robot between seven
and ten k after 36 months so that's
really a price model that is at the
moment just for Japan and I'm not sure
we're going to have the same thing in
Europe or in the US the day with is it
but as a for to give you an idea of the
price this is it at the moment any other
question yeah so what's the commitment
under the NAO robot first pepperell but
actually what is the future of now
because we are coming with pepper that
is new so the question is about the
future for now
you see we don't address the same market
so there's no competition between now
and pepper since both of them are
dressing different markets I'm running a
lot of workshops with kids with now I
don't think that necessarily i can do
the same workshop respect our deepest it
would be more impressed by pepper so as
an educational tool I'm not sure that
now is going to be replaced that soon
even though you could do exactly the
same thing with pepper just that is
easier for kids to handle now than it is
to handle pepper then for the business
use cases it really depends on what we
plan to do what I mean is that pepper is
mama by than now but you cannot carry it
in your hands so for example if you are
home it's harder to take the robot by
yourself and grow up stairs then it is
to carry now for example so both robot
from our point of view even if they read
the same technology and so on they don't
answer the same problems so i'm really
not sure that paper is like a threat on
the on now not at all at the moment it's
really like understanding which market
is more interested by which robot and
making sure that we can provide the
solution that comes with it other
question has a question yeah so the
question is why was it on your released
in japan so at the baja was created ten
years ago but we will put by south bank
which is a ted cooperator three years
ago and they wanted us to build the
dedicated robot for them that they could
use in shop a guess what it's pepper but
at first they wanted to keep it for
themselves they put the money on the
table and i wanted to make sure that you
could take advantage of the robot in the
first time another element is that now
is a small robot that you can ship
pretty easily and so on so for
everything that is a customer care
related that's easy I mean you can ship
it the monon the batteries that we have
on pepper don't allow you to put pepper
on a plane so it means that it's
released at the moment in Japan because
they also know how to take care of the
robot and they have all the warehouse
and factories where they can do that
it's kind of the same decision as what
you would have as an answer from an
automotive company it's not just about
selling the car
but making sure that we can take care of
the car once you buy it and that's the
same reason why we are step-by-step
opening the market in Europe and we want
to do that in the u.s. because it's not
just about selling the robot but making
sure that we can take care of it for our
customers but it's coming i think that
in the year or three years to come the
paper should be available more widely
than it is at the moment we also the
question do you think people are ready
for that ready for what do we think
people are all ready for that honestly
we can see that there's a difference
between Japan and the rest of the world
clearly that all they've been were
waiting for at the moment for Europe and
for the u.s. you can have a doubt the
fight that it's it will require some
additional work I guess to make sure
that people are comfortable interacting
with the robot but we can see that they
get a lot of attention at the moment so
i'm not sure that saying that is
entering your question at the moment we
get a lot of interest but that's the
beginning will disinterest be the same
in two weeks into months from now once
people have seen at least once the robot
I'd like to think yes but I cannot
commit at the moment and make sure that
it will be the case but when they hear
is it or when we have people visiting us
now under the entice it's like a
showroom that is open to the general
public where they can come and see the
robot we definitely see a lot of
interest and people are we can see that
what they expect from the robot is
really in advance to what we are what we
can here is at the moment what I mean is
that the level of expectation they have
is really higher than what we can do
clearly at the moment with the robots so
I don't see no reason for them to feel
like that there are some questions
related to society would they take our
jobs and stuff like that questions
related to privacy and so on but once
they are in the same room as the robot I
don't see them being afraid or trying to
stay away from it on the other on the
contrary they really want to interact
with it and get close to the robot so it
will require necessarily some adaptation
the kind of applications that we are
using
in in shops in Japan even us at the
attack the bomb look at them sometimes
or just like what the so it's
really we know that the content need to
be culturally adapted to the audience
that the robot will be interacting with
Saudi application made for Japan will be
reworked so as to be released in Europe
or in the US but for the rest yeah I
don't see people being like let me far
away from this whole lot it's really
they warn them not as bad as Japanese
people want to but they want them if i
can add something to that so for my part
I'm working at the Atelier that Nicholas
mentioned which is a discovery space for
general public to come and discover the
robots interact with them discover what
they are capable of and basically you
see certain amount people coming coming
in and kind of being afraid of as you
say losing jobs perturbing the economy
and something and basically when they
arrived interact with the robot and they
see by themselves their capabilities
their limits they are that this kind of
realization that the robot can do much
more than the fault in some way but it's
it's not threatening and we observe that
what what you said that people are not
they are not putting any distance
between then and the robot if if they do
it lasts for a few minutes and once they
see the robot greetings them proposing
to shake hands of these kind of things
they cannot resist the urge to come and
touch robot interactive 8 and the more
clearly CD potential key use ages that
the robots can provide which are not in
contradiction with them keeping their
work if it turns shows a bit
so the question is do they break often
yeah is it exactly that I mean it
depends on how you use them right now
itgs importance now because that's the
one we are the most used to an oak and
fall from his own height and it's gonna
resist it's not going to be broken that
easily on the other hand there was a
report like a month ago about a drunk
man in Japan who assaulted a robot and
that kind of first assault on a pepper
that's it so in for these cases i mean
the robot has not be designed to be
assaulted so they don't break that often
it really depends on the usage basically
they've been designed to be a pretty
robust but once again it really
depending on the usage at some point
it's also mechanical devices though just
like your car you also need to take care
of them before they break that's another
important element to take into account
and since that we are working on on our
side in order to be able to detect
default before that happen but as they
are and for regular use h know these are
pretty robust robots know so the
question was about maintaining the robot
by yourself now in most cases really a
lot of developers are asking us if they
can don't if they can do that by
themselves but it's not that easy to be
honest most of the guys will try to pay
attention to that or in this time in
doing this usually wait for the warranty
to be over before starting doing this
kind of thing so for us it's really we
we don't let people put their hands on
the odd way because whatever you do on
the other way might have a lot of
consequences on the rest of the robot
changing some part inside the other way
we'd have an impact on the balance of
the robot so if he is to fall each time
you launch an app because it's supposed
to be a balanced and is not because of
small changes inside of the robot then
that's something that we don't want to
we don't want to necessarily Nessus
face that's the same reason why you
cannot modify the other way and why the
real place where you can experience
freedom with the robot is really on
programming but we don't try to change
that much of the of the other way at the
moment the only people who manage to
modify the other well usually that was
the first example I have in head was to
have a treaty sensor on now and they
basically just printed a socket for the
head so they can put the edges 3d camera
on top of it but changing things inside
of the robot very few people have been
digging into that there's a guy an
Italian guy who bought it and wanted a
black robot I painted the robot and
isn't it three times I guess to our
office and we had to just make sure that
the robot would work again so that was
really expensive for us and were not
that happy with this kind of situation
usually so the less you you change the
world where the batteries from our point
of view and it's even worked for for
paper other questions time is amazing
time zappia will be around not with the
robot but i guess that with our face and
accents you can easily locate us feel
free to come and discuss if you have
questions that you want to handle on a
one to one side and not the sort of
everybody's thanks for being there and
enjoy attention eh of course you can
take yeah if you want to take pictures
yeah thanks a lot I think you own
