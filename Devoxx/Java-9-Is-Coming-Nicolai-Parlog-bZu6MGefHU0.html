I'm talking to Nikolai who gave a talk
about Java 9 so just gonna ice cube I've
got big codebase
it's like Java 6 or something I even
bothered with gather 8 I had a brother
with Java 9 if you haven't bothered with
7 and 8 I have problems you should
bother with mine either
you should start there and we you have a
lot of other problems there I mean no
seriously there are codebase there are
still old Java versions and then jumping
to 9 while jumping in general is not the
best decision anyway but even stepwise
going to 9 it's likely going to be
painful especially the step to 9 there's
if you have a big codebase even with
Java 8 going to 9 will will cause some
some work most likely not in all the
cases but most likely and I guess the
best thing that you can do even now is
to update to your all your dependencies
all your tools already now two versions
just to stay up-to-date mouth even not
if they're not Java 9 ready just because
if the next version of your tool is Java
9 ready but you're still stuck on a
five-year-old version for different
reasons you can't make the jump then you
know it doesn't help you that there's a
new compatible version out there and
there are special menus sophisticated
tools and ideas for example counters
that anything that deals with by coat or
a lot does a lot of reflection all these
kinds of things are in danger of from
breaking on Java 9 you can fix them and
the libraries can fix them by and large
and you can do some command line magic
to make them work but the best way to do
would be at some point to upgrade to
version that does that that's all you
need
out-of-the-box and for that to do to do
that you need to upgrade first what is
up-to-date mouth and I think that would
be the best way to go to upgrades all
your dependencies all your tools now and
then when Java 9 comes out try try
playing with it try compiling try
launching on Java and see what breaks
and if you're not depending on running
on Java 9 anytime soon
then you know take it take a timeout
wait for the tools that you depend on
that maybe break wait for that fix the
problems
try again a couple of months follow all
what's going on so it doesn't have to be
a kind of nightmarish migration
you can start using it out of the box
and then think about the module system
by enlarge yeah so there are two kinds
of migrations one of them would be just
to get it working on Java 9 and there
are changes in Java 9 that even if you
don't touch the module system at all
things that he used to work earlier
don't work anymore
so this is one part of the migration
story and to just to run on Java and
just to compile a run on Java 9 you have
to fix these things for example if you
use reflection or just even if you don't
use reflection if you just import types
and Sun miss something for example or
many of the calm Sun packages these
imports will fail on Java 9 regardless
of whether you use the module system or
not then again you can use command + X
to get out of that or you might want to
actually use public API if it exists
there's the first part and then the
second part is to actually migrate your
own application into the module system
if you want to and then I would actually
consider that second part to be easier
than the first part because the first
part you really have no choice if you
want to run on Java 9 you have to do you
have to get all working at once you can
move into the module system stepwise
like first have one more job and have
two modules then split things out like
you guys are slow migration part there
but if you're using code that it's not
accessible any more in Java 9 then there
is no slow path there you just basically
either use the command escapes or you
just migrate all at once can you think
man - gates sure so the Java module
system imposes more rules than they used
to be before so for example as I said
you cannot just import pipes from the
Sun packages anymore so if you cannot
make your code or your dependencies
maybe that depend on this code if you
cannot update this then there's another
way around that you can use a command
line flag that tells JVM or the compiler
make this type of this package available
to my code that for example works when
you use when you import types there are
not accessible anymore if you use
reflection for example you might want to
use a different command line flag so
what the point is that the rules that
the java monster imposes you can opt out
of them
by one with this command line flex but
it is somewhat painful way to do that
and you have to be the one of control of
the command line so when I write a
library then I have been if I if I don't
cannot update it I have to tell my
customer my clients if you use this
library then you have to apply this
command line flex the code itself cannot
break out of this all of these
limitations on purpose which i think is
by and large decision but it means that
there is work ahead of us and how did
you find preparing demos for your new
job and I'm talk well if you don't have
a big code base then it's easy
well it depends actually because many of
the tools are not well now they are more
and more but when the tools are not
there yet you have to really go back to
planning on the command line for example
which is something I rarely ever did
before now a daily basis so there yeah
the the demo the new API is for example
and writing there's small demos for that
sort of fun and I use IntelliJ now so
they're the two support for Java 9 it's
ok but sometimes you want to do stuff
that the idea of the IDE does not
perfectly grasp for example there's a
new feature called much released stars
which means you can have the same class
the same fully qualified class in
different in different areas of your jar
and then one version will run Java 8 and
another will run on Java 9 and maybe not
on Java 10 and so forth
so at the moment IDE snow don't really
cope with that yeah you can't have the
same file twice with exactly the same
name and if you do some tricks then you
saw that in these instances you still
have to fight the tools occasionally but
I mean Java and I did not even get out
so I support acted quite well already
and I'm sure that by the time it comes
on most major tools will support it well
enough and then going forward from them
there were more and more features will
start working I think it's important to
notice that the jdk team says it as well
that Java 8 was comparatively easy to
upgrade to and it was a very interesting
language changed everybody want to use
lambdas and streams so I was a lot of
energy into doing it right away
so many many a project that upgrade very
very early and that will not be the same
case which are benign and that is that
this
they can educate him is aware of that so
they they know that it's going to be a
longer migration where you wanna vet
things a little bit more and do it move
it more slowly and that's fine too
I mean imposing a module system with all
the strictness that it usually has after
an ecosystem evolved for 20 years that
is that's tough it's tough from a
technical point of view but it's very
tough from a cultural point of view
because people have to get used to do
things a little bit differently you
cannot just say look I just use
reflection and you know if I to get my
way with with jars you have to face the
fact that especially if your library if
you do that if you do reuse reflection
over other people's code then your
clients have to use this command line
flags otherwise your library won't work
so you have to be more careful in what
you do and I think that's a cultural
change as well and go take your time
take some time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
