going to design a racetrack for for the
line follower robot and the way the line
follower robot works is he can
accurately detect light colors and dark
colors so since I'm not sure what color
the floor is and this this is a perfect
example of the robots not sure what
color this floor is either that's why we
have the white track so you know it's
like the base color and the black which
is the line will actually follow so the
constraints on this there's a couple
constraints so one constraint is it
don't do any angles more than 45 degrees
so smooth curves are okay but if you
have any like for example if you did a
90 degree turn the robot would just see
the 90 degree turn what wouldn't see it
and we keep going straight so when
you're designing the track try to keep
it to no sharp angles more than 45
degrees the other constraints in general
is if the corner is too sharp it will
have trouble but it might make it you
can experiment and on the most important
constraint is I'm not interested in
carrying the tape home so make a big
track and have fun all right so here
have some tape taro have some tape and
you know you guys can figure this out be
creative try different things and we'll
see what works what doesn't
well it doesn't the beginning in the end
of the track don't actually have to
connect if they do connect it will
continue but if they don't then we'll
just stop the robot and start in
somewhere else it's all good actually
it's the robot has made it around some
sharper corners than I would have
expected so all right so just to see you
guys get an idea what's what it looks
like this is this is a little guy
that'll be attempting to follow the line
all right so can everyone else mostly
hear me over the construction the road
construction yeah just put it straight
down the center all right so the fact
that nobody nobody said no I'm going to
assume the answer is yes you can all
hear me so we're just going to we're
going to chat about some of you know
running Java 9 on raspberry pi while
we're constructing the the demo but if
at any point you get tired of hearing me
talk feel free to jump in and help with
a construction project this is a group
effort
my name's Steven Chen I'm the director
of the Oracle technology Network and the
Java guy job one content share Oracle
code Kamini share and I also play with
lots of embedded hardware and stuff as a
hobby so I wrote a book raspberry Pilot
Java and I'm playing around with you
know various CNC cutters and 3d printers
and other large dangerous hardware
actually one of the one of the projects
which we had in mind for Java one that's
here is um we wanted to do a full sized
like like full-scale foam 3d printer
using audio scaffolding kind of like
kind of like how they make these um this
rib doesn't have it I think that's not
actually scaffolding but you know
sometimes like a large conference rooms
lot of scaffolding overhead so you can
actually like use that as a structure to
create a massive 3d printer so we were
thinking too you know
anyway we'll see if we actually have
time and energy to do that or not before
Java one but now we're going to chat
about Raspberry Pi and specifically
running java 9 on the Raspberry Pi so
how many of you guys have a Raspberry Pi
already ok awesome
so everybody who didn't raise their hand
do you have 40 bucks in your wallet yeah
yes ok so you should convert that 40
bucks into a Raspberry Pi because it's
much more useful so raspberry PI's are
fairly inexpensive
basically it's a small embedded computer
it uses an SD card as a hard drive you
can power it over a like a simple 5 volt
connector from like a cell phone or
something a normal microUSB jack and
compared to your average embedded
platform it's it's super easy to get
started with hey do you have any ideas
for the track jump in and help out so
it's like super easy to get started with
so traditional embedded boards that
people use for their jobs like
development boards like panda boards and
other devices the the set up and getting
drivers loaded and getting you know
serial tipping in and getting all the
firmware setup and all that great stuff
that that's easily a couple weeks of
headaches with likes pad software and
poor quality control on boards and funky
drivers and different revisions the
board and all the other things you have
to deal with but the Raspberry Pi
foundation they they actually are using
similar hardware so what you find a lot
of embedded development kits but their
goal was to make this a computing
platform for education and for
specifically like teaching kids so as a
result one of their design goals was to
make it as easy as possible to get up
and running they've kept backwards
compatibility of the operating system
all the way back to the first revision
of the board which is pretty much
unheard of in the embedded industry they
also designed a super easy embedded
installer so you don't even need to hook
up to the hardware with serial or do
anything crazy you just take the SD card
copy the installer files to it and it
automatically takes the fat partition
reformat it to exp 4 sets up the
raspbian operating system which is a
very nifty vien and takes care of
everything for you so it's like it in a
couple hours you're up and running if
you know how to put an SD card in your
computer and copy some file so super
easy highly recommended to get started
with n you can run the latest versions
of Java on it so raspberry pi
distributions come with a version of
Java 8 you can install early access
version
of Java nine and play around with them
so that's what we have on this guy today
we're running Java 9 on our little line
follower robot and there's a bunch of
advantages for running Java 9 on small
devices actually a lot of the the main
feature in Java 9 is modularity and this
actually is great for embedded devices
because you have constrained space and
resources and this allows you to pare
down the JDK to just what you need you
know package up things together into
small runtime images which just include
the modules which you actually need for
your environments the way jigsaw which
is the project name for modularity is
structured is a structured into a bunch
of gems which is the Java enhancement
process so there's a JEP for the overall
module system modular JDK modular sort
of modular runtime images and then a
couple which are related like J link and
encapsulating the internal API but so
this this one's interesting in itself
the modular runtime images so one of the
improvements in Java 9 is that we're
finally getting rid of zip file which
has been around forever so actually an
optimized efficient way of storing class
files more space efficient easier to
load things will be much easier for you
know example embedded devices doing this
and it can be extended for different
data types in the future so you know
it's an optimization but it will also
help out with resource constrained
platforms another improvement is J link
this one's particularly important
because this allows you to just link
your application with the modules you
require and create a simple runtime for
it you can create a customized runtime
for just your own application which just
pulled in the resources you need it's a
tool you run from the command line after
compilation it'll pull everything in and
give you a kind of a consolidated
application that you can run on your
which just includes exactly what it
needs so you don't need a full Java or
JDK or dairy installation on your device
you can just you know put your
application and has everything it needs
they may be run in a fairly small
footprint you know I'm going to go back
and say all right
the other the next thing I'm going to
talk about is J shell and this is
something which most programming
languages have it's a read eval print
loop or rebel so Java finally has an
official rebel and this is a great way
to go on the command line and actually
try things out without actually going
through a full compile phase it gets rid
of some of the syntactic sugar around
the Java main class and all that stuff
you can just type in quick statements
and get stuff running good way to
testing although my experience is for
most practical applications you you
still actually need to pull in all the
classes get the library set up all that
stuff so you probably will never
actually use it but we will try it today
on the Raspberry Pi and see if we can't
get it working and run some simple stuff
on it and it's really good for like you
know just running quick commands showing
people things testing stuff on the
command line so it's nice that we
finally have a rebel in Java that
actually works and is well supported
this is tangentially related but Java 9
also adds a sheet to be to support so a
lot of people use raspberry PI's as web
servers to serve up web applications to
clients connecting remotely because it's
actually a fairly powerful processor
inside of it the latest raspberry
parries have armed version nines I
believe they have quad-core processors
and I think a kicker tooth member I
can't remember offhand but basically
compared to like the computers I started
on when I was a kid
this Raspberry Pi is a beast and it
comes in a very small package and it can
run a web server
serving up a handful of clients quite
easily so as an example on the aquatic
robots that james gosling the father of
java creates as a part of liquid
robotics he runs a simple web server to
serve up information about the um the
robots that you can login to remotely
over you know very slow connection
sometimes they use home use those funky
satellite satellite communication links
and then you can get in there and make
small changes to navigation or you know
see video on those the robots and do
other stuff okay so okay actually it's
our version eight not mine so this is
the quick list of what where java 9 is
supported and where it isn't so the good
news is raspberry pi twos and threes
both work with java 9 as well as you
know x86 all the Intel Edison Galileo
etc boards the not-so-good news is that
we have dropped support for our version
5 and 6 so if you have an older
Raspberry Pi if you have a Raspberry Pi
A or B or B plus or if you have one of
the new zeros you're kind of out of luck
stick with Java 8 this is less of a
technical issue and more of a resource
testing issue so you know we from a
maintainability of standpoint there's
different libraries for ARM version 7 to
version 8 so like back forwarding it and
maintaining a version for the older
libraries is extra effort and testing so
as a result we've dropped that support
so we can actually take advantage of
some of the new your compiler features
and not maintain people get versions of
the code base but if you have the older
boards you can still run java 8 on it to
run the latest version with all the
patches and you should be fine you just
can't take advantage of Java 9 features
up
and then some of the stuff which also
doesn't work or works but is not
supported so the g1 garbage collector
actually works on round three pi but
it's not officially supported so if you
want to take advantage of the new
garbage collector you should wait until
officially supported it probably doesn't
make sense to run g1 on the Raspberry Pi
anyway because the way g1 works is it it
actually takes one of your cores and
uses out of the garbage collection
thread so it actually does a lot of
garbage function in parallel so it'll
slow down your application and on a
small resource-constrained device like
this you'd actually in general pervert
prefer slight pauses but higher
performance rather than pause with
garbage collection but it's consuming
additional resources on your device the
other thing which doesn't work is JavaFX
so we're no longer supporting JavaFX on
embedded platforms again for resource
issues but you can use swing and AWT
those both work there is a good option
for doing java effects on the raspberry
pi though the folks that glue on and
they're actually doing a presentation
this afternoon as well so Johan Voss who
runs the company is out here but
basically they support they support Java
effects on mobile and embedded devices
so so they have Java FX running on
Android and iOS and they also have it
running on embedded devices like the
Raspberry Pi and I introduced them to
Evan Upton the guy who is the founder of
the Raspberry Pi and so they're working
closely with Evan to put out a new
version of Java FX which will work in
x11 the current version of Java FX which
is was was released by us and now gluon
is releasing it only works on it takes
over the whole frame buffer so you can't
you can't write it inside of an X 11
application it has to take
the fullscreen so you get good
performance but it's not possible to you
know run it inside of a windowing system
they have new graphics drivers for the
new version of raspbian which they're
working on which is not yet released and
that's going to allow proper 3d
performance inside of a x11 windowing
system for applications running on the
Raspberry Pi kind of like a normal
desktop operating system so to allow you
to get direct access to like OpenGL
low-level video Hardware from inside of
x11 and Johan is working with the
Raspberry Pi foundation to upgrade the
JavaFX support to work inside the new
environment so you can download it today
and you can use it and it takes over the
full screen in the future you'll
actually be able to run it inside of a
windowing environment as well also gluon
took over a scene builder which is a GUI
builder for job effects so there's a
nice way to build JavaFX applications
and actually I use this for the the
coffee demo which is one of the demos
we're going to we're going to show in a
sec yeah there it is coffee demo so this
this application for the coffee demo is
actually written in Java effects and
deployed to the phone you can actually
scan that QR code or go to that URL and
get the app on your device if you want
to give it a try but basically the way
the way this app works is we we used in
a Java one and we're using at the Oracle
code events and some third party
conferences actually we have this we
have this working for the CNC cutter
here yesterday the day before in the
exhibition hall but you you get the app
inside the app there's a couple
different options once for the coffee
demo one for the CNC cutter demo you can
customize for the coffee demo the type
of coffee the strength of the coffee and
what it does is it gives it has a
Raspberry Pi program running connected
to a coffee set up with a scale and a
temperature sensor and a bunch of relays
to control the grinders and the water
kettle
and then it does a automated pour over
set up so it gives the person the
barista instructions on how to actually
go through and for the perfect cup of
coffee so this is one example of an
application the second one which is the
one we have running here is the TNT
cutter so I'm using the carbide 3d
routers it's if you guys want one of
these oh you did you did the experience
knife and you got it printed for you too
yeah so there's there's six of these
traveling around the world and when they
come back I don't want them all sitting
in my garage so we use these car by 3d
routers they're really cool fun toys
they use brushless DC motors they have
little Arduino inside of them for the
motor controller but otherwise they're
pretty dumb and the way they get their
instructions is over serial over USB
connected to a computer other embedded
device so I hooked up a Raspberry Pi to
these the Raspberry Pi sends g-code
commands which is the instructions for
the motors over grbl which is a serial
protocol for sending g code there's a
raspberry pi screen like an early
prototype and it's hooked up to the CNC
cutter and it sends the instructions and
then cuts out beautiful things like oh
wait that guy and what we use these for
at JavaOne is we had artist Miriah
Wellman who built a huge sculpture out
of all the things which were cut from
the attendees so they they cut out all
these little these cool little shapes
and then we composited this big
sculpture and we unveiled it at the
closing community keynote here's some of
the code to connect to the CNC cutter so
you know it opens up a serial port on
the Raspberry Pi you know it does some
setup for english locale I learned this
in um we had a problem with this in
Europe because some of the guys I was
working with this on
machines configured for weird European
locales with where they swapped the
comma and the period in numbers and so
when you send when you send commands
with commas and periods swapped the
herbal controller just goes crazy
because it doesn't actually see those
numbers but anyway you set it up open
the comport and then you can actually
start sending commands to the printer
like like all these nice G code commands
this is the initialization procedure for
the CNC cut print it moves it moves the
head over like some of these are moved
commands I can't remember offhand what
all these are did this beat this looks
like a move command move to zero did you
do yeah this is a relative offset some
of these are speeds too like you can set
the speed and travel death along with
the commands and then that's how it
actually moves and then on figures out
the length of the tool the other thing
you have to do is get to calculates a
workplane offset because once you know
the length of the tool you have to
figure out the distance from the tool to
the surface your cutting on and this is
the coordinate system for the CNC cutter
so it has a XY and Z and you have a you
know a piece of material you're trying
to cut and then you need to figure out
what the proper offsets are to get it in
the right location to actually start
cutting and then you issue g-code
commands to do the cutting so this is
this is g code on the left and then you
know pseudo code on the right for what
these commands actually do like t21 sets
it's a millimeters then it sets it to
absolute positioning mode sets the speed
to 9,000 rpms and then starts starts
destroying the material for this we were
using acrylic plastic like like that
sheet he has over there and the reason
for that you can also cut wood and you
can cut aluminum soft aluminum but the
the problem with cutting wood at a
conference like this is you you get fine
saw dust particles and for people with
like
as more allergies or problems that can
irritate them and technically cutting
certain types of wood thank most types
of wood are mildly toxic so um you don't
really want to be breathing the dust
okay and this is a command for the
universal g-code tender which is a
library we're using to send the code
from Java code this is an open source
project of varying levels of software
quality we had to fix some bugs in it
but it's easy that's not released yet so
it'll get better okay and then similar
experience right you um you download the
app you can actually draw this on your
phone did you draw on the touchscreen or
your phone touchscreen okay you should
get the app a try to you just for kicks
you can draw it on your phone and then
on the device you press the Scan button
then you scan the QR code you get back
and then it will actually show the same
drawing on the screen that you can cut
out so fun stuff okay so we're going to
play with the line it looks like you
looks like you guys are done are we
timed perfectly here hello oh nice nice
yeah you guys you guys use did a good
job okay so we're going to play around
the line follower which is is this guy
and so this this is a little robot which
is constructed using big kid Legos so
this is made using the make block set
from there's a company in Hong Kong
called make block and they they have
this cool stuff which they they build
their kind of a maker company and they
use extruded aluminum which is really
strong and they have this special design
where all along the channels you have
this little lumps lit with ridges in it
and you can screw at any point along the
line so it allows you to do fairly
flexible design of different structures
using you know simple extruded aluminum
and some screws and some rivets plastic
rivets and
screws so it's a really cool idea
they've actually built full 3d printers
and all sorts of complex stuff using
their um using their construction
technology and this was one of their
their first designs was just building
you know basic robots so this guy's a
tanker uh but that I kind of preformed
designs using their stuff it has the
line follower on the bottom it has a
distance sensor on the front so this is
you know the safety sensor will test it
and see if it works but the idea is if
you get too close to it it's supposed to
not run you over and it has you know a
couple motor controllers for controlling
the left and the right motor so
hopefully he'll he'll actually go around
and do the right thing let me get the
Wi-Fi network he's expecting setup as
well so he could you can talk to us
so the also if you notice the design of
this is um it has a board on top with a
bunch of new telephone jacks so it makes
wiring a little bit easier than if you
had to wire up all the sensors by
soldering but there are basic designs
for Arduino boards and I wanted to do a
pure Raspberry Pi design so I'm using
this board in the middle I think I have
a picture of it you do need to do yeah
this guy here the RP 600 so it's it's a
dumb adapter from Raspberry Pi to
Arduino pins a lot of a lot of these
adapter boards which you find for using
Arduino shields they actually have our
do we know chips on them and then you
talk to the arduino chip over serial
which i think that's silly just getting
arduino at that point and part of the
point was i wanted to actually do direct
control of motors using pulse width
modulation so you can do PWM or pulse
width modulation from the raspberry pi
directly you can do like simple control
of sensors and different things from the
raspberry pi and i want to directly do
that using a Java library rather than
going to arduino and offloading the work
but this is the full kit of everything
you need it's basically you know the
make block starter robot kit plus a
Raspberry Pi there who no shield and the
RP 600 I think these come with the
starter kit as well the line follower
and the motor driver okay and then this
is the code for getting the GPIO pins
with the PI 4 J library so I'm using the
PI 4 J library for this and the next
slide is the line follower algorithm but
let's let's see if we can't actually get
in this guy and and do something
ah
we actually have access to the guy okay
so we're going to we're going to SSH
into him okay so now we're now logged
into the the robot can you guys see the
terminal is it big enough okay let me I
know you said it's big enough let's make
it even bigger so you see I have a
version of Java 9 - all down here and
let's just prove that we're actually
doing yeah so it's an early access Java
9 release and we can run J shell as well
so I promised I promise we do some J
shelling so you know I mean doing J
shell from the command line on something
without any interesting libraries is not
all that great but we can we can do
basic stuff like we could do hello
devoxx Ian's
and you know normally if you if you did
this from like a Java program you'd have
to like write the whole public static
void main class and you'd have to have
imports and you'd have to do the whole
jigum all but J shell kind of lets you
just randomly type things and you can
even do you know simple control loops
and stuff
raspberry PI's can count to I so we
should get a bunch of yeah okay so
raspberry pilots can count to 99
apparently so you know you can do simple
stuff on it but yeah that's that's about
all we're going to do is that that
wasn't the right command I think it's a
slash exit yeah how can there we go and
there's there's also help commands in
there do basic steps you can import
classes and you can you know have
variables and do all the usual stuff
here you're used to doing okay but you
know when you get tired of playing
around that just just open a real IDE
and then get get your job done so
NetBeans has a really convenient
integration with the Raspberry Pi where
you can actually set it up as a remote
debugger and that way you can do like
debugging performance profiling and
remote execution on the Raspberry Pi
I think intelligent added to support as
well or there's a plugin for ontology
which does exactly the same thing I've
not played with the Eclipse support now
as the Eclipse guys around this
conference I guess I should have
technically brought a great Eclipse down
mount but maybe it'll forgive me
apologize if this is slightly small
because I don't have a lot of control on
fonts when we get to code I'll adjust
the fonts but the general editor fonts
are a little bit tiny but you can you
can add a new platform and if you choose
remote Edition then you can actually say
you know DevOps Java 9 line PI local put
in your username and your password and
then you have to specify the remote JRE
path which which is something home hi
home pie JDK 9 maybe not work on them
but once you get it set up properly then
you can actually set it up as a remote
debugging thing and use that from inside
of all your applications so let's let's
give that a try so I have this line
runner code okay so we can we can
definitely we can definitely make that
bigger so on this this code is it's
pretty straightforward so it's like the
same code I had on the board for getting
the pins where the pins yeah so this
provisions a few pins using the PI 4j
library and then it creates pulse width
modulation for the two motors the way
pulse width modulation works is like if
you turn on a motor it goes at full
speed and so the like the standard way
to control motor speed is you you give
it pulses of electricity so which will
slow it down and the nice thing about
pulse width modulation is it it lowers
the speed but it also lowers the power
requirements so you're actually using
less power to control the um it did you
guys have any tape leftover at all how
about the black one any black left now I
just need a little little extra I can
use the white I was thinking that last
time I ran this demo my battery fell off
and this would prevent the battery from
falling off which I think would be nice
if the battery didn't come off in the
middle of our trial run
so this is this is a random USB battery
so originally the design was that it was
back powered off of the I have a bunch
of double-a batteries which are driving
the motors and that works great for a
while and then if the motors get stuck
it the draw of the motors increases and
then the voltage to the Raspberry Pi
drops and you reboot so I'm you know I
you could probably design a protection
circuit or a capacitor or something
which would allow it to live through the
the voltage surges and actually like
keep going but I do SP battery networks
so that was my that was my hack I'm
really I'm really like like more of a
hardware a software guy who dabbled in
hardware rather than the opposite a
hardware guy who is pretending they can
write software I assume you guys are
mostly in the same category as well if
you're here at a software conference
ok so anyway you know pulse width
modulation is fun you can set the speed
the other the other funky thing the
actually the line follower parts super
easy because it actually the line
follower has two light sensors it uses
an ultra which Mottola ultraviolet light
or something it bounces that off the
grounds and then has a sensor which
picks up the reflection and tells you
whether it's black or white but it has
two of these and it's just a simple
on/off so you get a pin back for like
highest black and low as white or vice
versa and then the algorithm is really
simple if if there are both white then
you're lost because we're in the floor
somewhere we don't have a line to follow
so the the default is just keep going
with the last direction you had if the
left is black
and the right is black then you're on
the line you want to go straight if the
left is black and the right is white
then you're slipping off to the right
and you want to make a left turn and
vice versa so that's how it follows and
you'll you'll see that's when it's
running sometimes it gets a little jerky
because he's straddling the lining like
going left right left right and
constantly going off both edges
the other interesting thing to point
down the code while we have it open is
the the front sensor the the distance
sensor was the trickiest one to get
working and the reason for that it's an
ultrasonic sensor but it's really
designed to be an analog sensor and so
the way it the way it sends back the
distance is in microseconds so it has a
like a multiple number of microseconds
for how far away the object is with a
higher number for greater distances and
a lower number for shorter distances and
so like like small dedicated devices
like Arduino which are single threaded
and they just go and constantly check
state this is great they listen to the
sensor they check how many microseconds
it is and then you get extremely
accurate reliable repeatable results
when you're writing this on a Raspberry
Pi with a pre-emptive multitasking
operating system like Linux unhappy
because it has random pauses and then
you stack Java on top of it which has a
garbage collector and all this extra
levels of abstraction and it's even less
happy so what I did for this is I
switched over the the regular PI for J
library is too slow for this so what I
had to do is I had to go down to their
low-level protocol which is basically a
thin veneer it's a thin J&amp;amp;I wrapper on
top of the on top of the wiring PI
library which is a C library and so just
using those direct calls via J and I
it's actually fast enough to do
microsecond timings to a point it the
sensor works to about a foot and if it
gets shorter than that the timings are
too short and then it misses but it
mostly works for the purpose because you
know once you're a foot away from
somebody you should this time to stop
so let's give this a try so I'm going to
I'm going to randomly run this and hope
hope it just starts working and then
we'll we'll test the track okay
well that that's half working okay there
we go loose cable uh-huh okay so where
should I start them anywhere all right
let's just go this way oh and feel free
to stand up and walk around okay so once
these once you started it doesn't
actually matter if he stays connected to
Wi-Fi because he's autonomous now and
hopefully he's he's going to make it
around okay it's pretty good you see
kind of like jerks around a little bit
but he eventually eventually makes it so
so what's what are the special features
of this track from our designers now see
that's that's actually really important
so it's it's a minor point but on the
corners it's it's actually it's hard to
get the black perfectly lined up and if
there's not enough white then he just
goes off because he'll probably see
those Browns as black his Maya okay so
that's the big challenge see if you can
make it over the hill
well there's enough clearance
he might just blast his way through it
we'll see
and actually we we need um we need
somebody to be the stops the goal to see
if he'll stop as well some point oh it
was it was a good try yeah alright there
we go alright so somebody has to stand
in the track and see if they'll stop for
you
well I wouldn't leave something that
small he might not
oh alright it's off alright so big round
of applause for our track designers yeah
okay so that's that's a good question
actually I was thinking about doing this
too to have it like shuttle so the I
have another version of it which has a
grabber and so he can grab a ball and
then he can run with the ball and he can
deposit it somewhere so actually I was I
was thinking about doing patterns with
the black and white lines so if he saw a
certain pattern it would open or close
the gripper yeah yeah yeah so you could
have you could have like different
because I mean with it if it doesn't see
a turn if it just sees like on/off you
could use that as kind of a pat like a
code to send it to given instructions I
would keep going straight while it's
reading the code and then when it gets
the code you could have it stopped or
you give it two different instructions
so I think you could actually design
little codes into the track at different
points to have cool behavior
yeah yeah but I mean I I think it's we
I'm not actually sure how often it's
sampling but I think it's pretty often
like it shakes around a lot so you could
probably within like a two centimeters
give it give it a code with at least you
know 16 bits or something yeah
yeah so that I'm actually remotely
hooked up to the Raspberry Pi in this
case so the Raspberry Pi has a Wi-Fi
dongle on it and while I was talking I
hooked up a small Wi-Fi router to my
computer and the Raspberry Pi knows to
hook up to that Wi-Fi network you could
also hook up at Ethernet cable the
raspberry PI's have Ethernet on them or
you could you could just copy the
software to the SD card and then run it
autonomously on the SD card yeah yeah
actually that's all NetBeans is doing is
it copies the jar over and then it runs
the Java command to execute the jar file
what we using 'yes' SCP to copy and it
uses s well there's an SSH execute the
command thing but it uses that to run
the command remotely yeah so the
standard way if you didn't want to use a
specific IDE feature would just be to
copy the jar file over using your
favorite SFTP client and then you could
login with terminal and run it and
actually assuming we're still connected
to it you can actually see the commands
here so you see here it here it actually
is a command it's running so it changes
directly does a sudo runs Java and then
here is the
puts up with well that's where it's
making the directory but if we look at
the pie itself there's a NetBeans folder
it creates here and this is the line
runner folder and here's the jar file
which it's running the line rate RHR
yeah yeah absolutely
what did I what the only thing installed
on the pie in this case is I want to run
Java nine so here's the Java nine the
JDK nine folder which it's reusing by
default the Raspberry Pi has Java 8
installed on it so if you I are in Java
8 you can take a plain Raspberry Pi with
nothing special just the standard
raspbian installation and you can
remotely execute using Java 8 so you
don't need anything special installed
all right cool
well thank you guys for coming to the
presentation you can find more
information about using raspberry pi and
Java in the book which I wrote for
mcgraw-hill together with Jim Weaver
called programming raspberry pi with
Java programming the Internet of Things
that has I think this exact project it
has a 3d printed gaming console which
also runs the Raspberry Pi and runs half
NES which is a java-based NES emulator a
magic hat which uses an RFID card reader
so it's another fun project and you can
actually you can make your own RFID
cards or you can actually buy them
there's a bunch of companies which do
poker tables automated poker tables and
they sell RFID chip cards with almost
invisible RFID tags
and it also has a couple versions with a
coffee demo which I showed you guys and
if you have any other questions or you
want to just chat feel free to hang out
we have a few minutes before the next
session I think about five minutes or so
so thank you guys very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
