I'm Raphael Eric most people call me
devil and what I'm going to talk about
is microservices and actually it's it's
a bit more ahead of the curve in the
term set so micro-services was hype and
now it's more like then we had this
disillusionment face and now this talk
is about how how micro-services can go
wrong and what you can do about it well
at least one aspect of that but let's
start with the blue background so
remember the model it's who remembers
the Mona Lisa right all of us remember
the monolith and those were great days
because whatever we did once it was in
production it wasn't a problem anymore
it was an ops problem so we could just
throw things over the wall and everyone
was happy and then there was this guy
called jazz bassist who said you built
it he owned it and then everything just
turned well quite unpleasant to be
honest at least for us developers so we
came up with the idea of microservices
because if we have micro-services then
we don't have to deal with deploying the
entire application which is deploy that
more micro service and if you think
about it what were monoliths I have a
pretty good metaphor for that yeah now
once you take a monolith and break it up
into micro services you know what it
turns to yeah little Python but I'm not
being completely fair here because the
owners picture is like this you're your
own service in the middle is a polished
gem it's always perfect it's always
others people's services that fail right
so that's that's the world that we are
living in it's always other scene crap
that fails so what can we do about it
well so my wife is doing martial arts
and one of the things they teach people
at martial arts classes is how to fall
gracefully how to fall in a way that you
don't break your arm okay and this is
really important because if you if you
are in a dojo
then people are going to throw you
around and it's gonna hurt and if you
don't fall correctly you might break
your neck so it's pretty important to
learn how to fall well so that's what I
want to talk teach you now how to fall
gracefully when other services are not
as nice as your own so I'm gonna talk
about so this talk is going to be in
three parts the first part is the
journey how we realize that we have to
do something about this issue then I'm
gonna talk about the Enlightenment when
we realize how can deal with these
problems and eventually if we have time
our try I will write like I would like
to dig a little deeper so let's start
with the journey let's imagine we have a
car rental company and we have a very
simple application there is one process
one database and the process is making
queries to the database that's the
simplest application you can imagine
right this is essentially a tiny'mon on
it and what happens is when we want to
reserve a car we check if the car is
available then we reserve the car and
assign it to a customer these are the
three steps that we are going to do
these are three separate queries now
this sounds good but at some point the
boss comes to us and says hey the cars
have some cars have been reserved but no
one picked it up
so we scratch our heads and wonder what
might have happened and then we look
into the logs and we see that yes the
application correctly checked that the
car is available yes it correctly
reserved the car and then when the
assignment should have happened
something went wrong network was down
and we couldn't assign the car so
essentially we had a reserved car with
no one to pick it up so this is bad how
can we fix that any ideas how will you
fix that with a SQL you would use
transactions right you start the
transaction you do your thing and then
come into transaction and that makes
sure that the whole transaction is
atomic either everything happen or
nothing that's that's the cool way to do
it okay
but now something happens discover
intercompany by its another bunch of
other companies and it becomes a travel
agency and they have like three
different systems and their systems has
to talk to each other they offer this
kind of travel packages that have a car
in it Hotel a plane tickets and even
museum tickets so essentially you have
to organize four different services with
four different databases and you have to
deal with that how do you do that well
it's not as easy anymore because it's
not one service not one database so and
that's that's just one problem the other
problem is that the transactions that we
are doing even if it was just one
application that when you do a
transaction it looks things in the
database and yes that can have an impact
and performance if you have like 20 or
30 queries that run in sequence and
maybe what some of them are long queries
then doing a transaction is is going to
put a performance impact on your
application and also
if it's not even the same application
like in our example then the transaction
is not even possible because you cannot
say my sequel to law you can ask my
secret to lock rows in a postscript at
PostgreSQL or or even a MongoDB mahmud
even doesn't even have transactions so
what you what you do about that because
we have several databases and multiple
services yeah so one idea the worse idea
that you can come up with is
fire-and-forget you just make the
queries if some of them fail you don't
do anything about it
don't do that because you will have
inconsistencies in your database and you
end up with the same situation that we
talked about where the car is reserved
not assigned okay what's the next idea
mm maybe we can do manual failure
require recovery so what we you would do
there is you create logs and whenever
there is a failure and you couldn't
couldn't complete an operation then you
make a log and then you create pager
duty alerts that alerts you in the
middle of the night that something is
wrong
now that works for a while but you will
be pretty angry and sometimes when you
have a lot of failures and you can get
your job done because you have to
manually fix the database all the time
and after a while you will be pretty
sleepy because waking up at night to fix
the database is not really fun so what's
the next step well maybe we can automate
that recovery so we don't have to wake
up anymore but we can say okay if if
there was a failure then this other
script runs and it's type tries to fix
things the way we would do it manually
that's somewhat better but what kind of
automated recoveries can we can we think
of my first idea and my team's first
sight it was brute force
so whenever a query failed just repeat
it a bunch of times like five times and
hopefully it will succeed at least once
so there are a number of problems with
that so one thing is that even though
you retried a few times it may may not
be successful but the even what universe
is that you might end up create sending
a lot of queries to the database and
after a while the DB just falls apart
under you and any it you have like this
runaway thing where the more queries you
are sending to the database the the
worse shape it is in and and then you
just overload the database much faster
than you would otherwise so okay that's
that's not good either okay next idea
mmm distributed transactions okay so at
this point we went on the internet and
try to find what what other people did
and we found out about distributed
transactions and that way transactions
work usually is the two-phase commit two
phase commit means that you check every
query if it could run but you don't
commit them basically you open a
transaction in every database you do
your stuff and whenever all of the
queries are successful then you commit
all of the databases one after the other
can you see the problem with that
approach exactly the commenting part may
fail so yeah
that doesn't work either so and and we
haven't even mentioned scalability
issues because if one of the databases
has a long-running query then we keep
transactions open in several databases
on via that one database finishes and
also there is a single point of failure
because whenever our process dies before
the commit or halfway through the
commits then we have again an
inconsistent state so these are the
things that we tried and
frankly none of those worked really well
so then we had the Enlightenment what
can we do what was there the correct way
of doing it and the interesting part is
that we came up with these solutions a
solution ourselves and then after that I
went to conference and heard someone
talk about it so it turns out that
there's nothing new Under the Sun and
and the solution that I'm going to tell
you about is actually a really old
solution people came up with it in the
60s and 70s when they had large and slow
disks and the solution actually works
nowadays with Microsoft's is as well so
the idea is what if we don't stick to
acid do you know what acid is okay can
you shout out the words that belong to
the letters a is atomic exactly see
consistency I isolation or integrity
some people say it's integrity but it's
it's isolation and E is durability
exactly so one of those things will go
and my challenge for you while you're
listening to this talk try to find out
which one is gone okay so what's the
solution the solution is called the saga
patent and the original purpose is not
to make sure that your microservices
were together night nicely the original
purpose was to break up long reigning
long-running transactions so their
problem in the in the old days was that
the queries ran slowly so whenever they
had like a bunch of queries in sequence
then having all that lock locks live
while the whole transaction runs was too
expensive it it had a performance impact
so the idea is I want to break up my
transactions into smaller pieces and
then the nice thing about this approach
is that by the way it also saw CEO Mike
services issue but that's completely
coincidental people didn't design it for
micro services but it works really well
so why not use it so what's the
definition of zaga and actually I have
the definition here zaga is a sequence
of independent actions with idempotent
compensating actions so I like these
definitions that usually professors give
at the university because no one
understands them so let's just break
these things thing down so that we
understand it better so what's the
sequence of actions well an action is
that I reserved the car for example and
I have a sequence of these actions
that's easy
what is a compensating action
compensating action would be something
that I do and if I do that then I get
back to the to a state that is
equivalent to the state that I would
have gotten if the original action
wasn't done so for example I reserved
the car and then I cancel the
reservation that's a compensation thing
action the cancellation of the
reservation the important part is that
you want to make sure that it looks like
this never happened and the difference
from just reverting that action is
obvious when when we talk when imagine
if you are incrementing a number okay so
you are incrementing an integer one by
one so I do the incrementation and then
some other processes do something else
with that number and then I revert I do
the canceling action if my canceling
action is to write the original value
into the database that's not a
compensating action because all of the
things that happened in between are also
canceled
I just want to cancer that
incrementation so instead of just
rewriting the original value I will just
decrement the value does it make sense
okay so so that's that's really
important and what does idempotent mean
so idempotent means that if I do it
twice it will have the same effect as if
I did it once incrementing an integer
not unimportant for example because if
I'd instrument it twice then it will be
two times bigger with two right so
what's the definition of idempotence
an operation is idempotent when applying
it multiple times is equal equivalent to
applying it a single time it's again
that's just like this professor kind of
definition and I you used to have a
really good example for this what's
important what's not and when I did the
talking Hungary everyone was laughing
and then I did the talk in Germany and
people walked up to me that and said
that this was offensive so I'm not going
to say that example but yeah instead of
I came up with another example which is
not as funny but I think imagine that
you have a cup and someone tells you
pour a cup of orange juice into the cup
then you pour it and you're done and
then they tell you to pour again then
you pour again and it overflows
so pouring the orange juice is not that
important makes sense right but if you
be someone walks up to you with a cup of
orange juice and tells you to drink it
and you drink it then it comes empty and
if they tell you to drink it again
nothing happens you just have one cup of
orange juice in your stomach okay so
that's idempotent that's the that's the
difference between being idempotent and
not being item button
it's idempotent if if you do it twice
you have the same result so let's look
at the saga pattern in action first I'm
going to show you the happy path in hell
passes like this so here is our travel
agency example this other guy is our
service and he walks up to this lovely
lady and tells her that he wants to
reserve a car and the lady says alright
let's reserve the car then he walks to
the hotel guy
the room they say okay and then we walk
to the plane or the air sorry to the
other company and ask for a plane to get
in it's okay so for now that looks much
like brute force like right we just do
all of the queries orbs actions and we
just go through it but what happens when
we have a failure and that's the
interesting part about is that desire
button first we reserved a car and we
and the lady says okay it's reserved and
then we walk to the hotel guy and they
say huh we are fool we cannot visits
right so so now we have a problem we
have a car reserved but we don't have
hotel so we walk back to the lady and
say that we want to cancel the car and
if we were lucky then the lady would say
okay the car is cancelled but in this
case she fell asleep so what do we do
well we ask again and the lady wakes up
and says what and then we repeat again
and then she says okay so this is why we
need idempotence because when we do the
cancellation we might end up in this
situation where it's not successful so
we want to be able to repeat it as many
times that we need to okay and then if
we say again because we are angry and
and we didn't hear her say okay then she
can just say it's already don't worry
okay so what is this I guarantee the
Zagg guarantee is that either everything
is successful by the end of the saga or
the successful events are compensated
for or we are in the process of
executing the events now I'm going to
ask you what was it that we lost from
acid
exactly we traded off atomicity for
availability that's the that's the main
concept here so now we know how the saga
works let's dig a little deeper and
let's look at how to implement a saga
pattern first we will need a saga
execution coordinator which I'm gonna
call it a sack from now and the sack is
going to do a bunch of things but this
is the part of the code that is
responsible for making sure that the
saga is either completed or it's in the
process of being completed and for the
sack we also need as a Galaga the saga
log is going to be persisted and we are
going to go through the saga log when we
need to reserve revert action so just as
an example we have our travel agency
there and then we have the hotel car in
the plane service and then what we do is
first we are going to wait yeah that's
not funny
so first what we are going to do is we
are going to begin a saga and we will
write into the saga love the big we
began the saga that's the first log item
then we begin reserving the hotel we do
our transaction with the hotel service
when it's sick successfully returned
then we write into the SAG log and hotel
begin car
we do our thing with the car service and
so on and so on until everything is
resolved and we are happy so that's the
happy path what happens if there is a
failure then what we will do is we begin
the saga begin hotel and hotel that was
successful then we begin car and when
the car service returns an error then
what we are going to do is we are going
to write a board saga into the saga log
and if there is a temple saga in a saga
log the only thing you are allowed to do
from that point on is revert everything
before it so after the saga is aborted
we never ever try to complete it we just
try to do everything in
Wednesday for everything that we did
before and in this case what we do is we
begin a new car you should try to go
talk to the car service and if it's not
successful we try it a bunch of times
exponential back-off is a good idea here
so if the car service doesn't respawn
then try it try it again in a few
seconds and then again in twice as many
time and then twice as many times so
that you don't overload the car service
and then once the cancelation is done
then it will just undo the hotel as well
so that's that's the that's the
compensating part of the saga so when do
we need to undo everything so we read
the dialogue and if we see a boards
again the log that's a sure sign that we
have to cancel everything right if there
is an abort Shaka we have to cancel it
but that's not the only case also if
there is a big in sub transaction so for
example big in hotel and that's the last
line in our saga log then that means
that we failed at least if someone else
has to pick up the log so the way this
works is your process is doing the
desire and then it fails at some point
for example the process crashes and the
last thing it wrote was begin hotel then
we don't know if the hotel is reserved
or not so what we are going to do is say
we assume that it wasn't successful and
then we start compensating for
everything okay yeah and this is why
idempotence is really important because
what we are going to do is we are going
to try and try and try and do we are
successful with that compensation now
there is another version of this pattern
called forward recovery and the reason
for that we need that other pattern is
because sometimes some actions cannot be
cancelled for example
I work at a company that's sending
emails that used to be our core business
now we do a lot of other things but it's
still an important part of our product
and when you do when you send out an
email you cannot cancel that right once
it's sent out its sent out so you need
some other solution and the other
solution is referred to our recovery so
you have your ziege you do everything
first that you can undo and once you get
to the part that cannot be undone but
can be implemented in them idempotency
you will start doing that so in this
case sending name email is going to be
your last step and if that fails then we
will just go back and try to send it
again now you might catch a bit of a
problem there because maybe we just
didn't realize that the sending thing
was successful but the trick is that
since we are making this a really small
operation really quick and small
operation we can minimize the
probability of sending the linea twice
it's never going to be 0 but it's going
to be as small as possible so that's
forward recovery and basically the idea
is to predict periodically
retry with an exponent strip back off
yeah I already talked talking about that
so now the only thing that we have to
talk about is how we can achieve at the
idempotency because it's not always
trivial right there are some actions
where it's natural for example deleting
an item or drinking the orange juice
from the cup that's ID important by its
nature once you have deleted something
if you try to delete it again with the
same ID it's not there so you are just
going to say I didn't find that item and
then you know that it's still it is so
sometimes it's natural that's that's a
quick win and in many cases that's true
but in some cases some actions might
need to be made in them idempotent so
it's not by its nature
for example sending an email if you send
an email the person is going to get two
emails and probably are going to smoke
your spam and that's not good so we want
to make sure that we don't send that
email twice right how do we do that well
for each action that needs to be
idempotent and it's not by default we
are going to generate a unique ID and
this unique ID will be what makes sure
that we don't do that thing twice and we
have a nice diagram here so what we are
going to do is we have this request
that's coming in and what we will do so
notice that the actions that we are
trying to make idempotent are always
within one service so now we can use a
transaction when we have multiple
services we couldn't use a transaction
but here we can use a transaction and
what we are going to do is we are going
to start the transaction insert the
instep ignore by unique key so we have a
separate table that just has one line
for each completed action okay and what
we do is we are going to insert into
that table and we are going to use that
unique ID as a key and then if we have
success well we have three options here
one option is that we get any key
violation which is good because it means
that we already completed the action and
we can just stop that's that's a that's
a great thing the other option is that
we actually did insert the unique key
successfully and in that case we are
going to perform the action and it's if
that successful then we come into
transaction and we are good again okay
so what happens here is that we had two
queries one just made sure that this is
the unique operation and the other one
was the operation that we wanted to do
and then also if we if the unique key
insertion wasn't successful or or the
perfect perform the action wasn't as
successful then we just draw back the
transaction and respond with a failure
to the other service
and that way we essentially made sure
that that query just ran once does it
make sense okay
so wow I've been quick so conclusion
what do you need to think about okay
first before I say I have my closing
words one really important thing that
was pointed out to me by someone at the
previous conference is that if you need
the saga button
you actually have either you have a
design problem with your Microsoft
architecture because your service is
doing too many things or that service is
really like a core item in your
architecture so in our case where this
issue came up it was workflow engine so
what you could do you could draw up
actions one after the other and then it
would be executed for you and because
this one service was essentially sending
messages to all other services we had
really long-running sequences of these
actions and that's a well it situation
for for this kind of zaga pattern but
context matters and in many cases in
probably most of you will never need
this or at least not very frequent
frequently but when you need it then
it's really useful and if you have like
something that's if you are building a
service that talks to many other
services this is something you should
think about but again context matters
and you shouldn't just run around just
run home and implement the saga button
just because you heard about it you
really need had to have a business case
behind it okay so that that was a caveat
so what's great about the saga pattern
is that it helps you think about the
arrow keys so whenever you have a
culture in your company that we are
thinking of of these kind of issues we
have to
make everything item potent then it
makes you think about the error case and
so when this whole thing we found this
solution after that for like a year and
every demo that we had we were talking
about this and how we solve these kind
of issues and by the time we finished
making everything got important that had
to be an important I was the idempotence
guide the company so whenever someone
has this kind of issue they always run
to me but yeah so so the thing is that
where I want to get to here is that in
your company there is already culture
that whenever you have a narrow case you
have to think about how you can handle
that error case what you should always
do whatever whatever kind of service you
build is think of compensating actions
always have some way to undo things and
one of the great yeah and also also
think about idempotency of actions can I
make this action idempotent for for
other people who might be using my
service and the really nice thing that I
realized was that github if you look at
the github API they actually have a
unique ID field for some of directions
so you can send in a unique ID and they
make sure that the that action is going
to be idempotent for you so it turns out
that people that github already knew
about this and they were thinking of
this and what I want to get want you to
think about is this whenever you build a
service and you whenever you build an
API that other companies might be using
always think of how you can how they can
undo your operations and and if it's
important to that something happens once
then make sure that you accept an ID
that they can send in and and you make
sure that the operations happens only
once with their ID and basically that's
all I wanted to say with
more thing is that I have yeah two
things shameless self-promotion I have a
workshop called lean poker it's great if
you want to learn how to do continuous
deployment and DevOps really well look
it up and I also have a youtube channel
called called morning commute where I
discuss software topics with other
developers in a car like an carpool
karaoke but ya know Carl Carl King we
are just talking so you can look that up
and that's what I wanted to say thank
you so much are there any questions yeah
yeah it works so the question was Kenny
can you do the operations in in in a
synchronously so you don't want to wait
for each actions to action to complete
before starting all of them and that's
actually a possibility the reason we
didn't do that is because our
application was in PHP and doing a
synchronous course in PHP so we didn't
do that but but if you work with nodejs
then it's perfectly a possibility and
you can wait for all the actions to
complete that's that's something you can
do one thing that you have to keep in
mind though is that if you have a
forward recovery part then you have to
first complete all of the actions that
are compensated and only when those are
done and all of them successful then you
start the forward recovery part because
if you send the email it sent any other
questions yeah
yeah so one piece of advice before you
implement yours your own sack try to
look for an open source implementation
online because it's it's not that
difficult to implement it it's like 200
lines of code but if someone else wrote
it why not use that otherwise I didn't
view singleton III I personally think
that singleton is an ant pattern so so
we simply made sure otherwise that we
have a single sack for each process the
thing that you have to think about it is
if you have a cycle of being written you
want to make sure that if another
process finds that zaga log then it
doesn't start working on it right that's
that's the tricky part and the way we
solved that was that each saga log had a
line that contained the process ID that
last worked on that saga and then what
we did was that we had a separate
process that we'll look through all of
the opens AGA's and see if the
corresponding process IDs are still
running and if one of the process IDs
wasn't running then it would start
execution coordinator for that
particular saga but you have to make
sure that the process that was handling
that dialogue has actually died before
you start another one that's that's a
really good point but there are several
other ways to do it I think in Java you
would probably create a log file and
lock it and then when the process dies I
have a person size in latitudes of the
lock and then you could do that that's
also a possibility another question yeah
that's the point that you don't have to
because the okay let me show you so the
whole thing that we have here that this
is something I try to point out but
maybe it wasn't completely obvious but
this thing is in one service you don't
have multiple databases here because the
whole point of the Zagat button is if
you have a long transaction with
multiple services you are breaking it up
into smaller pieces
and each of these pieces is going to
affect just one service and since it is
only affecting just one service then
when you want to make it idempotent then
you are just dealing with one service
make sense okay and what else one in the
taste thank you for attention</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
