joined by NetBeans guy young feel anger
thank you very much for joining us thank
you for having me and obviously the big
news last from last week is NetBeans 8.1
is here it's / right can you give us an
insider's guide to this please well what
it means a third one is all about
primarily is support for nodejs so a lot
of people are doing JavaScript on the
back end as well as on the front end and
need tools for that and in the same way
that NetBeans has been supporting Java
for many years into end from creating to
developing it further to debugging
profiling all those different kinds of
tools we providing the same kind of
support for energy is so you can create
applications and there are templates for
that and you can run your noches
applications you can debug your no GIS
applications and you can also hook them
up to the Express joyous framework on
the front end which is typically what
people use when they're doing energized
development if they're doing front-end
development with that but in addition to
those nodejs features there's a whole
bunch of other JavaScript related
features that have been added because
there's a lot of JavaScript development
going on but on top of those JavaScript
features is also a whole bunch of new
features for Java developers and
primarily completely redesigned profiler
for java and plus a whole bunch of
enhancements to the editor for for java
developers again but also enhancements
for PHP for c++ and also for the first
time if you download the html5 or the
PHP distribution of NetBeans you
automatically get the JRE with it so you
don't have to install that separately
and all of this is free and open source
as always so that's that's basically
what Nick means edit one is about that's
a pretty significant thing for netbeans
isn't given its long long history with
Java right with that its influence based
on demand from developers to get that
definitely definitely native java
developers or are you seeing kind of new
ways of developing it NetBeans the thing
here we want this ID yeah yeah it's I
think it's both on the one hand I'm Java
developers in general are looking at a
JavaScript and we're providing tools for
at and by the way and there's the new
Oracle javascript extension toolkit and
there's a plugin for that for netbeans
as well so that's a new JavaScript
framework that was announced at javaone
Oracle's own JavaScript framework with
plans to be open source next year and
their support for that and it means
right now already so yes on the one hand
it this these JavaScript features come
from Java developers asking hey you know
we want to get into the JavaScript space
how does netbeans support that and on
the other hand there's a whole new wave
of people who are not using java at all
and who you need tools for that and
we're providing those possibilities to
like an evolution for oracle or mace
that you are looking into that job right
space or do you feel that it's kind of
more augmenting that Java Oh following
well I think every 100 organizations are
looking at javascript at the moment
including Oracle that's yo it done a lot
of work they just invested in it right
yes found it right right exactly so I
mean everyone is interested in this
space and I think it's primarily because
the browser is on all the different
devices that are out there so everyone
wants to have apps that run on mobile
devices and on tablets and whatnot and
the browser is on those on all those
devices and javascript is a language of
the browser so everyone has has an
interest in write once run everywhere
yeah yeah everyone does yeah and it's
the browser that is actually doing it so
it's it's interesting yeah thank you I
us obviously big surprises in this
release for people who maybe not so
don't always keep up with a
redevelopment in netbeans what's coming
up in beat down the road are you allowed
to sell for your wife sure well the next
the next big release is going to be
NetBeans 9 which will be released
together with java 9 so then they'll be
support for for jigsaw and modularity
and any changes that are coming in the
Java 9 release we were providing support
for our NetBeans is the official ID for
the Java platform so when java 9 is
released we also have NetBeans with it
so can we expect any early releases for
that in the next few months so there's
already some some early builds after the
available people playing with that so
yeah continually as we get closer to
that we will have will have built
available for that and have the feedback
being for that
people enjoying getting stuck into that
modularity yes well it's probably what
everyone's going for it yeah it's it's
on the one hand i mean it's it's really
a small group of people who are getting
their hands dirty with that stuff right
now but the feedbacks been good and it's
it's you know it's not thousands of
people who are who are getting started
with java nine but it's a small segment
of people and they're definitely finding
their beers useful for that I think
we're really worried with net java 9
that there's gonna be issues with
people's code things breaking things
right being backward compatible right
would you say that's a huge kind of
thing that people should be looking out
for or do you think that's more just a
small again a small subset of users i I
don't know i mean it will have to wait
and see how people are going to be using
this on the one hand of course GX 0
means modularity for the JDK but there's
also the part where your applications
themselves will be well have modularity
features as a possibility I wonder to
what extent amid but you see but I
wanted to what extent existing
applications are going to be rewritten
to be modular or whether gonna be
terraforming it first yeah or whether it
could it would be you know people when
they start from scratch in a new project
that they would use the modular features
that that jigsaw provides we'll see how
people will start using it hey well look
forward to seeing how that work folks
hopefully testing about that with you
next year absolutely thank you that's
for joining it thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
