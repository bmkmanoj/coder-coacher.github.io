welcome welcome to a new world where the
quantum computers are coming okay so my
name's Alistair Collinson I work for
Cenacle technologies and blah blah blah
you're not really interested in that
stuff are you the main thing you have to
know about me is really I'm a nerd in
fact I'm so much of a dirt that my
colleagues call me around they're you
know our computer scientists and
mathematicians and physicists now
personally I'm not a physicist not at
all last physics class I took is about a
decade ago and yet I'm here today to
talk about quantum computers and that
sounds like physics right well thing is
yes it does have to do with physics the
time is coming well you don't have to be
a physicist anymore to work with quantum
computers being a nerd is totally
sufficient and now we're at a conference
here where there's loads of interesting
talks and yet you guys are sitting here
in a talk about something you'll
probably not need for at least the next
couple of years so I think the chances
are pretty good that you two are nerds
which is great okay so quantum computers
let's get started with easy part
computers everyone knows what a computer
is right for example something like this
here admittedly this is rather old this
is a replica of the Souza's 8-3 which
someone could argue was the first
computer ever it was certainly the first
electronic programmable and binary
computer binary being really important
here when we talk about binary we
normally imagine zeros and ones and yeah
zeros and ones are binary but binary is
not zeros and ones binary just means we
have two distinct States our computers
aren't filled with zeros and ones
they're distinct States it is
we care they could be I don't know a
green circle and a red triangle as long
as they're distinct that's fine now
most computers nowadays work with
transistors though smaller than these
ones here and the way a transistor works
is basically depending on its inputs it
either lets a current go through or not
two distinct States and that's fine and
that works really really well for loads
and loads of problems but not all
problems so what does it not work well
for well let's look at something we're
all familiar with at least I hope with
nodes in the room can't be too sure
nature and for example let's say we want
to distinguish where in this image we
have forests and where we don't so let's
have a closer look this part here that's
clearly forest right and it's part here
that's clearly not forest but what about
this area when there clearly are some
trees there right yet most of it is
grass so we have to decide we have to
draw a line somewhere and say okay so
many trees per I don't know square
kilometer makes it a forest and anything
below that isn't that's an arbitrary
line we're drawing here we are
artificially making this binary and it
works well for some cases but as soon as
you get loads and loads of these
situations where you have to define
lines your the value of your computation
degrades so how can we solve this
obviously I'm going to say quantum
computers because this is talk about
quantum computers okay part two of the
equation of course is the quantum part I
already mentioned physics particularly
quantum physics is relevant here so
quick
crash course in quantum physics quantum
physics was first described by two guys
in the 1920s namely Niels Bohr here and
Verna Heisenberg they work together in
Copenhagen and described both the
general rules of quantum physics and
what came to be known as the Copenhagen
interpretation of quantum physics
explaining how it works is far too
complicated to get into in this kind of
session so I'll give an example of how
it works say we have an atom we don't
actually care about the whole atom what
we care about is the nucleus and let's
just assume that this atom we have is
radioactive which means at some point it
will decay a small particle will leave
the nucleus in this case that was it
would be an alpha particle and what's
what remains is smaller now if you wait
for a while you had it in its original
state you wait for a while there are two
states you could imagine it to be in
when you check either nothing has
changed at all or it's decayed right
through possibilities according to the
Copenhagen interpretation of quantum
mechanics you can have both at the same
time that is until you measure and at
that point when you measure it it
decides one to be one or the other now
don't get me wrong measurement in this
case I'm I'm using a human term for it
it's not that human has to look
consciousness has nothing to do with
this this part of physics it's just an
easy way to explain its measurements can
also be anything any process requiring
it to be in one state so it's still
weird and we're not the first people to
think this is weird
one of the first who was
he thought it was weird and he had good
reasoning was this guy here Schrodinger
so Schrodinger came up with a thought
experiments which was supposed to
ridicule not quantum mechanics which he
thought was correct but the
interpretation that Bohr and Heisenberg
had proliferated and the experiment as
you may have heard of is Schrodinger's
cat so assuming you have a cat and you
put it in a box now in this box there
are some other things so there's some
kind of radioactive matter this is
pretty much just many many of the atoms
we saw previously and you selected the
specific matter you put in there so that
after one hour has passed the chance
that any of it has decayed is 50/50
right okay we have our matter what else
do we have we have a flask of gaseous
cyanide cyanide of course is rather
unpleasant so it's better to keep it in
that flask and right now it's safe but
there's one final thing in that box and
that's this weird contraption a Geiger
counter which with a hammer attached so
if the radioactive isotope should decay
what will happen dead cat okay so we
discussed this with the atom earlier if
the one hour has passed there are two
states in which we think it could be so
after the hour we can have either
nothing happens the the radioactive
material is fine the cat is fine or well
bye-bye cat and according to the
Copenhagen interpretation you can have
both at the same time you have a cat
that's dead and alive so
zombie cat as I said Schrodinger thought
it was this was rather ridiculous so he
came up with a different interpretation
and actually if you were in the drop
database presentation earlier this might
seem familiar because he mentioned this
as well as the multiverse Schrodinger
came up with what many people know as
the many worlds theory now physicists
are fascinating the kaabah with highly
complex solutions to weird problems so
what this theory it states is let's take
everything there is you know the world
the the galaxy the universe now I
couldn't find the picture of the
universe but this whole suffice and in
this universe among other things you
have you know your cat now if one of
these quantum events happens at a
situation in which after which we could
measure that the radioactive material
has decayed or mater cade rather than
getting a zombie cat what you actually
get is two universes which are exactly
the same except for the result of that
one quantum event so in this case the
cat is dead or alive now there in this
case you do have both states that just
separate it into two different universes
and of course this can happen again if
you have another radioactive event which
gives you even more universes and again
you get the picture and I mean I always
split in two it doesn't necessarily have
to be true it could be some other number
of separations
now one thing you may notice in this
slide is we
rather Benny did cats come on there we
go and that's because whole world
doesn't allow for certain things for
example if you take a dead cat and add
more cyanide you don't get a live cat
that's not how biology works luckily a
cat is also not the same as a qubit and
now we're finally getting to the points
where quantum mechanics and computing is
combined so what is a qubit a qubit is
basically a quantum computers analogy to
a regular bit it too can have the value
0 which looks a bit like this in what
this representation by the way is called
a Blas fear so that's 0 it can have the
value 1 as well so that's that's fine we
can handle that but he could also have
something like this this is neither 0
nor 1 it's clearly a point which exists
in this sphere it has a value and we can
work with it and this value is a
combination of 0 and 1 now if you find
the maths you're confusing because 0 is
at the top one is at the bottom and
something on the sphere is apparently a
sum of both don't let it confuse you
this is a three-dimensional
representation of four-dimensional
values math gets weird just trust me
that it's a combination of the two so ok
assuming we have this this
representation of the state of a qubit
which is what the Blas fear does here we
can operate on it so like in binary
computing we have operations or gates
that we can use on our our qubits one of
which that's interesting would be the
Hadamard gate so how does the Hadamard
gate operate the hedemark gate says ok
let's assume there's one further axis in
that 3 dimensional system which is
halfway between the x axis and the z
axis
and we'll just spin our vector around
that axis what would happen now if we
measured the state of this qubit what
would happen if we forced it to take a
value of 0 or 1 the answer is it would
give us both answers with the same
probability depending on well random
chance basically and so it does have
both states at the same time in a way
this is what's called quantum
superposition and it's a very very
powerful tool in our quantum computing
toolbox another tool which by itself is
rather boring because we know something
very very similar to it already is the
power Li X gate and the X gate basically
says ok I'll take the x axis and just
spin my vector around that so 0 becomes
1 and vice versa you could imagine it as
a kind of knot around the x axis not
gates we're all familiar with negation
that's easy enough the X the X gate
alone is pretty boring though necessary
of course but it gets really interesting
when we use the SI not gate the
conditional not gate so the conditional
not gates is basically a super powered
power Li X gate assuming you have your
first qubit we'll call it the the
control qubit in state zero and you
apply a C naught then absolutely nothing
will happen to our second qubit which
we'll call the target qubit if we have
or our control qubit in stage 1 and
apply our C naught it will flip so that
what we saw with the X the X gate right
so this looks like it's basically an if
equals zero then X then flip and for
these very simple cases there's no
difference however what happens when
your control qubit is in superposition
we have two arrows there in the second
one so it's both zero and one suddenly
and you could imagine it a bit like this
what's happened is it's in two different
universes it's 1 0 or 1 and note that
the control qubit in this case has also
changed now this isn't actually what
happens but it's sir
what would happen as soon as you measure
it because as long as it's in
superposition and you don't measure it
it's not forced to decide which Ally so
as long as you don't check or a by what
they this is the Schrodinger's cats
equivalence in quantum computing is
what's called quantum entanglement
you'll see that it's either one on both
qubits or zero on both qubits you don't
get a 0 and a 1 combines in any way
because they are entangled and as long
as we don't measure basically what we
have is this we have two situations at
the same time simultaneous situations
arising from one qubit in superposition
and as long as we didn't look ok so
we've seen a few gates now we've seen
the Hadamard and the c not gates we've
seen one of the three Paola gates the X
gate the Y and the Z gates operate in
very similar fashions they just spin
around to the other axes there are also
other gates for example the eye
density gait which is the most boring of
all because it just does nothing or
there are phase gates which can be
written in this way one projects I'll be
showing you very soon does use those
gates written as such but those aren't
Universal definitions and there are many
many more gates that you can imagine so
that's what we can do on a very
technical level why do we want to do it
what can you do with quantum computers
well actually there are many many use
cases that are coming up that have been
coming up especially in the last couple
of years for example one really big one
is quantum computers can break
encryption in certain cases or quantum
computers can help design cars quantum
computers can help model model behavior
in chemistry and medicine quantum
computers can help build better AI or
they can be applied to weather
forecasting which seems pretty random at
times though it weather forecasts of
course have gotten better over the last
few decades some companies are trying to
apply quantum computing to detect
financial fraud NASA is using quantum
computers very early quantum computers
but they're doing it to improve the
engineering of things NASA engineers you
know spaceships satellites Rover stuff
like that
and to bring a very a very up-to-date
example it could be used to break
Bitcoin so those are just a few examples
of what you could do but there's a lot
more research to be done here and that's
why we need everyone who's interested in
the topic
to think about what the possibilities
are now okay
this so far has been very theoretical
and theoretical stuff is nice but you
really want to actually you know use it
in some way and so I'm going to show you
two ways how you can actually use
quantum computer programming now and
there are quite a few reasons why you
may be interested in doing that one
comes actually from a fellow speaker
learning something that's just totally
different from what you know gives you
so many advantages it makes you think in
different ways which makes you think
better so okay let's think differently
and we'll start with the IBM quantum
experience so the IBM quantum experience
is basically a quantum computer in the
cloud
IBM built real quantum computers for
example here's an image you can see this
huge tank there that's basically a huge
freezer in which there's a chip that
looks a bit like this one here and
that's the quantum computer this
particular one has seven qubits which
you can see here and what IBM did is
they said okay we'll allow anyone to
access this quantum computer online you
can program it in an interface that
looks like this it's a graphical editor
you can create your algorithm in this
graphical editor or there is a
text-based variant as well using a
language called IBM quiz m2 and you can
then run it on one of their real-life
quantum computers at the top there you
see the status of the quantum computers
that I had access to at that point
- both with five cubits for certain
members they also have
20 cubits computer available and more
ashore to follow so let's design a
quantum algorithm on that and we'll go
with what we've seen already
Schrodinger's cat
so encoding as cat in the example what
are the elements we had well we have our
radioactive mass we have the Geiger
counter with its attached hammer we have
the cyanide and of course we have our
cat and as we learned earlier these are
all entangled now if we move this to the
interface we saw previously it would
look something like this so the this is
by the way called the quantum composer
and what what we design is called a
quantum score both obviously inspired by
music and on qubits three here we have
our radioactive mass which as we learned
earlier is in superposition so that's
done by Hadamard gate and the Geiger
counter is connected via a C naught as
is V cyanide as is the cat and if we
want to look at our box we have to
measure which is represented by this
pink gate here and effect let's let's do
a bit more let's measure all of these
gates that so we are working on and if
we run this on again a real working
quantum computer we get something like
this as a result so this here is the
case where nothing happened our cat is
fine the radioactive material didn't
decay all as well this years the case
where well things didn't go as well the
cat is dead and by the way if you're
reading the numbers at the bottom ignore
the first digits because that's the
qubit we didn't use the last digit is
the state of the cat of the second term
the second digit is the state of the
radioactive material and I'm sure you
can interpolate what the the bits
between it mean now so this is those two
values are fine but we also have this
here what's this
well these are errors the thing is what
IBM built it is a real quantum computer
but it makes mistakes and there's a lot
they have to do there they call their
quantum computer to really close to
absolute zero it's just points 0 1
something kelvins warm but they can't
get it to absolute zero for well
physical reasons you know that's damn
cold and and so this causes errors to
happen now I didn't look into why
particular errors here happens more
commonly than others it's probably due
to the design of the quantum ship and
the combinations on the chip they do
have two different chips available in
the in the quantum experience both with
five cubits but with different layouts
certainly on the other chip I couldn't
design it because I couldn't get four
connected qubits on which I could lay
out the algorithm bit a bit of a
technical detail but never mind now we
do get these errors anyway and for this
reason error correction is a really
really important and difficult topic
that the quantum computing community is
working on that's the quantum experience
next way you can get into quantum
computing yourselves is the Microsoft
quantum development kit now this is much
closer to what we know is code from our
everyday lives of course pulling stuff
dragging stuff into these graphical
editor is
also coded a form but we're not used to
that kind of code we're used to you know
words characters numbers braces stuff
like that and the quantum development
kit allows us to do that it brings us a
language called cue sharp the syntax of
which as I assume nobody is surprised by
is inspired by c-sharp and we'll have a
look at that in a short moment until
about two weeks ago I thought I would
have to tell you sorry but this only
works on windows but two weeks ago
Microsoft tweeted out this it's now
available for Linux and Mac so great no
matter what kind of system you have you
can run the the quantum development kits
so see ok let's have a look at what this
looks like so here's a really short
example and as you see I've blurred out
most of the code the part that isn't
blurred out is what we'll be looking at
right now and this again is our crowning
US cat example so first we apply our
header mark gates to the radioactive
isotope then we apply a/c not to the
isotope and the Geiger counter then we
apply a/c not to the Geiger counter and
the cyanide and then we apply a C not to
the cyanide and the cat exactly the same
as we saw in the quantum experience and
now we need some dropper code because
this isn't enough set up it doesn't know
what these things are so okay what else
do we have
oh we have to of course measure so first
of all we set up at the beginning of our
cat is alive and then we say let's look
into the box and just return you know is
it alive or dead then we do some setup
work so first of all we say we need for
qubits for this algorithm
and it uses this using block which you
can see at the top which is specific to
Q sharp then we say okay well we have an
array with four cubits but we'd like to
give them names because no cubit
- what's cubit to give it - in this case
is the cyanide
so that's easier to to work with proper
names are really valuable as I I hope
all of you know then we initialize all
our q8 bits with zero now we didn't have
to do this in the quantum experience
because they are automatically
initialized with zero here we do have to
do it manually and at the end we have to
clean up after ourselves so we have to
set them back to zero and this is
actually a requirement of this using
clause every bit that leaves it has to
be set back to zero the reason we need
both the initialization and the cleanup
at the end is basically decay of states
we can't be sure that qubits will remain
in zero state they could decay towards 1
or if they're in 1 they could decay
towards zero that's part of what happens
when we saw these these errors in the
quantum experience result so this is our
algorithm and we can call this because
we're on the.net platform from c-sharp
so this is a tiny block of c-sharp code
and basically we say ok we'll use a
quantum simulator in this case hint
Microsoft right now doesn't offer real
quantum computers they only offer the
simulator the language is prepared to be
used on real machines however we then
run our experiment get the result is our
cat alive or dead and then check whether
it survived or not
okay so this works fine we get sir
again the cat is alive or the cat is
dead in 50% approximately of the cases
and you can you can look into this
there's a lot more you can do with both
the IBM quantum experience and the
Microsoft quantum development kids I
can't cover all of it in this kind of
talk it's just far too much but read the
specs if you're interested now in this
case here we're using a quantum
simulator and why don't we just go that
way why do we have to build real quantum
computers why don't we just you know
simulate all the things and I would like
to go back to a previous slide for that
do you remember this slide here and you
might now this should be a really smooth
animation watch this that was not a
smooth animation was it my computer is
having real problems with PowerPoint now
let's assume it has to simulate
something a bit more complex like you
know a huge quantum computer and you
don't actually don't have to imagine
this because people have done this
particularly IBM last year published a
paper about results from an experiment
they did and the experiment to simplify
it was they they implemented certain
algorithms for quantum computers and
optimized the simulation to use a well
less extreme amount of memory so what
they came up with is for a 49 qubit
computer they managed to get it down to
four and a half terabytes of RAM
down to four a fifty six cubits computer
they actually managed to get it down
further so the structure of the
experiment was probably better suited
for a fifty six cubits computer what's
really extraordinary is how much it
needed before the optimization eight
petabytes or one exabytes let me repeat
that one exabyte can you imagine the
DEXA bytes and an exabyte let's just go
through this one there we go an exabyte
is a thousand petabytes which is a
million terabytes which if you speak
British English is a mill yard gigabytes
if you speak American English it's a
billion which turns out to be you know
10 to the 18 bytes 10 to the 80 bytes
that doesn't tell us anything really you
can't imagine 10 to the 18 okay realize
it this way our universe according to
current estimates our universe is you
know thirteen point seven times ten to
the nine years old which works out as
4.32 times 10 to the 17 seconds that's
less than half the bytes in an exabyte
so it's pretty extreme so for the moment
were probably for larger applications
stuck to real-life hardware and this
year is pretty cool this is a quantum
computer that IBM built it has 50 cubits
and i thought this was going to be the
largest quantum computer I was going to
show you until on Monday I'm it speaking
a few days ago Google said hey we have
something here they call this
Bristlecone and it has 72 qubits what
really extraordinary about this if it
turns out to be correct
and they haven't tested it to the full
extent yet but this apparently has a
really low error rate so the problems we
had in the quantum experience when we
ran our code on the real quantum
computer earlier wouldn't occur at least
not in in that extreme fashion so I
don't know whether the term quantum
supremacy is something you're familiar
with to quickly explain quantum
supremacy is basically when we can write
algorithms for quantum computers that
they can solve within reasonable amounts
of times and regular computers binary
computers can't of course the definition
of what is a reasonable amount of time
varies there may be a precise definition
of of quantum supremacy I'm not aware of
it if there is but this is a huge step
towards quantum supremacy because I mean
if you need even with the optimized
version three terabytes of RAM to
simulate a quantum computer which has
about two thirds of the qubits this has
things are getting really interesting
okay so let's say I've convinced you
that this is really something you want
to look into what can you do well one
thing you can do is you can register for
the quantum experience is free you have
no requirements whatsoever there's
nothing you have to do with it you can
just play around the reason they're
offering it for free is basically
because they want to learn what people
do with quantum computers they want to
spread the knowledge and make sure that
as soon as they do offer commercial
quantum computers people actually know
how to use them of course you can also
download the Microsoft quantum
development kit as I said now available
for both windows
which is then integrated into Visual
Studio or Mac and Linux where it's
integrated into Visual Studio code and I
assume most of you are aware of a small
site called Stack Overflow
there's they have the whole stack
exchange Network which includes SEC
overflow and many many other sites
currently in area 51 which is their
their area where they suggest new topics
and try them out basically their beta
area there's a suggestion for a quantum
computing site which you can commit to
actually this screenshots is about a
week old since then the number of people
who have committed to participate has
risen to about 50 percent of what we
need to get started if you find this
topic interesting why not commit to you
know looking into the topic it's not
that much work to do but show your
interests show that it's something that
you would like to look into you can use
my personal referral code if you like
otherwise just google it you'll find it
and apart from that basically go forth
explore try it out and thank you for
listening we have time for questions
yeah mm-hmm okay so the question is
where does the power of the quantum
computer come from compared to current
supercomputers why can't we do the same
thing with current supercomputers
basically the answer is with a current
supercomputer what we would do to in
your example break Bitcoin is you can
optimize a bit but basically you're
gonna try every possible variant you're
gonna brute-force it that works but it's
expensive you know you need a lot of
computing power to to brute-force
something like a Bitcoin or any kind of
encryption a quantum computer basically
does the same kind of thing except it
does it in parallel universes this is
not parallel computing like you're used
to this is parallel as in it operates in
different universes at the same time
tries out different things and then at
the end makes sure you're in a universe
where it has found the solution it's a
really really weird concept that's
because quantum mechanics is really
really weird but it's basically you can
imagine it that it ensures that you are
in a possible universe because I mean
you can't be in an impossible universe
that's physically not possible and it's
therefore gives you basically a shortcut
ignoring most of the implausible results
you could have the algorithm used to
break
well the algorithm that people are
afraid of when they speak about quantum
computers breaking any kind of
encryption is called Shor's algorithm
and it's being mathematically proven to
work if your key in represented in
binary has n digits it will manage to
crack the code in square root of n I
believe it was steps while with a
regular computer you would need n steps
and now this is a big speed-up it's not
the solution to everything and I want to
make very clear quantum computers I
don't think quantum computers will
replace regular computers because there
are some tasks which quantum computers
just suck if you want to build an adder
a simple addition with a quantum
computer you'll get results like I think
it's roundabout fall and that's not
really something we want for something
like an adder it's quantum computers are
great basically for any subject or they
can be great for any subjects where
nowadays you would probably go towards
it with probabilistic algorithms and
breaking Bitcoin or any other encryption
is something that's nowadays that is
your best choice other than brute
forcing it does that answer your
question it is it's really weird oh one
thing I forgot to mention both IBM and
Microsoft have really great
documentation on their websites
there's a wonderful getting started
guide for example on the site of the IBM
quantum experience I highly recommend it
they actually have two versions one a
small condensed version which doesn't go
into much detail and one that's really
really thorough if you find the topic
interesting maybe just try out the small
version for starters and
if that gets you fixed dive in okay yeah
mm okay so the question is are there
problems nowadays that you can solve
more quickly with a quantum computer
than with a binary computer and the
answer is not yet there are problems
that have been proven to be solvable
with quantum computers faster than with
binary computers we don't yet have
quantum computers as powerful as we
would need to do that though maybe what
Google announced there with drizzle coat
that might change that it's possible
that within the next couple of weeks
we're gonna hear
we've reached quantum supremacy which is
basically what you described maybe not
we'll we'll see it it depends on many
many things it depends on the precise
algorithms that are described it depends
on the error rates and so on and so
forth so maybe it's gonna be a week
maybe it's gonna be several years we
don't know I'm pretty sure it will come
within a conceivable time frame okay any
other questions guess not then thank you
