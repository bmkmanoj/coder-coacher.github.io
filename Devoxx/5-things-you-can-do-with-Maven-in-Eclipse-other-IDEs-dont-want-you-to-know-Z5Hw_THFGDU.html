about five things you can do with navin
in eclipse other IDs don't want you to
know so hopefully i will teach you some
things today if you don't know about
them if you already know about them good
for you I am glad lacombe I would have
been coding bugs for developer tooling
at read at an eclipse for furious few
years now I am the project lead for the
NT we wtp project and am commuter on the
eclipse and tui projects and eclipse k
dtls my twitter handle is a flea comb
and today in case you have known haven't
noticed i'm going to talk to you about
how Eclipse IDE is awesome Eclipse IDE
why is it awesome because my from my
perspective it provides incremental
feedback super fast if you make a
mistake in your java class save your
file the whole source tree is updated
with errors all over the place so it's a
really good incremental build tool and
maven is awesome maven give you give us
conventions over configuration when you
look at the maven build file you've seen
them all you can open any but any
project on github if it contains the
Mint's like over a million pom.xml file
you know what it what it's doing it's
really straightforward the problem with
maven is it's a command line bill tool
so in the context of idea of an IDE well
it's it's not really supposed to react
to incremental changes by design but we
have maven in eclipse which is Bigley
awesome in Nam in marin in eclipse we
managed in a way to give the incremental
powers of a
clips to the maven build so I'm going to
show you a few things all this
awesomeness in action by doing a little
demo what I'm going to do is convert a
legacy web application to maven and then
I'm going to adapt the bill to react to
different profiles the element profiles
which is a production profile and we're
going to see how we can reuse external
resources added 20 to our build and
we're going to do all that while keeping
a minimal of bill / deployment turn
around so it's demo time and as a bit of
a disclaimer I'm not using the stock
eclipse in store installation i am using
right add tables developer studio 10.3
points zero point GA which is an
equipped distribution but it contains
some of the some other tools that will
help me percent that demo most notably
there's a server adapter that will help
me run my wildfly server and another
tool that's going to be helpful for
Raven conversion we're going to see that
in a moment alright so I'm going to put
that full screen so I got here what I've
got here is a really simple web app it
uses the Eclipse conventions so the
sources are under the SRC directory the
web assets are under web content and the
app is deployed on wildfly here there so
i'm going to put both screens is there
I've got a to-do list app for vc funding
you can talk to me after this call to
interested in the funding this app so
this is a to-do list app I can check my
tasks add new a new task that forgot to
add that we're going to see some awesome
pom.xml action there but it's a legacy
App Engine sent that it's not based on a
bill system it's using pure eclipse
stuff so I'm going to convert that
project in maven and you're going to see
how easy it is so you right click on
your project figure to maven project can
we see it yes this opens a wizard where
you will define group ID or fake ID
version packaging who else here in the
in the room knows maven or is used maven
raise event everyone so everyone knows
the concepts all right so i'm going to
use group ID orb devoxx keep the
artifact ID name and click finish when I
click finish something is going to
happen which is provided by the desk to
do a tool and this thing is the maven
dependency identification so if you can
see here my crop my pocket contains
dependencies to jackson in the web app
libraries folder web instead i also have
oh it's modal window anyway i also have
dependencies two jars provided by wells
lie and all these dependencies described
by the cliffs I need to translate them
to maven dependencies so that wizard is
exactly doing that so I know I need a
few of them not all of them so i'm going
to select them I need ejb so i'm going
to select it I need jax-rs
here I need jpa and I need injects and
the last one I need is Jackson matter
because I know that Jackson mapper
depends on Jackson core I don't and I
don't need Jackson core directly Jackson
court will be when I have a min bill
will be dragged automatically as a as a
transitive dependency all right so I got
a bunch of dependencies hear that i'm
going to add to my build but i know i'm
deploying on a web app server a java ee
server so some of these differences are
already provided by the server so i can
edit the the dependency and say it's
provided all right but i got a bunch of
them that are already provided so i'm
going to select them here more yeah i
can edit them all at once and boom
provided scope so when I click finish
here okay my my small web app has been
converted to maven so I add I have all
the dependencies that have been
identified already with the provided
scope except for Jackson mapper I can
see these dependencies are available in
the maven dependency as well and Jackson
core is here as expected so the wizard
converted the product amazing it's not a
refactoring so that means all the
existing directories are still here I
did not break my project I didn't change
anything it's still the same everything
still in the same place so source
directory source directory contains non
java file here I can see there's an
imported sequel file
this is a java 1017 project so the
compiler is configured to compile to 17
and the war plugins configure to take
all the assets existing in the web
content directory and the ad still works
nobly or not we'll see all right oh this
one thing I forgot to do because there's
a kind of a bug in the server adapter on
etude sale well flyer that it's going to
use the to do context so I'm going to do
that with the final name and I'm going
to say this is artifact ID all right so
let's see deployment directory ok I've
got a bit of a problem here remove that
I check the deployment ok I want to
deploy it under to do war this is a bit
of a bug in dl server adapter called a
tool all right to save it I redeploy
that has run a server
see I really ployed it to the war okay I
things back so I talked about the UAE
try two conversions new haven right next
I'm going to add some customization
depending on some build information so I
want it to play here the version of my
application so how do I do that take my
index HTML and say okay this is say
artifact ID X ID and version I'm going
to remove the list save the file so I
the dev studio tools provide a live
reload server and I connected my browser
to the library list server so every time
I save a file that pile is reloaded in
the browser so here I can see okay I got
some dollar extract ID dollar version
things don't mean anything how do i get
these build information and inject them
into my actual application so we need to
do something is called web resource
filtering so i'm going to open the war
plugin configuration and i'm going to do
something like web resource whip
resources here
they're so as you can see I got Auto
completion in the configuration of part
of the plugging this is actually a
feature the Maven tooling in Eclipse
that you have we have deep knowledge of
the all the configuration value of types
available in the pump so if you try that
in another ID you might be surprised
that you're not going to see you so
we're going to do filtering true and
this should be save the file and isn't
they're here somewhere
ok
isn't there I don't know what dammit
girls are not good with me today now
okay there's an open to exception
somewhere all right if I can't do that I
mean I'm going to be in trouble okay so
let's let's try I'm going to kill that
and restart clips it's the only way i
can think of so should they demo work
properly as soon as i enable the
filtering because i enabled this is a
mitten build enabled in eclipse maven
will process the change resources so my
HTML file should be redeployed with the
proper content let's see what's
happening here server restarted maybe
it's a dairy product configuration even
the project wait for deployment may be
okay if you live reload servers not so
did so we're going to open you know it
doesn't work nothing works a salsa okay
sorry we're going to skip live reload
alright see what's wrong let me change
nah all right let's check normally MTA
will basically process the raw pages the
raw index HTML page and put it in putted
process page in the web resource
directory so I'm going to a vanity
project maybe second time
nope don't work this is interesting ok
so we are going to do something else
we're going to move on if this again I
think maybe there's a Wi-Fi problem it
causes maven to puke all over the place
oh I think I know okay let me think so
we have we're going to include include
when I hear clude eat HTML
nope
okay so no resource filtering okay we're
going to move on to I was going to be
interesting we're going to move on to
war overlays so the idea of war overlays
is let's say you have multiple
applications to develop at your company
and you want to share the same graphic
resources icons CSS files like that so
the idea is that you're not your
application will not be responsible for
containing these resources directly so
here in my case I got CSS in the
bootstrap directory so what I want to do
is use the resources provided my
magnetic company so in here what I'm
going to do is add a dependency to these
shared resources so it's to insert
dependency and add shared assets here
this is a war type you can see so when I
save it normally here in the target
folder I can see an overlays folder that
contains another war files that just
contains a bootstrap CSS that's going to
be deployed on my server if it works all
right so I'm going to delete mine okay
and see what happens nothing works again
now
ok it's dear full publish
nah all right i can't debug everything
so what time is it don't have much time
so I'm going to I'm going to have to
apologize and explain you what supposed
to happen so the idea is you want to
share your resources and by simply
adding in dependency to your pom.xml m2e
wtp will take these external resources
put it put a copy in the local workspace
and everything will be deployed on the
server on the running server here for
some reason oh yeah okay we're here so
we don't have the resource field string
here but we that we have at least the
overlays right so it works with external
dependencies that the jar exists in
America story has been downloaded and
then included in my workspace but what
if I want to overlay resources that are
in my workspace so i can do that as well
so if i go to the mind navigator in
oakland the same project i'm going to
refresh here we're going to see you
share share the acid project as
physically a few are they
here it has a few folder contains
containing different themes for a
bootstrap so right now i'm using slate
locally so try again to do when i'm dead
2 million project configuration this
should i shouldn't have to do it
manually it should just work just work
no it doesn't okay so let's do change
here i'm going to use something like
Amelia slightly so one of the 10 another
feature of the pollinator here is the
navigation through the type of the file
system if I do SRC main flatly diploma
deter recognized that depending on the
type of of object that's configured in a
plug in it support it will open like a
smart file browser so here and change my
content the content of my project in the
workspace hopefully it works alright so
now I'm sharing resources from another
project in my own web app but i still
only achieved you add my own web
resources here we can check in the
target folder this is the old version of
the overlay but everything is it's
coming from the workspace really so
let's try it another another time Amelia
save it and it works okay so that at
least works alright so we we've seen a
few features from the pom-pom XML editor
deep configuration options navigation
through the file system we've seen
overlays working web filtering is
another problem well so there's a last
feature that I wanted to show you but
it's deeply linked to the web resource
filter good strength that i wanted to
show so i can still talk about it it's
the profiles management if you have
different profiles in your build so
let's create a few profiles
okay that profile and production profile
so what you can view in in Eclipse is
select the profile you want to work with
any given time so is a wizard for that
so control out p will open the maven
profile selection so it can enable any
given profile save it and should web
filtering word work you could see that
filtering depending on the profile with
a date the application in real time
fortunately I'm lucky today so any idea
what happens if I ask two profiles that
provide the same things are what happens
if their label at the same time and the
idea no ok so the last profile in the
pom.xml wins you've got two profiles
that and each of them override the same
or declared the same values the last one
declaring the pom.xml wins it's kind of
important one of the thing you can do
while working in Cliff's is have a
profile that's enabled all the time in
eclipse in order to do that to do that
for instance the deck profile if I want
that deck profile to be enabling a cliff
I can declare an activation policy which
is based on a property named m2e version
ok when I do that the profile is
automatically enabled in eclipse so if I
go back to the profile management wizard
ok I'm going to Jack you ate everything
oops
and this is at all there I can see the
deck profile is automatically activated
because the mt virgin property is
injected by m2 eclipse all right so
that's about all the things i wanted to
show you it'll be nice to have the web
or social filtering working so let's go
back to the slide a little bit so in
summary is a demo went well we've seen
the project converters which is really
good dynamic resource filtering didn't
work but it's still really huge if you
can believe me there's a profound
management system that's I think really
nice in Eclipse war release report works
dynamically you make any change to your
war of alleged appendices and they're
normally deployed on the fly which is
really nice and some features from the
ponics and other editors are unique to
eclipse like deep configuration
knowledge a file system navigator if you
have any question now is the time nope
all right thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
