do a start slowly so that people that
come can have a chance so just let me go
to the start of my presentation so yeah
it's like probably this page and hello
everybody its talk is lambda hardcore it
works for work based Aegina nice to see
you here so about me maybe for those
that don't know me I'm your recruit I
ski I'm developer wizard you sometimes
see it and an architect written this way
I spent last 17 years with JVM generally
so mostly with out of JVM and that's my
pokemons are as follows you know John La
Scala whatever
yeah but Anna working can spend my life
in the Lutheran working from see essence
physician so CSS insurance we don't
insure stylesheet yet the company was
founded like you you see over a hundred
years ago you know we have family gas
occult well it's okay okay so what is
talk going to be about so the first
think warning for you once I forgot this
this talk is completely useless sorry
for that if you are counting on seeing
something like I don't know great stuff
you can do with Java lambdas yes it's
great stuff that you can do with Java
lambdas but not on your production never
now not in a normal business life it's
something for fun so we'll be talking
what's a number it's very important
question what is I will show you
something like lambda calculus who knows
lambda calculus a couple of you so will
be something like recollections of
things from from University I'll present
that in Java that's the core point of
this presentation and yeah we'll have
some fun so II
as a maybe why did that come to that
point you I must say I'm not a sight so
sorry for those of you that rely on me
and I will be explaining very deep
scientific stuff not
iein real developer Joe so however I
studied mathematics and so I learned a
little bit this stuff but I studied
mathematics only because of this so by
the time I was to choose my studies I
was like mastering this machine
commodore 64 who had commodore 64 and
that was the greatest machine of all
times come on you know and i was able to
do that so being able to do that means
yeah there's nothing you can learn at
study other studies here come on it's
just a top level that you can achieve in
computer science so for me studying
computer science was just no no no no
sense at all and i had a colleague that
was able to do this on his pc with her
coolest graphic cards so because of that
is only black or white so he had the
same problem there's nothing he could
learn more so he proposed that we study
something fun it would be mass so i went
to study math and that was well my first
lecture the professor was doing a proof
that one indeed is different than zero
oh my god he spent I don't know like 15
minutes
proving that one is not zero but you
know this first time in my last life
I've seen that it's indeed it's
different I could prove it since that
moment and first time I had doubt about
it but okay the question is what is one
what is zero that's very impressing with
interesting issues so what is a number
in fact kunos what is the number can you
explain me three what is three Oh what
is successor that in fact okay successor
one two but what is this can we define
it better so yeah because okay come on
I can have two things in my hand like
what I really like for instance if you
have a cone I don't have either by
demand coin body if you look at the coin
like two euro is greater to switch
it's funny because one thing and it
represents two isn't it crazy yeah so
number is something more than just
counting items it's something some
abstractions and how to define it so
about the number two like if we don't
have coins if we don't have apples shoes
people we don't have anything to count
what can we use because let's suppose
this represents big Bank the start of
the universe let's suppose it didn't
happen our universe wasn't created and
even for those of you that believe there
was a Flying Spaghetti Monster that
created know for a moment let's pretend
there was no Flying Spaghetti Monster
so universe wasn't created at all can we
represent numbers somehow without apples
without water bottles whatever so
mathematicians considered this problem
to create mathematics so abstract that
it wouldn't depend on the real life and
they come with something like set you
know who can define a set of what kind
of things we don't get things nothing
was created yet believe it is empty you
can a group of things
so basically mathematicians don't define
set set is something abstract they said
we don't define what status status sets
exist but in an universe that wasn't
created can you have at least one set
yeah great
so universe wasn't created but we have
one thing empty set isn't it great
creating things of of magic that's cool
so we have an empty set okay great
we started we are got now we have one
thing out of nothing can we do further
are you in fact so that is a group of
things do we have think right now we
have an empty cent does this think so we
can create a set that contains this set
how cool
great so we have empty universe not
created and we already have to think how
great yeah we are very powerful with
nothing just mathematics just
abstraction so it goes farther I don't
have time but to explain everything but
there is a procedure this procedure says
let's
take some this set before the things
that we created make an Union with this
thing as an element so basically for
instance next thing after this septic
containing empty set is this set set
containing an empty set and empty send
contain teens in set so looks strange
but it is basically zero one two and
operation don't have success or in
mathematics so that's how the classical
mathematic was created the question is
okay then is the three the question is
why do they do that
at all this stupid play with sets there
was a reason behind because if we are
able to precisely define the structures
the fundament of this mathematics so we
know which language we will talk we know
the rules maybe maybe this mathematic
will be somehow automatically working
maybe will read something that was a
like hundred years ago the holy grail of
mathematics that's a picture like that
with humor silver song stated this if we
have good axioms the basic the
fundaments maybe we will find a
algorithm that using these fundaments
will prove automatically every every
theorem so like fermat's last theorem
every complicated Pythagoras theorem
when we just automatically prevent
because our language our fundaments are
good well defined that engineering no
more abstract mathematics is just
engineering so how cool would it be
great yeah mathematicians were thinking
about how to make themselves useless
like computer science is doing machine
learning okay but yeah somehow but there
are some visual score known as set
theory and those working well it started
still working well in fact but there are
some problems this was let's consider
the set of all sets that not all are not
members of themselves so okay
sounds complicated there is a there is
this thing in a city it's like Lugano
there is a barber who shaves all men who
don't shake themselves and only men who
don't shave themselves okay and now the
question is does the barber shave
himself
and if I don't spend much time on it but
there is no good answer to this question
he can't shave himself because he only
shaved the men that do not shave
themselves so it's like and also he must
shave himself because otherwise he would
before so it's stupid but that's a
paradox known as a result paradox
another paradox that was killing this
fundamental said theory like they
started live with six seven axioms so
this fundamental set the set of the just
axiom and some other fundament and then
they came to such paradox and what how
to solve paradox is the same as you do
in a normal life you start the system
with a clean requirement this is this
then you design a framework for that is
great then come to the business and
change the requirements and all
everything collapses the same thing
happens in mathematics so 10 such
paradox and they had to put some crazy
hacks do not those paradox happen so
after all if you set up ctrl right now
you can go to Wikipedia I will see that
it has like six seven axioms that are
very very clean and under the
understandable you will know what it
means and then six other that are just
crazy what what is this even that those
are hacks nasty hacks on production to
make everything working so you know
maybe it's just not clean framework
maybe we should do something better the
new system we let's start again so there
other guys along the church in 1930 he
was started something new let's forget
about this test theory what start with
something else let's take a function of
this fundamental particles that wasn't
good enough let's take a function who
thinks it's crazy because you know what
the function who knows what the function
is
yeah so but you already see this in
order to have a function you need a set
stupid where is that very something you
know that's about okay we'll go over
that so a function sounds stupid but
let's think about for a moment let's
build world with functions so once again
new world functions so universe wasn't
created there is not even empty set
again start from scratch can we define a
function function that doesn't need
anything to exist yet what identity
function what is this
so a function that doesn't change
anything so it takes whatever ok
whatever at the moment doesn't exist but
would take whatever and we'll give the
same thing back so in order to describe
this function you don't need anything
that's cool abstraction identity
function so ok we've created something
identity we have once again empty
universe and we already created
something identity function so what can
this identity function in this moment
except how itself because we have one
thing identity function so it's function
that wasteth can take an identity
function and will result write it with
identity function how cool we are
powerful so we don't need anything and
we can play with that ok cool so that's
how mathematicians so that's proposal
how to write identity by the way it's
only it's very simple you would write it
f of X from X is X sorry and I'm
sometimes using polish words but the
Madden Alonzo Church the notation
proposed this lambda I no fancy fancy
symbol from X dot after dot you write
what it is it means sticks so that's how
you write identity with this notation
and yeah maybe we can if we go further
basically lambda notation is like this
lambda from X
X is the variable argument dot and after
that any expressions what you do with X
what you have to do so that's the format
you will find on Wikipedia whatever so
just two examples lambda from X from X
is X plus X or lambda X is sine ethics
that's a that's that those are good
definitions but all those are bad in
fact
who knows what's bad with those
definitions at this moment we don't have
yet in an empty universe plus we don't
have sinus whatever so we don't have
those operation we have to define them
and we'll do that today ok not ever all
of them but we will see so the only
thing we will have in this universe and
the only one thing ability to define
something like lambda with this
expression and inside of the expression
you can use something like this lambdas
from X is for instance efforts from from
X and what is this F it's just another
lambda what what is this space that's
the most important operator in lambda
calculus is so important the
mathematicians are afraid to write it
it's function application so it's in
London L guru's function application is
just a space you don't you don't talk
about this it's so so important okay but
nevertheless it's very simple so we will
have only two things ability to define
the lambdas and ability to apply lambdas
what do you do lambdas are functions
basically okay so let's play with that
okay for you it's not clear we'll do
that in Java writing code that's the
goal so how to define lambda in Java
what is this in Java okay it is our
stablished it's functional interface how
cool and it's public interface but we'll
call it lambda okay so the question was
to write here inside apply apply from
what to what
ronk what is the domain exactly so we'll
write something that results results
with lambda takes another lambda that's
it that's the lambda in Java
well how cool so we can maybe play with
that it will be very stupid but let me
define this like lambda identity is like
this easy what can we do with such
identity oh I will do something very
stupid I will display it sorry it's my
even its low so you see it's like this
so I've just printed some hash of an
object doesn't make any sense but we
will see that something is in fact
working if I apply identity to itself
like this you will see that this thing
works because after doing identity with
identity I get the same number so you
see it's working so this is well how I
will define whole mathematics today Java
with anything but but one exceptions I
will only only define lambdas inside of
those lambdas I will use other lambdas
and applications I will not use boolean
I will not use integers whatever I would
just do plain definitions of lambdas so
purely functional even even more than
purely one exceptions in order to print
it in a sensible way I will use some
other package this package what it is it
takes it takes this identity definition
and tries to print what it is in a
mathematical way you will see that okay
because otherwise playing with such
crazy number doesn't make much sense so
let me but before I go further I will
just go back to the mathematics for a
moment just to show it a little more
data so we know how to play with
identity can we create yet another
function identity was easy without using
anything from external world like price
or sinus so there is a possibility like
take a look at this it's a lambda from X
dot results by the way it's less
associative so it results
lambda from Y returning quite so it's
basically you can explain this lambda
from X that whatever x axis it just
ignores it and returns identity it's
basic it's has a lamp it's not identity
it's other lambda because it's right
also you will see that basically the
function of two arguments
so lambdas are basically functions of
one argument but that's not a problem
even though you can have two arguments
this is the how now let's play with that
so I will show you we have this function
lambda from X returns lambda from wider
from Y that returns Y and we apply it by
the way I'm not afraid to write this so
I'm using underscore I write the
function application we will apply it to
the two objects that I borrowed from a
different world
like trumpeter tomato okay just for a
moment let's borrow those so after the
first application in place of X I will
use trumpet but you see because X was
not using an expression in fact it
returns lambda from Y returning white
and then tomato has a second application
then I apply it tomato of course because
its identity it returns tomato Serie C
we have something that's how lambda
calculus works so there is also other
possibilities I take now I create that
function lambda from X that returns
another lambda that takes Y and still
return X it's got something else because
we do the same operations with example
the tomato we get after the first X we
reapply this trumpet then we get lambda
from Y returns trumpet and then it still
applies to tomato but because it doesn't
use tomato in expression it returns
jumpers so those are two different
functions that we created basically with
nothing and there is a possibility to
use something like that lambda from X
returns lambda from line that returns X
applied with Y but the problem is I
can't write it because I if I apply
champions from - tomahto I will break
trumpety also so sorry I don't do that
from stage but okay let's do that in
Java it will be easier so first of all I
will show you how this package for
displaying works
so if I the smart displays the only
thing that I will be using from the
external so all the dirty things
it displays simple that's that's
identity so mathematical definition then
I will play with the ball you see this
function funny we've just defined it
before so I will DIF display it it's
like this ok it's working the system is
working I just defined some funny lambda
right now let me do this I define lambda
that's called true basically it's the
same lambda as this funny but for a
reason it's called a true by the way it
doesn't matter how it's called it's only
in only makes metal what's inside but
we'll see that so I will display this
true but even before going farther I'll
do something something more I will
define lambda called false as you see
those words exactly those two lambdas
that I will I was discussing before but
this time with Java so you have
something that we call true and false
yeah okay that's just the names but not
coincidence how they are called so if I
create another lambda called end like
this
I can even display it by the way I will
show you something if I display it I
will have this true/false and end and by
the way if you are concerned why this is
here P and Q that's a conversion that
mathematicians use and by the way in my
package for displaying it basically
doesn't know which names are there if I
delete this P here I will get the same
with x and y so it's just a matter of
convention I am displaying using this
convention with P and Q so to make it
consistent with things you can read for
instance when Wikipedia so after the
stock you can go to Wikipedia and reject
all of this it's the standard thing ah
but you can recheck that with Java
exactly with this so we have something
that's called and true and false let's
play with that I will create something
called result one at life it with false
and true I just
and is a lambda from two things so first
I apply it once with false and then I
apply this with true so what will I get
what will be the result of that for some
of you that shouldn't be a surprise if
you look at the result it is what it is
the same as a false you see so we have
operation and that takes a false and the
true in return something that looks like
a false how cool so maybe if I write
here a true what I get something that is
in fact true and by the way I said it
doesn't matter how the lambda is called
so I can here for instance use funny
funny is again something that is true
should I still because it has the same
definition as true so it should return
true let's see that yeah it returns true
so it's working and operation with just
nothing we didn't have to use no bullets
no real rules no integers just pure
functional definitions how cool so we'll
go further we can create or the same way
like this and then I will I will
sorry I make it on top like yeah results
from or so I will I will use it with a
false and that's true so let me let me
show that so right now we have all with
a false and the true and it returns true
I will spare mine time proving you that
it really works with all the possible
values or is it unclear for you Mario
clear or not okay great so if it's clear
it's just working you can prove it with
a pen or you can prove it with Java so
how cool I even you can go farther
that's a note definition it's a little
bit longer and then for instance I will
display not from false so this is this
our K and so not from force is again
true so what I've defined here is the
definitions of true or false and three
boolean operators this means we have
boolean algebra covered with just
nothing just pure lambda how cool it
works but okay you may say okay boolean
algebra is something easy two things and
just the end here does not really great
things so let's do something more
interesting like this
zero do you recognize this zero so you
should recognize it you should you have
seen already that now it's not a
identity it's something that takes
something and returns identity so it's
already known under the different name
now it's false false and it's ultimate
ultimate ultimate proof that the
creators of C language were right
because they you know in C zero is false
it's exactly like along the church took
her his lambda calculus like almost 100
years ago so he already knew that okay
so but we can define one this way so by
the way it's only a convention for
bullying al-ghab and for this that's a
convention now you can represent those
numbers or those those values there are
different conventions this is working
this is the most popular there are other
alternatives to just use operators and
everything most must fit but this one is
as I say the standard mainstream one so
we can define one this way and two this
way I will just display it and you will
see the pattern okay fine you see that
zero is this one is this and so is this
basically it's a function so what is a
number in lambda calculus is a function
from two things that basically returns
something that how many times this F
argument is applied will applies with
the FFO mix so it's like if it one time
it represents one so basically it means
you
create successor so this operator this
way takes some n thanks some F and thank
some X and returns if n is this kind of
number within this way then it will
return
just one more application of s so I can
represent successor operation I will
only dust displayed how it looks and
then I will display your hair for
instance looks successor from one
okay so successor from from one what is
this as you see successful for one is
exactly looking like two so it's working
already and we can go even more further
like right now I'll do something strange
successor because you will ask probably
if you are listening carefully what is
this Cardinals from from integer ten
because in this moment I'm using integer
I told you I will not use but if I write
there as apply as apply apply apply
apply it would be very boring for me
so I made a shortcut and I defined this
small utility function that returns this
but basically in this place I could
write this F from X returning s applied
to s applied so that will be boring so
that's a shortcut you don't need it but
it's for to make it more readable it's
still working so behind it's just
ordinary our lambda so if I defined plus
this way like it's you see it's a more
complicated operation than for instance
sentence or where then I can display
this plus
justice so we can display any lambda so
I will display plus and right now let's
see if it's working I defined those two
lambdas again to spare myself time
typing those all applies ie this is a
with six times F applied this is this be
war
seven times so I will display them for
ya
yes so plus a and B let me check it so
you see a in fact this one this is
written in Java in fact B is written in
Java this way has one more F so that
represents section seven and then plus
and you should count all those F for me
it's just impossible
I can't count only two three so I had
one other another thing everybody that
studies mathematics has this problem III
can I created a function that counts how
many times has appeared so this is
Cardinals to integer only to display so
again it's only for debug purpose so you
see it it was 13 so as expected it's
working how cool you can again prove it
on pan with a pen or you can prove it
with Java in dev it really you can you
can try it with debugging but that's up
to you as a homework it really works and
doesn't need anything
we Java with nothing so multiplication
is easy looks like this the
multiplication operation by the way is
the one that you can easily understand
one way it works if you why it's looking
like that it's the easiest of the
typical calculations okay moment just
make it in front so if I multiply again
this a and B I should get some kind of a
number okay so it's also too much just
yeah so I just need to see so I multiply
a and B and you see oh I have 42 because
I've create I've converted it to two
integer but I don't have to I could
smart display for instance this maybe I
will check it because I like the whoops
you know what I was kicked to next slide
because I would just I just I just don't
want to play with this code again but
basically it works and let me skip to
something more complicated okay I don't
I always lost if i type too many s so
okay working natural numbers working
boolean algebra can we do more because
the color that's fast forward that's
always in front so that was the problem
that in fact alone
Shetty one day he said okay plus can be
defined but can we have - okay we have
successor can we have predecessors of
the current ation it was not that easy
in fact she's his student found the
student I know co-workers clean found
the way how to represent - so let's take
this nine number so I call it a nine and
let's take a look at this operation how
how complicated it is you see it's like
oh my god oh my god oh my god oh yeah
it's done so this is then I will display
even this operation and then let me show
it really works
it's I display a nine and then I'll
display decrement in I will see if it
works
done you see the commander has one F
less it really works
how cool so we can even decrement how
it's great really that's that was one of
the biggest inventions in this lambda
calculus how to decrement and if we can
decrement subtraction is then easier
because basically it looks like this
using predecessor so we can subtract
I won't apply with subtraction really
because I want to show you something
interesting because okay those are
operators or natural numbers operators
right now take a look at this lamp I
call it not by accident Islam if it
takes some see this condition the exempt
T means in case of true take some f
means in case of F in case of false
basically and definition is pretty
straightforward what is this it's
something that we know from every
language it's a if expression by the way
the expression not statement so if the C
is our fourth all true as defined
previously with this convention then
providing some other lambda as T or of F
we will get either T or F evaluated
depending on the condition so we can
represent the
I would say basic break of algorithmic
spreche in how cool and we can go
further with that for instance this is
zero is a come either condition by the
way again something to not repeat every
time this a lambda from X returns why it
returns lambda from winders returns why
this is very basically this thing and
this is the opposite the true definition
I have them under that is this yarek
bullying instructs here you know in a
bad line package it's basically the
standard definition of true and false as
a lambda really so it's nothing magic
here so for instance this is the less or
equal condition that's I'm printing it
here because I will need them so just in
moment let's go to here and now I we
have this conditions we have if we can
build something very crazy but we need
one more
Spink so this is something that I really
like and it's called auto call of auto
cooperation so it's lambda that takes
one X and returns X applied to itself
you know it is very real and very
impolite it might go on and do it to
yourself
okay it's very bad one but I love it and
then using this lambda you can create
something like this who knows this stuff
because this is very very famous think
why that this is something known as Y
Combinator or fixed point Combinator but
a couple of different names because it's
one of the biggest breakthroughs made in
lambda calculus why do we need it I will
show you I will show you by writing some
other function some other lambda lambda
from called G that takes some error but
forget about our for a moment take look
look at this n if so it basically takes
some N and if n was 0 then I
return 1 otherwise I multiply and forget
about this art for a moment with
predecessor of gun you know this think
maybe one just let me see if it combines
you notice what this is
so take some n if n is zero then I
return 1 otherwise and multiply with
predecessor from and from another from
further settlement president from and
with this function it's a recursive
definition what is this okay
factorial exactly its factorial so so
almost so so I write lambda lambda
lambda in factorial moment factorial is
why applied with G so I will in a moment
explain you why I needed those tricks Oh
some well some of you may find it ok so
I make it up so I will play with
factorial from 3 for a moment like let's
print it factorial from 3 just let's
bring it
you see factorial from 3 is in fact sex
that you can count doors or six time F
so if I print here six then I will get
something crazy Wow they you could count
all those s but although you could
believe me that it's okay but maybe okay
if you don't believe me I already have
this function that counts how many time
as how many FS I have here so this is
the thing and basically the question for
you who knows why this strange why fixed
point Combinator is needed why it's not
really normal recursion there because if
you define factorial normal with with
every language you can use this function
factorial from n minus 1 and okay yeah
why it's not working here there is a
simple reason for that because it's if
you
define function like here was factorial
you can inside of the body reuse this
symbol factorial but if it's the
variable definition G for instance you
cannot use this G here inside so because
of that this simple trick is needed so
because of that this trick is needed in
lambda calculus that you go with
something intermediate that basically is
a that's not a factorial that is a
factory of factorials and this Y
Combinator changes this factorial
factorial into the real factorial
basically you can do the same with
Fibonacci well whatever recursive
function so this magic operator magic
lambda that take something and returns
recursive version of this how cool it's
really magic so okay so what I've shown
you today is that really this Java with
nothing or lambda rules
purely pure functional language is
powerful can do Oriol mathematics from
scratch again you can define everything
and basically it's true if you don't
believe me you can believe drink because
heaps proven that lambda calculus and
Turing machine are equivalent they are
enough for both exactly so powerful so
anything you can do with the Turing
machine you can do with lambda calculus
and vice versa
okay isn't it great so we have powerful
tool so maybe like now let's go back to
our Holy Grail so we have very very I
would say elegant formalism lambda
calculus that is very powerful so maybe
we'll do this trick
what is the theorem like last firma
theorem and pretty giris is basically a
statement and lambda calculus in fact
it's more complicated but it is like
this you can represent statements
logical statements with lambdas you see
that point then i simply evaluate this
statement and find out if it's true or
false
all magic so i can simply see take any
complicated theorem that mathematicians
took I don't know 50 years to prove I
just simply evaluate if it's true or
false
isn't it great
so all the problem is gone so we can
read how to do that but basically it's
not really working why it's not working
you see on this picture on this not nice
auto Columba if you do how to call with
outer coat so once again that's the
operation you will see this let let's
write for a moment Stack Overflow error
so unfortunately in any real complicated
realistic statement with lambda happens
such lambdas that you can describe
mathematically you can reason about it
but unfortunately in any automatic
calculation they explode with Stack
Overflow basically it means it's the
same problem that you know from Turing
machine you can't tell if it stops you
can't use another Turing machine to just
say that it stopped or not so basically
charge has proven that no computable
function can decide equivalence it means
you can't build lambda that takes
another lambda and just say it's true or
false
Oh such a story so but you don't have to
worry if you go to stack overflow
you can in fact find the solution I
wasn't brave enough to check it but
people are working on that it was really
long story behind that with c-sharp they
are building the equal equivalence so
they visit each checking if though is
two lambdas or equivalent so basically
if you do that you have an operation
that checks to lambda and say they're
all logically if they are equivalent
then basically you've broken this
housing problem or whatever I think they
haven't studied anything but maybe
that's a chance to transfer them maybe
they'll find something I just count on
them okay so the right now maybe is to
something something more often okay so
we had this set theory that was not
elegant it's working but it's knowledge
and then we had this lambda calculus
that's very very elegant formalism but
at the end you see this has the same
problem in fact as at the other
formalism you can't have this whole
grain so maybe we should choose
something else
who thinks there is something else that
can help us so basically there are a
couple of other formalism like lambda
occludes the recursive function or
whatever the different names you can
read about them but basically
unfortunately it's proven that whatever
format is you take if it's complicated
enough so it's good enough so very
minimalistic you can take and it will be
okay but if you if it's complicated
enough to do arithmetic so plus minus
whatever then unfortunately there is a
proof that these formulas wouldn't be
able to prove itself simply like that
it's proven so basically cool together
made this proof even at the beginnings
of the charge where church works so and
church knew this thing already basically
finally think about this definition that
if you go to this theorem you'll see
that simply he creates that such
statement that is true but you can you
cannot prove that it's true how cool
it's really funny but okay it's very
interesting procedure so summary from
today for you funny thing I told you
it's not really usable yeah but it's you
can do it in Java if you want to learn
about it so if you want to learn about
lambda calculus you want to impress your
friends here the Gauss whatever and then
you can do it in real Java and you can
really because you need if you go to
Wikipedia and written about lambda
calculus is always this mathematical
terms it's not really reliable so if you
do it with Java for me it was way easier
of with Scala it works basically for any
language I've skipped lot of problems so
in lambda calculus we have problem
called eager lazy evaluation those are
complicated but you can once you start
you will see what was the point
but that funny thing shows that
basically if I was able to do that with
just pure function definitions oh come
on then everything can be done with
purely functional that's no excuse for
you for your colleagues tell them if
somebody says now it can be done
functioning oh come on and show this
video to them okay that's one point of
the story if you want to read more about
the topic
after this if you go to Wikipedia and
read about lambda calculus it's really
well done and we will read it way easier
there is a great block which presents
c-sharp version of this talk so we are
doing the resync mostly at the same time
so I was even using the block while it
was written to make something easier to
understand but it's really deep so it
really goes into the details to a lot of
things I couldn't present but there are
really a lot of articles you can spend a
month reading that Dixon blog official
version of that I like the book which
doesn't isn't really about lambda
calculus it's about mathematics drink
machine but it's really inspirational so
I recommend it in Paros new mind Roger
Penrose and he this briefly describes
the lambda calculus but I really say if
you if you read the first part of this
book you will be eager to learn more on
all this talk so I like because of that
I proposed it but you know there's
another fighter
I think it's not that old in fact
physical proposition ice types that
somehow connects this thing these
abstract things with more than I would
say researchers that we're doing in a
functional programming proposition I'd
types I also recommend it because it's
very I would say funny article funny
paper you will will be laughing while
reading it and still it's very deep so
it's like and it doesn't really have a
lot of Maca it has a little bit but it's
really really interesting so you will
you after reading this you will find
like 50 other articles to read so it's
great more knowledge if you want to play
with those lambdas you can use mine on
the github this package called bedlam
it's basically lambda visualization I
use it today to transfer Java written
lambda into mathematical little numbers
so it's like this only and this
presentation can be found on this tiny
URL and basically that concludes the
talk so thank you very much
don't forget to vote do you have
questions has anyone questioned okay
thank you this it's useless but okay
thanks okay so why</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
