Austria and I'm here at Jarek who gave a
talk today which I certainly miss called
lambdak or hardcore yes
so what clean and hardcore elements of
language we delve into today so it was
really scientific talks of not really
hardcore in terms of JVM but hardcore
how you do really hardcore maths with
Java that sounds like contradiction in
terms
it's just Java land itself Ultima yessuh
literally I wanted to show that that the
complicated mathematics terms are can be
easily seen and tried with Java so that
was exactly the point so what is it
about a job at an agency fee that is it
many previous complicated mathematical
functions I approving the function or
you doing anything with large volumes of
data and also basically I my talk was
about lambda calculus it so it's not
that complicated in terms of the data
volume water whatever is complicated in
understanding it's math but it's not
really that nobody can easily trace but
with Java we it can make help in
imagination how it may make it easier to
him for the typical developer to
understand what is this all about
hey can you give me an example of one of
the calculations so the calculations we
try today were simply basic like 2+2 or
whatever but the point of the talk was a
lambda calculus and lambda calculus is
that we don't have numbers as we know
like integers whatever everything in a
lambda calculus is lambda is a function
so instead of having two I had a
function that was representing two
instead of having plus I had a function
that was representing a plus and then I
had where instance three as another
function and then it was really like
that shown in Java to show that using
those three functions I can create
another function which at the end
represents five for instance like so
it's really this kind of thing can we
learn
studies and it's still hard if you don't
have good tools to really delicate and
that was the data point yeah that
reminds me a lot of Erica try to read
one it's called understanding
computation where it steps through
building your own compiler by building
up functions like that okay so I don't
know this book but I wouldn't say it was
like really oh maybe it was like really
building maybe not compiler but subset
of Java basically what I've shown to
then is a very small subset of Java
let's say that we don't have anything
with from Java we have only like
defining a function and function
application is very very small language
but it's good enough to represent
everything that we know from math like
natural numbers in real numbers even
computations like factorial whatever
that's very cool
what about imaginary numbers that is not
a problem as in mathematics once you
have natural numbers everything after
imaginary goes very quickly it's like
you can create them using this but
really the biggest point the hardest
point is ready to start with zero what
is zero what is one that's the hardest
point once you have done and you have
natural numbers and everything it's just
automatic so very much mentioned out
know that what inspired you to get
started on this talk I I'm not sure if I
should say but it was really like I did
well a couple of years ago a talk at the
Java user group in Roseville about
lambdas in Java 8 that were coming and I
try to explain whether the 10 or lambda
came from and so I thought that people
that there is lambda calculi that is
described but then we had
after-after-party let's say after day
after day even after drinking possible
simple a little bit of beer we get an
idea of maybe we could do it with Java
that was been funny indeed it was 39
about Java when he did it oh so that I
didn't understood the question did you
learn a lot more about Java when you did
it not really about Java I would say but
I learned about functional programming
because the district was representing
that even this lambda calculus is the
purest functional programming that one
can imagine it's really so cute that you
don't even have numbers like integers
whatever is just fun
applying functions and indeed what I try
to show that talk it's even with this
very simple language you can do
everything it means functional
programming pure functional programming
is good enough to do everything so
that's the lesson yeah it's just there's
no excuse you can do everything with
functional programming is only your
choice or you may be I guess I better
get started functional programming then
yeah yeah I've been meaning to um
there's a website called Coursera
functional programming in Scala yeah but
okay it's colorize is better for that
but I would say better a little bit
better in Java you have to write a lot
of yeah boilerplate code but it's still
good enough I would say it's better
maybe to start with language that you
know so maybe like Java and then maybe
because to be familiar to not do two
things at once oh I I did it I was
learning how and functional programming
at the same time it was really hard for
me okay cool well I'm looking forward to
seeing your talk</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
