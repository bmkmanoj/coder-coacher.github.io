talking about transforming well when to
transform your rest api is into a
streaming API version and I'm a massive
fan of your talks because you may claim
get a really good use of media and its
variants fundable for me and it's really
good fun so I guess we'll start with
with the basics what is screaming
compared to they may be polling well so
pulling is kind of the traditional way
of having real time data actually it's
much more like almost real-time data
because you don't really know except if
you know exactly how thin your bet is
refreshed you will make a lot of users
call you will make a lot of you will
retrieve some response a lot of times so
it's not it's not working really well
because it's not scalable and so you
will not have real-time data when you
have a big amount of data so that's
what's the traditional way of doing it
but there is other technology which
exists for more than 10 years now
including service events which are real
way to do it's what we call push
technologies and its really make to have
real real real time because obviously
and so that's like why name maybe for
example you open a channel team in
communication and you're just
continually sending and if it is it just
a TCP packet so it depends from on the
technology choice you're making what's
the cat for example it happens by a
binary be directional connection so that
both server and the client can send that
out to each other it's not TCP it's it
has its own protocol which is TCP base
but basically it's just when the ad
check is made it's switching to it's an
upgrade protocol which is made so it's
wishing to its own
websocket protocol whereas in service
and events it's completely based on htp
you just need to add a little better to
support services event and so it's
classic 80gb correction this crazy yeah
but in service and even chicken it's
only the server which can send that I
took science so real different use cases
as you can guess absolutely so it's more
fair place here example a updating like
maybe train time then definitely exactly
exactly it does not support binary
neither so it's really for I mean in
fact in most cases when we need real
time it's just text set up and it just
come from server to the client and on
the other side it can be and all with
post request with simple and classic
post request and so in this use case
first engines are light waves and more
efficient mmm okay and how did you find
it to implement on the customer side
it's incredibly easy to consume you get
service event library in almost every
language you get polyfill to support all
versions or browsers that don't support
service entrance I'm not gonna mention
it we we all know about which one we're
talking and so it's really incredibly
easy to consume you don't have to
reconfigure your process and not belong
to neither which is the main problem
with WebSockets and so yeah it it makes
it really easy to use everywhere and
your mobile application of web
application or even on drums in your
toes yeah that is there make sure you
catch all these so which will be
recorded here its own and because the
pony they say there are a few surprises
yeah drones are always surprised and
impose
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
