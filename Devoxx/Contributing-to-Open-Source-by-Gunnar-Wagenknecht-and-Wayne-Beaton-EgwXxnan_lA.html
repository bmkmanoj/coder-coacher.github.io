Air Force and with today with me is when
beating a very good friend and colleague
looking at the Eclipse Foundation
responsible for open source projects and
we thought it's about time too oh I dia
of this talk today is basically just
help you guys getting started when you
have questions in about contributing to
an open source project so for most
organizations is this on is not on this
is not on so this one okay see there's a
this is a graph or chart made by school
of school of business that was talking
about adoption of open source
technologies most organizations go
through this this pattern where they
start off it start off as an
organization that does not use open
source at least the management doesn't
think so but usually some open source
software is sneaking in at the bottom
and we found and we've experienced this
over over you know quite a number of
years organizations progressing from the
the point of denying that they use open
source right up to the point where
they've made a strategic investment and
it goes through different stages where
we start using open source we start
making minor contributions to open
source projects to actual participation
and open source projects right on to
full ownership of open source project
and leadership is within those projects
and then as I said earlier making a
strategic bet an open source so if you
have products that depend on open source
it is in your strategic best interests
to contribute to those open source
projects and make sure that they stay
viable right so when one thing too that
probably a lot of you already know is
there's many different places out there
in the Internet where opens what
actually happens happens in a way that a
bunch of people collaborate work
together on on a particular open source
projects and those places can be simple
communities which provide nothing but
infrastructure for hosting projects such
as get up for example but tall to be a
foundation like the occult foundation
War II apache software foundation which
not just provide infrastructure but also
provide a process and rules and tools
that help you do open source development
this foundation is another example right
they also help my installation also have
actually developers on staff to work on
open source like on really important
open source project it's open source
does take a number of different forms
the one of the things that we read
eclipse foundation do the apache
foundation does this as well is that
they own the project on behalf of the
community which prevents any single
vendor from from dominating a particular
project that's just one of the factors
to consider when you are considering
doing an engagement an open source I
guess the first thing most obvious thing
is to actually connect with the
community find out where the community
lives and and where they do their
communication and just join in on that
communication that may be in a good hub
repository that may be on a Google
Google Groups mailing list or more
traditional mailing list patching
Eclipse Foundation you have the more
traditional mailing lists for example
but just connect with a community find
out what their values are find out what
their plans are and work out how you can
integrate with those plans and and a
very very first step actually is in
connecting with the community if you if
you help other users that can be users
within your company that can be used
within a local area I user group that
can be used on Stack Overflow on the
forum one of many miss whatever whenever
you have whenever you see cuz like as a
user you started when you start with a
technology with a project with a product
whatever it is you do have questions and
once you gain experience and you
actually have answer to those questions
and by helping others that already is a
very valuable contribution in any open
source project because it helps engaging
and building community
reporting problems is another great way
to started working with an open source
community not a civ user community I'm
familiar most with the Eclipse community
of course out of our massive community
of adopters of the Eclipse IDE
technology only a small fraction of them
actually have opened up or created
accounts and they've created bug reports
trading bug reports is an important part
for any kind of software development and
especially open source if we don't know
about the problems than we we can't
really do anything about it this picture
here is you know if you're reporting a
problem with about with it with the
product that you that you've been
working with being as specific as
possible providing a graphic this case
the the person who created the the bug
report actually drew some arrows on it
too to indicate where you know it help
help the people at triage in the bug
understand what the problem is I'm not
sure that I would have put dolt in the
end if we're up to me I tend to try and
treat the people I'm talking to as
nicely as possible because I like them
to engage not really directly related to
the picture though don't report bugs
over Twitter that's just not useful to
anybody if you're going to report a bug
reporting it through the channels that
the project specifies is going to have
the most likely best results another
thing you can do is like go out to user
groups go to conferences and talk talk
about the project talk about technology
and and it's the same like it's another
extension to the way of helping users is
actually going out and tell others about
the project right and evangelized or or
or spread the word and make sure that
people understood or even be of erica
projects technology how to use it and
how to translate it into the tate
successful products in their companies
or even businesses sometimes
participate in discussions this most
open sources there's lots of different
rules as Gunnar said earlier lots of
different ways that open sores
organizations work generally though
everybody has discussions sometimes well
we have the notions of transparency and
openness and open open source projects
transparency is basically a project team
letting you know what they are doing and
that'sthat's pretty valuable the project
is operating in an open way though they
invite you to participate we at the
Eclipse Foundation Apache foundation is
good at this most of the linux
foundation's projects work like this as
well openness to participation from
others so look for that in a project you
know some projects just aren't
interested in your input and maybe
engaging with them might be a waste of
waste of cycles but certainly try to
participate in those discussions and you
know if again is a good way of knowing
for something worth investing in as if
those discussions work two ways and and
when you get to the point to actually
start contributing code to a project
which is actually which is like another
level on working with open source or
within the open source community is also
be sure to make sure look out for things
like coding conventions or rules or
policies that a project might have said
it's very likely that you can change
code formatting in a specific open
source project with your very first
commit that actually requires the more
heave engagement with the committers and
and some discussions and however it is
possible right the idea want one project
i work with like there were several
contributors showing up and then just
asking if it's possible to change a
setting here or there to make it today
because there are some nails I had some
very good arguments to the project
decided okay let's do it right and
although spotless is always small but
fixes the juju bury you because it keeps
the amount of code change low keep in
mind that when you submit a chunk of
code and its large then the developers
of that project need to have like some
dedicated time that they need to satisfy
two regular code and in order to accept
that it sometimes even developers want
to lie
also what you have some some confidence
and in that it's not just a drop that
you're doing but like also commit on
have an interest and maintaining that
that code or the new functionality right
and sometimes they want they like to
have an opinion uncertainty sign of the
implementation so it's actually quite
good like it was thinking about
contributing a lot of functionality go
out on the mailing list course or the
developer and talk before you start
throwing the code over cuz that's in the
end it might save some time for you oh
and also like the next slide if you're
looking like with the poly libraries
there might be certain IP rights that
you have to certainly if you're
contributing to an open source project
pay attention intellectual property
management how the project takes care of
that sort of thing at a minimum you
probably would be required by a by
project that's thinking about things you
probably require some kind of
contributor agreement where you indicate
what rights you are giving to to use the
code that you contribute something that
a lot of people don't understand or miss
is that very often when you contribute
code you give away your rights to those
contributions not everybody works that
way though eclipse foundation apache
foundation you actually retain the
rights to the contributions you make
your just licensing that code to the
project team to use any way i could talk
a long time about licensing and
intellectual property but i won't do
that and we just keep in mind that
there's probably a process there's
probably some intellectual property
management if there's not then chances
are the project will have some trouble
with commercial adoption or adoption
really by anybody who's cares about
intellectual property management with
that it's think we're just yeah so the
the final advice is just do it you know
if you're interested in contributing to
an open source project gets started good
ones will help you we have a saying at
eclipse kill with kindness if somebody
shows up it's a project teams job to
overwhelm you with help if they don't do
that my email address is wayne and
eclipse.org and I'll sort them out
anyway that's all of our time thank you
for your attention I hope you enjoy the
rest of the conference
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
