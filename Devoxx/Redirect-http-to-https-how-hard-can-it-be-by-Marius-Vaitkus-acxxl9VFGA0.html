when you need to stand with your
microphone and can't say anything okay
so my name is Maris I'm a software
engineer at wigs and today I'm going to
tell you a story about how we did
redirect to HTTPS and how hard can it be
right so for those of you who don't know
us
viscom is a powerful drag-and-drop
website builder and it allows to extend
its core functionalities with various
services and tools and public area of
picks up markets is a place that I
maintained and the place where the story
happens so one day I got an email from
our SEO team and they notice that we are
serving the same content regardless of
which protocol you use and since HTTP
and HTTPS are different protocols bots
would treat that as two different sites
they also mentioned that we might risk
to get a penalty for duplicate content
so we had to fix it generally you do
this by sending a server-side redirect
with status code for your one from HTTP
to HTTPS version of your site you also
ensure that all internal links point to
HTTPS to avoid unnecessary redirects
there might also be a good idea to
implement HSTs policy which protects you
from protocol downgrade attacks but it
only works when your whole site is
migrated to HTTPS which was not the case
and in my case so a couple things come
to my mind at first I thought why not do
that at our load balancer dispatcher
level so the request doesn't even reach
my servers
and that was not possible at that point
of time not everything under wix.com
domain was HTTPS ready and we don't do
custom rules for our maker services and
other things that came to my mind was I
require and not require as a seller
notation that I saw in our library and
most of you are Java developers you know
what a notation is and there is
basically nothing easier than just add a
new notation to an endpoint but I
noticed that it uses wrong status code
302 which is a temporary redirect so
like generally you if you add such a
notation to run point you probably
expect it to be always served in HTTPS
so I thought why not change it permanent
so I go ask around I write in our public
chat and it turns out there is a reason
for that
one thing about 301 and the name
actually states it that it's permanent
redirect so everything in between
like browsers proxies and etc will cache
it and that's a lot of caches that you
don't actually control so if you make a
mistake it's very difficult to reverse
your decision so eventually I decided to
just write playing codes I added it
under a feature toggle so I can safely
test it by myself I released it
I tested on production everything worked
fine so I opened the feature toggle and
I actually even monitored for a while
while doing other stuff but eventually I
went home and it went wrong I come in in
the morning and I see that all our
graphs are red we actually have monitors
in our office that shows the status of
your applications I see a lot of alerts
in my email
and took me actually it took me a while
to understand what happened I obviously
I turned off the feature toggle
immediately everything back went back to
normal and then I went into the request
logs that she to check what was the
reason and they'll use a reason I first
need to explain the rendering sequence
for bots that we had at the time since
our front end was mostly generated by
JavaScript running on a client-side and
many of the bots are not really good we
are not really good at running the
JavaScript we used an external service
called pre-render IO to do the
JavaScript rendering for us it basically
consists of two parts one is the
middleware that you run in your codes
and as a part is search servers which do
the actual rendering so how it typically
works is when search bot hits your end
point this middleware would intercept it
and the request to their service the
service would call us back with original
URL to get a dynamic page they would run
all the JavaScript and then they would
send us a prepared static HTML so we can
proxy it back to bots so what I expected
to happen was as I added the redirects
of real to free all every one redirect
to HTTPS so when a body hits us I
expected it to immediately get a
redirect then call us back on HTTP URL
and usual rendering sequence to a cure
remember me mentioning a feature toggle
so it turns out that our feature toggles
have a flag to tell whether to include
bots or not and that flag is before
it's false by default so another unlucky
coincidence that happened is that that
library didn't consider pre-render as
bots so what actually happened is when a
BOTS
hit an endpoint and a feature toggle
would not let it through the new
functionality it would let it through
the old one and it would call would pass
through two per ender per ender call us
back and we would redirect per ender to
http obviously that's an error per
render doesn't know what to do with
redirect it expects to get 200 so it can
render the page so we put send us an
internal server error which we would
proxy directly back to bots it didn't
take very long for me to fix it it's
just one flag but I think there are a
couple things that we can learn from
this story and I think the first
question that you might ask is why I
didn't notice it immediately and this is
because Sooners might take wild to
manifest in our case per ender actually
has a cache so until that cache expires
see it would just hurt to serve the page
normally and coincidentally that cache
expires at night when I was at home
sleeping you might also ask why I didn't
notice their alerts and it is because if
you get too many of them you just stop
reading them and in our case we made a
mistake previously and BOTS has cached a
lot of non existing pages and every time
someone comes to a non-existing page we
send a 404 and that's
error condition so if enough balls would
hit non-existing pages it would cause an
alert most of the bots actually cleaned
up pretty quickly like in couple months
but there was one boss that was
notoriously bad at this
and it haunted us for almost a year and
he was also hitting us at the point of
the story so we usually got alerts at
least couple times a day when it decided
to refresh its index another thing that
comes to my mind is that not all users
are equal if you have a public web page
it doesn't only get hit by a desktop
browser it might also get hit by website
search engine crawlers scrappers or even
your acceptance testing software and I
was developing a feature that was mostly
geared to search BOTS and even then I
forgot to check whether there is a
feature there is a flag to include bots
in in the future toggle and actually
that flag makes sense like if you are we
are also using the same library for our
a/b testing and usually you do not want
bots to cache pages if you do not know
that there's a winning combination and
other things that you might have noticed
is that my original code was correct and
it was ironically it was trying to be
safe that caused the failure and I'm not
saying that I would not add a feature
like this under a feature toggle but
generally the more complex your solution
is the more space for bugs appear and
and lastly 301 is scary like before
implementing the feature I did a lot of
reading and there are a lot of ways you
can shoot yourself in the foot with it
firstly it's cached basically eternally
by everything by browsers proxies by
design and it requires actually clearing
user browser cache to fix it so believe
me if you made a mistake and asked your
support agents to explain browser cache
clearing sequence to every affected
users they would kill you and I was
actually bitten by this myself I had a
weird router which would redirect me
with 301 to some URL whenever I entered
it psyche and it was really annoying
when I brought a new router which would
give me a 404 whenever I entered the
same IP so I had to use incognito mode
at first to configure it so if you do
need to move a page or do a HTTP HTTP
migration there are a couple of things
that can help you firstly you can set
cache control and/or expires headers so
the response is not cached permanently
or you can use a 302 for testing and
replace it with a 301 later thank you
I think I still have time for questions
it's Riley okay great I can go go and
grab my sandwich</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
