and my name is Marcelo I'm a software
engineer at uber and today we're going
to talk about something we did during
the last year to tackle the problem of
mobile performance at uber and what
means mobile performance at the scale of
ubirr and so first thing I want to ask
is what's mobile performance and I was
looking a lot of different definitions
for this for this talk and and they are
all very interesting but I think that at
the end what we really want to ask is
one simple question that is how well are
we doing in offering the user a pleasant
user experience when you see the app and
then if you look at the data we can see
that there is a strict correlation
between the business metrics and that
performance this is also very intuitive
step it's very easy to see the user that
prefers to use an applet is moot and not
junket which are these the possible app
performance metrics I just put a bunch
of them here so if you user the battery
usage memory usage framerate but also
things like how much does it aim how
much time does it take like to change it
from a state hey to be for example or
like how much the longer takes a certain
piece of code to be executed
specifically about mobile performance
there is a another problem that is about
responsiveness the user touches the
screen and he wants to see a feedback
feedback that is in a certain amount a
specific amount of time so we're a big
company and I just want to simulate an
example there is someone coming and an
only most developer coming and saying
hey my future performs badly it's chunky
and I have no idea why so let's see what
we can do to help this developer and
this is what the Android documentation
says when the user touches a button the
app you tried the dispatches in touch
event to the widget set suppressor state
and then notifies the widget that he
issued the retro itself this is what the
Android Open de Jonge says but let's see
what it means exactly so I just reported
here
is the simple math we want to render
frame happy 16 milliseconds so what that
means is that well that's it we are
rendering the first frame and then we
execute a bunch of work and then at this
point we start to execute a long
operation that takes more than 60
milliseconds for example in this case
were skipping three frames and we draw
another frames some other work frame
work this guy so ideally if you we want
to allow the system to draw a frame
every 16 milliseconds and an avid ease
kind of feeling of like a smoothness
without any junk enos we need to keep
the main thread free and able to draw a
frame every 60 milliseconds
additionally the Android do condition
also says that the user expects a
feedback about after 100 200
milliseconds and this is pretty much one
other example so we needed to show
something after after the user for
example presses a button after 100
milliseconds so what can we do to help
this developer um there are already a
bunch of tools that are out there I just
reported some of them
sighs trace trace view GFX info there is
also a very interesting talk the Google
i/o this year that was talking about
sighs trace it was very very interesting
and why not just use these tools well we
actually do use these tools and and and
we use them to find the issues in the
app but we also wanted to have that was
very important for us as something that
we could use in production and and that
we could use as well in a test
environment so let's see which are the
requirements for this performance
monitoring at scale and what's the scale
of ubirr you better operates in six
hundred cities 24 hour seven variety of
devices network conditions where
multiple apps multiple platforms Android
iOS hundred of Engineers
100 of commits every day this is a very
interesting point because it's almost
impossible that to like check all the
code that is committed
from a performance perspective beside
the code reviews but the most
interesting thing is also that all this
code is for two platforms Android and
iOS so let's talk about some of the
requirements first of all it has to be
easy to integrate ideally should require
minimum possible amount of work
developers want to focus on the features
should be compatible with multiple build
systems this is a very specific thing to
ueber because we migrated from Gradle to
box in the end Road environment so we
needed it to work with both building
systems should gather metrics like the
ones we mentioned before so CPU frame
rate but also measured duration of parts
of the code should be easy to plug a new
metric provider because there could be
some custom metrics to tries it should
have a minimum impact on performance
themselves of course there is always an
impact but we should just want to
minimize it additionally we want to be
able to dynamically decide which parts
of the code to trace and target only the
parts that we need and as well yeah we
want to have this tracing bot from
production and test environment so we
came up with this idea that about what
to do in design for tracing and and we
came up with this a Performance Racing
SDK we nemi did for it let's see how a
bit out these works
so there are two main concepts that also
are two main api one is the tracer that
is able bash it basically to measure the
duration of the two markers between two
marks in the code and the second thing
is that we have monitors monitors are
basically they encapsulate the logic
together a metric like the CPU the
framerate a bunch of requirements about
these ones we want to have an output
interface this is important because we
may want to write to a file or we may
want to make a network requests and this
data or back-end we want to choose which
code should be traded or not at runtime
and we should be able to type of trades
or allowed a tag
to talk to trace and/or load some values
about the mountains that this is there
are some events in the system that are
event based like for example when the
battery changes this is notified to our
broadcast receiver on on Android so
these are event based but there are
other things like for example reading
the CPU usage of the last second for
example we may want to do this every
second look like the frame rate again
that is the same as the tracer we want
an output interface and and then we want
to be able to turn them on and off only
when needed so let's see all the tracer
API work I want to start with the simple
interaction of what we call trace and
what we call span so let's say that each
span basically in this in the slide it
represents a function and we also have
the concept of the parent-child
relationship so alias parent of B&amp;amp;Bs
parent of see often group of spans of
the same sessions simply it's simply
called the trace for us this is the
architecture of the tracer it's it's
fairly simple astral there is the main
entry point that is called the tracer
manager this is initialize it with a
bunch of objects and it creates this
object called span that is what we
defined before and represents the
execution of a function or just the
execution of code between two different
markers there are bunch of the
configuration objects that are needed
and this is because we really wanted to
be able to tune it according to the app
and the use case this is the data flow
we just check if it's enabled you can
expect that there is something that
comes from the back end and say yes
trace or not we call tracer manager dot
start there is a configuration interface
that says hey this is the the span
should I proceed the tracing it so you
can expect also hear something from the
back and the sizes what has to be traced
and what is not let's say yes at this
point we create this span we execute the
code and then we simply call finish and
NM will pass this is a span object to
our interceptors and reporters in the
specific case of the tracer there are
two different traces one is the auto
trader that is used for function tracing
and it's done automatically you don't
need to do anything beside some
configuration we basically automatically
inject some code in some parts of the
app and I'm gonna show how in a bit and
the second part is the man or tracing
that this is more like to trace logical
operations that are not just
self-contained in the function for
example you may want to trace
declaration up for the uber app could be
for example since you call a ride for
example to the state in the app changes
and to receiving the message from the
backend so does it work this bytecode
injection but said that you have a
simple function that is executing some
code it's just for example what could
injection basically with our transform
is basically going to inject an
instruction at the start of the matter
that at the end it simply is called the
start and as arguments which puts a
bunch of specific informations about the
function like the class name the phone
qualified class name the metal signature
and a bunch of other things that are
used to describe the function itself and
at the end we just simply call finish
this is how you basically configure it
it's pretty simple you just needed to
apply the plug-in basically and then you
create this but for a performance config
file we use an external file because we
are also as I was saying before we are
also compatible with the back through ok
back that does basically translation
from the Gradle file to the back
configuration file the manor tracing is
that requires the developers to actually
put these these markers in the code and
then they are also able to such tags or
some log some events and it's pretty
much as it's shown in this slide as I
was saying also there is a we we have
trace of the concept of which functions
are executed as parent and which
functions are the children these done
through something that we call in the
parents Panhandle basically are the way
in which this works is that we have a
simply a thread map and the inside the
thread map basically we keep a stack of
the
and opening the span for that time and
when the span is completed we simply
remove it from the stack this way we are
always able to reconnect the span to the
previous executed one if we log in
console one of these one of these
suspend this is pretty much what we see
so we have an ID an operation name that
is in the case of the auto tracing it's
basically the full qualified class name
and then the metal signature we have a
parent spanner this is this is basically
the ID part into the parent function FXa
sting or otherwise a bunch of tags that
some of them are automatically added um
but it's also possible to set them at
run time other interesting things here
you can also file find it the Java file
name where the what we injected the code
and even the line number for the method
this is useful if you want to like to
reconnect the performance information
back to the file that created that
before what is what this code was
injected and then we have duration and
start time this is how the configuration
in the JSON file is that basically the
main important thing here is that we
define what code we want to trace
basically simply on a set of regular
expression and then we basically
post-process this these we have a
possible compilation step the basically
goes through all the compiled classes
and then if the full qualified the class
name matches the regular expression then
we inject the tracing instruction with
the tag and we then use this tag to
match it back with our back-end
configuration to say turn on and off the
tracing for this piece of code the same
concept is applied for the blacklisting
actually classes well because ideally
you want to avoid the tracing for
example views on Android the whole code
that has to be very performant this is
possible also true annotations so same
thing we can define a tracing strategy
that can be a blacklist or whitelist and
then basically we have this annotation
here do not trace that basically we'll
just say
to the post-processing its prosper
processing step just to skip the method
and then we have these two other
annotations start to spend a stop
spender this is basically a shortcut to
automatically inject a manual span start
and stop as I was saying before we have
also configuration system that says what
can be what should be tracing and what
shouldn't and this is done through two
simple interfaces that can be defined
and the Bible to that they don't know
always returning true here but we can
basically match this class name and
metal names or simply match some tags
that we create at this post process that
the same is valid for them and all types
of configuration so this is the way in
which we basically X estimated the
impact of of the out ferret
basically let's say that you have two
functions for M bar and fool doesn't
know the duration of the performances ck
itself but knows the duration of bar m
bar doesn't know the duration of the
preferences decay again but knows the
duration of itself so if you simply
subtract them and you assume that they
are defined as shown on the right you
basically find the duration of how much
time we spent in the in the infrared and
so this craft version is you can show
that the tracing takes about one
millisecond per method on that twenty
twelve year class device and we use the
Facebook here cause classification that
means that it's a it's a device that in
ten twenty twelve was considered at the
high hand device so the total impact it
can also be to another through the
configuration let's say that in the same
interface I showed before you put a
random and say yeah I just want to trace
one function every hundred every a
thousand everyone ten thousand for
example so think is that um if you trace
all the code and basically you put a
regular expression that says
trace everything the impact can be
noticeable because you're basically
adding one millisecond especially if you
two per method especially if you trace
get there's and setters so getters and
setters are super fast right so for
example they are in the order of a few
microseconds
depending from the device of course but
then we realize that we also wanted to
do
developers I'll tool twist when the
rocket builds and so we created this
thing called the light tracing and this
basically light version that can be
computed through this flag in the
configuration file call it a create
trace file and then we have a build type
that just uses a configuration with this
flag set to true so the light version
basically can be used only for rocket
the backing and what it does is that
skips all the ferret pipeline and print
each span in the logs and then they're
all ready for DZ is quite low and it's a
just a few hundred microseconds so
additionally we wanted to make this very
easy to use so we built on IntelliJ
plugging that reads all this printer
span and then creates a chrome tracing
file that is basically the same
interface of size trace so what you have
at the end is a a local function
profiler but you can see all the
functions being colored here you can see
also see the stack trace basically how
it evolved a short time and then we
combine informations like at the bottom
of this screen for example we attach the
desired emmanuel spans so we see exactly
what code was executed between the man
who spends additionally at the top there
is a day output table monitor we are
going to see in a second but basically
this is one of our indicators for
understanding the app was dropping
frames and in this case we are pushing
some work in a main track so the
application drops enters in something we
call dropping state after skipping a
certain number of consecutive frames and
then recover from the drop in state
after drawing a certain number of
consecutive frames let's see a moment at
the monitor API how do they work
the architecture is similar to the one
of the tracer again here very
configurable and there is a builder will
be set all these objects there and any
not put to generates this monitor
specifically this is data flow again
it's enabled or not then we have a
metric provider that is basically the
main interface that provides the metric
this is a
pasady in the monitor that just
decorates the output of the metric
provider with the bunch of useful
informations like for example the time
since the last gather America or
some other informations and then we pass
these to intercept our reporters so this
is pretty much what's the definition of
a metric provider it has simply a name
that says what's the name of the metric
we're collecting it and then there is an
observable that returns basically all
the measures for this metric
what's the initialization for the
monitors um
this is it basically just five lines and
in the first case we are creating a
framerate
magic provider and then we're saying we
want to repeat it is every second and
this and we are passing some reporters
interfaces and the same for metric
provider we can collect it is every
every second again as you see here there
is also an enable and there is also a
disable method and you can expect again
that the back end is able to turn on and
off this kind of tracing and this is
what magic basically contains and it's
an ID again the name of the metric and
an array of measures for example frame
rate of what was the longest drop
between the different frames send some
tags and then when the metric was
actually measured I was mentioning
before the frame drop monitor that tells
us how much time we spend edging state
and I mentioned this before it's
basically we drop a certain amount of
frame in a temp range and then text the
junk state basically we have to draw
again a certain amount of consecutive
frames
okay how do we visualize this data this
is probably the other half of the
problem because a performance data can
be very interesting but we also need to
represent it in a meaningful way so
there can be that local visualization
that is what we were talking before but
it's more interesting for us to look at
this data in an aggregated way so we can
understand things like for example
suppose that you put a manual span so
two markers in the code this is actually
real use case we have a span this
quality dispatch to a route the duration
and then we say the a at some point that
this duration can't improve the
can we do so we started working on the
code we refactor it and then we started
shipping some some progressive updates
what we saw was that the duration of
this panel was simply going down and
ideally you can expect that there is a
an alerting system that says alien or
now this duration is going up again
should we do something should we
investigate is it why is this happening
this is for example possible usage or
another one that is another real use
case is that we measure for example how
much object we instantiate when the app
gets created and we were checking a can
we improve here what can we do here so
we started checking the memory usage and
then we made some fixes and then at some
point we we basically were able to make
sure that there was a huge improvement
here between the four ten to fifty bar
and and we are now basically able to
make sure that this is always a metric
under our eyes there are other kind of
analysis that you can do especially if
you have more data that comes maybe from
a test environment and so you can
combine for example auto tracing with
manual tracing in this case for example
you can see all the functions that were
executed between the mono traces and
maybe if you're trying to improve a
piece of code and then you have these
mammal trace you can say hey these were
the functions with the where we spend
most of the time maybe on the main track
now
I also wanted to put here an example of
something over the life tracing that was
a talking before because I think it's a
it's very interesting suppose that you
have a very simple application so we
basically initialize this light raising
our monitors and then we say stuff
terminal span this is pretty much an
activity on create so we set a bunch of
things so we're using darker and and
then we are the first layout to change
we said basically we stopped this pan
additionally we have a bunch of other
spans like consume impose in annum
we we have a fab button basically it's a
button that is triggering at two seconds
thread asleep on the main thread and
it's triggered after one second this is
just for an expander
okay let me show you what this looks
like so you can expect it to have
something like this simple app you start
it loading a bunch of images no you
scroll it's fine and now you click on
the fat button at the top and now it's
frozen and it's recovered again
so basically what's broken on the main
site for two seconds so the app is very
smooth but right now is the fully
instrumented with the light tracing and
the impact is not small only according
to the it depends how much code you're
tracing so in the code that should be
tracing is specified in the
configuration file so you can tune it
for the part of the code that you are
investigating so at this point I want to
show you what they produce the trace
okay so for for the example that we run
before this is what the local profiler
gives an out so at the top view of the
frame drop monitor basically this was
when we started the app and okay so this
was an installation and then the app was
starting so basically nothing was a
drone and we were dropping all the
frames here the start you find for
example ok initialize monitor took here
80 milliseconds there were no sub calls
then we called here on create for the
activity here there are a bunch of sub
calls that we can see for example dagger
was injecting some some code and then
this took about one millisecond one
millisecond TM it's fine not that much
some other stuff here occurred and so
this is very interesting because you can
measure the duration of everything you
are injecting through dagger and you can
also see if your accentuate in some
bigger object that is taking too much
time on the top of these I also put this
span this manner span that is AB start
so this is basically starting at the
mark report and then it's stopping here
when bad
layout unchanged at least that was
called okay this is instead adapter so
at this point in the app started and it
started drawing frames we find a bunch
of calls here
it's basically get on it and Count it
was the adapter that was converting the
list of images to basically actually
image view this is the other span we had
activist foreground while we were
scrolling of course the adapter was also
doing the work of banding the view
creating the view if it was necessary at
this point we clicked on that on the on
the fab button and the main trade
basically was stopping for two seconds
so the wall duration of this function is
about two seconds and this is also the
manual span that we appended and then it
recovered and start the drawing again
and then we basically close it the app
and the activity for Gramps when it was
created so these are very interesting
too you can basically configure it if
you want to trace for example dagger if
you want to trace I know any other
library and all simply if you won't
understand a very specific part of your
code at this point um so we are moving a
tower the open sourcing all this part
favorite and just let's say that there
is still the same anonymous developer I
wants to use for it in this application
and basically we were working on it and
we are aiming to open sources in the in
the next coming months and this it this
is what I wanted to talk about is there
any question
okay cool thank you for the attention
then and I hope you will use it as soon
as we open source it thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
