have sound that's where we all know we
okay cool so the first thing I'm gonna
ask is in most of you have kindly done
this but this is meant to be an
interactive panel with people from the
audience because this is about you
asking these fine people lots of
questions and getting open and honest
answers from vendors yeah it's a thing
what happened today I won't it yes this
is good
excellent so um if you really do have
questions especially if you have
questions can you please move more
closely to the front because then it's
easier for me to shuttle back and forth
so by way of quick introduction my name
is Martin Verburg I'm the diabolical
developer and I'm moderating today's
panel on the future of Java EE as it
moves to the brave new world of a
foundation in eclipse where it has the
eclipse project name of Eclipse
Enterprise Java I think that's correct
but we will may be naming one of these
things we'll get to discuss over time so
I'll let the panel introduce themselves
as they go along and I'll start with you
David fu Confucius hello I'm David Alaba
see I work at Oracle in the organization
that is responsible for Java EE and
other technologies but here I'm really
representing the Java jörg of Oracle
can you switch to a handheld mic is this
all ah
so I'm steeple I work for IBM I'm a run
times developer advocate but I'm
standing in for Kevin SATA who is the
IBM rep on the PMC I think yeah ok so
I'm IRA grants that I work for a
consulting company in Sweden called
Cybercom but here I'm representing yeah
I guess both sides sorrow because I'm
with the JSP and also it's in the
Eclipse Foundation PMC for Virginia no
if I was actually the chair of the PMC
for this grand new project so he is the
benevolent dictator for a short amount
of time yeah my name's Mike Croft I work
in the support team for payara
I am Roberto Cortez I work for Tommy try
when we do support Tommy as the
application server I'm Dimitri some
rallies and I'm the engineering manager
of the Red Hat JBoss Enterprise
Application Server product in the
wildfly swarm community project well
very cool so who here in the room is not
here for Java EE so your run here
actually knows what Java EE and is here
photography just just I just wanted to
check this is this is good so questions
from the audience do we have any early
questions about Java EE moving to
eclipse and what this all means yes we
have one - we'll start with you first
okay so the question is how are
proposals and how is the development
process of the future of Java EE going
to work in this new foundation who wants
to go first well I think I can go as far
as we know I think that's not really
decided yet I mean here as it's a
community we have the power now to
decide that we you can evenly even be
the JCP but you can be something
completely different so you as a
community you now have the power to
actually influence how the process is
going to be decided so join join the
mailing list discuss that that's gonna
be there's there's a discussion around
that at the moment so you can definitely
influence how you want to move things
forward
yeah I agree so everything has to be
discussed and one of the thing that we
need to make sure is that we need to
improve the existing process because for
example one of the issue that we have
with Java is that we have just finalized
e8 and if you look back July 7 was
finalized four years before so I mean as
we go we have to define those new
process so basically we will evolve the
platform within the forge a project but
we need to make sure that we improve
those pros those process
okay so the question of who audiences is
the focus still going to be on providing
some sort of an overriding platform as
an let's call it a Java EE 9 spit
overriding specification or will the
focus be more on just improving or
adding new individual specifications
that people can just cherry pickers as
they wish
yeah I would just make a command I would
rather call that a 4j 1.0 yes apologies
yes so everything is up to discussion
the thing that we know is that that e4j
1.0 will have to be compatible with Java
8 and then we'll start it from there so
we will basically evolved that Java 8
compatible platform to something that we
all agree you can for example look at
how they eclipse micro profile is doing
right now and yeah you can kind of if
you're running open Liberty you can
configure 8 to run micro profile version
1 or 2 for example or you can
cherry-pick the config API and only run
that one so we were able to do that kind
of thing
but it's up for discussion and the
interesting bit is whether this would
make a compliant you know runtime
because now the current rules you cannot
you have to provide the whole thing so
that's it very good you know question
for the community yeah I think that's
gonna be the big debate so the
interesting thing you having worked I
also work in the market profile project
the interesting thing with with that
I've seen is that people have just
decided we now have three interesting
things and all the vendors kind of get
bigger on the mailing list and say you
know what that sounds like a 1.2 release
let's call that work profile 1.0 and
let's just go on and build the next
things and it's a much more rapidly
evolving way of releasing enterprise
software as it were it's always
following the new open JDK release
cadence there every six months whatever
is ready will go into the release and I
perhaps I Pepsi lessons being learned
from it and being being applied in this
case that's where the community seems to
want to go so far but there's people
from engine already join the mailing
list and definitely have your say
because it's it's it's definitely now's
the time next month or so especially
say I think there's a question here
first one yes so Oracle support of e4j
will they give the same level of our
contrition as I have on the Java EE will
be less will be more it should be less
because if you look today I mean all the
spec but three are driven by Oracle so I
mean the one of the things that we are
doing by moving Java II to the Eclipse
Foundation is that we want to encourage
others to contribute to the overall
evolutions to the platform a good
example would be payara for example so
payara is based on GlassFish but for
some reason they come to they contribute
back to the switch itself by moving
everything to forge a fire will be able
to actively contribute to the reference
implementation of e4j so what we hope at
the end of the day is that we have we
will have more contributor contributing
to the platform than we have today but
no in total I mean it so one of the
things that we have been critical
critics eyes in the past was well until
Java 8 is that basically Oracle was
driving the platform and it's kind of
true because I mean we are the spec need
of the Java 8 umbrella specification and
we are the spec leads of all the
specification but three cgi-bin
validation and j-bot and hopefully by
opening the platform more people will be
able to contribute while also lead part
of the platform and I mean the overall
reaction that we have is for so pious
clearly said that there they are willing
to contribute Tomy tribe has also said
that read at IBM also so at the end of
the day we hope to have more
contributors working on the platform you
just when it's a add a comment from
virus protective on that is the
absolutely with empower we're already
making plans on how we can contribute to
evj we don't see it so much as our call
kind of like removing support as much as
kind of the rest of us joining in more
so there were kind of a few lot of
technical things that were preventing us
from going through the JCP pirates
obviously already members of the eclipse
foundation with our involvement with my
profile so joining in with e4j is really
really easy for us and we're really
excited to be part of the future of it
so yeah I think it's it's going to be
very interesting to see how not just you
know us as vendors but obviously Ivor is
here kind of representing that the
community that if the Eclipse micro
profile is anything to go by it's gonna
be interesting to see how community and
individual efforts contribute to that as
well and maybe even other organizations
that haven't been involved with jari in
the past
thank you I'd say if you look at the
chart behind it's like you really does
say what we're trying to do which is get
things more nimble and more flexible so
I think you know IBM's really behind
that sort of change so everybody
everybody has stuff that they want to
contribute and the old process is you
know you can get in the way the new ways
of doing business the new new open
source approaches anything we all
benefit when there and we are naughty
did we benefit from a business point of
view as a community we benefit because
we can make things happen faster and get
things out so you know I think that's
what we really want to do it as well I
had one little extra point to that this
is one of the unusual times where you
yourselves as end-users of Java EE like
technologies with it moving to the
Eclipse Foundation that's a time where
you as an individual but also you as a
representative of whatever company you
work for
now really having in have an opportunity
to actually influence and contribute
back so after this discussion when you
join the mailing list another thing
worth doing is actually making a note to
yourself to go talk to the bosses talk
to the powers that be back in your
company and say hey look we can actually
start contributing directly to the
technologies that we rely on and I'll
personally love to see you know day to
day businesses is that were joining this
effort so instead of it just being
mainly vendors plus a few individual
community members actually have the end
users the organizations as well as
people come and join the effort and
we've seen a smattering of that already
start to happen with micro profile and
I'm hoping to see that more as well
more questions so what the timelines
have any any hard dates been set yet
where we need to make a decision X bye
can I get this if I'll go statement
that's a very good question basically
what is our roadmap so we are not really
talking in terms of deadlines because
right now we have a lot of work in front
of us basically we have to move
everything that is written by Oracle on
the Eclipse Foundation site so that's
basically moving open source project
which is in itself already well it's not
that easy but we also have to move the D
CK which are not open source today so I
think that it's better to talk about
milestone instead of deadline so the
first important milestone to me would be
to have some repo on the Eclipse
Foundation side so some repo like for
example one of the report that we would
like to move quickly is Jersey and
jax-rs
so one we will have a few repo that who
that would already be a first milestone
but the big milestone would be to have
that 1.0 e for J bits that would pass
the GK Andriy for J side now when it
will happen
we don't know next year but when exactly
it's hard to set this stage because we
still have a lot of things to do to get
there yes just to clarify that little
bit that first milestone about a release
is really taking the existing Java EE 8
as it is today which was partly closed
source and partly control Lib Lib Oracle
open sourcing that completely in
ensuring that that still passes the TC
case so that it is exactly the
equivalent as far as compatibility as
concerned as Java EE 8 that there will
be the first release and only then I
think we start moving forwards building
new things basically
for the questions
okay so we for J this is not verses but
in comparison to market profile what's
the story there
so I think that is also something that
is up for a discussion right now you may
see a clip micro profile as kind of an
incubator for technologists that are it
could be standardized for EJ but you can
also see them as as part of the the big
platform the same platform so so that's
kind of up to to the marketer to and the
vendors to decide I think and and I
would like to see Eclipse micro profile
not to be like only a playground or
sandbox to test out new technologies it
should be that as well but I also see
Micra profile is actually a something
you can run in production so so it
shouldn't be like just a toy but that's
more marketing I think you wanted to add
that obviously we've already seen the
microphone file config API that I've
mentioned earlier is already a jsr
submitted by David wasn't it that kind
of submit that a long ways I think Kevin
and John Klingon from Red Hat so in that
sense you know that this already Mike
profile technologies that are feeding
into currently through the JCP to e4j
but I think the only reason for that is
because there's so much eclipse the
process to set up to begin with I
personally see that the two projects can
exist very happily side-by-side I think
they are really complementary but yeah
like I said I think what we've got
already with micro profile is something
that can be considered for production
and I think it's really important that
that does stay the key focus of it that
is something that's really usable and
reliable yeah so I think we can find a
couple of synergies between a micro
profile in the so if you look into who's
involved in micro profile and the
when there's pretty much two are the
same people right so we don't I don't
think we want to turn these in to
complete two different projects you want
to use signatures between of that
between them and I also pick an example
of the micro profile security spec that
Tommy Turner I've also contributed
heavily in there so if you look into
security which is a super big thing in
today's world if you take the security
on the Java platform at the moment it's
not really a modern thing that you can
use in your everyday project so the
micro profile security is back actually
came and modernize a little bit the
security piece and hopefully that will
make it into the into the East back as
well right and just finish up think
about ie micro profile brand I think it
will be a very strong brand if you come
up with something like that there's
always the you know the balance to hit
like how soon to standard.i something
versus how long you can wait so
personally I think it's a great effort
to have this cubital project and
astronaut we see it proves itself it's
it's easy to bring back the specs back
in IE and I think people should be you
know impressed by the speed that micro
profile went forward and within the last
like six months we are like you know
three iterations so that's super fast in
you know in whatever the community has
done all this time so I really feel this
is some sort of you know cloud profile
missing from EE I'm not sure if would be
called micro profile or something else
but yeah I think we have to do but also
it also happened that the two project
are hosted at the Eclipse Foundation so
it would make sense to find synergy
between the two projects over time
I mean collaboration will be king yeah
so I mean just practically the teams
that are working on a a and market
profile are the same sorts of people
they're working on the same technologies
you know yeah there's just one player a
missing on the microphone fight side
but you know from our development point
of view there's like all these two teams
that compete to each other it's the same
people going to the same buildings and
they just working on two different
variations or the same variations and as
you said the fact they're all the same
the same place makes it just so much
better to get things done you know it's
just I think this is a really exciting
thing for a ye and from mica profile to
to you know to move everything forward
much faster than we've managed to
achieve before so I think you know it's
a really good thing for us cool
exhibition so I think the people over
here we're next there I think then
there's another back there yes yes you
question is why why the Eclipse
Foundation as opposed to say Apache or
something else okay so well without
going through all the details so we have
discussed with three foundation in fact
Eclipse Apache and the Linux Foundation
and at the end we have decided to go to
the Eclipse Foundation it was not just
Oracle at that time IBM and reddit were
also involved in the in those discussion
for different reason one is that we
think that keeps foundation is more Java
friendly than others foundation so that
was one thing to micro profile so Mac as
we said I mean we hope to see synergies
between the macro profile project and
e4j so the fact that Eclipse already had
micro profile makes sense and also we
wanted to leverage the experience from
reddit and IBM because they went through
all the process of creating a project at
the Eclipse Foundation so that was one
argument then if you look at Java EE we
already have two project which are all
stated on the Eclipse IDE that is
Eclipse link the GP a reference
implementation and Jason Jason B
reference implementation and then also
just the fact that the Eclipse
Foundation was very proactive in
welcoming us I mean even before we
reached and we reached out to the
different foundation the Eclipse
Foundation was already publicly saying
that they would welcome the Java project
so I mean we want to make sure that we
have everything set in place to make
sure that the e4 j project is successful
so at the end of the day we have done an
assessment of different criteria I've
mentioned a few and we think that the
Eclipse Foundation was the was the right
place for moving forward
I had one other small thing to that oh
when I think I said on the JCP Executive
Committee for a long time and its
primary concern is worrying about
intellectual property and the flows of
how intellectual property go so and this
is to avoid patent Wars and all that
sort of stuff and the Eclipse Foundation
probably has out of the Foundation's one
of the more rigorous processes
managing IP flow and things so I think
for my mind I knew they were going to be
extremely careful when they took on the
vast body of work which is Java e8 today
and make sure that whatever came in will
squeaky clean and will be squeaky clean
going forwards and that just lessens the
risk in the industry for all of us that
that we would have you know sort of
patent trolls and the like okay so I
think I'll paraphrase your question do
you think e e4 j will will have as a
goal a more tighter integration between
the individual pieces of technology that
make up say a EE 4j 1.5 release for
example yeah so faster directly the
question about CVI and HIV
so Tommy tribe is very interested in
leading the HIV back over the Eclipse
Foundation
maybe with reservoir mine as well as
another lead for that speck and we
believe so we have we have done a lot of
work on the HIV specially with the open
HIV and I've is doing that work but the
idea is that we want to strip HIV of all
the other stuff that's out there and put
it in CDI so for instance one of one of
the reasons why people still use a GPS
because timer service right is not on
CDI so we want to extract that we have
done that that worked in the past races
with transactional right so
transactional is his own spec so we look
into I mean HIV it separates back right
but at this time I think we probably the
idea will be to strip it out and put it
on CBI and then
keep evolving cd-i to make it like the
glue on all the other specs and I have
to say congratulations to read that
because they've been doing a terrific
job running the CDI spec and maybe
because also it has like very open
governance model it's been one of the
most active specs out there Antoine is
here
no but basically so the fact that we are
redefining the rules will allow us to
make those kind of change in a very
rapid fashion cool there's a question
hanging here slightly pivotal question
does off piece a little bit so for the
existing application server vendors how
are you planning on keeping up to date
with the new open JDK release cycle of
six months and the LTS stuff and on
offer an EE for Jaylyn taught us as well
how do you think you're going to keep up
with what what's going to look like to
be a much more rapidly evolving set of
specifications suppose this is also a
question for the e4j group because now
the spec says you know e 7 requires you
know e 8 or higher and it brings very
interesting problems because you know
you may plan your next release to be you
know in march and by the time works
comes with no Java 9 anymore right so I
don't have a good answer really so so
well so if we look so today we have Java
8 Java 8 is officially supported on a CI
10 plus it's done up to the vendor to
decide so WebLogic will support java c 8
but at the time it will support sorry
java WebLogic will support next year e 8
at that time
we'll also support a c9 now if we make
some projection on the e4 j side we
should do the distinction between the
project itself and then the supported
product that will come from that project
and it will be then up to the vendor to
decide which version they will support
the thing is that given that we will be
in a better shape to evolve more quickly
I think that it's fair to say that if 4j
will also follow more closely the
evolution of the on the GDK side so we
will be able to adopt more rapidly and
follow what what is done on the AC side
which has been an issue for now I mean
we have just released it eight at the
same time basically of asinine but then
if we're talking about the commercial
supported product it will be up to the
vendor to decide exactly what their
policy will be yes so for for us Tommy
tribe I mean we haven't really discussed
that but since we are still an
open-source project it will be a
community decision right so I think
that's something that if you're I'm not
sure are your itami users sir no okay
but I was I will I will suggest to you
well I will do it myself
to send will send just an email about
that to the our mailing list and we'll
discuss it openly as we always do and
we'll definitely reach out to decision
about that yep
from my perspective I work on the
support team so I'm in contact with all
our customers and we've already had
quite a few questions on the future of
Java and how it relates to payara
we've got a Support Lifecycle on our
website obviously as an open source
project the only income that we get from
support so this kind of thing is really
critical for us we we've committed to a
ten years fort life cycle but just to
kind of like bring things from more
towards EVGA we've said already that
Paillard intends to contribute to EF ej
i didn't want to make it clear that our
intention is to contribute in that sense
into GlassFish
the reference implementation we've got
no plans to kind of push our
contributions through payara because we
think it's kinda it's more appropriate
to do those things in GlassFish which is
more neutral and it's more open and for
the community really it's not something
that we want to make direct money off so
our PI our efforts will be separate but
obviously in that we do have such a
large shared code base with GlassFish
obviously that is going to make things a
little bit easier for us in that
Confucian to evj will also help our own
product but that's just the way that
things go so from IBM point of view we
have a full stack so we have vm up so
our support model will be really what
our customers decide they want so
ideally the support model will be as
close to whatever we're getting out of
the open source projects but if at any
point we've got customers you want
support for something for longer then
then that's what we'll do and it'll be
driven by business and market forces
obviously as much as possible any
changes that come through those things
go back into the code bases so a lot of
it will be driven by how amenable open
source projects are to taking fixes for
things that they don't you know which
are they're not old streams and things
like that and that's just business as
usual really but from an IBM point of
view it's driven really bore what our
customers want and I don't think we see
any any particular challenges cool
question so you can get you can speak as
Mike what we're recording okay yeah
having made a large initial investment
of time and code I find myself kind of
at the back door of micro profile at the
moment diversity seems to be lacking due
to resources of individual companies and
commitment we can provide I really like
IBM so don't take this as any any kind
of negative thing at all I'm friends
with many other guys at IBM
however IBM do seem to be dominating
much of the effort at the moment because
of the vast resources that they have to
contribute to that effort I'm speaking
not on a Tomi tribe level I'm speaking
for Tommy Apache Tommy as an open source
developer in my own free time rather
than a developer Tommy we're not a
traditional competitor of IBM yes you
could consider it a competitor of IBM
and however where we feel that were
worthy contributor to the EE ecosphere
and have been for well over a decade
this includes companies that Mike works
for like payara I see ourselves as all
good friends so here's the question
there are many beneficiaries of EE is
there a will to draw them into the EE 4j
eco sphere and allow for resources
leading to better diversity within the
EE and micro profile that goes be one of
the longest Christians we've had it so
good
anyone want to take that one first
sure it the IB representative so did you
are you asking for people to make space
for other people to contribute
okay okay so I get the point so it's
like the big guys have all the money
they talk to each other they have their
influence and they make it and they make
things happen and that's that's true to
a lot and many of these things I think
many of us on this side would be going
we really would like more people to
participate right so in terms of it's
not just we would like to participate in
the coding because that would be really
cool but I think your question is also
how would you get a seat at the big
table and I think one of the ways that
we send that work are things like what
maher zain tape with the ljc getting
onto the JCP process it's like all
getting organized and getting enough of
you represented so that you can have a
voice I think individuals it can be
quite hard but if you can get a group of
people together I think it's not not at
all impossible
I'm a bit surprised actually because
even big large organizations you know
they may have resources but they do many
things also so I would expect that
actually you know they would be happy to
you know share and give others
opportunity to to participate right and
I and I would really think that you know
people if they still give value into you
know EE and all the benefits and brings
you know portability and stuff you know
they should step up so I really see yeah
yeah but but I I think there's a vast
need for specs people to run specs to
participate and I think there is space
for for everyone really well I think
that first of all have to create
awareness of what was happening with all
these projects look at how many people
have in this room I don't know maybe 50
so like I have a session like a couple
of days ago and I asked how many people
are using spring and pretty much every
people every person in the room raise
their hand and then I asked you who was
using Java or micro profile like ten
people over there right so we did lose a
lot of other developers or projects -
I'm not and I'm not bashing spring
anyway I love their work and they turn a
tremendous amount of cool the coolest
things over there but that's natural
right so Java is being stuck over the
last six seven or eight years we haven't
done anything cool we haven't done
anything new we haven't even been
following the latest trends so people
moved on to - to - to other projects so
now it's the time that we have to raise
all the awareness and try to bring all
these people back and try to revitalize
the community and I think that that
maybe maybe that's the answer that we
need so we're seeing less people and
nice people and you have all these big
companies throwing the resources and we
don't see other resources because they
they are another things right but maybe
if they understand that they now can
change stuff and they can make some
things better maybe they'll return you
don't know but but also to your point so
because we are always discussing this in
the in the Java context that if you look
at Java it's basically a set of API and
technologies and for example how many
people are using jax-rs outside of Java
EE so e4j en will also impact obviously
jax-rs al jax-rs will evolve out the
servlet api we live all our GPA will
evolve and so on and there are a lot of
people that are consuming all those api
outside of the pure java ee programming
model so it will also impact those
person to you know I just wanted to kind
of call back to something that that
Martin said in actually a while ago is
that now that we're in kind of going
towards the Eclipse Foundation the the
rules for kind of collaborating have
changed a lot and there is now this kind
of whole new opportunity actually for
people who work as users of the
technology but who you know have this
substantial investment whether it's
through consulting or through kind of
selling some other business on it can
actually then say well you know maybe we
dedicate someone to this project maybe
for however much time is it's kind of
commercially feasible I'll see you for
it for us in payara we kind of know all
too well like kind of the pressures of
you need to kind of contribute to open
source and do things kind of for free
and in the open but then someone needs
to pay for it someone need to pay for
the time so whether it's some of the
guys that stand-in up here or if it's
some other kind of benefactor from the
company for from other companies that
are users of Java EE it would be
fantastic to see some kind of investment
- maybe the sponsor specific people so
it it would be great to see but yeah I
guess it's there's a long road ahead
still it's actually a really good point
for me coming from a consulting company
it's - convinced like like companies
like like the one I work for and other
similar companies to contribute to open
source is kind of you have to educate
these companies
so they see that by influencing the
technology we are offering to our
customers we are actually experts on
that technology and we can show it but
by controlling the open source we show
that we are good citizens in the
ecosystem and we know what we're doing
and we're not selling technology that we
can't fix so getting that kind of a
mindset into other kind of company we
can have contributions just add like
something that I think that's a little
bit important which is if you look on
the the the model the government small
that we have the Charlie before and this
is not bashing Oracle in any way at
least not trying but it wasn't one of
these fundamental flaw so basically you
will participate in an expert group you
will provide all you are T and then
Oracle will keep their IP and will
listen to you with the TCK so basically
you were giving your work away
so the norica will pay will charge you
for using your own work right so what
will be your your will to actually do
something over there right so that's why
I gave like the example of CDI which was
like an open spec over there and you
could use it and you can contribute to
it very easily like invalidation or bad
shoot or also open implementations and
have open TCK that you can use and
contribute to them and and i think there
is a hidden cost that people don't
really realize is i you know if you go
the technologies available now they're
like maybe 300 most of them open source
you can use and people use them and
build their own custom stacks and they
get stuck right and and at some point
they will realize you know now they have
to rewrite their applications to use
something else so that's the
fundamentally the value of Java EE right
so either you pay for it upfront or
later so so there you go you know that's
your chance to to lower your costs in
the long term thank you can I can I just
get back though but the question was
really about getting
other people to participate beyond just
the large corporations and I say I agree
we had challenges with that with the JCP
process and getting small small
individual people to come through and
get things going but I think with things
like eclipse it's so much easier for
people to participate so I you know I
can point a different runtime the
ecosystems like node and others where
there's a much more flat involvement you
know people just come along and they own
little bits and pieces and that's seem
to be okay with Java that's not this
always been hard to do but with
something like eclipse where it is much
more of a sort of a really developer
driven community I think there's a lot
more opportunity for people to get
involved in and have their voice heard
so you know I think what going to
eclipse is the right thing to give that
sort of Cape that also the option to
people yeah there are a lot of
protections under the Eclipse Foundation
rules it's why they have things like the
PMC's and the structures and the
foundations in place there - - to
automatically level the playing ground I
think it really does stop a single
vendor or a single entity from
dominating any Eclipse project or any
Apache project for example in a negative
way so there is there are some
protection and built at eclipse and I
have one of a curious question I'd like
to ask the audience so we at the London
Java community considering to raise a
Kickstarter campaign to actually fund
several full-time engineers to work on
community projects like EE 4j or perhaps
openjdk itself where perhaps smaller
individuals and smaller companies can
actually contribute what they can
actually contribute because they're not
they don't all have have deep pockets
but then as a combination as you
mentioned before Steve getting a group
of people together to then hire some of
these engineers some hire some was
engineering talent that they would need
so our last two questions as an
individual just as an individual person
would you donate a small amount to a
crowdfunding campaign in order to have a
couple of Engineers hired to help push
EE for Jay for it says I mean
individually contribute - okay so it's a
sweet home out how about do you think
the organizations that you work for as
on these larger engine users with
via consultancy or something else do you
think they would contribute say a
slightly larger amount call it 500 euros
a year or something to be able to have
that sort of direct coding influence
okay that's that's really interesting so
I think this might be another
interesting area to explore and I think
that's something we'll do through the
virtual Java user group and the Java
champions and the wider community and
that may give a lot of the individuals
who really want to have that influence
at you till you talk about and actually
they can have you know a full-time
employee effectively that they represent
it represents them so that might be
another interesting thing to try as well
so if the thing thanks that was just
useful feedback I'm just a small note
over there and so look for instance on
the j-unit project right they had a
crowdfunding campaign so they could move
the unit forward with all the new stuff
I mean a unit is some-some everyone so
everyone here's used a unit right pretty
much all the room
so whoever 2008 to J unit before one
person two persons three persons are not
a bad actually
but still it was like a project it was
really requiring some new stuff and we
came up with edited they came up with
these sounds campaign to do it so maybe
other projects actually required it as
well and it worked very well I think
yeah it it yeah I think they got the
equivalent of about two or three
full-time engineers for a year through
that Kickstarter campaign so it's really
good cool I think we've got seven
minutes left so probably time for one or
two more questions depending on how deep
the question goes question so will the
move to EE for Jay in being under the
Eclipse Foundation have an impact on the
Java X package names which
understandably a lot of us rely on today
okay for the existing specs no they will
keep their Java X package names for new
specs if they go through the JCB
they can use gelwix function names if
specifications go without going through
the J's be they have to have something
else do you want to have something
I can add one tiny bit to that minor my
understanding is that minor extensions
to existing technologies that have the
Java rec space so some bug fixes to say
servlet etc or even even a minor
enhancements server would still be
allowed to use Java and let's see
intention as my understanding it's only
if something completely new gets created
that will have to have well whatever we
decide to call it does that sound right
David from Newell perspective yeah yeah
yeah cool question here
excellent so the question there is under
leaf adjey is there the possibility that
the existing CDI technology could be
split up moved into smaller
specifications or pieces of technology
and and therefore even perhaps help
encourage pivotal to come and join the
party I suppose we could I mean there
were already some steps to split CDI in
different levels you know base C etc so
technically it's possible yeah yeah so
the specification CDI to husband's
modular right so we have CDI Corsi I for
Java C and based on that CDI for Java e
so that's the first step and then
obviously I will evolve maybe towards
that model where would we really have
multiple spec instead of one spec which
has been model arised is something that
that will have to be discussed so we've
actually four minutes left so what I
will do is I'll actually like to kind of
get our final wrap-up statement from
each of the panelists that perhaps what
they think is the most important thing
that you can do next or what they what
they're excited about let's just have a
free-for-all and see where this goes
so I'll start at the far end with with
Red Hat okay well I guess the message is
participate you know the barrier to
entry is getting very low you know
everyone will have access to tcks
mailing lists etc so I think that's
that's your chance to prove you you like
you still like EE and I find the name
very cool because you can read it
backwards yeah I think that issue if the
definitely interested should join the
discussion join the mailing list on the
eclipse foundation search for whatever
spec you're interested in look what the
guys are doing over there and if you
have any ideas just collaborate with
them send the ideas
and see if you can help them out yeah
can you say that payara is a company is
feeling really positive about the move
we think it's great we're really
optimistic about helping out and
personally I would like to say that I
think from the Eclipse micro far we've
seen a lot of really really great
efforts from everyone from from
communities and and vendors I think it's
a great template for how Eva J can move
forward and yeah I think I'm really
optimistic about the future for both my
profile and evj yeah I can just add to
that as well I think this is a great
opportunity for us to to step up and do
something great from an already great
platform we shouldn't forget that Java
EE 8 is a excellent platform today and
the year for J 1 or 0 will be the
exactly the same platform and we can
just make it even better from there so
yeah I'd say definitely contribute the
other thing is don't panic
he's just moving house it's going to a
nice house it's bigger house it's closer
to the shops you know you can get more
involved with it but we're very positive
about it we think it's a really great
thing to do so I think the big takeaway
for me is is go away knowing that
there's some good things happening and
yeah we're gonna have a transition
period but it's all for the right
reasons and it's the end of it we're
gonna I think really made really amazing
so I think that we are basically trying
to put everything in place to make sure
that the platform can stay relevant for
the next 10 to 15 years now something
that obviously we need your help but
something that we need shorten also from
you is a bit of patience because I told
you that we have a lot of work that
we're tackling right now on the legal
side on the Oracle legal side and on the
Eclipse legal side so I mean we can't I
mean that's something that we have to go
through so it takes times and the next
milestone is when we will have some repo
up on the Eclipse side and we see what
we all want to have is the 1.0 that will
pass the ie8 TCK so everything on the
eclipse ide that would be really no
matter of my
still want to live so speaking from me
so the London Java community joined the
JCP we got a seat on the executive
committee with a single mandate from our
users get Java open all of it right from
java ee ee to a me so Java EE being
opened up by Oracle is one of the most
amazing things I've seen happen in the
industry and Oracle should be lauded for
it and I think we should take this
opportunity and run with it before
someone takes our toys away so I'd like
to just give a round of applause to all
of our panelists and thank you for the
great question from the audience as well
and I'm sure you can catch that
afterwards as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
