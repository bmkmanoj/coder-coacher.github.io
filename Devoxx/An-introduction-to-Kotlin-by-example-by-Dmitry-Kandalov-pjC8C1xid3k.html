this is introduction to cotton by
example my name is Dmitry I'm a software
developer I've been working with Java
Indian languages last 10 years so mostly
for banks I'm not affiliated with
JetBrains so I can see whatever I want
and I assume everything I show is
downloadable from this Dropbox link so
you don't need to write it down if you
want to take photos already there you
can download it now and see what's
coming so I assume everyone in this room
know what Java is and of course the
answer which is an island and to zoom in
in unto the island it's quite big and as
a joke there is Java see my kind of nice
photos from there so not all of it is so
nice with very nice places obviously on
Java or something like this so similarly
you can guess what colonies and answer
it is an island and zooming in again is
in Ireland
waitwait smaller an island under st.
Petersburg so looks something like this
I've never been there but it's much
easier to get there I think then like
probably clips from London so in reality
cotton is a programming language
statically typed pragmatic and it
currently compiles into JVM and
JavaScript so it's officially supported
released support to JavaScript so
stereotypes should be obvious what it
means pragmatic it means that it wasn't
built within experimental features so it
was designed to be interoperable with
Java
embeddable existing code bases and like
used in production as I mentioned it
currently compiles to JDM in JavaScript
platforms and there is experimental
coupling native so to open source Apache
2 license it's in github you can
contribute to but in relative
JetBrains employees few developers
this is a graph showing history of the
needs for Kotlin project so I downloaded
cloned it from github ran some analysis
on it so vertical wine is amount of
commits per month for Kotlin and
horizontal line is time so it starts in
2011 so even though it seems like a new
language it actually existed for six
years before release wine was published
and this is unlike JavaScript which
allegedly was designed in two weeks to
like six years forgotten to get it right
then they broke backwards compatibility
keeping only the features which are
useful and that which they were
confident are useful and then they
released version 1 from which that they
support backward compatibility so this
was last year this year it was caught in
one point one place so overall it's
about 20 to 30 people working on it so
it's not a huge project I mean in terms
of less amount of developers this might
be a good thing so obvious question why
not Java so like to decide if you like
love Java and you have no problems with
it then definitely use Java but other
than that is just Java is a bit old and
it's difficult to change my favorite
example is semicolons I think the last
Java one there was a question to Java
architects are they any plans to make
cynical and optional in Java and the
answer was like technically it's doable
but in practice we have so many things
to do other than semicolons so in
reality it's not going to happen ever so
we start with semicolons in JavaScript
like through the real example there are
other things which are difficult to
change so why not Scala is because
arguably Scala went too far and it's now
too complex already it's going to find
when you do use simple project but when
it's like 100 people working for 10
years and then you look at what they've
done and there is no single person who
really understands the whole application
then it's going be really complex
working with languages like Scala this
is like that the biggest arguments
against color and why not groovy the
problem with groovy is that it's
dynamically typed it has optional times
that do not very strict so again on huge
projects is probably not so good
and why would you Scotland there are
certain things which do not exist in
Cortland gluttonous disease in other
languages for example nullable types and
I'll show it later so this was like
quick introduction now now I'm going to
do demo like with life coding so it will
be some examples it will be flow build
factorial and code cutter and the reason
I'm doing examples with instead of
slides because I think it shows just to
show how it actually works like actual
workflow on your daily basis rather than
just some code hopefully it all will
make sense if you want me to like you
have a question just give a shout if you
want me to type some codes to see how it
works also just just in France so here
we have this is intelligent presentation
mode and this is hello world so if I run
it now it will bring Scoville
so here the Cintas fund is keyword in
Cortlandt which means this is a function
declaration then we have function name
takes arguments and after column you
have type of the argument and this is
the return type of the function this is
unit which is like void in Java so and
it is optional then in curly braces we
have the body says println this is a
string literal as you might expect if I
go to println
navigate to it this is just it's a
function defined in Kotlin esterday
library because here you can see path
and it's just system out jela so I can
here extracts for example this road as a
message and here you see the string
interpolation the Java syntax is this
with process in cotton you can do it in
shorter ways and this like with full
syntax with curly braces so here you can
see values keywords and it's like this
is the name of the variable and there is
no type this is because in Kotlin there
is local type inference so this is we
can specify type explicit and it's a
string if I navigate to string it is
caught Lin string just slightly find it
but
interesting videos that at run time it
becomes java.lang stirring so now I'm
looking at Kotlin bytecode you can see
in definition of main method it becomes
java.lang stirring this is one of the
reasons why Cortland can be compiled to
different environments at compile time
this is Scotland upstream this is not
Java stream but after it's compiled it
becomes for Java platform into the Java
language else to do something else so
this is like why it works so here you
can remove streams and if we try to
assign something to the message like
their box we get a red thing which says
well cannot be reassigned and we can
change it to vice so that I default
everything should develop like finally
mutual this equivalent to Java final and
you can change it to Y so I'll change it
back and just well now I can I'll try
and extract a function called greeting
so you can see this is again function
definition it takes one argument message
and then returns another string but it
looks slightly different this is
expression by this so if you if all your
function is just one expression can be
converted to this form so I can convert
it to similar format as main and this
will look like this then you have to
have return key words unlike scallion
grew here last expression is not
returned automatically from functions so
here I can try again single Athene with
message and do their walks and again it
complains can it be reassigned who try
to do vark we cannot do it so all
parameters are final and might change in
future but right now you just cannot
resign anything one of the interesting
features which is which doesn't exist in
scallion groovy you can have extension
methods so here I'm doing this doing
this refactoring and those parameter to
receiver and it changes method signature
now it's strings or greeting and here we
have this instead of message so and when
we use it we can pretend there is a
method
on the stream so I have this make sense
in reality how it works is just a static
method so if you would bytecode this is
just a public final static it takes a
stream and so in a way it's like in
Python you pass this as the first
argument to methods so this is a similar
thing we can also define our own method
again println and it will do printer and
this right then we can rewrite hello
world like this and it still works fine
so I'll change this bits back to
arguments receive it round it's a
message and another thing we can do is
we can have default arguments for
default values for parameters so here
then we don't need message anymore
now the thing which is just nicely we
can have nice named parameters so here
this message means this argument is
basically named so and dine wise hello
rolls right with functions they can be
private which is like normal thing they
can be internal which is like c-sharp
convention so they won't be accessible
from other modules that can be protected
but there is no package private and by
default everything is public this was
slightly controversial decision because
originally in Kotlin which was rather
were out everything is before by default
was private and you had to be specific
to make it public then which was the
liberal design decision that because
most java code bases have most public
fields than private so they decided to
save characters and swapped it and data
around so also functions can be defined
anywhere so I can put it inside main and
Izzie you can notice there is no
surrounding class around it so education
just typed code in the file there is
also good because the graphic language
was designed for to interoperation with
Java within the same project so I have
some class region color function written
from Java I can do printer LAN so if I
navigate to booting from Java see this
is Java code because there is semicolon
so enter tall prints now like interval
interoperates with Java yeah so I've
been running it through ID and like
interesting to know how it's all going
to it's all very similar to scale or
groovy so this particular project the
respond XML if I expanded the
configuration is relatively simple all
you need is this dependency for this
project and then there is a plugin for
Megan to actually compile then
intelligent ticket type or you can
compile from command line and so on so
this is how it all actually works so
this is this is edge with filler Wells
and switched slides with for world this
what we looked at basic syntax string
extraction of a platform available and
named parameters extension functions and
Java this was really intense hello world
so here is a joke that the question is
what was that chicken or egg and the
answer from evolutionary point of view
that egg was test with some leases with
the ancestors before chicken so the next
exam this was going it about streams the
next examples tutorial which is about
numbers to see my death tutorial I'm
sure everyone here knows what tutorial
is so basically this is Wikipedia page
this five band and then equals all the
numbers from five to one multiplied so
I'm switching back to IDE and in series
tutorial but this is similar we have
entry points main main function and
inside they have defined factorial so
looks good and it's defining the cursive
way so if n less than 1 then return 1
otherwise we calculated for toriel for n
minus 1 multiplied line so I'll do a
little bit of cleanup here so I'll move
function outside of main
also if statement is an expression so I
can do this thing like lift return outer
v
here instead of returning inside if
another identity and it'll work
there is another thing we could do
instead of if is to use when this is
like switch statement in Java owners but
it is more powerful and see hey it's
like ten minus one then return 1 else
return tutorial but I don't like it here
I think I'll keep it like this and put
it into one line so because it's 2017 we
should really write a unit test so I'll
do a class factorial test this is
interesting argument that probably all
frameworks and everyone is wrong and
files should be called tests like plural
because usually inside those facilities
have multiple tests why you call it one
test that's the interesting argument so
this this Intex looks like almost like
java in TS i calculates factorial and
I'll move all this into test then I can
run it so essentially we're now using
test framework as a main method for now
place so what's going on here is that I
define a class which exactly like Java
then we have test annotation as you can
see from inputs this test annotation is
just j-unit doing and then again we
define function well then we have
backticks this is special syntax where
you can avoid compliance restrictions so
what you can have in identifier so it's
similar to scouring groovy can have
almost anything there including reserved
keywords and then we have like tests and
it all works because it compiles to
normal Java code so it's integrates with
ID all the tools like you don't need to
do anything special so now we need some
assertions so I can say so that equal to
let's say 1 for now then there is a
question what we want to import and
there is compressed with case which is
written for coupling but I'll go with
just normal Java hand pressed and this
is equals to so now if I run this it
should fail because numbers are not
I think these are the right numbers for
details then I have 20 and out a little
bit you can see this is just normal Java
methods so no quite often you can just
use Java libraries and they work
seamlessly so here this looks good but
if we what if we try factorial 17 is an
evil example and it returns negative
number which is this strange because
definitely should be negative whoo
multiplying positive numbers and that
they answer to it if we navigate to int
and go to court when this court in
source code says represents that to be
signed integer and on JVM it's basically
lowercase scenes and if you can expect
it will just silence overflow if you
look at bytecode you pretty sure you can
guess what's going on this is white for
the tutorial is just normal int so at
runtime
this is coddling int and after at
compile time the scotland's at run time
it becomes lower casings also all these
methods they're really not special
syntax this is operator overloading so
this compared to less than equals is
compared to on in objects in Kotlin the
same with - the same with multiply you
can control click on them and see what's
going on so we could try and do like
lawn right here but it's not going to
really help it will overflow slightly
later so the actual answer is to go for
big decimal for example so this is what
I'm going to do it will take the real
word surface so let's import
one then we need to change our the whole
test
so one thing to note this is normal Java
bigdecimal as you can see remembers the
interesting thing this is bigdecimal
constructor and we don't have new
keyword I think it's one of the
interesting features and I think it was
a good feature like no new keyword
because why would you need keyword the
Constructors I construct the value of
your type in that that's all there is to
it so if I run it now it should print a
more sensible number rather than
negative yeah I have an answer good and
pasted back in if you notice I changed
all the literals to big decimal constant
and it would be nice to do something
like that and actually you can do it
with extension functions is like quite
easy to define so I can do something
like that so if M is private and then do
this dot compare to the integer with
decimal and so basically we just write
in and into the decimal and so this
works now it's really good
this notice keyword operate if I remove
it stops working
so we can do the same thing here great
extension function on the personal so
it's the same again this is shorten
syntax for expression by the end I speak
decimal so that's fine as well so what
we can do you can always use like the
actual method call so you can minus one
and just will leave just like Java there
is one more thing we could try and do
one but then the you could do with in
Scala with implicit conversions there is
nothing like this in Portland so we
could do like two big decimal and so on
but this is too much it's like it's not
going to add a lot of value so there is
no way to do to have this syntax so this
is all good that the next of this step
is like what if it was big decimal of
books 30,000
you can guess where that's going
sorry not decimals terrific toriel
toriel upsets thousand yeah I'm pretty
sure you can guess what's going to
happen and this is my favorite stack
overflow error so the problem is that
this pictorial is recursive and when big
numbers is bigger than default stack
size in Java so obviously we need to
write an iterative way or do tail call
optimization and codling can do it like
Scala there is tail rec annotation links
and the interesting thing is that it
doesn't happen by default you have to be
explicit about it and ID roll hints if
you correct because here the problem so
that it's not really tail recursive
implementation the one we have because
the last operation is multiplication so
we need to rewrite rerun rewrite heads
to be tail recursive so something like
this probably will do do result and here
the factorial n minus 1 result x and so
now this should work and you see the
warning is gone
and we get this tiny tiny number this
kind of scroll it looks correct to me
yeah so this is pictorial example so
this is what we looked at in flooring
abstraction again similar although big
decimal wasn't part of this abstraction
the decimal was in Java so all numbers
an object on YouTube word there is
operator overloading you can do tail
call optimization and we looked at unit
testing so and that's a joke that unless
you in space your glasses always full
super optimist so the next example is
code cutter so in its data munging
cutter which is bit more realistic
enterprise-e thing so I learned about
code cursors from website by Dave Thomas
who wrote with co-author this book
semantic program this is what website
looks like right now it used to look
more seriously in the past I'm not sure
we'll change the cache but in general
kata is a small exercise you do again
and again to improve your skills for
example coding skills comes from martial
arts where they repeat movement and
practice repeating the same movement
over and over again so one of the
cutters on this website cut a number
four about data munging so the cat is
has three parts parts one is that can
you read text file and you look the
process it and find day with minimum
temperature stress the file contains a
table and in table you have day number
and maximum and minimum temperature on
that day then you do in part two similar
thing with football teams you find team
with minimum goal difference and in part
three you respect it so I won't do all
of it but I'll do just the beginning so
switch can do data munch in Qatar
so what we have here is class definition
with test again to rule it this simplex
will extend in a class so this is string
spec here I'm showing different testing
framework which is not judging based
more Koplin tests so what's going on so
we extend the class string spec and here
we have unit as a keyword and this is
the code which will be run after
instantiation of this class if we go to
screen spec we see success sales base
but they just run with so it all just
integrates with J units infrastructure
because it has this gene sanitation in
superclass then there is some
interesting things interesting things
are happening here so we have string and
then curly braces like slightly strange
syntax so I'll show what's going on in
reality so this is actually lambda if we
specify type this is how specified
lambda from unit to unit so it's like
void toroid in Java and this is the
actual lambda then we do this is invoke
methods on stream and this is the
extension method which is defined in
superclass string specs of a control
click on it this is how it works so it's
defined in here and because it's
operator it can be converted to just
sirens and there is another rule which
is similar to groovy if you pass a
lambda as the last argument to function
then you can drop parents so you can end
up with curly braces so given all that
it looks like we just call in something
in a string and you could do it with any
other classes it's kind of interesting
that those simple things they accumulate
and you can have interesting facts in
text and so on so I'll run it and show
the actual file now so what what's going
on here is you can guess we printing all
the lines from this file with weather so
this is what it looks like this is some
stuff at the top we have no idea what
this is really then we finally get to
some data and Advanta or a bit more
rubbish so looks like typical enterprise
problem so i'll show what's going here
so filed
is Java a your file so it's constructed
here then red lines is extension method
defined in Cortland IO which just
returns the list of strings and then for
reach is again extension method which is
defined on interval it takes a lambda
and similar to what I showed this is
just we drop in parents and using curly
braces and here inside the closure what
we have specified
so inside lambda by printing line and it
is the default name for single argument
so this is the full syntax but because
there is only one argument to the lambda
it's called it's like in groovy
this is what's going on there is you
might notice this read lines doesn't
throw in the exceptions we now don't
have any catch exception things anywhere
this is because there are no checked
exception in Coghlan it's all thorough
uncheck so to show to explain a little
bit more what's going on so if I extract
lines and specify types so you can see
this is list of strings this is how you
do type parameters so you can guess by
now that string is probably if I control
quick and it's defined in court link
collections and at run time it will
become java.util string so if I click on
string and I go into cotton source code
cotton collections I can collapse
everything so you can see is like
mirror's Java collections really so
least extensive collections by the way
you can see this is declaration size
variants so unlike Java or Scala cotton
can do both you can define your variants
in when you use some collection or when
you declare them so it's more flexible
and you can see the least extensive
collection so and but you might notice
there is mutually so the trick is that
by default code main list is read only
where read only means you cannot modify
it but it doesn't mean that it's
persistent data structure underneath it
but anyway so this is like whist is
read-only and there is similar thing for
sets and maps and so on so by default
everything is written
here is a slide with diagram so green
are read-only cotton collections
yellowish mutable and at the bottom you
see blue this is java.util like normal
collections Anjana so I'll inline this
thing and move on with the code castling
so what we want is probably again we can
enter file would probably want to drop
the top and take just 30 lines the sort
I'm going to do so I remember how many
to drop so when to drop take 30
these are extension methods drop and
take so now we got through the rubbish
then what we might want to do is do map
and split regex
so what we're doing is meting each line
and splitting using this regex
unlike Java and Scala if you want regex
you have to have explicitly regex
objects if you put in the screen it
won't it will treat it as a string it
won't magically compile it into regex
now if you good this is a good design
because it's very explicit that this
screen won't be magically transformed
somewhere in the background surrounding
this again we should see that each line
now becomes a list so looks like a list
because there are comments between
numbers now we probably want to extract
three columns like they maximum
temperature and minimum temperature so
I'll do it as least for now so I'll put
it this is 2/3 so what's going on here
I'm creating a list this is just like AZ
list in Java similar the intent here
what's going again operator overloading
so we had the least and then we extract
values from the list so parent again we
should just have three columns
yes going on what what suspected then we
want to convert the last two columns
into integer to do difference so this
again extension method if I click on it
it's just Java length percent but looks
nicer I run it again it will probably
fail because there are some numbers they
have styles and a typical enterprise
developer I'll just to replace it with
something like remove those I don't know
what they mean I'll just remove them so
now it looks better so almost what we
want the interesting thing there are no
tuples in cotton but they used to be
there and before the first release they
decided to remove tuples because it
wasn't clear how it's going to play with
the rest of the language so they decide
to be conservative and maybe adds tuples
later and the one of the solutions
instead of table was to use data classes
so it is similar to case classes in
Scala so here I'm typing where the entry
class so this class which has annotation
data so you might expect from Scala it
will have equals hash code to screen and
so on and cooking method so it will have
day which is screen well max which is
int and thou mean which is also aimed so
now can use weather entry instead of
least and it will be nicer it's also
arguably more semantically reached then
just tuples which have one two three so
now you can see it prints whether entry
because it has to string and the last
bit is to what we needed to do is to
find a with minimum temperature spreads
so you can say max minus its mean and
then you should print tool and can you
do okay I'll just do variable here entry
and do printer
and the answer should be de footing yeah
unfortunately it's not 42 not enough
interest so now we can write because
it's a test we should probably write a
session so it can basically almost copy
the output here and now it should be
oh yes good arguably here what we were
going to do is to assess on the day
anyway searching on the whole entry so
it should probably be something like
that
in the reality but here we bump into the
next problem is that compiler is not
happy it says this is like something's
going on here
and to understand is it's useful to see
the actual type of this entry and this
type is almost like entry but it has
question mark so this is how encoding
you get malleable not malleable types by
default everything every type is not now
so whether entry cannot be now but if
you want it to be now you have to add
question mark at the end the reason it
happens is that mean by method it can
return now if your collection is empty
so and it enforces entry to be you know
so if I remove question mark we get red
arrow around noon bite so it has to be
inaudible so that there are few
backgrounds you can get from ready so
you can surround with now check HERE
Kotlin is clever enough to understand
that entry is final if we check it for
now then on the next line it's
definitely not now so we don't need to
do anything it's like one way it's
called smart casting and can be used for
some other things as well so the next
fix is to add bangbang which is
basically say I know what I'm doing this
is not going to be now if it's not will
be no point at runtime and probably that
the right thing to do in this case is
whether say with safe where the question
mark dot which means if entry is now the
whole expression is now there is a nice
blog post by net price about type
hierarchy and now labelled things so
that's this blog post can quickly skim
it so that's where it's like at the top
of class hierarchy there is class called
any age is like object in Java so then
we can scroll down so it's basically the
whole inheritance models like in Java
when you have multiple inheritance from
interfaces and single inheritance from
classes then there are notable types
which is for all the types you define
you get like a mirror of nullable types
and not knowable types like any without
question like they are subtypes of noble
so you have this mirroring of the whole
hierarchy then there is unit as we've
seen the resembling value of one there
is only one value of unit and there is
nothing at the bottom of the hierarchy
and that's it's like three T needs type
system in a way that sounds slightly
strange things like nullable nothing
which cannot exist but it's not strange
but anyway that's the hierarchy so this
is almost the part one of the cutter
I'll do bit of cheating and just paste
part two just to show what is fights so
looking at this very similar code so we
get football file read lines drop few
lines filter is then split it and create
team entry here we nicer formatting when
we specify names for like using names
parameters and then again we mean by
football team and then we print it so
the if we were to do third part of the
cutter we will have to probably
introduce some abstraction and the
simplest attempt would be to say this is
super type data class entry with some
wielki of a me for example and then try
to extend it and we will soon find that
we cannot extend because it what we can
it extends because this is final quest
this is another interesting thing total
in all classes by default our final so
you have to mark them open as soon as we
do open we figure out that data is
incompatible so we kind of have data
class and open at the same time if we
remove data then it's just a class which
doesn't do much so there is no real
point and for me it's like it should be
an interface really and we can do
something like that and then implemented
I can implement the interface so this is
the way I would go place but I'm not I'm
gonna stop here and move move on so this
was cut cut just sort of looked at
collections lambda higher-order
functions of those those functions like
for each will exam
and no checked exception data classes
nullable types and we looked at yet
another testing framework open test so
this is how you do SQL injection for
road cameras now totaling puzzlers
they're not like real real puzzlers but
obviously they inspired by Java puzzlers
if you haven't read this book definitely
recommended gradebook and what a shadows
like those files was obviously if you
just so just learned a little bit about
language not fair to have puzzles so
these are introductory puzzler sex
scenes you can bump in when you start
using Cortland and get confused so the
testing flow flow going back to flow
rails so we have two main functions the
first one main one
it does println hello one and main two
which does principal and hello - so like
we just looked this with expression by
this Intex and on this main - is like
Scala syntax so what will I understand
like it should print color one and hello
- right so what are the answers so I go
for B because it's going to be Row one
and two you have your favorite guest
reading and then C is one it doesn't
print - and the answer the reason for it
is that main - if you specify full
syntax it just returns a lambda it
doesn't really do anything
so here return type is a lambda so it's
not Union moving on is similar then what
am I so here we have main method value
called the bottom I then curly braces
parens and then we print this value my
reason is that curly braces
it looks like I've learned from like
these examples the curly braces probably
lambda so but it has nothing inside so I
don't know it's probably shouldn't be
valid thing to do and so what might
guess would be that shouldn't really
compile I'm not sure or return some like
now so if you look at the answers like
now units empty string doesn't compile
so I go for D I
think it should compare so hope you have
a guess and the answer is cotton unit
this is because if we extract shell all
the types explicitly that curly braces
is is a lambda which returns unit and
what in my evaluates to unit and the
source code for unit is this actual
source code for unit it returns to
stream and this is the only object this
how it works but this is my favorite one
return the turn of power throw so here
would have f1 and f2 two functions the
first function does return return 42 the
second throw throw exception so because
everything is expression in Cortland I
think like return 30 to make sense its
expression it has type of things
probably and then we return in so it's
all fine
throw throw is like definitely
conflation Airy so what are the answer
so I choose B so it returns 42 and the
second function doesn't compile and the
answer is it all works fine and the
reason for it is says there is type
nothing which is at the bottom of the
hierarchy and in reality the type of
expression return 42 is not teams from
type system return type is nothing which
is subtype of things
so from compiler point of view the
leftmost return returns nothing which is
subtype of int which is fine at run
times what happens the rightmost return
is evaluated and they said it's the end
of execution similar thing with throw
exceptions so you can throw any object
which is subtype of expression and
nothing is cell type of expression so
it's all fine and for example if you
look there is a method in code link o to
do it has typed nothing and it throws an
exception this is this white folks it's
allows you to do fun things like this
this well it goes trans find the
backticks you can use keywords in there
and then you just return twice or even
this which enter or return
ballots
so a bit some complicated example with
defaulted values so I used Ruby and
Scala previously so here we have number
and like it's very notices can be
changed and then we have maps empty map
of anything and then we do dot with
default and pass enclosure which
increment n and then we try and get from
emptiness some value and what I expected
like greetings car developer that with
default will wrap my map into another
map which will provide default value
when the key is missing so what's going
on here my reasoning like map missing
key it will evaluate the n plus plus so
it will return 42 but it will increment
n second time we run it not sure what's
going to happen will it like remember
the key was 42 or will evaluate it again
so because its closure maybe it
evaluates us all the time so it will be
my guess
42 43 and the value of n will be 44 in
the end but it still so I'm going to be
and it sounds like reasonable thing what
other options like 42 42 or like nulls
or throw no pointer so the fun thing is
that it's just Mouse and the reason for
it is seen before this square brackets
operator overloading it's get so it's
normal guess on a map is just like in
Java then the fun thing is that with
this is normal gets the fun thing is
what with default is doing and it craps
map into this interface which doesn't
have debt it doesn't override get at all
so it's doing something completely
different related to another language
feature so this is what I get now like
you rest maps and but you get still
returns now so this is just other words
a bug and the fix actually is just to
write code like this don't use the squid
default ever so that's that's how you do
that's how you get the same
functionality you get you use method get
or default instead
so the the final Fazle is by 99 bottles
so here we have packaged backticks 99 so
as we have seen with function names you
can use backticks to do anything right
in any other context you can use
backticks then we define class bottles
and we create an instant of it and
assign two value bottles and then we
print class of this value so my guess
would be that it should print 99 bottles
or something like that like why not if
it's valid thing so these are the
answers so I guess maybe McGee might be
reasonable because is underscore maybe
of this numerals enough allowed and Java
but I think fundamentally you can use
anything but probably there so pick your
guess and the answer is it doesn't
compile and an alt compiler crashes so
you can say none of the above and this
is not fair for puzzlers I know it's
like breaking the rules of puzzlers and
it's like actual error but the point of
this is Kotlin is relatively new and
there are those edge cases which you are
more likely to find then let's say in
language like Java so nothing it's not
perfect yes so but it's getting there so
in reality it's good for example this
code will burg if you move class and
value inside main function and you can
define classes anywhere so this will
work and it will print something it
won't crash so yeah this then was and
like finally in then some link Scotland
so what works you can find things about
cotton there is website code link link
which has lots of links to libraries and
frameworks and so on which obviously
there's coupling length like website
with the Copelan you can go there find
lots of things there are coupling
currents like small exercises where you
have the failing test you write some
code link codes make the test pass and
you can do it even without any
installation in the browser if you
google fruits for goblin Cohen's
Coughlin Commons also like github if you
want to clone it and run locally I did
99 problems in Cortland there is this
website 99 problem in Scala which was
original 99 problems in Prolog
so I did all of them
so if you brave enough the beginnings
are easy of this cotton not going sign
problem begins very easy then it
suddenly becomes very complex so if you
can't assist explain this obviously
Twitter account which you can follow
there is a blog the interesting thing
about blogs that it's been maintained
for all six years if you want to see the
history of the language like go read the
blog it's kind of interesting and there
is quite an action book you can see on
this word there is also forums online
discuss cutting length the song and
there is slack channel and it is quite
nice there are developers like code link
or developers there they can help you
usually very quickly like within a day
you will get some answer so it's like
very nice place to be and so that's
that's the call in future there will be
1x releases currently I think the
biggest problem with Kotlin is that
version 1.1 directive Foreman's problems
and there are no fundamental reasons for
it because it unlike skull it was
designed to the place the compile just
the fastest Java but there are currently
problems so if you download the latest
version of something and something is
slow just don't think it's because
Godwin is slow in general so it will be
fixed I hope soon ish so this was coming
in future lives also will be think with
rolls for lists and yeah the other thing
which I didn't mention but it's already
released in the in production on both
JVM and JavaScript flight from score
routine support and the interesting
thing is that unlike other languages the
abstraction was pushed down so you can
do like yield from loops and it yields
big like in c-sharp it's library
function it's not a keyword so take a
look at this this is interesting and
there is totaling native which is just
in preview stage so it's very early date
or copper native but it's in development
so it will be it's already possible but
it in the future you could be able to
will be able to compile cotton code in
native code and just use it so that's it
and please give some feedback of
they're steaming thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
