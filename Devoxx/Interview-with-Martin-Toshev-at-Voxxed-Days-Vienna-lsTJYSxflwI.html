sniffles and strudels if i solve in
several sightings and i read marking you
search about job security yes you
looking so I'm a Java developer and I
know the bytecode I'm unsure of I comin
in a sandbox on the JVM so apart from
that what don't is that correct exactly
apart from that what do I need to be
aware so typically every java developer
needs to be aware of how does the
security sandbox model of the Java
platform work apart from that he needs
to be aware of what security apts are
out there in the JDK and basically how
to apply them properly in order to be
able to secure his application properly
as well or horse is a lady of course the
hydra java at katies and artwork so in
very general the Java security sandbox
works by first doing some kind of
permission checking you have to specify
by default permissions in a security
policy for which describes basically the
permissions in a domain-specific
language and after that basically the
security major takes the responsibility
to do that permission checking behind
the scenes if you are developing a java
application server or another kind of
gel managed environment such as osgi
potentially might need to do some
additional permission checking on top of
what does the jvm do by default it's
important to know how the security
manager works and then you can just
trust it to do it thing oh well
absolutely every java developer should
be aware of how the security major work
in order to properly set up basically
what's needed for his application to run
in an environment with the security
manager installed ah apart from that as
we already mentioned it's an essential
knowledge to also know how does the job
security API works never any changes
with Java 9 that people should be aware
so the biggest change which we
developers expecting John is Roger
jigsaw which modularized the Java
platform with that big change
essentially the security model will
remain the same typically however they
might be some changes like for example
grunting for permission to certain
modules in the JVM and restricting
permissions to others but apart from
that developers should still be aware of
the same security model as it is now
today so the security model we're kind
of module basis and will it be per
module of application yes so typically
arm basically security is implied based
on the location of where the code is
loaded from and potentially which user
that executes the source code is defined
by just so as modules basically might be
allowed to the possibility to be loaded
from different places there can be a
different set of permissions per module
that could be set eventually so this is
one thing that that would be possible
what are the key take away Tim you talk
so the key takeaways from my talk are a
few apart from the fact that developers
would become more aware of how the
security set box model of Java platform
work they also become more aware of what
are the different API is that they can
use in order to provide security in
their application and last but not least
it's a set of several specific
guidelines for the JDK that developers
need to be aware of when they take into
account the security sandbox normal and
the different supporting security api's
in the JDK</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
