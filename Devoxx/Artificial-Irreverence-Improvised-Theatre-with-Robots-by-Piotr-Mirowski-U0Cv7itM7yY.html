hello everybody welcome back after the
lunch service sessions we are going to
have a 45 minute session that will be a
little bit different probably from the
coding exercises and what you've seen so
far it's going to be quite interactive
and at some point I will ask even a
volunteer from the audience to come on
the stage the way is going to be
recorded and strained but if you're
looking for fame and celebrity please do
volunteer my name is Pierre Thuot near
offski and I have a friend Cory Matthews
son whom I collaborate on this project
he actually lives in Edmonton in Alberta
in Canada he's a PhD student in
reinforcement learning at various of
Alberta and we have come up
independently and then together with the
idea of doing improv comedy with a robot
and a chatbot so just by a show of hands
how many of you have already seen an
improv show before okay that's about
30-something percent which is great for
the other ones don't worry
improv is essentially theater without
script so there is a little trailer so
we are going to improvise with a machine
and there are lots of technical
considerations we you just saw us
handling the sound output
everything will be running on this
laptop with an AI that we designed and
I'm going to walk you in the talk over
how this works but before we actually
proceed with the rest of the show and
presentation I would like you all and
that's a tradition that we have
established with curring I would like
you all to take a deep breath and lower
your expectations but I think you're all
programmers so you know how things work
great I think we can start this now
hello my name is Albert hello
I am a research scientist in artificial
intelligence I've been doing this for 15
years and also as you may have noticed I
have a little bit of a French accent and
even a hint of a polish accent when I
speak so technically that makes me a
foreign expert I hope you don't mind
some people England do where I come from
and I heard that people in in Belgium
might mind as well for different reasons
but let's not get into that
so okay we are going to do an improv
show including an artificial
intelligence and we are doing this
because many people have lots of
concerns of our artificial intelligence
I have to say I am concerned as well in
the last year and a half I've seen how
the rate of growth of artificial
intelligence has been outpaced by the
rate of growth natural stupidity we've
had a lot of that on 23rd of June 2016
and then on 8 November 2016 and and we
just keep breaking no return points it's
scary so I really like doing improv and
I've been trying to find people to do
improv me and I haven't heard back much
from them but one person has replied his
name is Corey
Madison and also when he is not very
because it's physically away what I did
is that I built a little robot called
Alex this is Alex he says hello
so Alex is actually an acronym for
artificial language experiment and it's
also gender-neutral name which is very
convenient because it's a machine it's
it so alex is actually trained on
dialogue from 100,000 movies that's
quite a lot
it goes from 1902 and to 2016 and those
movies
quite different some of them can be
varied even profound like the deer
hunter of a Decalogue and other movies a
bit different like deep impact or deep
front so they may contain a little
incorrect dialogue so you might
understand that I wanted to play some
filters on top of that it might be
useful I don't want it to say anything
incorrect because I am a scientist not a
politician before we start our improv
show I need to to warm you up because
you've been sitting all day listening to
lectures so I'm going to ask you for
suggestions and before that I need you
to all shout on the count of three your
first name
one two three Alex and Albert and now on
the count of three can you all shout
your favorite food one two three pizza
we all know that we like pizza because
it's convenient it comes in boxes what
maintain the heat for long nights then
coding and and finally on the count of
three can you all shout something you
would tell to a loved person one two
three I'm sorry I didn't hear very well
can you shout it louder one two three
and this section shot something one two
three thank you I don't get to hear it
very often so okay I think we're ready
to go and know we can ask Alex to
actually ask for a suggestion of you Oh
if you may have noticed this is the
output of a speech recognition it's very
good right it is part of a show uh yes
okay so Alex will ask for a suggestion
he humans can we ask you for a
suggestion of a dangerous activity
a dangerous activity scuba-diving yes
lions drinking Belgian beer okay
driving in Antwerp okay after having
drunk Belgian beer great I'm going to
stop improvisation start improvising hey
Stacy how do you enjoy my driving in
Belgium driving a beautiful Aston Martin
for the country where I come from Stacy
you're admiring of my skills I know you
think that somebody one day would
replace with a so during real car with a
robot I don't think so
I'm the most skilled driver on this side
even if I drink or you comfortable Stacy
I'd like to leave with the rest of the
evening sorry but you're still single in
the bathroom don't worry Stacy I'll take
care of you and I would take care of
myself I would take care of a car first
and foremost I wouldn't want to damage
the car at all and that will leave us
life of the rest of the evening
and as far as the battery goes well
that's my pride life Stacy I'll be
afraid if I beg you to forgive me I will
not be able to make it the doors they
seek
come oh you make it I have everything
under control I mean I do like and I do
sound as if I was completely like
careless but I'm not I'm a trained and
skilled driver or everything is under
control I knew you would trust me Stacy
I've been in love with you all the time
I've known you all - I know I know Stacy
since the day I saw you that was four
years ago when you were sitting in front
of a computer the computer lab I thought
wow that girl and you're not looking
good at this I'm just going to start
with your new book my new book yeah good
I mean at least you're going to spend
the evening with something I created I
think it should be happy with that I
mean that's I would prefer to spend
living with you I thought that was true
how would I know you don't trust me come
on I've always wanted to spend that
evening with you that's why I I took if
of his writing tour of aunt Ferb
it's just the two of us together and the
traffic jam why do not you have a drink
with me I've never heard of it well and
Ferb is a city in Belgium it's a
beautiful city that has a beautiful city
center and I thought that I wanted to
just drive you around well technically I
probably need to leave a park the car
the parking you know the
and you have not had much time with all
you've been trying to do is go to the
police please believe me Stacy
oh okay are you trying to tell me which
one to tell me I had too much of a drink
are you trying to tell me I'm
irresponsible
before you are killed I thought you were
not sure what you were going to do okay
I got it
it's your way of showing me tough love
you're trying to scare me into not drink
driving anymore right Thank You Stacy I
I think I heard a lesson you're a man of
luck I just wanted to make sure you were
in the same room I am in the same room
as you Stacy in this car and I'm also on
the same page as you
I love you Stacy anything thank you so
now I think that I would just proceed
with the rest of a talk so and maybe I
also might deactivate the input of a
robot so let's first introduce ourselves
a bit more properly and that you what
led us to actually work on that subject
so yes we all two nerds with a passion
for theater so on my side I started
doing improv as soon as I entered
engineering school in France and set in
Toulouse and that was in 1999 with
company ccd and we are part of an improv
university improv team called Liz and
horrible I continued doing improv in a
foreign language in English when I moved
first to to England for one year and
then for ten years in New York and over
I was member of a troop called cherub
improv which was doing improv comedy in
nursing homes hospitals
and basically trying to cheer up people
and that was a wonderful experience
because we communicated a lot with her
patients and four years ago four and a
half years ago I decided to come back to
Europe and of course I started looking
for a place doing improv and well I came
back to London the job and there I
discovered something even more exciting
which is musical improv where you
literally try to build in real time and
completely spontaneously an improvised
musical with rhymes rhythm melody and of
course all done in a group and also
since I'm I love theatre also decided to
take some drama classes along scrotum at
the guards and that happened in parallel
- well my engineering studies and then
doing a PhD in computer science at NYU
with young Nokia and my interest in deep
learning for sequence modeling and time
series predictions suffering some of the
problems I worked on included epileptic
seizure prediction from EEG or modeling
language statistical using statistical
language models and so I think you can
see we the connection starting building
up and the why a desert to combine both
theater and AI for language my friend
Carrie Mathison is a PhD student in
reinforcement learning and robotics at
the University beretta and I met him
online after he blogged about his show
in April 2016 but he did at the rapid
fire theater in Edmonton with Piggy a
chatbot but he assembled and immediately
we established connection we started
collaborating and curry is a skilled
improviser and award-winning hypervisor
who among others improvises TED Talks so
he literally gets the title of a TED
talk for the audience and the slides of
pepper but somebody else
he needs to make a speech about it he
also runs six degrees of science which
is quite educational
mixed with improv so Cory and I started
literally a long distance relationship
so to speak and that's also the name of
a show structure that we devised where
we basically improvise remotely Cory and
I connect via Skype or Google Hangouts
and we do an improv scene accounting for
seven to eight hours of time difference
which is quite interesting when he does
a show connecting from 4 p.m. from the
mountains in Alberta and I am in a pub
in London or vice-versa he's in a
performing space in Edmonton and I wake
up at 3 a.m. to get ready for the show
our inspirations are multiple and we
really been lucky to meet a lot of very
good skilled improvisers who explored
the medium extensively and so that
includes the show stoppers who won an
Olivier Award for the improvised musical
happily never a sorry happily never
after by the nursery theatre and the
nine days who improvised a musical and
the theme of Burton's movie
we also who's an is anyway which is
probably one of the more known improv
shows screening on television which
essentially contains some of those short
form games that gave inspiration for
building a chatbot and interacting with
it so one of the game in whose line is
it anyway is called pick a line where
the performers literally pick a line
written in advance by the audience
members they pick it from a heart and
then while they do a scene in real time
they have to integrate it seamlessly as
if it's exactly as if it was exactly
what they were intending to say and they
have to justify that line even if it
makes absolutely no sense so
you agree with me that if you have a
chatbot that interacts with you in an
improv game that's essentially kind of
comparable with the only exception that
the chatbot might actually pick out on
some cues if a speech recognition works
well and use it to inform the scene so
now I think it's time to deep dive into
our creation itself Albert
sorry Alex well Albert also is a it's
also an invention we try to basically I
was trying to to go with usual
stereotypes of of a nerd hence the
glasses with suspenders on the tie I
think that's a very nineteen eighties
nineteen seventies stereotype but coming
back to Alex at visual language
experiment it is essentially a
statistical language model based chat
board which is trained on film dialogue
so no discussion about chat BOTS can be
done without mentioning eliza developed
by Professor Joseph I'm Dan Barr at the
MIT in 1966 which is the first case of a
program that tried to pass the Turing
test and induce the audience members the
oldest members interacting with it into
into believing that it was coming from
an actual human being doing a
psychoanalysis session and here I could
be pasted examples of
snippets of a code the total code length
of Eliza's maybe 200 lines and the bulk
of it consists literally in substituting
you by I and I by you so returning
rephrasing there the question from the
averse being asked and sometimes finding
keywords and giving a generic response
or a generic question and the actually
it's typically questions was very
frustrating with Eliza is that it keeps
returning questions back
- the person who interacts with it and
this way it fuels that conversation but
it becomes a little bit frustrating
after about 10 exchanges and Joseph
Eisenberg apparently observed that one
of his co-workers once was locked in a
room dr. Eliza and when he entered that
coworker told him not to dis not to be
disturbed because he or she was really
she a ting the second is a session with
a chatbot so it really did work at a
time for some reason so come back to
Alex I said that Alex means at visual
language experiment it's also referenced
to alex' a parrot I've know you've heard
about the parrot but dr. Irene
Pepperberg from Harvard was training for
30 years to essentially learn bits of
language and count up to six and learn
vocabulary hard words this reference is
essentially a way of saying that all
that we're doing is just building a
parrot nothing else but doesn't really
understand what's going on so Alex I did
Cole has a recurrent neural network
which is used to generate text word by
word and I wrapped it with a Dalek
system but enables turn-taking
to essentially understand when a line
ends and where the next line begins and
when it should stop talking I also have
a system of ranking multiple candidate
sentences based on the likelihood the
statistical likelihood and choosing the
most likely one the inputs to Alex or
speech recognition and so on this stage
set up and using a wireless headset so
that's why I have two microphones that
Center to a wireless base and when it's
connected to this laptop it's not
perfect and we we are still looking for
a good solution that works well and that
can accommodate there is accents then of
course versus text-to-speech which
enables the audience in a pub or in a
theatre to listen to it
there is a user interface as you've seen
a server that can be very useful for
full server interactions for instance
connecting an avatar that runs on a
different server so the data sets but
you use the train alex is a corpus of
100,000 movies running films that you
connected from open subtitles and that
represents almost a billion word tokens
one of the just possible justifications
for making that choice is that improv
actors or actually using for some forms
of scripts some forms of patterns and so
I thought that the kind of patterns that
are prevalent in movies or plays or
essentially can be used for a chatbot
the statistical language models
themselves have gone through multiple
refinement iterations it all started
with Claude Shannon a very inventor of
the information theory who devised the
idea of ngrams conditioning for
probability of a world of position n in
a Engram on the N minus one preceding
words and if you have a large covers of
text you can literally compute for
statistics by Counting for each given
context what is the most likely word
that follows of course this has a
limitation but the context is just as
long as n minus 1 this idea has been
refined massively over the ages and in
2006 it was introduced by search engines
for doing machine translation and this
worked quite well
at the time because of the large amount
of data and it has further been refined
using neural networks already at the
time of Claude Shannon people were using
it
for generating tax and presents Keith
Johnstone who wrote the textbook on
intro looked at how this could be used
to generate a text piece of text using
an Engram of
length and minus one equals to free the
hand in frontal attack on an English
writer that the character of this point
is V another method of a letters of the
town of whoever told it from unexpected
so you see that it doesn't really make
sense because the context is only as
long as three words and so it completely
loses the structure of a sentence after
that and there is no meaning whatsoever
what we use now is a recurrent neural
network so recurrent neural network is
essentially a neural network that has
connections going forward in time and
that means that as the net non-aqueous
iterated on successive words and
produces new words it maintains a hidden
state presentation of the of a sentence
so far so for instance for the sentence
the cat sat on the mat we can imagine
that we starts with a hit no network
initialized with some hidden state and
then we propagate forward of the
embedding of the first world v we added
to the hidden state and from there we
can generate probabilities of the
following word so what something that
follows the sufferance is the cat and
then we propagate it forward and add new
words soaked at the sat on the mat this
is how they will Network works when it's
iterated forward to when it's inferring
a new sentence to train it what we do is
that we take an existing corpus of
sentences and we make we feed as inputs
to the neural network the actual in
words encountered involves sentences for
instance in the movie dialogue and then
we correct the outputs at every time
step and propagate the error back into
the neural network
and this and the specific kind of
non-degree texture that we use is a long
short-term memory I won't go too much
into details but it's essentially the
state of the art today that's used by
every single search engine to do machine
translation or speech recognition and
the advantage of long short memory is
that it has additional mechanisms for
the neural network not to forget
information all the time
and to handle longer complexes but of
course this is not enough to actually
help to generate good candidates so one
thing that we added was using topic
models topic models or just statistics
of words that can be found in different
documents and for instance and this is
an totally unsupervised algorithm you
can specify beginning the number of
topics that you want and it produces
then collections of words corresponding
to the most likely words given that
latent topic which is discovered by the
algorithm and if you look at those six
for topics for instance topic six
homicide offending prosecutor NYPD
forensics and sure it looks a bit
corresponds to a topic of associated
with police detective stories and then
this following topics my sensei yakuza
hotel
Yoko Honda okay that's more likely most
likely a samurai movie etc and those
topics are used as an additional input
conditioning the neural network that we
use and this helps essentially to
generate words within a domain and if I
say for instance a beginning of an
improv something about pirates or ships
it's more likely to sample from
vocabulary corresponding to to see and
unpack all and we use the vocabulary of
about a hundred thousand words so we
also added this physical avatar which is
essentially an off chef of a shelf robot
that we bought at easy robot it has 16
servos and we control the angles
and to summarize I can for this part I
would say that it's a personal
do-it-yourself project that's quite fun
we do really instead of yet research but
it's not research per se we used as
implementation language Java Script
c-sharp that's for the front and
interface and the neural networks are in
Lua and torch we use some Python code
for proposing with data set and oh and
of course we had to train it on in the
cloud on a powerful GPU machine for ever
month and I would encourage you to try
this at home using Python and tensorflow
which have very good tutorials on how to
build language models so when and where
well we've been performing at various
places I started performing July 2016 at
a pub in the London and was lucky to
perform at the British Academy on during
an evening on love sex and marriage with
a robot we had dating scenes with a
robot Karina I decided to challenge
ourselves and we went for his
transatlantic artificial intelligence
show binary - where we use two different
projections and two different laptops he
was connecting from a different theater
he had his own audience and some of our
audience's Washington lieutenant Lee -
shows livestream with two robots
performing it was absolutely mad and I
would give you some more details of the
world and we met physically Kurenai in
the Edinburgh at the Fringe Festival
which is the largest performing arts
festival in the world where we are a
class physically on the same stage and
have been also going over fringe
festivals after that so he I can show
some highlight there in the sky the Sun
and in front of it crosses the moon and
around the moon you see the sweet ring
of the Sun why look right at it for it
brings you good luck the enlightened one
he communicates with the
pagan gods in the sky and he sends us
signals we know we should be afraid of a
thunder but we shouldn't be afraid of a
Sun of course many of them did not come
to the room tomorrow you can see the sky
once and for all if we can't make it to
the moon tomorrow we'll be able to see
the sky and well thank you very much
enlighten when you've taught us so much
one day we'll make it to the moon if
this planet is not to be our last it
would make sense that that one is our
next it is the sky and the universe the
Sun so there is a lot of justification
going oh how do i skeeve that thing yes
so now the question is why we're doing
this well to make full of ourselves
what's one thing the other one is we
always should do a most obvious thing
that's our personal philosophy and my
personal spiration for doing this is the
explicit corpses or so-called cadaver
gazecki a game played by the Surrealists
but game consisted in which donkey
marcel duchamp jack play they're sitting
around a table and writing one word or
one sequence of words and giving that
piece of paper to somebody else who
would read only that and write on
another piece of paper another world
then give that piece of paper to a third
person and so on and so essentially it
could be seen as a diagram of use used
to generating sentences and for the
artists that was a way of expressing
something
going in the collective subconscious and
the most famous example of this is look
at that over X key waha revenue for the
exquisite corpse will drink the new wine
which is nonsensical but there is
something beautiful on it and an example
of visual kinetic scheme the so as I
said improv is about doing the most
obvious thing and it's surprisingly hard
because typically when people try to do
improv they try to be funny on the stage
but actually it's much better if they
not try to and the typical behavior to
adopt is to essentially overcome any
social fears and just let them let
oneself go and the kief Johnstone again
had this very great sentence I began to
think of children not as immature adults
but of adults as atrophied children or
Gio Bernard said nobody knew how to do
this when you were six years old all the
stuff just got in the way a little bit
of inspiration came one to me when I was
working this working on search query
auto-completion for a search engine and
when you think about it if you start
typing the first letter I the search
engine may suggest Instagram ITV player
indeed iPlayer so the mostly the the
most likely suggestions given no context
and then as you add additional letters
it restricts it makes the context more
obvious and it restricts the choice of
possibilities and then those Momo
statistically likely answers or
impossible suggestions or impossible
quiz in Pettigrove as a game I guess
Imperial War Museum Imperial College
London well I did that search from
London and then improv it might suggest
improv classes London Improv Everywhere
improv comedy so the search engine
essentially uses a statistical language
model or just a study feel free to
suggest and most obvious which means
most relevant query
given a context that is the query prefix
location time of day the previous
searches sometimes and improvisers do
essentially the same thing they just
listen to the cues that of their on the
stage when they perform and that cue can
be anything that is said by the other
person it can be something that somebody
has said much earlier it can be really
cooperation can be body of language body
language fear of mine so this project
made us think a lot about the whole
notion of artificial creativity and my
personal opinion is that so far we have
not achieved at all with one single
exception artificial creativity and the
only exception is this mode of free
reinforcement learning based neural
network algorithm that was trained to
play the game of go and to master it and
in the latest version of it alphago was
trained without any human input so the
only inputs consisted in 19 by 19 bolts
and the targets were the next movements
but those tags are not provided the only
thing that was provided to the algorithm
was the reward weather weather vane was
losing or winning the game and it had to
come out by itself with winning
strategies and one can say that in that
very limited world which consists of a
board of 19 by 19 that algorithm was
trained to solve a task and managed to
do it and it did show some creativity
that surprised human go experts who are
watching the game but in order to scale
that up to the world where we live would
probably be exponentially complex right
another example that was published two
weeks ago is this paper on generative
address our networks which were trained
to generate 1 megapixel images from
images of celebrities and the training
of them consisted in having agram
reproduce as close as possible
the input but then also produce an
output but that was indistinguishable
from Maria photographs and that agram
can then be taken to general in a pure
generative mode to generate the picture
in pixel space so those two first two
photos will or do not correspond to
actual pictures but we are completely
synthetic and were generated by the
algorithm however that algorithm is
created only the pixel space it has no
idea what is actually behind the picture
that is generated and why that picture
can be considered as valid by a human
being so yes so this leaves leads to the
obvious obstacle of performing the
machine and as a friend of ours tweeted
we are doing a comedy of speech
recognition errors we had lots of
failures and for instance when
transatlantic show since we had so much
tech on the stage - mixing tables -
laptops and internet connections to
handle the robot literally crushed and
burned which was quite bad I had to
replace some of the motors and it was
convinced Ian of a night where a
reviewer came to rate our show but as
Thomas Watson said if you want to
succeed you have to double your failure
rate so as you may have seen alex is an
exercise and justification when the
Machine gives difficult suggestions we
can call it real-time dynamic problem
solving and essentially that's what
improvisers try to do all the time and
curry learned something great from his
improv features when should be
improvised should be able to improvise
with even a non improviser actor and
still make them look good on the stage
well of course vary from uncanny valley
that we know luckily the human in robot
places are safely in the toy domain
environment so I think it's not scary
when we came with robot to the Edinburgh
Fringe Festival the kids in the streets
loved the robot
but then in terms of italic model we are
torn between two constraints on one hand
want to justify and make the dialogue as
grounded as possible to make it as close
as possible to real dialogue on the
other hand well we also want to exploit
the comedy in having an imperfect
dialogue and that actually actually
helps us a lot so now the doubt I think
I'm going to directly skip to the result
of that but essentially very it's a
question that was asked to me once do
you see one day a machine competing with
humans on this stage my personal answer
is no because that's not theatre is
about but okay let's just do business
and experiments
can I ask everybody from that side to
close their eyes yes and so just bad
side just please keep your eyes open and
look at this face okay now everybody
opens eyes so can those who have the
eyes open can you please close your eyes
keep your eyes open and if you're on
that side close your eyes look at my
face and finally those who were who
never had the eyes open please open your
eyes
and everybody else closes the eyes look
at her face so what did you think of the
other face was her face sad was a face
happy was it was her last expressed no
you you're sleeping
okay no mind so left Kuleshov found this
very disquieting effect that essentially
the same face being shown different
different contexts seem to express
different emotions for the observer and
that was of course used about because
the perception of the actors emotion the
screen depend on the sequence and that's
used for montage but the question is is
that really it could we we must be
fooled by synthetic actors well I
actually don't think so because acting
is more than just the appearance of
pixels on the screen an actor and that's
what Stanislavski explained to us is
basically learning to go into the
character and to create thanks to the
Stanislavski system a new being from the
script and from himself or herself to
create the character in the play and
that means that the character
incorporates their own emotional memory
and maybe maybe doing some animal work
and they do it in such a way that
everything for them becomes instinctive
and at the end of the day they express
essentially something true about
themselves when they act on the stage on
the screen so and the reason why we go
to see plays in the theatre is
essentially to learn something about
ourselves as humans and living in London
I've I've been able to see a great place
I discuss political events or friends
insane that was talking about the Sun or
Lebanon what was cutting about
colonialism so what lessons do we learn
from this whole experiment so far well
first of all I'm going to skip the
Wizard of Oz experiment first of all
what we learned is that technology can
be used as creative constraint and as
the musical beyond defense showed where
lyrics were generated by a recurrent
neural network a musical battle stage in
West End
what made this musical watchable was the
performance and the human curators and
the same goes for the short movie Sun
spring where the actor is Hollywood
actors interpreting the script
and many of examples of using technology
in improv let's say yes Android which is
a similar set up two hours but it's
humans who are speaking and they get
suggestions from the machine via UPS or
blast-proof where improvisers have a
glass giving those suggestions
essentially AI can be used to generate
narratives and the human in the loop can
use it to build a very beautiful
narrative and we've seen for instance an
actress playing on stage in Edinburgh
with a theory an iPhone with a serious
istant and we take aways of all our work
is that well first of all hugging is fun
but we know that then AI can use as
creative to constraint the audience can
easily suspend this belief surprisingly
the audience is quite has quite
expectations about composition childhood
agents which tends to be nullified when
we see them and finally theater is to
talk about ourselves thank you
