Adam who's speaking about game on which
is an open source tool that teaches
people how to develop microservices so
what are the core aims of game on okay
so I mean game on it says open source
project the idea that a lot of people to
learn about Mike reserve sees want to do
micra services but the problem is that
you go away you read some books of
googling you check things out and you
only try and do it for your very often
left which is a very simple hello world
example or or an application it's only a
single service and what game on wants to
do is give you an actual real working
like services environment so you can
come along you can start with very
simple almost hello world type concepts
as you get stuck in an extra giving too
much services framework and architecture
but then you can fast-track your winter
sort of giving into more of the issues
that are around microservices things
like eventual consistency and aspects
like that and it's based around a text
adventure the answers quite an easy
thing for people to get hold up with an
idea I mean it's a really good way of
sort of thinking about microsemi still
can think of and envision a rooms a
service there's one thing that's one
thing well that's your micro service and
now you can make a room do things but
you do its part of the Micra socials
crane work so you're walking as the game
player you're walking into a room and
having experienced than going on to
another room yes as a player you your
hectic transitioning through Microsoft's
as we own as the sort of work or the
infrastructure in the platform but and
then we call out to your rooms and we
move players into your room for you so
then you have control you can interact
with the player but it means you don't
have to address issues like okay what
happens with the player logs in from my
phone and from a laptop at the same time
and that translates into my clothes are
you know you've got people coming in the
same user from different directions
different entry points I do actually
work out that's the same user so the
game has got a ventures with Al Mubarak
adventures in the game that take you
through these harder problems so we
don't try and hide them but what we want
to do is fast track you into the game
world get you up and running
and then say okay now open up and what
what would you like to do you know what
things would you'd like to learn about
so I'm guessing it has some core
services that you can then expand on in
order to learn as you want to yeah
absolutely again the whole point is you
can dip in and out if you just really
want to be a mic so you know tryouts and
Mike's Subs you can start the room level
you know you can write you can plug it
in and the thing is because it plugged
into a real live system you can do it
wherever you want you don't need to try
and stand up you know a big
infrastructure in your own network or
whatever you can use us but then you say
people can in transition into learning
back daily authorization service so
we're showing you how to do so for sign
on so everyone still in log in with
google or facebook me once you go mac
service you know what used to be your
enterprise registry for people you know
using something that's what people are
allowed to do it's gone away now it was
like Facebook and Google RV you know
you're authenticated on meeting the
internet and you login with that
everyone what's log in with their
Facebook ok don't want to register
account there an account there so our
automotive for example shows you how we
actually do the coding behind that so
again it comes out that principal a lot
of people tell you that's what they want
you'll find articles describing the flow
we're share with you the code that
actually makes that happen that's one
for Lisa it is I mean it gives the Java
developers the ability to actually see
the code that makes these things where
developers want coke right yeah they
don't want any other they want pictures
hello picture to start with let the end
of day is the code that's going to make
something happen and you want to see a
non trivial example of working coach and
that's what we go in game once read the
or service we have a map service which
talks are caps TB when it's running
locally or talks are cloud service when
it's running guys so again to judge busy
the data interaction specifically
storage but also bringing in microsomes
like reading your conflict from the
environment for example breaking those
habits that if you're coming from a
monolithic world but being as you know
always thinking oh my data is in my file
system that's attached to me it doesn't
work when you take your microjet with a
foul yeah so you start looking at where
those pain points are going to be and we
show you how to actually effectively
conflicts in the environment we have a
sweet service this is our look at what
is surveillance so that's quite a cool
thing people want to leave a like if
you're very trendy right now I mean and
there's and so what we'll do is sweet if
we show you how to use it's based on our
open whisk technology but the concept
and what we want to share with concepts
service so what we do is sleep if we
actually go round on a time basis and
actually sing the rooms just say you
know are you alive you alive are you
alive because it was a lonely people
plug in and they'll stand something up
and after a while the roommate disappear
or develop a fault or something so we
use the sweep as a service mechanism by
which we did have a long-running process
we want something to run it's fast and
quick and periodic comes out and it
reports back in scores of rooms and then
it comes back into the room is weak we
call it a sick room the room is sick we
take it out we take it out the game yep
we have to self-manage it when we use
service but for now as an example in
there at the service and we have no we
were except that you know max has done
all in one language polyglot world so
again game on has rear examples in other
languages such as no javascript and
Swift ok so then from there you see what
how do these actually communicate over
to other Mike serves no languages and
start to realize and look at things like
oh ok so agnostic API just rest doesn't
matter 1 i'm running feeding two and a
half freedom to pick the technology i
want to pick from here and we're that's
based on that's what he was going to
write the service knows how to write
stuff in or you know that that
technology or that approaches is best
practice what we're trying to do that
gives you the freedom to do it and we
show how these things all interact
within within this framework of of a
text adventure game but underneath
looking what it takes to allow you to
plug things in and and run all the
services as well those are disappear the
core services we do have everything
there is a get booked so it's a working
sauce it's all sources and get up and
there's a gift book that describes all
the things in there as well and the
advantage you adventure you can
undertake there you go there's
definitely a huge nostalgic appeal
behind
adventure it's really actually that's
the thing we also found out that's
really interesting is that it it forces
creativity on G suddenly you haven't got
some push button she hung got another
thing to do and you and you just with
that text line so for example we wanted
to get it game on running with her in a
room on a raspberry pi so we did that
find the drugs it's a straightforward
then we had a pike am that came with it
so we have to take pictures but now how
do we do the pictures and had week you
know how do we get that into a text
adventure so what we do is we created
another service that takes an image in
crazy black CR oh that's cool now the a
secure comes back in their room now you
guys the room with the picture room when
we have the camera why that work you
know where we are you can take a picture
and it will come out and ask you out on
the screen I would love to see that
that's really really cool and it was
brilliant because it that sort of
interface horses creativity but let us
explore quickly grabbing standing up
another microservice and bring it into
the thing now obviously we know we
needed to build a pipeline and some
other things we came with it but it
shows that quick pickup of other
technology and the picture room so a lot
of static both that and the more static
version of a picture image got some well
have faces on their sons a skier that's
on the github repo as well so good you
can see it looking forward to playing
with it yeah it's good fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
