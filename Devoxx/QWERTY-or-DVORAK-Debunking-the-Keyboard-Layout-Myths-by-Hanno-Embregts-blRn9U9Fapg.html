talk thank you for choosing this session
over all the other ones my name is Anna
and I'm going to talk to you for the
next 15 minutes about a few keyboard
layouts and the myths that surround
these a little bit about myself my name
is Hana I'm from the Netherlands I have
been a Java software engineer for over
10 years and I have been touch typing on
the Kirti layout for 19 years now
because I learned to do that when I was
13 years old and I'm working at the
company called
info support okay so the year is 1868
and typewriters actually looked like
this this is an electric printing
Telegraph and it was equipped with a
piano like keyboard the keys were
arranged in alphabetical order so the
letters a to n were arranged left to
right on the Black Keys and on the white
keys the letters O to Z were arranged in
right left order so this is actually one
of the first keyboard layouts that
existed so let's have a closer look at
these piano line keys and to me this
actually looks quite organized you know
there's no debates on where should each
key be because it's well very well
ordered just in alphabetical order now
ten years later so it's 1878 a typical
keyboard looks like this now the middle
row still looks kind of logical you know
you can see the D F G H JKL that's kind
of logical still a bit alphabetical but
what the flippin hell happened to the
rest I mean that's that's insane right
it's like they they cover the wall up in
glue then invited a group of monkeys to
the room and they asked them to throw
some random letters at wall right let's
see where the letters serve would stick
to the wall it's just insane and the
worst thing is we still use this one on
a daily basis I don't know why we do
that it's insane and any Formula one
fans in the room what would Sebastian
Vettel's say about this madness any
thoughts
you would say I mean seriously this is
what he says every time he crashes or
some other opponent does something
stupid I mean seriously this is insane
now I'm not sure about you guys I think
it's insane and Sebastian that's also
think it's insane but what do you guys
think about it so let's find out for a
bit um I follow this link I will get to
an online folding slide and if you like
would like to participate in the folks
you can grab your mobile phone go to
mentor calm and use the code that is
listed at the top of the screen you know
if you want your opinion hurt of course
if you if you want to refrain from
voting this also again it's a free
country right so I'll try to join in the
fun what keyboard leh I do you use at
the moment I'm guessing I know what the
answer is but let's do the vote anyway
so my vote is toric mr. Frye's there
right when I when I did this slide I
expected lots of QWERTY answers I'll
call my guy or girl went well done good
for you right 45 QWERTY typers another
Dvorak welcome to the club yeah this
this is what I expected yeah so let's do
another voting one because I have still
I the second question to ask you guys
why are the keys on a QWERTY keyboard
arranged in that particular order is it
to slow down typists is it to prevent
gems in early typewriters maybe it is
because the word and the brand name
typewriter and can be typed on the top
row only if this is really possible you
should try it out or is it because
telegraph operators use a used
alphabetical order for years and
proposed the new layout because it was
easier for them most people think it's
to prevent jams
well actually a lot of these answers are
our false effects or it's not really
there are no real proof that it is true
and I would like to talk you through a
few of them and see what I could find in
my reaches because I tried switching to
rock and I read some sting things about
the QWERTY layout and this is what I
found in the process so the first myth
myth hopes or I need to switch my tab
again here we go the first myth created
to slow typists down well actually this
is very questionable because there were
no false typist at the time you know the
first touch typist was Frank Edward
McGowan he started developing his touch
type typing method in 1881 so this is
like eight years after the invention of
the QWERTY layout and this mr. McGurn
could type 79 words per minute so that's
quite false I can't get to that speed
but he could and maybe it was created to
slow telegraph operators down well this
is also very unlikely because the more
senders these were the devices that are
attached to your to your input methods
were quite fast they were almost
constantly waiting for new inputs in
this paper there's a description about a
typewriter demonstration so it was
demonstrated to a potential customer and
a Morse receiver almost Beck the
operator to please type faster because
it was going too slow and it wasn't
really wasn't really a good
demonstration due to the fact that it
was very slow at typing was very slow
the next myth it was created to prevent
jams in early typewriters well this is a
an example of a typewriter basket in
which the letters are already arranged
in QWERTY order and you should notice
that for example the T and the H are
opposite of each other because th is a
very common combination of letters in
the English language so the miss says
that the most cone combination of
letters were placed as far away from
each other as possible
to prevent this gem anything now this
this table is from the paper below and
it lists the most common letter
combinations in the English language
which is denoted by the frequency per
million words and the distance on the on
the real of the letters on the
typewriter basket and th is a good
example because they sit opposite of
each other so the distance is 180
degrees I'm I'm very amazed by the fact
that er which is the second most common
combination in the English language
they are almost next to each other just
just 16 degrees you can see in the real
where they are quite close to each other
so I'm not sure why they even did that
why they put it so close together and
the same goes for more of these
combinations so these are quite okay
they are also quite far from each other
but then IMT is also very close to each
other so I wonder if these common
combinations were meant to play be
placed as far as possible from each
other
why are there why are there so close yet
in the qwerty arrangement also so let's
zoom out for a bit this is the story of
vnr and why they got switched anyway
this is an example of a typewriter 1873
so this already has some QWERTY signals
in place you know this is this is a the
the dots are key and the the are key is
right here so these were world even
switch yet and sorry this which only
happens because of input from the
telegraphers so so they they found it
very it wasn't very easy for them to use
this this period key next to the e they
wanted to use the are the are next to
the e so they could type the the ER
combination more quickly also the S
letter which is between between the a
and the D in our modern QWERTY one it
was placed between the Z and the AE
because in the Morse signal
the combination for s and E was the same
more signal as Z and it was very hard to
distinguish these two and so they wanted
the s between the Z and East to be able
to quickly correct it when this was
received at the receiving end so I'm not
going to say this myth the debunked but
it's it's questionable for me the third
myth it was created so that the word
typewriter could be typed by using the
top row only well this is some sort of a
salesman myth I guess because the brand
name wasn't wasn't actually type right
it was Sholes and Glidden typewriter in
May 1873 so and and of course we saw in
the previous slide that the R key moved
to the top row but the hyphen between
type and writer never moved at all
also these letter shows were Clayton
they don't appear on the top row
exclusively they require multiple rows
and these sales demonstration weren't
even done by just a salesman pecking out
these this typewriter word they were
done by sending and receiving Morse
Telegraph which is also in the display /
so I guess this is an old wives tale
about the salesman so actually can we
conclude the telegraph operators
creators QWERTY according to their
preference well I can't be 100% sure but
in the research that I did I tend to
agree with this one I've made an
overview of all the earth the changes
that were made to QWERTY so in November
1868 the first typewriter existed and
mr. Schultz was the inventor of this one
and it actually looked like like this so
this is the piano arrangement that we
saw earlier after that in 1870 mr.
Porter the first customer asked for
numerals and punctuation marks so there
were 10 keys edit and by this time it
looked like somewhat like this so still
some alphabetical order but there are
numerals and also punctuation marks now
a few a few months later the second
customer was Harrison and also Craig
they asked to do the Q in the W on the
upper row and the S between E and Z for
the reasons I just mentioned because
these more signals are very much alike
and they would like to correct it more
quickly now it looked like this with a
dot between the E and the T
and afterwards people from Remington who
also were a customer of the shoals of
the inventor of the put the I between
eight and nine because the I was used to
to type the one signal symbol because
there's no one in this and also no zero
they used the iron and the O and in
order to type years more efficiently
like 1800 or 1900 they place it between
the eight and the nine also the zero or
the O here so that you could do like
nineteen hundred very quickly and
finally the Y was moved to the center of
the top row which was also done by shows
himself and this is where we arrived to
the QWERTY layout that we all know right
now well except for the M but that
change didn't happen until later so what
if you would decide to move to Dvorak
and I'm not saying that you should but I
did just because I wanted to learn
something from will you be a faster
typist a little bit about the Doric
simplified keyboard it was patented by
dr. August Dvorak in 1936 and it was
invented to reduce finger motion and
typing errors and it claims to increase
your typing speed more on this later it
also claims to reduce your RSI injuries
so yeah yeah your rapid finger movement
is issues now this is a keyboard that is
well supported on all major operating
systems so that shouldn't keep you at
all the word really intended your
fingers to move as little as possible so
he put the most common letters in the
English language and as much in the home
row as possible so 70% of the the
letters you're going to need while
typing English are in the home row so
you don't need to move your fingers for
8 months dr. August work really hated
the bottom row because he thought that
your your fingers would really start to
hurt more often if you use the bottom
row very much so he tried to avoid that
only very few used letters are on the
bottom row and a few are on the top row
most letter in QWERTY are on the top row
actually there this is a heat map this
illustrates my point the the red is used
most lovely is the most common letter in
the English language and the O also
quite a lot so you can see in this heat
map that for accuses mostly the home row
not the top row so let's finger movement
there how did I try to master Dvorak
this is how you should do it according
to me you should start by memorizing the
different locations of the letters and
just practice until you can touch type
them so you don't need to look at your
keyboard anymore I used it this website
this is a Dutch website where you can
just start out very easy and try to do
more difficult stuff later on it's like
this it's very small sorry so you can
you can you can say I'm going to do a
lesson just a home row or more keys or
the entire alphabet and you can also map
your keyboard so you don't even have to
configure anything in your OS you can
just map your keys to work if you want
this is a great way to start I guess I
liked it anyway
then you need to increase your typing
speed so just type on the full rock more
often this is what I did I kept some
some data on my progress for the last
six months I started at left side of the
the graph which was like March this year
or something and I ended in November
where we are now and this is a list of
my speed the blue bars are QWERTY so I
started around four hundred characters
accurately because you know I have 19
years of typing experience and I kept
practicing QWERTY because I don't want
to be yeah I don't want to be rendered
useless right when when there's no
keyboard available so I I tried to
practice the QWERTY also and I kept
fairly stable you know at the end I'm
still 400 characters or something and I
started with work with like one 150 and
gradually over time I managed to
increase it to around 3:15 through 25
which is which is around 62 words per
minute so mine quite I'm quite I'm quite
a content with that I can do my job just
fine you know when I really need to to
push for deadlines I use QWERTY still
but for work is is okay for my everyday
use so let's conclude on the QWERTY
layout it wasn't never really intended
to slow down typist and there's not
really much evidence for
solving the jamming problem because said
is the second most common combination is
still very close to each other layout
was attempt to believe it was optimized
for Telegraph for users and on the
Touareg layout I I know from firsthand
experience it is less tiring to use this
one extensively so my fingers hurt a lot
less but I'm very prone to errors and
injuries so that's that's good for my
case but mastering it will take a lot of
time is photograph after six months of
of exercising I'm at like 3/4 of my
QWERTY speed so not it's not equal yet
so you can't really be sure that for ago
make you type any faster at least not in
half a year or so so I'm going to give
it another six months and I buy I will
be at my queer to speed level but I I
can't be sure
so should you switch well don't switch
if you fingers never heard from typing
because this is the main benefit for me
it they don't hurt any anymore while
using for work so then switch if your
fingers never hurt on QWERTY or if
you're not willing to invest a year
mastering Dvorak if you're not willing
to invest this well don't switch at all
you know just just stick to your core to
your whole neck or whatever using right
now and do switch if your fingers are
killing you from time to time and you
want to to give them a little more rest
and also if you have a year to spare to
crank up your rack typing speed you can
also switch one question very quickly
because we're running out of time yeah
yeah
yeah so the question is could you
elaborate on having these two maps in
your mind how you just switch from one
to another well when I have typed for a
called a and then I need to type QWERTY
the first minute I'm a bit lost yeah so
this problem happens but off for a
minute I got used to it again
and then then it's okay and also a good
tip is please keep practicing your
QWERTY skills so in my case I use Dvorak
at work and in the when when you have an
hour to spare in the evening I mean I do
want to do some freestyle programming
just for a hobby is QWERTY so like an
hour a day QWERTY and the rest of the
time I'd work with Doric and that way it
works fine for me so yeah if you just
can't get enough the slides are up at
SlideShare and you can also ask me
questions on Twitter or a via email and
for now our time is up so no time for
questions right now thank you very much
