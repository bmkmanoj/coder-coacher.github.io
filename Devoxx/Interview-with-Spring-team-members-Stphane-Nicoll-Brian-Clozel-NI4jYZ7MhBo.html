to Brian and Stephan of the spring team
so you very fun slightly different
things so Brian it leave you more in the
Spring Framework areas can you tell us
what developers can expect with spring 5
so we touched last year a lot about
about Java 8 being behind spring 5 and
about how useful that was what else can
people expect yeah exactly with with
spring 5 we've been working on the
reactive parts of spring for two years
before spring 5 came out and so with
spring 5 you can expect to have a brand
new web framework which is called spring
web plots and this is not an old versus
new situation so web folks won't replace
existing spring MVC applications but
it's rather a new framework to address a
new use cases which are more about
streaming or scalability for reactive
applications with a dealing with a lot
of latency so this new framework will
definitely help developers in new ways
with use cases that are more and more
common because you're dealing with
streaming or because your deal you're
deploying an application in a cloud
environment where you have to deal with
many remote services with a network that
you don't like fully maintained yourself
say the least so you have to deal with
latency and you have to be able to to
handle the load
and have like efficient applications in
those environments so that can be super
useful especially for those use cases so
web flex is definitely a very good
addition and it's not just that part the
framework we integrated quite tightly
with the project reactor so which is a
reactive streams implementation and
reactive and reactive API as well with
operators so you can create brand-new
type of of applications that you
couldn't really do previously with
spring so that's pretty pretty exciting
so basically what brand explained those
new type of applications those new
paradigms you you basically need an
infrastructure you need something that
helps you build those applications and
Springwood is doing that for for quite
some time now so what you should expect
whispering good to is is that those
those new types of applications you'll
get also all kinds of development tools
so developer tools the actuators or the
management of your applications
configuration support so everything that
you know about spring boots to build an
MVC based app you can you will find the
same kind of support or what fraction
what are they kind of top features the
weakness but in spring five and then in
spring what are the features that
you you think you personally will get
the most out of orange oh I personally
really liked the new web client because
even though rest template is is quite
famous and used in many applications
it's got its limitations and I like it
personally but but web client is a a
brand new HTTP client that you can use
and you can even use it in spring MVC
applications and it's it's a it's got a
super nice API it's more in line with
streaming use cases as well and we we
tailored it in a way that you can use it
even in a testing environment so for
example in boot
we've got a nice integration with that
client where we can build it or prepare
it for you but at the same time you've
got a very nice experience with it in
your in your tests and your tests so you
can use it just like you would use for
mocking test with mock MVC so testing
directly your your web layer without
starting the server but with a simple
configuration configuration change you
can test it against a real running HTTP
server but you you don't have to change
otherwise the how you test your
application it's just the same API the
same code but you can just I mean mostly
a lot of applications are testing
integration testing with the live server
the application but with that you can
just try try things out and see if you
can just test the the web layer without
starting the whole server and that's
obviously way faster and it's it's it's
got a nice API and and I think a lot of
people using spring MVC will like it and
we made sure that you can integrate that
in spring MVC applications because the
reactive types that the client is
returning by by by nature you can use
those types as well in spring MVC it's
obviously not as well integrated as
spring web phlox applications where it's
built in but we've made sure that you
can still use that web client in
in many places in spring and I think a
lot of people will like it
what I love about the spring five is the
fact that you have many new options on
the table so if if you want to go
reactive if you want to build a reactive
based webapps then we have an option for
that if you would like to define your
web application programmatically so if
you don't want to use annotations for
your controller for instance we also
have a new option for that and we've
we've made that to a point where
functional api's are more integrated in
within the framework and with the
support of this new language cutting
which is quite popular these days so
that's definitely you have plenty of
plenty of options on the table and we
also reaching out to new communities
which is awesome because those new
communities bring new ideas things that
we've never thought before and I think
that's also improving the the portfolio
as a whole so that's quite interesting</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
