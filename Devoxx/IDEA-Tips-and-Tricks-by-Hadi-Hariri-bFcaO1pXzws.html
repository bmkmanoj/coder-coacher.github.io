and tricks any of you here using
IntelliJ anyone not using IntelliJ ok
how many years have you been using
IntelliJ five six seven eight nine nine
years huh okay if you don't learn
anything in the next half hour don't ask
for your money back okay and I'll make
it short and sweet
because there is apparently free beer so
I'm the only thing between free beer and
free beer and wine right so this is a
one-hour talk I'll randomly select some
tricks that I'll show you in half an
hour you've got the long hour one hour
version of it online but every time I do
give this talk I try and add a few new
tips and tricks so you have to watch the
entire thing to know what's different
from all of the previous recordings
right I'm not going to tell you what's
new that's how I keep my audiences in
the room that and blackmail so if you're
not familiar one thing I want to point
out is there's this little thing over
here called the JetBrains toolbox how
many of you have heard of that okay so
this is basically our new way of
distributing software to you will
provide you updates uninstalled installs
you can install multiple versions of the
same tool so you can see that I have
like writer a nightly version and writer
EAP you can even name them you go to
settings over here and you can in fact
define memory configuration heap size
you know when your intelligence writing
slow you just add more memory to it if
you don't have enough memory you by a
faster laptop and you can even edit the
java virtual machine settings here okay
so it tries to make all of that simple
and of course we're going to that lock
look binds into your jab range accounts
so all of the license management and all
of that
is also taking place here okay fantastic
install it highly recommended and the
best part of it is it's free right which
is about the only free thing you get
from us mana there's a couple more free
seeker okay we give out free brochures
at the booth as well right
so one of one other thing before I
forget to mention a lot of times you're
going to do see me do shift command a
and that is a look up so if ever I don't
know keyboard shortcut I will pretend
that I don't know it and I really don't
know it you can do shift command a and
look for it so if I say shift command a
we factor it will show me the action we
factor and that'll not only shows the
keyboard binding that also allows me to
invoke that action so I can say refactor
this and invoke that okay so that's very
useful if you don't know the keyboard
shortcuts there is also a little plugin
that I use which is called presentation
assist so if you go to plugins and click
on install JetBrains plug-in and you say
presentation and that's not there so you
say browse repositories and you say
presentation assistant now the
difference is anything that's under the
jetbrains plug-in means that it's
officially maintained by us anything
that's on the in browse repositories
means it's one of the 1500 plugins that
now we have on the JetBrains repository
this one in particular is actually
developed by a colleague of mine that's
also in charge of the IntelliJ platform
so you got a good pretty good chance
that it's going to be working for you
so we'll restart that I do this on
purpose so that you see how fast the
boot time is right so now when I do
shift command a you can see that it
shows the shortcut at the bottom okay so
this is useful for presentation that
it's useful for when you're doing pet
programming because often when you do
pair programming people next to your
like what keyboard shortcut did you
press now you can just say shut up and
look at the screen okay what else oh
there's another thing here which I
normally show last because if I showed
this first people would just walk out of
the session so I'm feeling lucky today
that you won't walk out and you go help
and you click on productivity guide how
many of you have clicked on this
for in your life alright three so this
isn't a PDF this is actually a
interactive dialogue that shows you a
bunch of different features shows you
how to use it and tells you how many
times you've used it and when was the
last time you used it right so the best
thing you can do is click on used and go
through the list of Nevers and see which
features you're missing the other thing
in the help menu is called the key map
reference which we give this out of
conferences and you can actually print
it yourself on an a4 sheet and that's
basically a keyboard shortcut or don't
do that and just remember shift command
a and the other ones you'll pick up okay
so any questions so far
that was really easy right okay one
other thing that you'll see that I'm
using is probably the most important
thing you'll learn today in this talk is
let me see if I can find anything let's
go over here I'm going to create a
column file something and let's say main
and then let's say a numbers equals 1 to
100 and then on that we'll say numbers
filter a X X is greater than 10 okay now
that's called in awesome programming
language this isn't about Kotlin
physical subliminal advertising but take
a look at this have you seen that right
that is actually a negative - great -
that okay that's fear of code and font
ligatures right so if you do on fonts
enable font ligatures and you get all of
those awesome little things so that when
I do this or I do
if numbers is not now
that cool people are you awake
I need emotions here I need feedback I
need to feed off of you if you're just
sitting at me saying what the hell is
this crazy guys saying or doing it's not
going to work and I'm the one that has
three beers before coming in okay
anyway that's fine ligatures that's
probably that that that that's a feature
that we save so that we can continue
getting you guys to pay for the
subscriptions right anyway right okay so
let's learn something because that is
not learning okay command o goes to type
right you're all familiar with that
so if I write extract functional
parameter that works and if I write
extract functional parameter that also
works which is camelcase completion
right shift command o goes to file so I
can do for example in bar boolean will
take me to the file you can also put the
brackets and say for example refactoring
and now will take them to the
refactoring folder okay so you can use
the go-to file to also look up for
actual folders if I do shift command oh
that will take me and I write index for
instance I will show me everything
that's index right or if I say get ID
that's going to show me everything
that's get ID because this is Java and
everyone and its mother has a get ID so
what happens if I want to go to a get ID
that is part of a specific class what I
can actually do is say for instance
let's say I want to go to I don't know
let's see what what get IDs we have here
we have get ID get ID and let's say we
want to go to order events so I could
say order event go to the type and then
here I can now do get ID or I could just
kind of come on the structure when you
and show you the get ID here structure
window command shift and then here you
can see that I can also start and say
get ID okay
or get order ID and that will take me to
the actual thing but one faster way to
do that is to use the namespace
filtering so if I go to go to symbol I
can say for example order event right
order event get ID and that would take
me to
a get ID that belongs to order event so
I'm using the camel case completion to
specify the type and then the actual
symbol that I want to go to okay so
that's a useful thing to to use on the
file ones you can also go to a specific
line so for instance if I want to go to
line 10 of Java 8 or line 3 I can just
say Java 8 : 3 and that will take me to
line 3 which is another reason why you
don't need this silly thing over here it
just takes up valuable space and you
don't need line numbers at all
switch off line numbers you go to line
numbers show line numbers switch it off
best thing you can do ok now all of
those keyboard combinations are
fantastic and you can remember them all
or you can forget all of them and just
remember double shifts how many of you
actually know double shift that's good
so a lot of people haven't heard of
double shift and they discover it after
many years of using IntelliJ and when
you first open IntelliJ do you see
something it's a gray screen double
shift right
it proves nobody reads anything
seriously so double shift gives you all
of the same functionality if I say for
example order event you see that it
shows me an order event but it actually
shows me a little bit more than order
event it shows me recent files classes
files symbols everything anything that's
got to do with order event and we've
made this significantly fast so you
don't have to use the specific versions
you can just use double shift but it
goes beyond just going to types files
etc so if I say for example Kotlin again
some subliminal advertising it shows me
everything around Kotlin and I can tap
through the different sections right
which is quite useful if you press the
left key cursor key so let's go to a few
things and let's double shift and say
for example show document message etc 9
if I double shift you can see that if I
go back with the cursor keys is showing
me all of my history as well right and
you can do other things so here for
instance you notice that I don't have
this thing called the navigation bar
right I don't have this activated this
is really good
because it gives me contextual
information so I can like click on plug
in and see all of the folders there and
when here I can even compress command N
and create a new file in that specific
folder so it's really really useful but
first of all notice and I'm using the
mouse and it sucks
don't use the mouse first thing you do
with IntelliJ is throw your mouse away
if you have something like a MacBook
with a touchpad smash it with a hammer
just don't use the mouse what I can do
is switch this off because I value my
real estate so I'm going to switch that
off and then I can invoke the navigation
bar anywhere right by pressing function
out left of course this is the OS X
keyboard mapping you can use whatever
else keyboard mapping you want there and
from here again I get that navigation
now this you saw that I switched off and
on using the keyboard but I can using
the menu but I can also do it through
search everywhere so I can say show
navigation bar so you just write
navigation bar switch it on switch it
off
ok very useful one other thing that you
might notice here is what I don't have
tabs how many of you use tabs in
IntelliJ okay stop that ready
stop it now please if it says one thing
you take away from this room is let tabs
die in all sense even tabs versus spaces
so why don't I use tabs because they're
very inefficient for navigation right I
see a lot of people have many many tabs
open and if you go to tabs if you go to
setting' re-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-nce' tabs
you have editor tabs over here I set it
to none some people set at the top or
right or bottom and people complain when
they say I have you know when I hit 34
tabs open the pixel jumps two places to
the right well I'm sorry
don't open 34 tabs right that's not a
bug that's a feature so what you do is
you set the tabs to none and stop using
tabs really inefficient way of
navigation and what you need to do is
learn the shortcut keyboards that are
the keyboard shortcuts that I just told
you about but two more that's very
important is recent files recent edits
and recent files so
first command II that's going to show me
all of the recent files that I have been
to so for instance in VAR boolean is
going to show me everything that's
around invert boolean go to the file in
bar boolean and if I toggle it's always
going to show me the last two files that
I've been to okay now shift command it
gives me the recent files that I've
edited so these are very more much more
efficient ways for you to navigate back
and forth through your files you can
also use the command less square
brackets or command right square
brackets to navigate to the last
position whether that's a file whether
it's a position in the same file or
whether it's a position in a different
file okay so use these navigation
features and switch off tabs in fact you
take it to the next level and there's a
plug-in for Chrome which is called quick
tabs which mimics the IntelliJ behavior
so if you do command e I can also get
that same behavior with tabs there so do
that please okay right any questions no
brilliant there's any questions have you
picked up anything new yet anyone that
hasn't learnt anything there's a tool
not right what else can I show you in
the short time that we have there's a
whole bunch of other navigation features
but those are the main ones that you
want to remember then we have things
like bookmarks so you can like set
bookmarks anywhere you want toggle a
bookmarked and view the bookmark go back
to the bookmark these are all ways that
allow you to navigate very easily okay
but let's focus a little bit now on the
editing aspects so a lot of times when
people come to IntelliJ especially in
the old days when we used to have a
really really bad website you could see
things like let's bring up spring let's
bring up the database let's bring up
maven projects bring back the database
so this is the screenshot that we used
to have on the web and we would get
people that come from VI or Emacs and
say this is crazy like how am I meant to
write code when I've got 300 different
things pointing at me first thing you do
is you don't write code like this you do
shift command f12 and that completely
removes absolutely everything so that's
a very quick way to toggle to two modes
in IntelliJ when you're going to edit
two
a window view second of all close all of
these windows anyway and when you want
to bring them up you can just use this
keyboard shortcut
let me show line numbers they really bug
me anyway
you can use the short keyboard shortcut
so I can say you know command one to
bring me the project window and by the
way here you can also search on any
window inside the IntelliJ you can
always search so if I want to go to make
static I just right make static and that
takes me there one other thing in terms
of switching files here which is quite
useful notice as I navigate across this
project view it's not actually changing
to that file if I want to change to that
file I hit enter now I would have to use
the mouse to focus on that you can
actually do that with the Escape key as
well if you hit escape it will focus on
the editor window right or you can do it
in one shortcut which is just F 4 and
that will switch to that file and focus
if you want to go down the path of
having every time I navigate through one
of these it highlights the same file
which I don't recommend you can do that
with the also scroll to source ok this
option which is the reverse is quite
good which is auto scroll from source
which means that if I'm for example on
invert boolean notice how it jumps to
invert boolean on the project view
because sometimes that's useful but
there's a better way even to do that
what you do is switch this off and you
can say go to key map and here look for
select in project view ok and you can
see that I've got this assigned to a
shortcut which is I'll command L sorry
alt option L control yes these two
things so what this means is that if I
navigate for example to order events you
see that it's not jumped here but I can
just press control alt L and jump to
that in the project view right really
useful before you could do this but you
had to do it through a two step process
which is select the project view and
then select the active file in the
project view this is much more useful so
anyway going back to editing
have the entire space if you
double-click here you can see all of the
different numbers again if you don't
remember to bring up the actual window
but the recent edits that I told you
about that is actually useful for
bringing up Windows as well so if I
write spring it will bring up the spring
window okay so give yourself maximum
edit space you can always press shift F
for also to drag your editor create
another editor window and drag that onto
the second monitor you can do the split
windows here if you're doing kind of
like a TDD thing you can have like a
test on one side and then your actual
code on the other side and you can split
this as much as you want you can do a
horizontal split everything like that
okay if you are any dim users here no
okay so if you do use them there's a
plug-in which is called idea of M which
is by us plugins and you hit idea vim
and that gives you basically all of the
vent functionality for editing copying
pasting text inside IntelliJ so you get
all of the features around navigation
etc but you get some of the benefits
around them as well right selecting code
another thing how if I ask you how do
you select code right now if I say how
do you select object source what are you
going to say to me option up okay you're
not going to do this no no or this no
what you do is option up option down or
ctrl ctrl W shift ctrl W right and don't
do ctrl W in Mac because they'll close
the window so option up option down the
good thing about this is not just
selecting but it's actually semantically
selecting so if I come here on invert
boolean the first option up is going to
select invert boolean the second one is
going to select the entire class right
if I come to the method the first one is
going to select the first one is going
to kill the IDE there you go
first one is going
oh right
is it raining outside yet or not just
add some excitement to this so the first
one is going to select the method name
the second one is going to select the
method body okay and then while you have
to select it you can also move code
around so don't copy paste code don't
ever do something like this don't
because normally when you do that when
you come on page you press control X
again and you're screwed now you got an
empty clipboard if that happens shift
command V and you get your clipboard
history okay so that's how you move code
around just select it and then use the
keyboard to move it around now if you
like multiple cursors we also have
multiple cursor support so I can press
put cursors everywhere
the so-called layman's refactoring right
it's like I'll place six hundred cursors
and then rename everything manually
don't please just don't if you want to
do that go to copy cons do it they're
not here like seven copy cons you don't
have multi cursive support so you're
going to screw it anyway anyway if you
want to select a specific word let's say
for example I want to print line I can
press ctrl G ctrl G and now we'll select
all of the control GS and I can then
select that and do copy paste you also
have support for copy paste multi select
so that works good as well the other
thing you should never do is sit here
and you know manually reorder your code
and say oh I like I like my foods before
my bars and stuff like that okay you can
go to reformat code and use reformat
code to set all of your preferences if
you go to java for instance here and we
select code style if and this is a
really really big if like you have to
make a very big decision if you have
absolutely nothing better to do with
your life then you can sit through and
format your code in this way right and
go through all of the different
wonderful options seriously that is if
you really have nothing better to do
what is also useful is that if I select
the chunk of code I can also do adjust
code style settings in that selected
chunk of code and the good thing is that
it will give me only the contextual
settings that apply so I can now switch
things there and see the behavior for
that contextual sign and not have to go
through options all of the time and then
you can save these and then you know use
them as a team setting saving setting
across your entire project okay now with
completion how many of you use code
completion anyone turns it off because
they like to remember these things by
memory okay so when I create completion
let's create a
all here for instance here say Java
class completion right there's many
things that we offer in completion not
just code completion intelligence one of
them is uh templates live templates so
if you go to live templates over here
you have all of the different templates
you can create your own templates all of
the files that you see all of the
surround templates all of these things
that you see are part of the templates
that we create so when I do P SVM which
is public static void main this is one
that ships out of the box you can create
your own ones and you can put
placeholders here very very useful but
when I do things like for example buffer
reader right so I write buffer reader
buffer reader equals new and now you can
see that I get the entire list of
everything that is potentially possible
as a for me to create an instance here
but I'm not going to have a created
instance of a boolean and assign it to a
buffer reader so here's where you use
smart completion right which if it works
it will show me only things that make
sense here so in this case I can only
create an instance of a buffer reader or
line number Rita anything that inherits
from that so get used to the smart
completion as opposed to just you know
the double the normal completion so I
say for example file dot IO what is that
expecting a reader file reader file dot
txt and that's going to give me oh yes
and add exception by right so now I've
got this and sometimes I come and say
well if bufferedreader is not now of
course here it's redundant because I've
just created an instance I want to do
something sometimes I don't type that
sometimes I say oh a bufferedreader and
then I say oh I need to wrap that in a
in a if if block now here what I can do
is again use surround with so if I
invoke surround with I can wrap this in
an if-else or whatever right but what
you can also do is use postfix
completion which is like if I come here
and I say not now it will
do the completion for me in reverse
order okay and we're going to extend
that at some point so you can define
your own code completion and postfix
completion but right now it's limited to
what we offer you out of the box okay we
also have things like hippy completion
so here you can see that I have text so
if I write for instance afire or I have
data as well here so if I write a D and
then I can do hippy completion and
iterate through all of the different
things over there but I can also do
things like T and you can see that it
iterates through all of the strings okay
that's hippy completion how many of you
write JSON JSON it's a JavaScript object
notation JavaScript JavaScript min this
thing runs on the web anyway so string
some JSON equals and let's write some
JSON I love writing JSON it's awesome
I need : but I need to backspace now I
need to colon name code no okay
no that's not how you write JSON by the
way shift command enter semicolon did
you see that so instead of hitting one
key you can do that with three keys the
cool thing of course is that you don't
need to do it there you can do it
anywhere and the cool thing is that if I
say for example if a if one equals one
completion okay if some JSON equals null
completion going I should do that
afterwards right JSON alt enter inject
language reference JSON okay now that
becomes JSON I'll enter you don't even
need this I'll enter edit JSON fragment
now we write JSON okay so that allows me
to inject one language into another and
it's a nicer way to write JSON and you
get the nice little editor for it okay
we have that for many languages for
example regular expressions so regular
expressions here I can say that this
is an actual regular expression and now
it validates whether that's a regular
expression same here you see if I press
control space
there's nothing but if I say inject
language reference regular expression
now I get completion on the regular
expression right but I can also check
this I can say check regular expression
so this is for example a visa card that
starts with a four so four zero zero
zero zero zero zero zero zero two zero
point two three go three there if I put
a five here it gives me an error so
that's a good way to test your regular
expressions as well okay
we're finishing I want to show you a
couple more things quickly there's a
plug in how many of you write java code
because otherwise you would be in the
wrong session at any one write anything
that's not java yes what what c++ what
else Ruby who said Colin awesome what
else
HTML I'll XML you know I met a team two
weeks ago at at Q Khan in London and I
asked them what do you do and they say
we write software I said what language
do you use they said XML I said no but
apart from XML they said no we just use
XML I actually hugged every member of
the team as I said your life is sitting
down and writing XML every day they're
like yes anyway my condolences so yep
so if you're not using something like
Colin of Scotland or Scala or whatever
one of my colleagues actually the
product marketing for IntelliJ has
created a plugin called advanced code
folding right so if you go to code
plugins and it's called code folding
advanced code folding you see that if
you enable this it does something really
really strange right so let's restart
IntelliJ that's one default that we
still have every time you install a
plug-in it requires you to restart
hopefully we'll solve that eventually
so now what this does it it does code
folding right so what does this mean
your your your Kotlin sorry your java
starts to look like some other language
right so I can say for example let's see
if this works I don't write a lot of
Java private read-only or is it
read-only private read-only private or
is it private read-only private final
int ID right ID 1
why are you kidding me like this so see
that here for example we're doing some
kind of code folding there all we're
doing is just simply folding some code
right we're not expanding it what this
does is let's say that I create for
instance let's come here and let's say
I'm going to do array list let's see if
this works array list elements equals
new array list of a b c d e f right is
that right what is that asking for cause
you can see I can't I don't right Kotlin
Java no needs some capacity okay so and
the code folding doesn't work what that
was meant to do is it would if the code
folding worked I don't know why it's not
working take a look at the plug-in but
that would actually convert that into a
vowel or a var right so var means that
it's like inferring the type but what it
is doing is when you click on the line
it will actually expand to array list
but it's going to make your code kind of
look a little bit different so it will
make your private pool Ian's private
finals those are your finals whatever as
final as a vowel
file if you're familiar with Scala
Kotlin is like an immutable variable if
you're if it's not it would use var and
it uses a couple of
techniques like it ads string
interpolation to your code in Java where
you don't actually have string
interpolation okay so it gets a little
bit quirky because you're kind of like
at some point am I actually looking at
Java code or am I not but it's something
that I would recommend that you take a
look at to see to see whether you like
it or not the other thing quickly is
going back to plugins there is a
training plug-in right ideal training
features and this is a plugin that we've
been working on which we haven't really
actively promoted just yet and what this
provides you is in the Box training of
IntelliJ IDEA so you basically go
through a series of courses that you can
download all of this talking is by the
way open source and it's available on
github and the courses are available on
github and it guides you through step by
step it kind of says ok what course you
want to do I want to learn the basics of
IntelliJ and then it says ok here's some
code refactor this code how do I do it
well I'll show you the steps on how you
do it and now you go ahead and do it so
it's like in product training which also
I recommend that you take a look at ok
so here you see start learning here and
then I have a bunch of different you
know learn the completion basics so it
shows you you know by default completion
is coded and instantly shows you and
then you can skip the lesson and go to
another lesson and follow the
instructions and learn IntelliJ
step-by-step and the lessons are again
over open source so you can actually
create your own lessons as well with
that ok we don't have much well I'm
already five minutes over time and I
know that you you're all waiting for the
beers but one last thing if I may if you
go to github.com JetBrains IntelliJ
samples right this is code that we keep
up to date and what I've used in this
presentation and you can actually
download this and go through all of the
different exercises and it shows you
like open this file it's you can see the
structure here like we've got completion
debugging editing
general
raishin inspections and each of these it
can actually tell you how it's working
and what actions you need to perform to
see all of the different features of the
product okay so that's also an
alternative way of and you see the codes
holding here there you go it's working
whoo-hoo so you see that's that's Java
Java doesn't have var yet but that
actually is code folding in action okay
any questions is there anyone that
didn't learn anything absolutely nothing
at all here
because if there is I'll give you a
couple of beer or wine tickets at the
booth okay thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
