coming it's always a worry over mine
that I'm going to end up talking to an
empty room so it's good see there's a
few people here so um what am I going to
talk about so he's probably guessed from
the title be talking about some
microservices stuff so first of all Who
am I
I'm James I've been working at the
thought works for about the last three
years now and before that I worked at a
start-up for nine years and the startup
and what I've done that thought works or
this is kind of an experience rapportive
of all of that
what's good about micro services but
mainly actually what might not work so a
little bit about thought works I'm I
have to put this slide in for marketing
purposes we're not gonna dwell on that
so before I crack on I just like to say
something about what I've noticed about
being in this conference and lovely
place Vienna architecture know it's
these buildings I think that's actually
this building the one on the right I
love the way that those bridges
reflecting in the one side of it it
looks like the bridge has got an angle
in it whereas in fact it obviously
hasn't I saw this talk yesterday about
quantum computing which I found
absolutely fascinating I don't I've got
to say I don't really understand it all
but this slide looks fantastic cuz I
thought I'd take a picture of it and
then of course he spoke about
Schrodinger's cat which I think I sort
of understand so I drew an analogy about
Schrodinger's cat this is actually not
Schrodinger's cat this is my daughter's
cat so this is clementines cat and as
you can see from the picture it's
displaying the one of the typical cat
emotions which is utter indifference a
while ago I asked my daughter I told her
about Schrodinger's cat and I said you
know what what do you think of this and
she was horrified that anybody would put
a cat in a box and gas it or whatever so
I asked her to think about that and she
said okay so Clementine if you say all
these things to the cat tried eight
different things you know as many
different things as you can and what you
end up with is something that looks like
this you see the cat can
display lots of different emotions so
that's that's clementines cat apologies
for that that's nothing to do with
micro-services so on to the stuff that I
am here to talk about so a little bit
about the key benefits of micro services
all I want to talk about complexity and
how we reason with complexity what what
it does in your application a bit about
outcomes and that's really the meat of
the talk is how you get to the outcomes
without necessarily going the full
micro-services way and I'm going to talk
a bit about some of the the case studies
some of the stuff I've actually worked
on so first of all what why do we do
micro services what's the point of them
well you can see loads of talks online
about micro services I think everybody
seen Martin Fowler's talks there's a guy
that currently works for thought works
in the UK called James Lewis and and he
has a great talk on Conway's law and and
how to get that working in your favor so
what a Microsoft Microsoft not Microsoft
microservices what do they do for you so
I think the first thing that there is is
reducing handovers reducing
communication taxes between teams this
is every people familiar with Conway's
law yeah one or two people so what
Conway's law states it was put together
sometime in the 60s it basically says
that the the software systems that you
build within an organisation will mirror
the communication patterns of the
organization itself so if you have
various teams they will build their own
bits of software and the way that the
software communicates will mirror those
real communications communications are
expensive we have something that I talk
about which is communication tax it's
very costly so I think that's probably
one of the most important outcomes then
we have all these other things that
people like to talk about independent
scalability of components which can be
important a massive thing is is
independent code bases so that you can
do your own releases you should reduce
complexity and components technology
diversity I've heard this trumpeted is a
good thing I'm not
all that convinced to be honest but on
the project that I'm working on
currently we have Java and micro
services we also have closure micro
services so in theory you can use the
right tool for the right job system
downtime yeah that there are ways using
micro services that you can degrade your
service better so that the UX is more
consistent the whole thing doesn't need
to go down as it would in in the old
days of monoliths and the last thing
I've added their platform thinking when
I was working in a bank forethought
works they had this notion that they
wanted us to create a platform for loans
so the way to do that well one of the
tools for doing that was to was to use
micro services so that they could be
used by different parts of the bank the
you know the bit that did various
capabilities like checking your credit
worthiness things like that so I want to
talk about complexity briefly I actually
saw a slide that looked a bit like this
you know in a talk at Berlin last year
so if you have a system that has five
things in it and if they can all talk to
one another this is kind of modeling
some sort of monolithic system you're
going to get up to ten possible
connections there if you add one more
thing to your system and I'm
deliberately calling these things rather
than modules or anything just to keep it
abstract if you add one more thing
that's going to add five more
connections so you're up to what 15
connections now end things this is a
simple mathematical formula we'll have
that many possible connections so for
example the complexity the possible
complexity of something was 16 things in
it is 120 connections I haven't drawn
the picture because it look ridiculous
so how can I reduce the complexity so
here's a system with 16 possible things
in it and as I say there's 120 possible
connections there
but what if I group them into related
things like that and if I then say call
these contacts
if I only allow collections between the
contexts or between the things in the
same context
I've now reduced the the overall
complexity of the system so now in this
example here there's only 31 possible
connections so have I reduced it have I
made it easier I'm not so sure I've seen
people argue that that's that's a way of
simplifying the system and in some ways
it might be in the interest of political
balance I've got Obama as well the thing
is have you really made the thing system
sorry simpler in reality would you
connect all 16 things to every other
thing probably not there there can in
the in the model on the previous page
you might have multiple connections
between your different contexts so it's
not just one connection there could be
various different messaging systems
going on there could be all sorts of
other complexity and I think one thing
that people don't really consider is you
you've you've introduced other
complexity and and that complexity can
be harder to reason with it's pretty
easy to follow the code flow in a in a
monolithic app you can debug it you can
just step through the code you can see
what it's doing it's pretty obvious it
just said do this then do this then do
this on the other hand if you've got a
microservices system that's sending
RabbitMQ messages and it's sending HTTP
requests everywhere it can it can be
hard to follow the trace the request
through the system you end up using
things like oh what's it called cabana -
you know trace the request there's a
cabana plug-in that we use that follows
the rabbit messages and we got it to
draw this diagram and it looked so
ridiculously complex it was untrue so
here's a quote I'll let people read that
you may have read that somewhere but
it's doubtful because it's my quote and
I think one thing that we we need to
realize is that my services they won't
make your system simpler they will move
the complexity around
and I think it's very very important
that we understand that and we say okay
where's my complexity gun because it's
still there and unfortunately I think it
can be different complexity and it can
be harder to reason with as I say we've
got things like deployments many many
different builds all sorts of things
like that to consider now and lots of
different technologies so what am I
saying on this slide sorry first time
I've given this talk I don't know
whether it flows probably yet so yes
right at the top there we're saying your
micro services the components should be
small enough to reason with according to
my colleague James Lewis they should be
small enough to fit in solid James
Lewis's head I don't know if that's a
universally accepted definition James is
quite a clever bloke so that means
massive as far as I know but so the
individual components are probably going
to be easy to reason with but the
overall system might be difficult to
reason with I think it's key to
understand this yeah orchestration
between components is clearly necessary
how you do that I shouldn't have used
the word orchestration there because
that has a precise definition but
getting them to do stuff it's harder
than it used to be
tests Wow the burden of tests on your
system is now massive you you have to
consider all the integration tests - all
the things like availability tests and
things we've got monitors on poun
monitors on my project looking at the
whole system you've got more builds I
think the last count on my project we've
got something like 150 different
pipelines in our build system and
technology diversity I think sometimes
people say it's a good thing but also
there it can be a bad thing we've got
dozens of different technologies in play
ansible chef CloudFormation all these
different things for provisioning and
various bits of as I say Java closure
there's obviously front-end stuff
running JavaScript so it's really hard I
think for any individual to get that
overall picture of the system
and monitoring and maintenance you've
imposed that overhead on you so rather
than talking about micro-services as a
thing what I've seen happen is we've
gone in as thought works on some
engagements in and the client says to us
we want to do micro services so that
they sort of view that as an outcome in
and of itself and I don't think that's
necessarily valuable because it's a
solution to a problem it's it's one
solution to a specific problem it's it's
not in and of itself an outcome so I
think a good way to approach things is
to say well what outcomes are actually
important to us so as I briefly
mentioned earlier communication text
handovers we often do an exercise and
thought works where we map out a path to
production and we stick stickies on the
board and say these are all the
handovers this is where things are hard
so what why a handover is important
what's what's the problem well I like
using an analogy for this if you imagine
this person has to give that piece of
paper to the other person so she needs
to hand over the piece of paper if the
paper gets wet it's gonna lose fidelity
or you know it's the message will get
blurred somehow so in this first picture
this is modeling them being in the same
team they're literally in the same boat
it should be pretty easy for her to hand
the piece of paper to their person now
if we look at this these people are not
in the same team but they're both in a
boat
they have empathy with one another they
have sympathy with one another story so
this could be a team two teams that are
aligned to the same goal so maybe it's a
data-based team in a development team
you know one has to hand over to them
it's going to be slightly more difficult
to execute their handover it might take
a little bit longer but if the first
handover takes minutes or hours the
second handover could be days or weeks
and then the third type of handover you
get in organizations and we see this a
lot in banks is what we call a
transactional handover now in this
picture she needs to give the paper to
this person in the submarine not only
does she have to wait for the submarine
to surface she has to say
now communicate to the submarine to
surface she has to know when it's going
to sit officially has to know where it's
going to surface it's it's really hard
so that that's a transactional handover
and they've got no sympathy no empathy
with one another they frankly they don't
care so if you can reduce handovers it's
a good it's a good outcome
another good outcome to head for is do
your own releases it shouldn't be
possible in this day and age you
shouldn't one team should not be able to
block and other teams release simple as
that so that's that's a very valuable
outcome I mean one of the biggest
dysfunctions we find as thought works
we're going to a new client and they
test yet it takes us months and months
to do releases and typically it's
because there's this whole massive
orchestration of releases going on
between teams and they have to do it in
lockstep and the first thing we'll try
and do is is unpick all of that reduce
the dependencies so that each team can
release its own code what am i saying
there oh yeah coordination overhead and
it's important to think about when you
do releases it doesn't necessarily have
to be on two separate servers I've
worked on a successful implementation of
micro services where they didn't have
their own separate service so it's
arguable if that's a real microservices
thing independent scalability of
components that's that's a good outcomes
ahead for your the service that receives
requests directly from the website
probably has different scalability
requirements from the one that takes
orders the one that checks stock will
probably again have different
scalability requirements it's important
to realize though if you are going to be
interested in scaling your individual
components you are again introducing a
big management cost to it I think a
touchstone I'm speaking to a champion
today after one of the talks where one
thing that I haven't come across yet is
useful abstractions for hardware and I
think we might be getting there with
with tools like kubernetes and things
like that but it annoys me that in this
day and age even
when you're using something like AWS you
still have to think in terms of servers
you have to think about NAT gateways you
have to think about firewalls all that
stuff
there's no useful abstraction which just
says hey here's an app to deploy it and
that sort of annoys me I know there are
things like Heroku and so on but I'm
told that's not an enterprise solution
but yeah that's that's my wins for the
day
strong module boundaries this is
something the the tech principle of my
current project likes to talk about
strong module boundaries are good
because they they help keep contest
together they help they make it easier
to reason with what's going on micro
services will be decoupled from one
another by definition although sometimes
they're sort of coupled in ways that are
insidious and again I've mentioned
Conway's law there you should use micro
services in a way to to get Conway's law
working for you get the people that work
on the same stuff working together
excuse me it is true to say that in a
monolithic application you can have good
modular structure it's just it might be
more difficult to enforce people will
end up making references from one bit to
another and so on so it's it's not as
easy to enforce your modular boundaries
ok let's talk about some trade-offs what
are the downsides so Martin Fowler has
an excellent talk which I've linked to
there called micro services premium
where he talks about you know these are
the things you've got to do you need to
consider automated deployment if you
don't have automated deployments see ICD
I don't think your mic reverses
implementation can work you need
monitoring you need stuff like your
banner you need a good logging
monitoring system you probably want
alerts going out we've got as I say a
massive build one or so that you know
goes read whenever the network goes down
things like that you need to understand
how to deal with failure it's not good
enough to just let the system fail bits
of your system will go down so you need
to know how to isolate parts of the
system you need to start considering
things like the circuit breaker pattern
and so
one L eventual consistency so talk about
kefka earlier today and and there was
talk of the databases and how you need
to move data from one part to another
it's a massive overhead we've got so
much code in our project that that just
makes sure that the the picture of the
data is consistent it cost I think I
called out developer complexity as as
something that's a cost as well because
as I say I think the developers or
certainly the leads the people that sort
of span the whole project need to be
they need to know so many different
technologies and then the service to
service communication that's that's a
cost you need to you need to understand
the protocols you need to be consistent
with your patterns and this this whole
sort of maintenance cost is ongoing and
then I've noted down certificates
firewalls all the things that's the
stuff that I don't understand all the
security things so that's the micro
services premium and when things go
wrong it they can go badly wrong and
I've seen them go badly wrong
you sometimes I've I've worked on a
micro services project but even though
the the elements are not tightly coupled
they're still coupled in sort of hidden
ways and people have to coordinate their
releases still so I like to say to them
you know how come your story is
releasing for services that that
shouldn't be like that
maybe the stories are written wrong
maybe maybe we've implemented it badly
at times I don't know it's possible in
your micro services implementation that
you might solve the same problem over
and over again the arguably there's yes
less reuse of code because you're no
longer got the option to reference
libraries here's an important point as
well which which I've noticed in places
where I've worked the funding model can
lead to big dysfunction if you have
things like banks are fond of doing
where they say you know here's a million
pounds go and build this system and I
expect you six months later to have
finished with it and hand it over to a
support team that is
a very dysfunctional model and and you
know I think you need strong product
based ownership of the thing otherwise
it does decay over time I think that's
the same point on the next line actually
you should probably combine those two
but it's and the final point I'm making
there is and I've seen this happen again
James Lewis I mentioned him earlier he's
got a phrase which is if you go into an
organization and you can reorganize it
and you can you can just create new
silos in different places and James
likes to call that okay we went in there
so and so and and the organization is
now differently broken so that that can
happen if you're not careful so now
here's some case studies now these are
real things I've changed some of the
details I have paraphrased a bit but
this is stuff that I've worked on in the
last sort of five or six years so here's
a problem statement this was in a
startup that I worked out for nine years
we had a whole big monolithic
application and like a lot of these
things it had evolved over time it got
harder and harder to do stuff we had a
team that was responsible for the public
facing website we had a team which
actually I was running which was in
charge of the sort of internal tools
space and we had other teams and the
whole thing had a single sequel server
database mm-hmm and it was hard to do
stuff and I think crucially for in micro
services discussion we we didn't have it
in the cloud yet this was five six years
ago I guess when this story starts
probably around about god I'm getting
old actually it's probably more like
seven or eight years ago so to sort of
illustrate this this is what the
solution looked like but of course
that's much simplified Wow that's
massive but you can't consider this on
the left without also considering what
teams went alongside it so we had those
four technic technical teams there and
they're sort of loosely arranged on sort
of horizontal layers the web team were
mainly front-end people the tools team
that I was with was sort of we're in
charge of those soap services
in the internal apps we we had an
infrastructure team we had a database
team but also you have to consider the
business teams and there was at least
five of them there were probably others
as I say I'm simplifying somewhat but
the crucial thing about this is what are
these teams care about so if we look at
the web team they sort of care about
most of the web app and part of the
database tools team which I was involved
in we cared about that stuff
infrastructure team well they cared
about pretty much everything and then
the database team well they cared about
the database obviously they they were
doing things like optimizations and so
on but they also had a sort of stake in
in the stuff that talks to the database
they were always making sure that we
didn't you know kill the database with
with terrible stored procedures and so
on so that that pictures starting to
look a bit confusing but I'm about to
make it more confusing because the sales
team cared about that stuff the partners
team probably cared about those bits you
can see where this is going and the
other teams cared about those bits so
now we've got a really confusing picture
and we would find that if the sales team
came to us and said oh we want to do
something we want to change this bit of
the website to help with our search
engine optimization it was hard to do
you know we had to make sure that
releases were coordinated we have to
make sure that the one team didn't break
the other team usually the web set the
web front-end team sort of one out and I
got annoyed because they would release
stuff and break the tools and then I'd
get the blame so what did we do so our
biggest problem was not treading on each
other's toes what we wanted to be able
to do was was release stuff so we
identified we said that's the outcome we
want to be honest back in those days I
don't think I'd even heard the word
market services but we started to move
it to something which did look a bit
like micro services we we refactored the
monolith that was our first step it was
move it into a inter bounded context is
what I'd call them now back then we
probably called the modules we started
using shared assemblies we started
doing stuff out into new get packages
for things like security and and
cross-cutting concerns and database
access things like that
we essentially we split the codebase
vertically so that it more accurately
mirrored the business so we were
effectively I again I didn't know the
phrase at the time but we were doing
what James Lewis calls a reverse Conway
maneuver where we we sort of shifted the
business to fit their software and
logically arranged it and we made our
teams cross-functional we we added
front-end people together with back-end
people and database people so we've we
brought it all together so that each
team could be responsible for the whole
development cycle we didn't do anything
to the database we kept it as a
monolithic database so crucially I think
if you see micro-services true
microservices implementation every
service will have its own data store so
we didn't touch the database effectively
and we didn't do anything with the
infrastructure the infrastructure
basically stayed in a data center so
this confusing picture became this so as
you can see what what we what we did to
effectively to get the outcome we wanted
was we as I say that that is what we
call the reverse Conway maneuver we
arranged the teams with with the
software people and we actually
distributed the software team throughout
the building there used to be an area
for tech and the area the business
people but we actually spread us out so
that we were sitting with the business
that we were part of but the database
team stayed on its own down the bottom
they were special so what was the
outcome there what did we achieve we
achieved separation of code bases that
that was the biggest thing we wanted so
that we could do independent releases
and we got a closer alignment between
business units in the team's delivering
very to them that is a very thought work
see statement that's that's me adding my
own narrative now I didn't quite
understand how important that was at the
time we didn't achieve separate
scalability of components whether or not
they've done that now I don't know I
haven't seen anybody from that company
for awhile we didn't achieve bounded
dated context and that was something
that actually annoyed me because I had
this argument with the database team
where I was constantly saying we have
this view of a ticket and we've got this
database table
it's got like 200 columns in it but each
part the system i meani addresses a
small subset of those columns so I was
constantly arguing you know we have
different views of tickets so why don't
we have different tables so it annoyed
me that we didn't have bounded data
context though I didn't win that
argument we avoided having to manage
eventual consistency crucially and
that's maybe why we didn't split the
database up and we didn't introduce
extra developer complexity in fact
arguably we made it a lot simpler
because we met we were able to
concentrate each team on on just the bit
that they cared about so now it's a good
outcome or as clementines cat would say
she's totally not bothered here's
another quick case study this was
something I worked on with thought works
recently we were in a publishing company
they asked us to work on this UK
application which was new they already
had a US market application they were
trying to use that as a kind of
framework and the the scary part was it
was taking them 13 plus months to get
something from the ideation stage into
production that was their big problem
they asked us to come in and say okay
how can we reduce this cycle time and we
at thought works we said okay give us 12
weeks and we'll prove that we can
deliver value quickly so what did we do
we we found that the biggest problem was
silos in this business this is a slide
that I've changed the names on which
actually we use this in a presentation
at a client this is my colleague Karen
she wanted to do something that was
effectively quite simple it felt like it
should take just a couple of days at
most to achieve this outcome she wanted
so she spoke to some people in the
business which involved a few phone
calls a few emails and she spoke to
various teams that told her about a
system that she needed to to access to
get value from the system which then
introduced another person that she had
to talk to this used to have actual
names on it it doesn't know which is sad
that person told us about another person
who we had to email because this person
was in a different time zone so we
couldn't just pick up the phone and talk
to her
and then amazingly we found out about
another system that we didn't even know
about it was like Oh God so that system
controls that system so we need to talk
to that system gosh this is getting
confusing then that introduced another
person with lots more emails all of this
is taking a stupid amount of time
finally they told us about the real team
that we needed to talk to and eventually
we got hold of the right people we found
some documentation we managed to do it
this simple outcome that should have
taken like a day or two it ended up
taking care in three weeks to even
understand what the solution the start
the solution was and the problem there
was silos every single person on this
slide represents a person or a team
they're they're real people they have
real jobs within this organization but
they're in technology silos each of the
people here understands exactly what
their piece of software does to the
content but they have no idea how that
affects the functionality in the
application so we we realized that so
here's a little schematic what this
company did essentially was it it takes
raw documents they can be news articles
they can be published legal stuff and it
does stuff to the documents so that and
it gets put into a document database and
then oh yeah I forgot about that this is
they call that content production and
each of those has various silos I think
we counted 15 different silos in those
yellow boxes on the left there and
that's basically to get a document which
is a raw document and put it into a sort
of XML formats such that the application
can read it and it enhances it and it
gives it functionality then on the
application side there was something
called shared display services there was
this u.s. application there was this UK
application that we were building and
they called that application teams now
the amazing thing about this was the UK
app was so tightly coupled to those
shared display services which in turn
was so tightly coupled to the u.s. app
that in order for us to release the UK
app into a pre-production environment
bear in mind the UK app wasn't live yet
the u.s. app was when we wanted to make
changes to the UK app we had to deploy
the u.s. app at the same time that's how
tightly coupled they were and the the
companies thought that this stuff
happening on the Left could happen
entirely dependent near the stuff on the
right they had this project plan that
said on this date all the content will
be ready and the app will be ready and
they were just expecting it to magically
work together it wasn't going to do that
so what did we do we realized that what
they were lacking was was an
understanding of product thinking so
initially when we were doing our
analysis we were going up to people and
we were saying okay what does your
system do and then we realized that was
the wrong question to us what we should
have been saying was why does it do it
what functionality does it enable in the
end-user app and by doing that owning
the whole outcome we were able to
effectively bust the silos and just
bypass all those silos and just pick out
the functionality we wanted and we were
able to does this slide have something
else oh yeah
so we we built our own little piece and
we we hived it off we built our
application for our functionality we
deployed it separately and it was
basically the main UK at was reverse
proxying onto it the company called it a
micro service it wasn't really a micro
service it didn't have its own datastore
but it was separately deployable and
crucially we reduced the cycle time from
13 month to a matter of days we were we
were rolling out features you know from
the point of starting a story to getting
it into the pre-production environment
was taking us that a couple of days so
that that was a great outcome so what
did we achieve there shorter cycle times
that was the the biggest thing because
we didn't need to traverse the silos we
we made Conway's little work in our
favor we owned the whole outcome and we
got separate scalability because we
deployed our thing to our own servers in
in AWS so it could be scaled on its own
separately from the main UK app and
another thing we achieved was a we got
the Wiese we changed the way that that
company thought internally we got them
customer focused we
got them to start understanding what
customer focus when it was a great
journey for us actually taught me a lot
about what customer focus means and how
it's really valuable in delivering
decent software however we had to manage
our stuff now we had to do our own
deployments we had to learn terraform we
had to understand all that stuff as I
mentioned earlier annoyed me that I
still had to reason in terms of servers
firewalls and so on and we didn't reuse
code they the client was a little bit
uncomfortable of that because we
actually solved some same problems that
were already solved but in the end it
was like well you know we're getting
things done much quicker and we imposed
this overhead of monitoring support so
that it had good and bad outcomes or as
the cat says still not bothered so I'm
going to finish with top five tips on
micro services tip number five this is a
countdown sorry you can start with the
monolith if you're going to do that
great and I would always say to if
you're doing a brand new project it has
to get to a certain size before monal
earn before microservices start paying
off so there's no reason not to start
with the monolith if you design it well
you'll be in a good place to split it up
later tip number four you need to
understand the cost it will cost extra
stuff it will cost in complexity it will
cost in real money it will cost in all
sorts of ways and I've just called out
some of the things I think I mentioned
in most of that earlier I know it's that
picture there that I got off Google
somebody had that in their presentation
earlier today same picture and you need
strong technical leadership this is
something that I've noticed done on the
current implementation I'm working on
you can sort of see over time how the
client has asked this at times as I've
asked thought works too to not be there
and they've taken ownership and then
they asked us to come back and retake
ownership because they were finding it
hard to manage themselves and you can
kind of see the different philosophies
that have been in play and it makes it
very confusing so you need that strong
technical leadership you need a good
tech vision and you need to be you know
somebody needs to be cured
and making sure all the dev teams stick
to it understand your outcomes I think
the biggest thing on this slide is is
that first bullet point ask yourself
okay if micro services are the answer
what what question what was the question
what are we trying to solve here what's
the problem we're trying to self
understand those are outcomes and go for
them understand what good looks like and
finally if you do it well you will get
great outcomes
this is martin fowler's phrase you must
be this tool to use micro services I
recommend reading that blog if you
haven't done as long as you understand
what your gain you will get a great
outcome and that's all I have and here's
some book recommendations thank you for
listening we've got a couple of minutes
if anybody wants to ask any questions no
everybody dying for lunch now okay thank
you very much everybody
thank you for coming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
