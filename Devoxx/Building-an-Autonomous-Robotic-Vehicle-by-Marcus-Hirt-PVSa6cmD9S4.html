I'm working for Oracle in the Java
product group and this talk is going to
be how you can go build your own
autonomous robotic vehicle so hopefully
after I'm done talking you'll be able to
just you know go shop some stuff and go
build your own vehicle
so since I'm working for achill I need
have this disclaimer slide which
basically says that anything that I'm
saying about future direction of Oracle
products etc should not be used for
purchasing decisions so yeah the main
goal of this presentation is to share
the fun because it's actually quite
hilarious to have your Java applications
interact with physical reality
especially if they are buggy you know
it's it's quite a lot of fun and it's
really not hard these days it's not even
that expensive so you know as far as
hobbies goes I'd say you know average so
and again not that hard I'm also going
to show you how you can put JFR to good
use when you're building these robots
because it can be quite hard you know
there it's hard to do feature extraction
it's hard to do you know corner
detection and all these things are hard
to get perfectly right and if you do
have something we can record your sensor
data and then apply your re algorithms
at the develop your algorithms and
visualize them then it's much much
easier so two disclaimers first one I'm
not a roboticist that is not my area of
expertise and the second one is that I
will be mentioning specific companies
those are not endorsed by Oracle in any
way you know I'm not getting any
anything from them I'm buying like
everybody else it's just that there is a
large amount of components out there and
these I know worked they worked for me
so they probably work for you as well so
I want to get pragmatic
right these things work so this is
coffee
I named him coffee because he's running
Java and his laser rangefinder well it
makes him look a bit like wall-e so I
didn't really have an any choice of
course he had to be named coffee and
here is coffee running at home an early
version with no quadrature encoders
running in autonomous mode and some
volume okay
you won't hear it then but so my son
which you can see probably no maybe not
running away he's screaming loudly here
so he's he's terrified of that robot so
the idea was for me to have something to
do with the kids you know some some nice
project to do together and he's scared
shitless so that didn't really work out
but yeah and I didn't bring coffee today
because you know I did bring him to Java
one and that was a total pain and he got
stuck in customs on the way to Java 1
and he got stuck in customs in Germany
when it was coming back to Switzerland
where I live
so you know maybe participating in
Oktoberfest I don't know but it was just
a pain and this was what Swiss told me
when I asked if I could bring the robot
on the plane
so they said kindly note that it looks
like a tank and therefore the
authorities at the airport you notice I
t's a might reach a different decision
and Swiss is an airline cannot guarantee
anything on our end so I I don't think
things have improved since early this
year so I just didn't want to chance
bringing the robot I did bring some
parts of him though so that I can show
so this is what I'm going to be talking
about what to think about when you're
building hardware that you're gonna run
on a non real-time operating system and
perhaps on a Java Virtual Machine
then I will briefly mention some things
that I've learned as a 3d printing noob
that that I'd like to hear and I will
talk about how you can record the sensor
information in the flight recorder in
JVM and do some demos of course I don't
have the robot but I did some recording
such ever'one when he was running around
in autonomous mode so we show that and
then talk a bit about the results and
some future stuff that I'm up to mm-hmm
so the brain then it can't have escaped
you that there's been a bit of a
revolution in terms of small computing
devices so we have the Raspberry Pi I
don't know how much it costs in the US
but it's probably around $30 and and
where the raspberry is zero I think is
five dollars or something ridiculous so
when they're births previa quite a heavy
cost when you started hooking up
hardware to your computer that is no
longer so and I have released the blue
smoke in one device so I have killed one
Raspberry Pi in the early days so that
may happen but it's not going to put you
down
back to too much and in terms of
embedded devices these computers have
quite the computing power and and and
the RAM so one gigabyte for coarse arm
you can do some interesting stuff with
that so that is what I'm using in coffee
I'm using Raspberry Pi 2 I have a
Raspberry Pi 3 for my next project which
I will be mention briefly mentioning
briefly I'm running Linux raspbian there
are several different distributions and
you have plenty of ports so there is a
lot of hardware you can hook up to these
things then selecting software stack I
went with Java I so I visited big
University in in Switzerland and they
were actually using Intel Knox for for
their for their drones and running
Windows so you know I didn't want to put
myself in a corner here so I thought you
know what why not use Java also the
tooling support is excellent I have been
remotely debugging my robot while it has
been running and executed code in that
Java process so so you know the tooling
process for Java is very very good and
also it's the devil I know for those of
you who know my background I'm it
I've been doing Java stuff for a while
and also the language support that
wasn't an issue for me I went with the
pure Java but there are a lot of
different languages running on the Java
Runtime these days so you know close
your room Jay will be whatever then you
need to select the Java Runtime so there
are several ones on arm you have the
Java ME embedded which is optimized for
small devices so you know you can run it
on 128k that is considered small these
days that's one on 28 more times more
than I had in my first computer but
still you know times change so but but
but you know fairly small devices these
days and you you have a very pleasant
library for accessing the hardware I'd
argue that it's better designed than
what you could do and get a few if
you're using Java embedded then again
job is embedded has tired complicated
compilation generation with GC
multi-core support richer library you
know you have neo and in concurrency and
flight recorder support so I went with
Java embedded and the drawback then is
that you need an external library to
access the hardware and something called
PI for J which is built upon a native
library called wiring PI so the hippy is
very C like but who cares I mean it's
it's just for reading and writing
addresses mostly anyways yeah ok then
you want to censor of course you won't
have sensors and actuators in your robot
and I'll do a quick detour because it
will become evident later why so this is
a pulse width modulation signal and it's
a very common way to control servos for
instance yeah for normal hobby servos
it's a 50 Hertz signal so you have each
period being 20 milliseconds and to tell
the servo to be centered you keep the
pulse up for 1.5 milliseconds right
that's centered 1.0 seconds is you know
full travel
of the server one direction and two is
full travel in the other direction so
why am I talking about this well if you
have a one millisecond garbage
collection happening just you know when
you're about to pull the signal down you
go from say hard draw left to actually
getting hard right you know the opposite
of what you wanted
just for one millisecond GC so that's
why I'm bringing this up and you might
get into very undefined space if you
have say you know a six millisecond
garbage collection it's going to be
undefined so when you're selecting
sensors
I recommend avoiding sensors that
require timing sensitive decoding in
Java and if that isn't possible you can
always try and this is not you know
trivial you can write your own own C
library have it as a kernel module maybe
on my blog I actually have an example of
that where we're there is a this Korean
producer of a certain humidity sensor so
you know that is certainly possible it's
a very specific specialized one by a
protocol for just that device and and so
that can be done and if that isn't
possible you can get your own little
microcontroller so have a pic or an
Arduino Nano and dedicate that thing to
just decoding or encoding whatever
protocol you want to support and I'm
having that for for for my next project
for very specific thing that I couldn't
find a chip that actually does what I
want to do okay
so coffee has these sensors he has a
laser
it's called lidar light v2 and it works
no up to 40 meters I'd say and the great
thing with this is that previously you
had to spend thousands of dollars for a
laser rangefinder this one costs well it
did cost 89 bucks then Garmin acquired
pulse pulse light what's in the name of
the company and then they know the cost
I think 150 or something but it's still
for a laser rangefinder quite
agreeable price so I can highly
recommend that then I have an IMU so an
inertial measurement unit so we have
gyros accelerometers magnetics and the
barometer and this is all on one weekly
breakout board from Adafruit called a
few 10 degree degrees of freedom break
out and in coffee I'm not using most of
those I bought it because of my next
project so I wanted to have a hardware
platform that I can use for other things
as well and then I have a GPS so the GPS
is for knowing where I am when he's
running outside and the camera the
camera is currently just streaming
things I'm relying on the most um the
laser so the question was what am i
using the parameter for well you can use
it for four to implement a simple very
meter but that's not what I'm using it
for in coffee I'm not using it in coffee
so as I said most of the IMU I'm not
using I'm using the gyro for being able
to precisely know how much I turn so
that's most and I also have the
accelerometer for when I was developing
it was very handy to be able to let the
stock the autonomous mode where and just
stop when I lift him fast upwards so you
know lift him up
stop so but I'm mostly using the gyro I
will get back to the other project later
okay
so then of course oh did I switch right
so actuators you probably want to
control servos for all kinds of things
you might have a I don't know you have a
Greek law you have you yes I did I put
the laser rangefinder on two servos so
that I can Pan the laser until the laser
so and again when you're doing servos
you probably want to have something that
generates the signal and has its own
timer so there is a chip called
PC a 96 85 that has a built-in timer and
you'd basically configure the waveform
you want it to output and it will keep
outputting that waveform until you
change it so if you until you
reconfigure it to output something else
so you know the GC problem goes away and
for motors
yeah spend some time calculating what
you want the max B to be of your thing
and your torque requirements and also
one thing to consider when you select
motors if is if you want quadrature
encoders you might be using step raise
as well but I'm using ordinary brushed
DC motors and there is there are these
nice little holes Hall effect sensors
that allow you to to decide how much the
wheel has traveled or the axis s turned
right so it's very useful for
controlling the motors I first started
out with H bridge simple H bridge mode
controllers then I switch to more
advanced motor controller that actually
had built in quadrature decoders so you
know has it own a proportional integral
integral derivative logic built-in it's
cheating but that's not where I wanted
to spend most of my time okay actuators
so these are the actuators I'm using I
have 25 millimeter Metal Gear motors
from Pololu with quadrature encoders so
when you select your motors you you need
to think a little bit about what what
what your requirements are in terms of
torque and what battery packs you're
using so I wanted to be able to use the
same battery packs I'm using for flying
my planes you know so so I selected a
12-volt one there are also six volt ones
and if you want to use so one thing that
I might mention is if you're using 7.4
volt lithium polymer packs you might
want to go with the low powered engines
because they don't take as much of a
beating when you're over voltage them so
yep and then I'm have some motor
controllers I actually kept one h-bridge
for controlling the claw and then I'm
using the Robo claw controller for for
controlling the engines main engines
then I have to service as I said and a
little break upward for for emitting PWM
signals right then wiring it up this is
something I wish I knew
years ago when I was building my planes
so I always used to buy these little
servo cables and various different
adapters and you know I spent a lot of
money on that then I discovered a few
years ago that the connectors are
actually called dupont connectors and
they are available in whatever polarity
you want so just buy a crimp tool and
then go to ebay and you can buy them in
the hundreds for a few bucks and build
your own cables in the exact length you
want them so that's what I did and I
want to use my the same battery pack
size as in my plane so I used xt60 and
you can totally nerd out in terms of
connectors I'm using all of those in for
various reasons in in coffee but you
know you get really far just using these
two pond connectors and your ester and
if you're borderline OCD you can get
these sorting boxes and your life will
be much happier yeah so prototyping with
make lock so make bloc was this
crowdfunded project for a system Makana
like system for four I don't know if it
was explicitly for robotics but it works
really well for it so you have these
wonderful aluminum profiles that you can
put together in various different ways
and and they are pretty much compatible
with the pallulah 25 millimeter engines
just that the axis is shorter for from
the pallulah edges so you need to do an
axis transplant a transplant for for for
using the pallulah engines but other
than that you know they work just fine
so I said it was a disaster with my kids
having having that robot they were
really scared because they couldn't
control it so I built radio-controlled
versions and they were much happier with
that so that's my daughter trying out
radio-controlled
version instead and here's my son
driving another version and I'm using
footage here encoders you can see that
they go really straight right and then
of course you let them play together and
and you know the expected thing happens
and everybody screams and it's all ma'am
right so designing stuff for 3d printing
so I haven't owned my 3d printer for a
very long time but using a parametric 3d
modeler is a wonderful wonderful thing
because you're going to have some
measurements that you're going to want
to be able to change so for example the
server width height the model height
maybe maybe the battery pack inserts all
these things if you use a parametric
model you can very easily change if you
get the constraints right and you should
try out the constraints while you are
modeling so that you have the
constraints right because going back and
fixing them afterwards is obtained and
Autodesk Fusion it's actually free for
hobbyist so you know it's a pretty
expensive software package that you can
just go ahead and use also designing
around current limits so current
consumer 3d technology and 3d printer
technology works in a way data either
it's called fused filament fabrication
or or fused deposit modeling so it
actually just extrudes plastic layer by
layer takes a really long time to build
things and of course you need to have
something to extrude on if you're
building a 3d house and you have a lamp
a channel you're hanging from from the
middle of the model and you want to
print that all in one go of course when
it comes to the layer for printing the
the lamp there is nothing underneath so
it will just extrude plastic onto the
floor of the house so you need something
underneath and you actually need to have
the maximum overhang that you can get is
about 45 degrees it's not going to show
well but so you can look at this later
to see see what it actually looks like
when you
have more overhang than they can have
them there are some techniques to get
around that there is a material called
polyvinyl alcohol that is water-soluble
so you can just print your your supports
in that material and then you put the
entire model into water everything
doesn't you know the support material
dissolves and you're good to go and I'm
not doing that anymore I have it I
actually have a dual extruder printer
but no not everybody has so if you start
designing things for that scenario
not everybody can print your your
designs so stop doing that also I found
it very useful to just mock up things
that I need to be able to fit into the
model so on the Left it's a mock-up that
I used for for my my special circuit
board and on the right is the the make
block design that it needs to go into
and this is what it looks like in in the
modeler so so yeah 3d printing takes
quite a long time the canopy thing in
the upper left takes about a day I mean
24 hours over 20 hours to print so it
really does take a long time that's why
you do want to mock up things and make
sure that everything fits together
before you start because it's not so
much the plastic waste and the plastic
that I'm using is biodegradable so you
know it's not too bad but but but it
really takes a long time and that's my
printer printing something else okay so
wiring start small try a chip build some
stress abstraction around it play around
with it make sure it works be very
mindful of logic levels and power levels
don't source a lot of current from the
GPIO ports there there are a lot of
things to to to take be be mindful of
but it all pretty much boils down to
just read the chip specifications and
you build yourself a nice little live
of sensible abstractions and then when
you want to build the real thing the
robot you can start going top-down again
and and just slotting the things that
you already know work also when I killed
my Raspberry Pi
I killed the SD card at the same time
and it takes a while to just install you
know the operating system and all the
tools and everything you want so once
you're done with setting everything up
make an image do backup own more SD
cards than one and and you know the
standard thing use this or SEM and the
raspberry is much more powerful than you
think I mean you can just VNC into that
machine and and you can even run run a
development environment in on it if you
feel like just experimenting a little
bit so the flight recorder on the
Raspberry Pi there is an API in JDK
seven and eight that allows you to
record custom events into the flight
recorder does everybody know what the
flight recorder is not everybody ok so
there is this technology in the runtime
that allows you to with very little
overhead record what is going on in the
runtime and and in the application
running on the runtime it's called java
flight recorder so that's what I was
using for recording sensor information
and actuator information in the runtime
I didn't want to introduce a lot of
overhead so you know the fact that the
flight recorder is has its own little
you know lated native local thread local
buffers and and nice time stamping etc
what was what's a good thing so I
decided to use that to record what is
going on in the robot and then dump the
flight recording to to my little tool
and then I could visualize and see what
what had happened I even put some
ambience in so that I could control it
from from from you know AJ mix console
you know turn on the automatic and just
remote control if I wanted to
so for coffee I have events for engine
changes laser scans both the overarching
timed laser scan you know I'm doing a
scan and all the points individual
points of that scan oh okay so no volume
from the computer let's see if we have
some volume okay quickly checking yeah
the volume seems to be on
do you want em
okay
do you get volume okay so let's just
skip that thing I think it's a bit late
for forgetting that volume to work
anyway so let's just continue okay so I
did put put events for also for for for
the gold target and whatever you know
other information I thought would be
useful and this is what it looks like
code wise using the unsupported API the
new API in JDK nine is much cleaner but
this is what you would do you would if
you want to be able to know the duration
of the event you would extend a timed
event and I have a relational key so
that I can group everything that you
know all the individual sample points
with a certain scan and and this version
of the API it's really important to make
sure that either had to have a public
getter or or that the field that you're
trying to record is public not so in JDK
nine also you have the actual point so
no relative to the robot itself and
that's just X Y and again the scan ID so
that I can find everything else that is
related generating events is very easy
you just just do set point and the scan
ID and then commit the event in this
particular case I can reuse the event
object because I know that they are all
going to be emitted in the same thread
for this personal coffee not in the next
but yeah so so I just reset the event
between every mission don't need to
allocate that is not necessary in JDK 9
right and you can go to my blog if you
want to know more about how to start
flight flight recordings and control the
flight recorder
I also did so there's this tool called
Java Mission Control in the JDK and I
did integrate with that so that I was
able I'm able to to visualize the scans
and if you're interested in how to do
that even though it's totally
unsupported you can go to get up and
check out trouble for J because I
submitted something similar there too so
some demos so this is coffee at JavaOne
and he's running in in fully autonomous
mode and I think I limited his max B to
0.3 of 1 or something like that so he's
not going going full speed here and yeah
he's using his laser rangefinder to find
his way and it's dynamically changing
his speed depending on how things look
ahead and he's gonna go this is not a
very good place to be so I probably want
to go somewhere else and here we go so
look around
right so I had one more demo but the
little try to find if I can get this up
again ok so let's get this back ok so
here is a flight recording of so
basically this is what I did I did a
very simple just wall avoidance
algorithm first and then I started
recording the laser scans from from a
trial run in my apartment then I started
developing from the pre-recorded sensor
data I started to develop the algorithms
for for segmenting everything so find
things that are related to each other
and then I did feature extraction so
where are the corners the cross is a
corner you know the solid lines are wall
and then I did some other funky
algorithms for for for you know finding
good places to go but the the point here
is that after I had done that first
recording I did most of the development
work without even running the robot
anymore I had record a sensor data that
is from real life so I could try my
algorithms see does this actually detect
the walls bla bla bla bla bla bla bla
all inside my plugin and then when I was
done developing the algorithms I could
just you know copied to to coffee and it
actually worked so you know yay ok so
there is this started to port things
from coffee to something called drop of
a J which is a framework for quickly
building robots in Java the core
framework is pure Java and we have
hardware specific support for for
Raspberry Pi in Lego currently so here
into LEGO robots you can try this out as
well and we just got started so you know
the core framework as it looks right now
was pushed in you know january/february
some sometimes so this is all up for
know if you don't like something just
tell us we're currently just building
things that we need so if you need
something different to tell us so this
is a very an overview of this what it
looks right now we have a module that
most things depend on which is regime F
and then we have hardware specific
modules like Hardware PI and the thing
with those two modules is that you don't
even need to use robe of J at all to use
the hardware abstractions so if you just
want to you know talk to the GPS but you
don't fancy building an abstraction for
it yourself you can just take the row go
for J Hardware PI GPS and and use it
don't need to have anything else and
same with the LCD or whatever your your
you're using but hopefully you're going
to want to use the other parts as well
that
gives you a another programming model
where you can actually configure your
robot in XML I mean you can use Java to
configure it as well but this is this is
what it would look like if you did
configure the next mount so you get
yourself a robo builder you add the XML
to the Robo builder you can also add
instances or classes and you know
whatever and then you do Builder build
you get a context you do context start
and then your robot is up and running in
this case after that we actually send
get a reference to the LCD component we
have configured in XML and send a little
message that we want
the LCD to display and then we're
waiting for quit and do an orderly
shutdown of the context context when we
get a key press and this is the XML so
there are two two components that are
just off the shelf and configured the no
code from from us there and one of them
is an LCD unit and one of them is a
button unit and those are actually part
of the same hardware you can see that
the hardware address is the same but
they are logically separated so you know
this is the LCD with the little buttons
and that's you could maybe see the
backlight demo when you know we're
changing the color of the backlight so
you know we do separate the button unit
from logically from from the LCD and
then we have our own code which is
setting up the demos and doing the menus
and and that is the example controller
and the controller just accepts these
messages the celibate immunization
processes the messages up and down we
just switch between different demos and
pressing select we'll run a demo so very
straightforward
okay so the results then you know this
was quite fun for me it was scary for my
kids so it didn't really that the
intended reason didn't really work but
but but you know it's really really fun
to build these things the kids that age
seems to really like being in control so
building radio-controlled versions were
very appreciated and so for the future I
would like to do full implementation of
something that in probabilistic robotics
is called
simultaneous simultaneous location and
mapping so that is something that I
would like to to have implemented but
before that I am now working on my
autonomous robotic lider so basically a
plane that will go look for thermals and
make sure to utilize the thermals
optimally and keep mapping and remapping
where where the thermals are of course
since I got twins
and yeah well time consuming I'd say so
you know my schedule for all these
projects have sort of been pushed out a
bit this one so some additional
resources that is my blog where I blog
about of you know usually thinks in the
Java Runtime so serviceability feature
is often unsupported stuff but that are
still useful to know about things that
might become supported one day you never
know and on Thingiverse
I have my designs so if you want to
print out a coffee you can just go to
Thingiverse and and download the STL and
print them Mission Control is on
oracle.com slash Mission Control and
Robo 4j is you know Robo forge a dot IO
and I think that's it we have ten
minutes or so for for quest
any questions sorry the yeah yep okay so
the question was if I'm using the data
from the runs for integration testing
and we're not there yet
I mean so so I was mostly developing the
algorithms for for for feature
extraction etc inside of Eclipse running
in the plugin running the plugin in
Eclipse right and debugging and running
it as I was doing changes so this was
just a very quick way for me to verify
that you know the my thinking was what's
holding up on real data but that saved
me quite a bit of time you know first I
tried and this is a real-time system
right so you can't really have a break
point the robot will continue running
forward right oh I bet that break point
well it's actually happening here nah
doesn't really work so so this was a
very very good way to get try out the
algorithms
right so the question was raspberry pi
have cameras did I consider using it for
for for for for more than just streaming
I guess and yes absolutely so there is
one guy that is loosely related to Robo
for Jay
that is an expert in in image processing
so and coffee has a camera so on his
head there so this is the 3d printed
thing his head and you know you have the
laser rangefinder here the camera goes
here so there is a camera already but
I'm just using it for streaming images
back so I'm not processing them and I'm
not using them for mapping out the
environment at all today but in the
future knows ok any other questions ok
so I do have some some printouts from
things that I'm doing for my next
project so if you're interested you can
just come up and I can explain the stuff
that I'm that I'm doing or if you have
other questions you know just just come
on by and ask great thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
