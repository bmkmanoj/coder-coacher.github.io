to do a talk about documentation as code
so he weren't able to come to Europe so
I'm stepping in for him it's a different
talk but it's run the same kind of topic
which is documentation and scope is
their sound our story began a year ago a
bit before Christmas when our main
character went to visit his dad burn out
the discussion starts around a good warm
coffee oh you already set up your
Christmas tree your Christmas tree nice
is that proudly shows off his new
fireplace as you can see it's the best
blahblah
lots of heats blahblah big logs ok and
apart from that what's up dad
well I started my new book I started
working on it a few days ago oh great
what is it about it's about longevity
and life expectancy so I sent my first
chapter to my editor and I just received
the first correction our fairy fire main
character is intrigued ok so how does
this work with your editor how do you
collaborate between the two of you well
I write my chapter in a Word document
and then I send the file via email and
then she sends it back to me okay is it
is she editing the document directly no
not really
she's using you know revision marks to
correct my typos and mistakes and the
comments to to ask questions
have to accept and or decline the
corrections and take care of the
feedbacks she gives me it doesn't seem
like it but it takes a lot of time you
know at this very moment of our story
and in a for force awakens in our hero
he can't help it
the fees alone of his brain is acting
like crazy last time it was in 26 for
Christmas seeing Isaac's dominating his
parents computer he had to to free them
by installing firefox instead this time
his father is endangered by writing with
microsoft word sorry but also with
collaboration via email a new challenge
arise for a main character showing his
right way to his father so welcome
everyone my name is Roberta branya I'm a
web developer and today I want to talk
about documentation as code and about my
dad so documentation as code because
after working one year and a half with
Dan Allen at open device I got infected
by the documentation virus we we helped
a lot of clients moving to that kind of
concept documentation s code and the
general idea is just to treat your code
like your documentation or to treat your
documentation
just like your code and it's actually a
an approach that you can also apply on
many other kind of materials learning
materials like articles books trainings
conference talks etc I also want to talk
about my dad because I mean there's a
real reason to to use him as an example
not like all the articles and
presentation you know like functional
programming explain to my mother or her
how she's a woman so so I'm really sick
of that and being named uber
it's not always easy to step ahead from
that so I'm talking about my dad because
apart from his job as a medicine
professor he's a bit like us he has side
projects so since 2010 he shipped six
popular science books around hormones
brain etc so it's a bit like us but not
really
he's not really a geek after all he is a
bit uses his laptop just like everyone
else is using word just like everyone
else and so is the perfect example of
the person agnostic to this concept that
can that I can explain to the the
concept of dogs a skirt so that's really
why I was curious to to learn more about
the way he works on his book and let's
be honest I was really excited to
explain to him the way we work on on
documentation the way we we maintain it
etc so the first topic I addressed was
writing so he spends most of its time
reading lots of articles publications
books etc and he takes notes on on paper
but as I said he writes directly on his
laptop
the first thing that really shocked me
is that if I were to use Microsoft Word
I would I've used you know like the the
poor semantic system of Microsoft words
which is Styles you know like text body
title headings etc but no with his
editor they have some kind of system
between the two of them it's like okay
there's a set of rules for different
kind of headings you have different font
size okay for you know like rect special
rectangles at the beginning of the
chapters
like did you know or some set like that
he has to put stuff in italics and for
different he has a set of rules like
that that seems a bit crazy yeah at
least it's at this very moment that my
my deaf brain was like wait a minute
have you ever heard that of separation
of concerns it's great so I started to
to explaining the the concept because
forest developers and UPS it's really a
great concept I mean we see that in the
network domain with the OSI model we see
that in dev with MVC
and stuff like especially on the web I
mean I love the web so we have the
separation of HTML CSS and JavaScript at
least we did before we act something
like that but I really like that and it
reminds me of the old days when I
started with the with HTML and CSS it
was the first time I was discovering
that separation of concerns between
content and presentation so putting the
the meaning and the semantics on one
side and the decoration on the other
side and back then when you wanted to
show off your CSS skills or at least the
the true power of CSS you were throwing
of CSS Zen garden so who knows about CSS
and garden okay keep your hand up if you
made a theme one or two nice
so basically CSS in garden was a great
website back then to show of CSS true
power while everyone was doing layout
with tables and so with the same HTML
and a different style sheets you could
have this website and this website it's
exactly the same content the same HTML
but different CSS I'm showing it again
you can see it's the same titles
magazine back then some people were
cheating with images for crazy phones
but I mean why not so
what's really important when when you do
content presentation separation is to
put the priority number one on content
and that's really what we are trying to
to to do and trying to convince my dad
to do that because when when you put
firing on content you really try to
remove everything between the brain of
the of the writer and the computer you
don't you don't want to have tooling
that gets on your way you really want to
to put what you're thinking about and
put it directly into writing so I wanted
to help him apply that separation of
concern principle so I started looking
for a language that he could use so as I
said I'm a web developer so I was like
maybe I can teach him HTML but I mean
I've I've tried to write write articles
directly with HTML
I tried also to write my teaching
materials when I was doing lessons and
it's a bit cumbersome I mean can you
really expect him to to learn that it's
it's not binary it's human readable and
human rights alone but I really don't
see how this puts the priority on the
content and basically HTML and CSS well
not really built to to produce books
they were really meant for browsers
there's a few good examples like
exceptions like Lea varies book on CSS
which was written with HTML and CSS but
so when I look at this I'm like knowing
I need another candidate so I'm looking
I'm looking at what people are using for
their documentation and I stumble upon
this anyone recognize that yeah what is
it yeah it's
Doug book and the unofficial logo is
attack
so Doug book is a really good system
it's it's an XML schema that is really
structured and that allows authors to
really produce well written books and
well organized books the problem is you
have to learn XML and it's even harder
than HTML in in the sense that as
everyone knows it's really strict and I
mean my dad did like more than 10 or 12
years of studies should we really put
XML on top of that I don't think so
I haven't done 10 years of studies
obviously but I remember when I was at
the University lots of my teachers were
also researchers in computer science and
they were using that okay clearly the
writers were away when that was invented
I used it on many reports for for
internships and I really like it it's
later so ullatec
i'm not sure so latex is a language and
a system of document composition and
it's really well known for the the
attention it puts on top typography and
especially on on mathematics and
scientific formulas it's still very used
in academics and scientific domains
because of that and and for other
reasons the problem is I still don't
have the priority on the content I mean
it would have to learn all that
backspace curly brace et cetera - all
those keywords so I was not really
convinced and lattic was really designed
to produce PDF so that could be
something is looking for but you don't
have other outputs type of adverts so
what do I do
we see we sell lots of solutions that
really do separation of concerns but
they don't really put the priority on
the content and I think this needs to
change we need something different
something simpler introducing this ok I
was expecting a bit more reaction let me
try again introducing this so when I
look at that I'm like my content are
breathing there there's not much
anything around my content they are
really king in that that realm you know
if you look only at the text it's just
that I mean the difference is really
really subtle if you look only and at
the markup with what's around my text
it's just that okay I made this example
so it's a bit cheating but it's really
to show you how simple it is so this is
asking doc it's a language that was
created in 22 with a compiler in Python
and it was really designed to put the
priority on content so anyone could
really focus on what they are trying to
write and trying to share and so my
father when I showed that was okay but
the same still - to have a few
characters I need to learn etcetera
won't this be a bit complicated so
because it was a bit afraid I started to
do a demo so I'm gonna do a demo so here
I'm using the atom editor there's also
plugins on other types of editor like
IntelliJ vs code etc but atom is one of
the best plugins that exists for
asciidoc so I'm gonna go fullscreen so
it's easier to
to focus on what I'm doing so first I
just want to show up the paragraphs I
mean a paragraph is that simple right
but what I really like in asciidoc is
that to create a paragraph you just need
to have a blank line so that means the
new line I have here after the first
sentence and before the second sentence
isn't meaningful for the output so as
you can see here it's the same paragraph
and that's really nice because if I
write another sentence okay it's really
in the same paragraph so when I was
doing that my dad was like are you
really writing a sentence per line and I
was like yes and it's awesome it's
awesome because you can tightly see if
you start many sentences the same way
and you have a stylus that sucks a bit
like me you can reorder lines easily or
move them to different paragraphs very
easy or in the middle of a paragraph and
that's really something that when you
try it when you give it a try after a
few hours you're like hey that's nice so
small detail and if you just want to to
do different paragraphs again you just
have to have a blank line like this so
next example next thing oh yeah okay so
the headings you you just have to use
equal signs so one for the document
titles as many call signs for the depth
of the for the level of your heading of
this heading of your section so it's
like really really simple then you have
the lists so you have ordered lists an
ordered list ordered lists are using
stars and order lists are using dots
what I really like again is that because
it's just text I can reorder them quite
easily it's not like in where
we're okay I'm doing bullets bullet
lists you know I'm doing enter because I
want to do a new paragraph where it is
like okay you want to do another bullet
list I'm not no I want to do a new
paragraph and just press ENTER twice
okay okay just have to fight again again
again and with that I'm just in my IDE
so I know what I'm doing
I really like that and it's a small
troll also so simple formatting bold is
stars it's a letís underscores keyword
like programmatic keywords we use in in
technical documentation is backticks and
you can also use pound signs so if I
just use hash signs like that it's
generating a mark tag in HTML and then
if I had this I can just do custom types
you know like I would have two sets of
keywords and I would just have to mark
them that way you have really simple
keywords for multimedia and it's very
very consistent it's always keyword one
or two columns depending if you are
displaying a block or an inline
something like an icon so here it's
inline so always key words : some type
of URI and then options between square
brackets and it will always be
consistent anyone knows how to do a link
in mountain yeah it's always like
question mark parentheses square
brackets which order is it here it's
simple key word column URI options again
I'm trolling a bit sorry then I showed
him a more complete document so if you
look at the output
you just have everything you need for
your book that so you can just change
the quote author or anything you have
stuff that are really interesting that
don't exist for example in my zone which
are we
ha admonitions so here I have a note
admonitions ammunition that is in line
and it creates this kind of rectangle
with an icon that I can customize if I
want but it's a way for me to just say
this is just a note or this is something
really important and of course we have
we have what we need to do code samples
formatting and showing off code samples
okay so one small details detailee was
interested in was the rolls so I
mentioned roll with the pound signs on
inline surf but you can also do it on
blocks and for him it's really
interesting because when you read a
technical book or when you ly read
popular science book on medicine just
like his you often have you know
rectangles with did you know or
important stuff to read etc to go
further and I was like you just have to
create new sets of rules with your
editor and I would say cleaner wounds
and just be just agree on some key words
just like did you know and that would
produce a rectangle that you could
custom customize and style as you want
in PDF in HTML etc when you do a block
it starts with the Stars you can do a
block inside it small detail so that
afterwards so when I showed everything
about that it was a bit interested a bit
intrigued I would say what's really
important as I just said with sub blocks
is that everything is aligned on the
left and compared to stuff that are
indented like maybe HTML XML etc all the
way that mark down the Scott samples
where you have to end and stuff I really
think it's easier to work with but again
you'll have to try to be convinced
or not so when I showed him everything
it was okay but there's no WYSIWYG on
your stuff
okay so obviously it didn't say that
because it doesn't know what it is but
that's often a question we have when we
show of a lightweight lightweight markup
language like now down or asciidoc and I
would say is it really a problem I mean
as I explained most of the time at least
when I'm writing with word it's fighting
against me I really prefer to have this
and if anyone worked on a CMS everyone
knows what kind of WYSIWYG system can
output as HTML and most of the time it's
like it's complicated so I would phrase
it a different way like my ex-colleague
we'd say Dan Allen it's not what you get
is what you get what you see is what you
get is you get what you get
so as I explained we have everything we
need in atom or any other editor and
that's really nice we have color syntax
colorization we have instant preview
that could replace WYSIWYG in a way but
again you really have to get used to
that and with the with the plug-in you
have helpers like Auto completion for
keywords between two inserts an image or
stuff like that so to write dogs a few
code practices we need to apply the
first one is don't repeat yourself so
that's something we are really used to
and in asciidoc you have a great way to
do that by using two things includes and
variables which are called attributes so
here I have an example of a fake blog
article so it's a bit dated as you can
see
so what's really popular these days okay
maybe angularjs okay so now it just
changed its angular to okay what's nice
is that using that kind of variables I
can really update my stuff with my
tooling
very easily the other thing that helps
me not to repeat myself
are they includes so if in a few
documents I want to always put the same
you know like paragraph maybe about the
author I just have to do an include
again keyword : uri options and i can
just write this at one one location and
have it everywhere so it's it's maybe
the the best way as we do as programming
to be sure that it's always the same
everywhere so sorry i think that's a
really a really great way to introduce
also the concept of having an IDE for
writers i mean we are not there yet but
when you see what I'm able to do with
with Adam I mean let's take an example
so if I take if I take this exam yeah
for example here in my document in my
folder I have some images because I like
the Beatles so I have some images of the
Beatles I can list them okay I like the
common line so maybe I can list them in
one column and then use clip copy yeah
so now it's in my it's in my what's the
name in English I can copy past it maybe
I can copy paste it here add a new
section about the Beatles okay and
what's nice is that every day with
JavaScript Java etc I'm using lots of
stuff in my IDE I'm using multi multiple
cursors shortcuts etc so here I can just
do the same
so if I take this I can trigger a
multiple cursor I can create a list that
are maybe an inline image I can copy
past stuff and say okay this is John and
voila I have the four Beatles and again
I can do that because I'm a dev and I'm
using the same tools for my
documentation and this really opens up
new possibilities and new stuff so like
I can change the well I can change the
case if I remember the keyword I don't
and so that's really something I really
like to do so again the concept of IDE
for writers is really really interesting
in that way so after explaining
everything the the different features of
asciidoc my father was intrigued okay
that's a first step but the I remember
something he said it was like I like
those little annotations you have I
called them annotations and I really
think it's it's what we are talking
about right now so it wasn't really
convinced but again in 20 minutes to
someone that is not a developer it would
it it was hard at the beginning so then
I started talking about collaboration
so as I explained just before the
process of collaboration with this
editor is a bit at least to our point of
views it's a bit strange so I was
convinced I could explaining how we are
collaborating between each other in the
developer team so I was like I need to
teach him get yeah no not really at
least it's not really a good idea so
what I tried is to explaining it to
explain it with a few images with a few
examples etc because what's nice with
asciidoc is that it doesn't come with
like many CMS or wikis with its own
collaboration history management etc
it's just plain text files so to do
collaboration it's great so really get
loves asciidoc and for that I want to
share an anecdote I shared with my dad
about collaboration so I was reading an
article on Remy sharps blog so if you
don't know Remy sharp he's great he's
doing a conference like tomorrow but
it's in Brighton so it's a bit
complicated to get there by tomorrow on
web development and is maintaining J's
bin and not known so he wrote an article
I was reading it and then I was like hmm
interesting
remember our humans so I'm not British
English is not my first language but it
really looks like lyrics from Daft Punk
right or at least it doesn't feel
natural or or normal so I was like maybe
I can suggest a small edit so I looked
at the top of his article and next to
the title there is an edit link so I
clicked on it and I showed to my dad you
know
so github is like this this website we
use as developers to collaborate and
when I click on edit I can propose to
that guy a modification well in his
brain it was started to be a bit crazy
like can
do that so I showed him a bit just like
a wiki I clicked on on the small pen and
I was editing the documents so I just
added a few words for the sentence to
make more sense and I proposed my change
and I was like you know that is a pull
request that is a way for me to say to
Remy I changed something on your article
do you want to accept it and that's an
idea that it was excited and afraid of
you know he's not really aware about
open source and when he works with this
editor is like everything is secret
everything is on in his laptop is
Edison's laptop having a book written in
the open or a blog that way seems a bit
crazy for him then I was like really
this is really great in ProQuest you
have a discussion you can say okay I
want to change this on a paragraph etc
you can see comments so it's some some
kind of group of modifications and you
can see what has been changed or at
least what is the proposition of change
and I was preparing a small surprise I
was like okay so as you can see you can
see before and after next to each other
you can see it above and below and then
I was like and you also have you know
like just like word like revision marks
so in this case we we only have two two
words in green but you know what I mean
so we have rich diffs in margin or or
asciidoc on github and he was like yeah
but I preferred that oh that I was like
okay you prefer diff like side by side
if you're starting to be a developer
maybe but really he was really
preferring that and if he had the tool
to show the differences like like that
he would prefer that and that's when
having a line sentence per line really
helps when you're collaborating the
diffs are really easier
read which is not the case here and it's
also easier to do your merge I mean
we've all done no maybe not everyone but
for those who have done angularjs
at first we were putting every injects
on the same line and each time we had
conflicts is because the same line was
modified all the time so a few people
started to put each injects on one line
it was a bit easier except if you put
all the new injects at the bottom anyway
having a sentence per line really helps
for collaboration so I was explaining
that and I was like you know what I was
reading that article I proposed that
changed and Remy merged it v5 even
finished to read the article is they're
not really powerful I mean we've been
hearing a lot about the future is like
you know ordering a pizza by a drone
with the - button etc and no the future
is this it's collaboration it's really
being able to say to someone hey is
here's a small improvement or maybe a
big one on what you've done and the
future is also that we merged it from
the gym anyway I'm just thinking about
hey cool merch not sure so the way I
showed it was a bit just like a wiki but
it's not it's really better because no
one here really used that interface all
the time we are forking a branch we are
modifying it we are pushing changes
directly with git and that's why it's
really better so here we have another
example of a company using asciidoc and
because we are using git and github or
any competitors like it level it packets
the project manager or the documentation
manager really has a way to track what
has been changed so for collaboration is
really great I mean try to use
anything else after that it really looks
like history another example is that I
really wanted to show him is a book that
is written in the open right now by
Nikola Ibaka from elastic so as you can
see there's like chapter 1 a skittle
chapter 2 SK dogs etc and that's what is
really powerful it's the fact that it's
being written in the open so on
collaboration some code practices we you
know you need to use mantis no you need
to use another one but you need to use
an issue tracker and as I showed your
maybe users of spring boots if you look
at spring boots issue tracker and get on
github and you filter by type
documentation you can see everything
they have opened right now on editing
their asciidoc documentation and most of
the time it's like oh we need to change
that typo or even we need to to work
around the way we are we are addressing
the reader that's something that is more
important what when you're not doing
English I mean in in French and Spanish
you have several ways to say you to
address the reader maybe as a familiar
way or as a formal way so that's
typically stuff with typos that end up
in your issue tracker you will be
collaborating with pull requests as I
just said so here you have an example
just like I showed and what I really
like is the fact that you can really
have the same process with the
conversation around a change especially
in this case on spring boots they are
like a giant conversation for one commit
and just not that big of a diff so
instead of code reviews you're gonna do
content reviews you're going to be sure
that all the contents of the
documentation it has been written just
like it would be one person and it's
consistent
run the whole documentation and the last
thing I explained was the concept of
branches so I was like it's a bit like
when you're sending your chapter to your
editor you can't really edit your copy
on your laptop because with word it's
complicated
we have branches and we use that all the
time on our code and on documentation
it's just the same and it's really great
so the last thing I discussed with my
dad about was the publication so that's
not a part is that interested in because
I mean everything is done by his
publisher and by the technical people at
his publishing company but I wanted to
tell him more about what I was doing as
my job so I'm gonna more explain it to
you then to him but what's nice is that
you have asciidoc as I explained but
asciidoc is the language the syntax and
what I'm using to transform ask a dog to
something I can publish is asciidoctor
it's really the processor that is
outputting something from asciidoc so by
the way there is a new logo recently so
with asciidoctor you're putting an esky
dog file into it or maybe you put like
multiple ask a dog files because as I
said you can do includes so you can
include another asciidoc small part or
you could just include some parts of a
Java file of a source XML file inside
your documentation to just show off
examples and when you put that into
asciidoctor you'll be able to output
obviously PDF that's also HTML epub dog
book and also presentation so for
example that presentation was written
with us connect
that slide is not asking our kids an
image but you see what I mean so what's
really powerful with that is that the
possibilities of the output are really
rich and it's it's just because inside
asciidoctor you have an HD
transformation so an abstract syntax
tree so when you give it your asciidoc
it's able to see which kind of key words
you used on which line etc and it's able
with that to produce many kinds of
outputs as I said there's a consistent
way of using key words and because we
have an ast you'll be able to do many
things as a coder that you like on your
content so there is a way to do some
kind of extensions and because you have
that key word system you can create like
it's an extension that already exists
but you could create an extension called
mansion so mention : something and
options and that would generate in HTML
that kind of HTML that kind of output
it's not that it's not that
revolutionary but it's really that kind
of small stuff you would be able to add
on your content and stuff that are
really specific to your to your business
another example we did recently was to
create a system of locating documents to
to locate links so if I want to link the
document that is inside a module inside
a component inside my my whole
documentation and I want to directly
link to the documentation of this page
on version 3.6 if I were to put directly
the the final H ref it would break
easily and so what we created for
clients is just to reuse the xref
keyword and to tap into the ast
processing with the the extension system
and we were able to
to to verify that this page exists and
to produce the correct final HOF so
that's really because we are using ask a
doctor we have we can put our finger
inside the gear and say okay at that
point I want to do something and being
able to list every link you have in your
documentation every internal link is
really powerful when you have like 5,000
pages just look at the number of pages
you have on the whole spring ecosystem
it's really big so for for everything
that relates to asciidoc and ask a
doctor I really advise you to look at
ask a doctor websites so I forgot to
mention that but ask a doctor was
created in 2013 I think by some people
at at github and that's why it's written
in will be and it was taken care of just
in the next few days by Dan Allen and so
the documentation of this new process
are of asciidoc is really more modern
than the one you had on the previous
version that was in Python you have a
github organization where you can find
all the the ecosystem of projects so
stuff to to produce PDF to produce
presentations as you can see there it's
in Ruby but you have a I wouldn't say
port but you can use it on the JVM or
inside the browser or with node on the
JVM it's using internally JRuby and on
node and the browser it's using opal to
convert Ruby to JavaScript but again you
have just one implementation and you can
use it in three ecosystem so lots of
people are using asciidoc with ask a
doctor or not especially the the editor
O'Reilly and I really think I started
using it like two three years ago
and now I'm really doing everything with
it so I'm gonna finish with a few quotes
especially one from Scott check on words
who works at github and will also book
about asciidoc about git with SK Dog
sorry and it was really impressed by the
way the the extension system allowed
them to do custom stuff and also so some
guy you may know that really loves
asciidoc so to conclude publishing Doc's
the code practices I mentioned it
briefly but because we are developers
being able to manipulate our
documentation with like code we'll be
able to use merge to publish like okay
so now we have to set up a continuous
integration but by having that we'll be
able to have the same process as anyone
using asciidoc like spring boots or even
the blog from Remy I showed off which is
you propose a pull request and if
anything changes on the repo with the
merge or a false Porsche but we never do
that we just trigger the continuous
integration and even the continuous
deployment to production again depending
on the clients we worked with the set up
were different but when you get to that
level of of professionalism with with
your content it's it's really getting
really nice so while driving home our
hero was a bit disappointed he was
thinking about everything is just it
just explained to his dad and maybe it
was too much information in in a really
short period of time so new tools new
concepts new techniques new words new
terms etc
but he perfectly knew that is that would
continue to use word and emails right
but driving home he was a bit happy to
he was glad because he knew that he
could convince you you the coders
because I on everything I I showed you
already have the tools the IDE the
techniques the collaboration tool in the
publishing spirits of DevOps of having
automated stuff etc the only thing you
need is to take take power on asciidoc
and ask a doctor and really take care of
your documentation with the same passion
thank you very much i have four minutes
for questions but I'll be around until
Friday if you have personal questions
don't hesitate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
