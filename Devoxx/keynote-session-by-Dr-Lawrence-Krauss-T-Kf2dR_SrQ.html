discovered again on Netflix with the
documentary on the unbelievers and then
I start reading his book universe from
nothing and I came to a passage in his
book which I actually had to take a
screenshot so I don't misquote him but
the quote that was really for me to drop
said okay I need to reach out to our
next keynote and the quote says let me
do it correctly while antimatter may
seem strange it is strange in the sense
that Belgium's are strange they are not
really strange it is just that one
rarely meets them that for me Alice yeah
I'm gonna just mail him you know I've
haven't know I can get a yes and then so
it's my great great honour and I'm
really like everybody's really
intimidated with our next keynote
speaker but I'm really looking forward
to him professor Lawrence Krauss yeah
thank you thank you and I keep
forgetting I wrote that I don't know why
I come back to Belgium
but anyway it's very nice to be here and
and I'm the entertainment so we stop all
this complicated Java stuff and now we
just worry about theoretical physics so
you can relax
anyway I'm gonna see if my my thing
works at this distance after a minor
accident this morning there we go okay
what I want to do is take you on a
journey back to not 20 years but back
13.8 billion years and what I want to
talk to you about is some amazing
developments that may allow us to look
back to the very beginning of time and
the good thing about cosmology unlike
Java apps is that that is it it doesn't
affect anyone and and so that's fun so
if this is more this is sort of like a
story and you can relax so I want to
begin with the relaxing part so this is
really the best of times
and by the best of times I mean that the
Large Hadron Collider is up and running
and it hasn't created a black hole that
destroyed the world and and it is
revealing things that have been amazing
and we hope it'll it'll reveal new
things it is as I'll talk about the most
complex machine ever built
it makes modules look trivial and and
but it's it's the worst of times as well
and and so let's see well in my country
is this guy I try to think of a European
equivalent so yeah thank you that's it
there's this guy too and and but the
great thing about all of this is what I
want to show you is that all of these
petty myopic worries are just worries of
our time right now but but they're
really unimportant in a cosmic sense so
so that's the great thing about
cosmology it seems to me it puts us our
present time in perspective and all of
everything we do will be forgotten in a
very significant way this is one of my
favorite Hubble Space Telescope pictures
they're all my favorite pictures
actually this is most recent
multispectral image of from the Hubble
Deep Field so every dot in this image
except that one is a galaxy each galaxy
contains roughly a hundred billion stars
and there are about a hundred billion
galaxies in the observable universe and
and the colors here are accurate but the
size is also accurate so the most
distant galaxies are the ones you can
barely see and they're almost ten
billion light-years away that means the
light from those galaxies took ten
billion years to get to us which means
by the way since our Sun the lifetime of
our Sun is about ten billion years an
average main sequence star that means
that most of the stars in this image are
dead now and any of the civilizations
that develop Java on those around those
stars are now dead and long forgotten
and
when an image is taken of us right now
boom by the time it reaches any of the
star systems there will be long gone our
earth will be long gone the Sun will be
long gone so that so we are as I like to
constantly say incredibly insignificant
and that's one of the messages I want to
you to take away from this so and put
the rest of the conference in
perspective but anyway when we one of
the strange aspects of this image is
that the universe is the same in all
directions if I took this picture in any
direction I'd see more or less the same
thing and that is remarkable and
surprising because of course when we
look out as far as we can in that
direction the universe is 13.8 billion
years old I'm happy to say in Belgium
and if you ask the Republican candidates
and in the United States you get in for
a number closer to 6,000 but if I look
at the far end of the universe in that
direction and the foreigner universe in
that direction the light from those
directions is just getting to me now
that means those two regions couldn't
have communicated before today but if
they can't have communicated before
today how come the universe looks the
same in all directions how could every
region know to be the same as every
other region that was a that was a a big
puzzle a major puzzle in cosmology that
we think we may have solved and but I
want to say that this when we try and
solve it we're gonna go back in time and
we're gonna use a wonderful aspect of
the universe and which is encoded in
this image which is which is about 4,000
years old this is in different cultures
as as different names but it goes by
name Ouroboros a snake that eats its own
tail those particular snake has legs so
it's not really a good snake but it's an
evolutionary snake but it is it is
remarkably many different cultures have
picked up the same image image but it's
important for understanding cosmology
because one of the great discoveries of
the 20th century is that the universe is
expanding
that means was smaller yesterday than it
is today the smaller the day before and
that means that there's a connection
between the very big in there very small
so if we try and you know we think that
the scale of humans are computers and
and planets and then we can go up to
stars and then up to galaxies and
cluster of galaxies when we go to the
whole universe the largest scale of the
universe we come back to the very
smallest scales because if we
extrapolate back the Big Bang 13.8
billion years we come to a time when the
entire what is now the entire observable
universe was contained in a region
smaller than a single atom it's hard to
to picture that it's amazing we can talk
about that with a straight face and and
and when we think about that and what I
want to tell you is we may be able to
probe that unbelievably early time but
the important thing is on that small
scale of an atom the laws of quantum
mechanics rule and so if we want to
understand our why our observable
universe has the properties it has on
the macroscopic scale we ultimately want
to understand the fundamental forces of
nature because those are the forces that
will have set up the conditions that
will have determined the ultimate
evolution of our universe so we want to
look back earlier in earlier time to
understand exactly how things got set up
and to do that we have to think about
particle physics as you'll see okay so
the the galaxies take us back the
earliest galaxies in that picture maybe
ten billion years old that means that
they formed a few billion years after
the Big Bang well that's early but are
not early enough to go back earlier we
look at another image this is a baby
picture of the universe it's a picture
of the universe when it was about
300,000 years old 300,000 years after
the Big Bang this is something called
the cosmic microwave background
radiation and it comes from a simple
picture if I look out if I look out in
this room I can only see as far as the
wall because the walls opaque okay when
I look out at the universe I can only
see as far back up
the point where the universe became
opaque that time was when the universe
was three hundred thousand years old
because at that time the temperature of
the universe was about 3,000 degrees
Kelvin at that temperature hydrogen
which is the dominant stuff in the
universe gets broken apart into protons
and electrons so you don't have neutral
matter before that time you have what's
called a plasma and a plasma is opaque
to radiation so you can't see through it
so literally if we look out far enough
the farthest we can see with light is
that picture because you can never see
past that point because the light can't
make it to us from earlier times so if
you run the film forward the universe is
a plasma and when the universe turns 300
thousand years old hydrogen protons
capture electrons matter becomes neutral
the universe becomes transparent and we
can see all the way back there so this
was a picture this is a satellite image
of looking at the Cosmic Microwave
Background because that radiation was
3000 degrees then but it's been cooling
now so that radiation is a temperature
of about 3 degrees above absolute zero
and the radiation comes in the microwave
band which is why we call it the cosmic
microwave background radiation and this
is this is an image of that of that
surface the two-dimensional surface in
all directions a spherical surface
that's been projected on a plane first
of all the image has this line in it
that's because that's our galaxy so this
is up and that's down this is a plane of
our galaxy so we can get rid of the
galaxy but I just want to say the
projection we've done is the same as the
projection of the earth I think I have
that upside down so I'll just see if I
can correct that there that's better my
wife is from Australia and so I'm always
northern semi-famous fearest centric
silence but the projection is the same
that that it we're projecting the sphere
onto a plane so so let me go back to the
projection there and then I'll get rid
of the galaxies because the galaxy is
just in the way its radiations coming
nearer to us and this is
the baby picture of the of the universe
now what is this picture well different
colors represent different temperatures
other variations in temperature but the
variation is incredibly small the hot
spot the the red spots are hotter than
the blue spots they vary in temperature
from the blue spots by one part in
10,000 so this whole thing is about 2.7
3 degrees above absolute zero and at
some points it's one part in 10,000
hotter or one part in a hundred thousand
actually hotter in other places it's one
part in a hundred thousand colder so
this sitting is incredibly uniform
unbelievably uniform the temperature of
the universe is the same to one part in
100,000 across the entire universe so
this again a problem because all those
regions couldn't have communicated they
could never have thermalized in the
standard picture how did they get to be
the same temperature this problem
persists to understand it we want to go
back to even earlier times how can we go
back to earlier times if we can't see
before these times because physio
theoretical physicists but physics like
all science is an empirical discipline
it's based on observation and experiment
we can hypothesize all we want but we
have to test those hypotheses if we
don't test things it becomes religion
okay or yeah anyway so we can't see
before this time well how can we get
through that surface how can we see
before that surface well clearly light
doesn't work so if we want to probe
earlier times in the history of the
universe we want to use a signal
something that couples more weakly than
electromagnetic radiation something that
can make it through that plasma to get
to us
some signal from the beginning of time
that can make it through that dense
incredibly dense plasma of radiation and
get to us so what we can do is look for
signals from that are weaker and the
weakest force in nature is gravity it
may not feel like that for you when you
tried to get up this morning to come
here
but that's because every atom in the
Attar earth is interacting with each
atom of your body the the gravitational
interaction of one atom with another is
so small we could never measure it but
when you add up the effect of all the
atoms on the earth you could measure
that fact in fact I wrote a book about
Richard Feynman who his friends by the
way with the queen of Belgium just as I
am now that's a true fact I don't want
to get into it
he gave an example if you want to if you
want to prove to yourself or a friend
how weak gravity is it's really simple
take a friend or maybe not a friend
up to a tall building here downtown and
and and go up to maybe the tenth floor
and push them off now it takes gravity
all of that distance 30 meters say all
that distance to accelerate didn't down
to the ground but it's electromagnetism
that stops them in a fraction engine
they don't even make a dent in the
concrete because the reason we don't go
through material objects is most of most
of the material objects are empty space
but the atoms in my electrons and my
hand experience forces from the
electrons and the atoms and that's what
stops me and so gravity takes all even
the force of all of the atoms and the
earth on me takes all that distance to
accelerate me electromagnetism stops me
in a fraction of an inch gravity is so
weak that it's irrelevant on all scale
smaller than the size of humans or the
earth but because in fact things are
electrically neutral on large scales
gravity is the only game in town and so
it's relevant and it determines the
dynamics of the universe but grat the
fact that gravity is weak means we can
use it now I like to wave my hands
that's what I do for a living and about
150 years ago max James Clerk Maxwell
told us that if we shake an electron up
and down we create an electromagnetic
wave we create light laws
electromagnetism tell
that well shortly after Einstein
developed general relativity where he
told us that gravity is really a
property of space and time that what we
see it with grass as gravity is really a
curvature of space that matter and
radiation energy affect the properties
of space around them and space becomes
curved and it can expand it can contract
in the presence of that material and
Einstein ultimately realized although we
got it wrong at least once that if you
shake a mass then you also produce a
wave but a different kind of wave a wave
of ripples in space and time a
gravitational wave so I think I have a
gravitational wave here ok so this is to
hypnotize you early in the morning but
if a gravitational wave is coming out of
this board towards you right now what is
that what will happen is that space will
expand in one direction and contract in
another and then contract in the
direction expand in another that's
happening all the time every time I wave
my hands I produce a gravitational wave
that propagates out but gravity is so
weak that that wave is so weak that we
don't notice the undulations in space
and time and in fact even incredibly
massive objects moving around produce
gravitational waves but again the effect
is so weak that we don't notice it but
literally in as I'm speaking here there
are gravitational waves going through
this room from all sorts of phenomena in
the cosmos and the fact that you're
moving around but you don't notice them
but if you're incredibly if you had an
incredibly sensitive detector you could
see that the size of this room would be
changing in one direction and stretching
in another than stretching in that
direction because pressing in that
direction so this is this is a
two-dimensional image this you can I'll
show you a three-dimensional images of
it but of course like all
three-dimensional images they're
absolutely impossible to understand here
and let's see if this works there we go
it looks like a snake but that's what a
gravitational wave propagating does it
literally changes the distance between
objects
as it propagates an amazing prediction
by Einstein
shortly after 1916 and we've never seen
gravitational waves directly we've it
turns up we we have good evidence that
they exist indirectly but we've never
seen them directly we in fact we
building detectors to look for them and
and I want to and this is a conference
of people who are ultimately involved in
technology I want to talk to you about
some of the most amazing technology
that's ever been made so this is let me
show you the largest gravitational wave
detector in the world the LIGO detected
this is in Washington State there's an
identical detector in Louisiana and this
was designed to look for gravitational
waves not from my moving my hands but
from cataclysmic events in our galaxy
because if two neutron stars collide
obviously incredible movements of mass
will produce gravitational waves that
might be detectable but gravity is
pretty weak and the waves are very small
so this is how will we do it so say
gravitational wave is coming down from
above
there are two tunnels each three
kilometers long and if a gravitational
wave comes by then this tunnel will get
a little shorter than that tunnel how
can we measure that well we send a laser
beam down in both directions and bounce
off mirrors coming back and if the
tunnels are the same length the beams
will arrive at the same time if the
tunnels change in length the beams will
arrive at slightly different times and
we can do that using something called
interferometry but the requirements are
rather demanding if these cataclysmic
events happening elsewhere in our galaxy
cause gravitation ways the changes in
length are very very small that would be
felt on the earth so this detector had
to be designed and it is amazing that it
works this detector can now tell the
difference so if this like tunnel of
length three kilometers changes compared
to this tunnel the requirement is that
you are able to
a change in length of a three kilometer
long tunnel by an amount equal to 1/100
the size of a proton okay think about
that and it's amazing that it works it
works you're able to were able to do
that but we still haven't seen
gravitational waves and in fact actually
it's better about two weeks ago or maybe
a month ago after much work the detector
was upgraded because who didn't see
anything to be able to tell a difference
in length by one one thousandth the size
of a proton and we're pretty convinced
that that should be able to tack these
cataclysmic collisions of neutron stars
and black holes in the galaxies but it
is it is really a testimony to the
ability of experimentalist to be able to
do that when a truck 50 miles away moves
along it affects this more than that
amount you have to isolate this at
levels that are almost unimaginable in
fact tidal effects from the moon change
the length of this more than that so the
requirements are such that I'm very
happy I'm a theorist because I wouldn't
want everyone I never believed it would
work but it does okay but these are look
this is looking for gravitational waves
from objects in our galaxy but what
we're really interested in is
gravitational waves from the beginning
of time because if we really want to
talk about incredibly massive energetic
things moving around there's nothing
more energetic than the universe itself
and the earliest moments of the Big Bang
when the universe was expanding
catastrophic ly as I'll describe we
think huge amounts of gravitational
waves were being generated and if we can
see those gravitational waves we can see
all the way back to the very beginning
of time this is a possibility which is
amazing and in fact when I wrote the
universe from nothing it was only
speculation but we may be on the
threshold to be able to do that now not
using this type of detector but this
detector here or a detector like it this
is a detector called the bicep detector
it's at the South Pole it's actually a
detector that looks at the cosmic
microwave background radiation and these
detectors are quite daunting to build
because um the this is here's a bicep
detector and another telescope at the
South Pole called the South Pole
telescope the South Pole isn't cold
enough top rate these things so we have
to send down liquid helium which we do
in the summer because and this is
surprising what surprising to me when I
first learned it but we can't go to the
South Pole in the winter I mean we could
go to the moon well that was fake but we
could go to the to the bottom of the of
the ocean we can do all these things we
can go on to space but we can't send
planes to the South Pole in the
wintertime so you know we send graduate
students and this is uh this is an image
one of my favorite images because it's
it's the bicep telescope taken at sunset
which is an interesting moment if you
think about it because sunset happens
once at the South Pole each year we
minute the Sun Goes Down it doesn't come
back up for six months so this picture
definitely was taken by a graduate
student because once you take that
picture you're stuck there nothing goes
in there and that's when we do the
science actually when it's dark and
quiet in the South Pole
so this detector was designed to look
for a signal in the Cosmic Microwave
Background that actually might be a
signal from a time that's much earlier
and I want to take you through that
signal okay here's a brief history of
time it's one of there's a few
complicated pictures I'll show you but
this is this is time not in 20-year
increments but in increments of seconds
the universe is about 10 to 18 seconds
old or so and this is the size of our
observable universe now and as it goes
back in time it gets smaller and smaller
and smaller and in a standard BIGBANG
picture at the time when the universe
was roughly let's say here was roughly a
millionth of a billionth of a billionth
of a billionth of a second old universe
would have been a certain size but we've
been able to solve this problem we think
of understanding why the universe looks
at the same in all directions by
realizing at that time something very
strange must might have happened that in
fact the properties of particle physics
are such that some energy could have
gotten stored in empty space an
amazingly large amount of energy and it
would have caused our universe to expand
by huge amount in a very short time it
would caused our universe to expand in
size by a million billion billion times
in a time interval of a millionth of a
billionth of a billionth of a billionth
of a second would have expanded in size
by at least 25 orders of magnitude in
scale in a time interval of 10 to the
minus 35 seconds it would have gone from
the size of an atom to the size of a
basketball in a millionth of a billionth
of a billionth of a billionth of a
second and there are reasons to think
that's the case when it was first
realized that might happen in 1980 and
proposal was made by a guy named Alan
Guth and that was very exciting because
you see it suddenly would explain why
the universe is the same in all
directions because now these regions are
so far apart they can't have
communicated but earlier times if the
universe expanded by a huge amount it
was 25 orders of magnitude smaller than
we would have imagined otherwise so
small that light could have traveled
across it and all of the regions that
now make up our universe could have been
communicating back then and thermalized
and become the same temperature and then
poof the whole thing expanded out and
then it took millions or in this case
billions of years again before those
regions could once again communicate so
the idea of inflation was a remarkably
interesting one because it can have we
think it happened we think it happened
but it could it could solve that problem
but during this incredible expansion of
the universe this catastrophic expansion
of universe one of the key predictions
which we made about 30 years ago 25
years ago or 30 years ago
we predicted that there'd be
gravitational waves and be produced
gravitational waves of a very particular
type that you could couldn't be mimicked
by anything else and I remember when I
first wrote about them I
thought I never thought they would be
detectable but they might be in fact
they may have been detected so here's an
image from a recent Scientific American
article I wrote it's complicated but
since I spent a lot of time with the
artist I thought I'd show it it may I
don't know if there's any information
transfer here I'll try and explain so
here's the idea that this is a brief
history of time this is today when
they're galaxies you go back in time to
the point where the causing microwave
background existed when the universe was
300 thousand years old
we go back to early an earlier times
right back to the Big Bang shortly after
the Big Bang there was this incredible
period of inflation we predict on small
scales remember the entire universe at
this time was about the size of an atom
quantum mechanics is happening and
everything's fluctuating around because
that's what happens in quantum systems
and if gravity is a quantum theory that
even space itself is fluctuating quantum
mechanically and so there's all these
random fluctuations in gravity in space
and when the universe blows up they get
frozen in all those fluctuations get
frozen in gravitational waves get frozen
in now they only begin to oscillate once
the universe becomes old enough for them
to oscillate a wave with a period of one
second won't begin to oscillate until
the universe is one second old a wave
with a period of 300,000 years will be
getting oscillate with universes 300,000
years old so this so here's a here's
some gravitational waves produced from
insulation they're produced on all
scales and it's a comes it starts to
oscillate when universes say a second
old well then it dies off because that's
what happens to gravitational waves as
the universe expands a longer wavelength
gravitational wave that Seyi has a has a
period of a year starts to oscillate
when the universe is a year old then it
dies off one that has maybe a period of
a century starts to oscillate much later
and then dies off but a wave that has a
period of 300,000 years
will just begin to oscillate when the
Cosmic Microwave Background forms
and what does that do well it'll produce
a signal as follows
so the Cosmic Microwave Background
occurs as follows you've got electrons
scattering radiation just about to be
captured in hydrogen and an electron
here is in a heat bath of radiation and
it and it scatters that radiation to us
today and we see the microwave
background but if a gravitational wave
the size of the whole universe comes
along it causes space to be smaller in
one direction and larger in another that
means that electron will see space
squished up in this direction will be
hotter in this direction than that
direction and that will cause that ready
that electron to scatter radiation
that's preferentially oscillating in one
direction polarized radiation the same
kind of polarized radiation that that
happens when light scatters off water
the reason if any of you are fishermen
the reason you like polarized sunglasses
is because when light scatters off the
ground it gets polarized and so let's
say it's oscillating in this direction
if you have glasses it only lets light
me and oscillating with that direction
then all the scattered radiation won't
get through and you won't see any glare
that's why polarized sunglasses block
out the glare when you look into water
but this radiation from scattered from
these electrons will be polarized so we
can look for polarization in the
microwave background and we can predict
what will happen so here is a little
region of the microwave background with
hot spots and cold spots and this is
random the light force can be randomly
polarized just by random effects and
this is what the signal would look like
with this image would look like if you
could measure polarization and there
were no gravitational waves if there are
gravitational waves it would look like
this noticeably different actually
noticeably not very different it's um
it's very very hard to do it's as hard
as it was to look at the Cosmic
Microwave Background and at least two
Nobel prizes have been won for
observations in the Cosmic Microwave
Background I should say the Cosmic
Microwave Background was discovered by
accident in 1965 in New Jersey of all
places by two people who didn't know
what the
they were doing but the won the Nobel
Prize because you don't have to know
what you're doing to win the Nobel Prize
you just have to do it
they were looking they turned a
telescope radio telescope up to the sky
and saw noise and they didn't know what
the noise was they got rid of white
dielectric material in the telescope
which was pigeon droppings the noise was
still there and eventually discovered
that what they'd seen was a signal for
the big bang but that was that was in
1965 and we've been able to image it as
you can see but the next phase is to try
and look for polarization so this bicep
detector was built at the South Pole to
look for polarization and they said okay
if a gravitational wave from the
beginning of time were to come through
our detector we would see this
snake-like pattern of polarization
because though that snake-like pattern
is unique signature of gravitational
waves that might have happened at the
beginning of time and so this was a
prediction and then on March 17th I
think two years ago the experiment
presented this data if this data is
correct this is perhaps the most
important image in the history of
science because if this is correct
these are gravitational waves from the
beginning of time this is a direct image
if you wish of processes that were
happening when the universe was a
millionth of a billionth of a billionth
of a billionth of a second old it's also
the first detection of gravitational
waves but just think about that if this
is true it pushes our window on the
universe back not by an order of
magnitude but by 49 orders of magnitude
our observable window goes from 300,000
years old right back to the when the
universe was almost less than 10 to
minus 35 seconds old so when an
experiment can improve things or when a
new Java release improves things by an
aura magnitude that's a big deal right
49 orders of magnitude is a really big
deal because this will allow us to test
our ideas of the
very beginning and that's why people
like me got incredibly excited now I
said if this is correct this looks
exactly like it's supposed to look if it
comes as we predicted I did say I
predicted this about 30 years ago but we
have to be certain extraordinary claims
require extraordinary evidence as Carl
Sagan repeated although he wasn't the
first person to whom bent that phrase so
let me just show give you a sense of the
problem here and I'll show you an image
it's techno so this is another way of
seeing that this is angle on the sky and
this is power in polarization it doesn't
really matter if you know what it is
except the predicted signal from
inflation looks like that here's the
data that was seen by by Seth it looks
just like it's supposed to look as a
function of angle on the sky this was
noise because you see there's noise this
radiation is coming through our galaxy
remember I had to remove the galaxy in
my first image well there's there's lots
of noise in our galaxy there's dust
there's all sorts of other things and
they assumed from measurements have been
taking that the dust was small enough to
not have that effect any big effect so
they were really seeing a signal now
there was another experiment called the
Planck satellite a European satellite
that's gone up to look at the microwave
background they were very upset by this
discovery because they wanted to
discover it and but they were able to
look at the Atari sky and measure the
dust in our galaxy as well as everything
else and they discovered something very
depressing there's a lot more dust in
our galaxy and people thought they
actually about a few months later
produced an image and this little peak
here is this peak here so this is the
predicted signal from inflation and what
they would have measured and they said
look dust polarized dust in our galaxy
because little there's magnetic fields
and electric fields and dust can get
polarized and where radiation hits some
dust on our galaxy it gets polarized and
they said lo and behold there's enough
dust that in principle it could produce
the signal that was seen now the dust
produces a flat signal and you notice
this goes up and down so that that
suggests that maybe it's a
real signal so these people said now
they probably saw Duff's these people
said no we saw gravitational waves the
big Bing give us a Nobel Prize and there
was a big debate both groups really
wanted the other group to be wrong
growth groups had real reasons to think
that they were right so what did these
groups do did they cut it up each
other's heads off no what they did was
they got together and said let's let's
get together and try and look at the and
combine our data to try and get a better
idea of what actually is the case and to
me I represent that because I think it's
such an important aspect of science that
that ultimately our ideology our
religion our language doesn't get in the
way and the ultimate purpose of all
these things is to find out how the
universe really works it brings people
together not like other things like
religion now so this is the paper it
came out so these two groups got
together and published a joint paper or
waiting and and earlier this year they
came out said well you know there's that
there's we this one experiment found a
lot of dust in a region centered on the
other experiment the uncertainties are
large and so we had to do a joint
analysis to reduce the uncertainties and
that was what was done and the two
groups got together and produced a
number of figures so here here is the
new and the new data here's the old data
so there's some number and the number
wasn't zero and that number are tells us
that our gravitational waves in the Big
Bang this was the original bicep result
this number R was 0.2 plus or minus some
small number the new the new analysis on
the same scale says that the best-fit
value of R is point zero five not zero
but the uncertainties are such that
there's only a 92 percent likelihood
that that result is correct
namely there's an 8 percent probability
that just random backgrounds when
there's no gravitational waves of proof
that signal and 92% isn't good enough in
physics at least in this kind of physics
in fact it's good enough in medicine but
in a real science it thank you
I'm particularly attuned to that because
we have this jerk running for president
who's a neurosurgeon he's proved that
you don't have to know anything to be a
neurosurgeon but anyway the 92% isn't
good enough
normally we want would want to know at
least to 95% and really for a
significant discovery which is telling
us we know about the early universe in a
way we've never known about it before
we'd want 99.99% likelihood and it just
isn't that so what we now know is maybe
these are gravitational waves from the
Big Bang maybe they're not we have to
improve the experiment to find out but I
want to spend the last few minutes of
the talk saying what if this is a real
discovery what will it tell us that we
wouldn't have known otherwise so I think
I gave the actual data but it's
basically it it says what I said just
said in an in a more technical way what
if this signal is right well it'll tell
us some things that are amazing why does
inflation happen inflation happens in
the early universe because universe gets
stuck here in Antwerp before we get very
cold today very quickly
there'd be water on the ground and that
water wouldn't turn to ice because cars
would be driving through it and and it
gets stirred around and so the the
temperature could fall well well below
zero Celsius and the and then water
whit's remain water until it was still
for a little while then suddenly boom it
would form ice which is dangerous black
ice okay when that ice forms a lot of
energy is released that's what we call a
phase transition in physics liquid
changing to solid when that happens if
the liquid is is still liquid at a
temperature far below where it's
supposed to be energy gets released in
that process well
what happened what we think happened in
the our early universe is that the
universe got stuck in some state that
wasn't the correct state as the universe
cooled down and eventually that energy
got released as the universe basically
went to its new ground state there was a
phase transition and all that energy got
released we call this a false fact and
we call that's a true vacuum but when
the universe is stuck up there that's
when you get inflation because it turns
out if you put energy and empty space
literally the universe is in the wrong
State so there's energy stored in empty
space there's nothing there but there's
energy stored in it that energy is
gravitationally repulsive I mean all of
you took physics and many of you had to
probably take it to get to where you are
now know that gravity sucks
it always pulls but in fact it can blow
as well if you put energy and empty
space gravity becomes gravitation and
becomes repulsive and so if energy gets
stuck in empty space for a little while
that causes this incredible period of
inflation this happens because the
universe gets stuck in some state
there's a phase transition now that
really means the properties of the
universe change the properties of matter
change the properties of the forces
between elementary particles change when
a phase transition happens now we know
there are various phase transitions that
happened when the universe evolved for
example when the universe was only a
millionth of a millionth of a second old
we know there was a phase transition
because there are two forces in nature
in fact a belgian won the nobel prize
last year for the discovery of the fact
that there are two forces that appear
very different the electromagnetic force
and another force called the weak force
they appear to be very different but
when the universe was only a millionth
of a millionth of a second old those two
forces looked identical then as the
universe cooled there was a phase
transition and one force began to look
very different than the other and
Francois and glair along with Peter
Higgs proposed a mechanism to understand
that so we know those kinds of phase
transitions happen but the interesting
thing is from particle physics arguments
we expect there would be a phase trends
at a time when the universe was a
millionth of a billionth of a billionth
of a billionth of a second old because
there are three forces in nature other
than gravity the electromagnetic force
the weak force and the strong force and
they're very different they're very
different strengths on the scales we
measure now but the amazing thing that
we've learned is that quantum mechanics
tells us the strength of forces changes
as you go to smaller and smaller scales
or higher and higher energies
electromagnetism gets stronger as the
weak force but it turns out the strong
force gets weaker so these forces are
very different in magnitude on the scale
we measure today but if we go 16 orders
of magnitude a scale smaller than the
size of the proton they start to look
very similar in 1975 people said you
know what maybe all the forces come
together and get unified at this
incredibly small scale and it was a good
idea but when we actually measure the
strength of these forces as we can do
and plug in the known particles in
nature to do the calculation we find out
that the forces don't unify but it was
realized that if you added a new kind of
symmetry of nature that many of us
expected to exist something called
supersymmetry
at a scale that might be probed at the
Large Hadron Collider it changes
everything and all the forces of nature
will get unified at a single scale and
at that scale what will happen is when
the universe has a temperature higher
than this amount and early in early
times all the forces will look the same
as the universe cools down to the way
the temperature gets this point suddenly
the forces will begin to look different
that's a phase transition it's a natural
place for inflation to happen so if we
were to be able to see gravitational
waves from this time we would be able to
throw particle physics on a scale 16
orders of magnitude smaller than the
size of proton that's a thousand billion
times smaller than the scale we can
probe at the Large Hadron Collider and
so we would be able to probe by looking
at the universe back to its early
moments of existence
particle physics on a scale we'll never
be able to probe directly at colliders
here to build a Collider that would
produce energies of this scale you'd
have to have a radius something like the
earth-moon radius and it's hard enough
to get governments to agree to build the
Large Hadron Collider much less that but
we can begin to probe these ideas other
places not just with gravitational waves
in fact here's one place where we are
also probing these physics this is an
another amazing bit of technology this
is in Japan in kameoka Japan and the
Cameo camonte came again to mind this is
a working mine and in this working mine
we built a large 50,000 ton tank of
water surrounded by 12,000 photo tubes
here's some physicists on a little
floating boat as little as the thing is
being filled up and this tank had to be
kept with the purity of a cleanroom in
the middle of a working mine and what
what happened is we filled it up with
50,000 tons of water and we left it in
the dark
why because it turns out if the three
forces of nature come together at the
scale I've just described then and for
Antwerp it's a real problem
diamonds aren't forever because even
matter will be unstable we can predict
that protons will decay but it's okay
you don't have to sell your diamonds
because protons will decay we predicted
with a lifetime of 10 to the 30th years
how could we probe that we use
probability quantum mechanics says the
average proton will decay in 10 to the
30th years but if I get 10 to the 30th
protons together on average one will
decay each year where do you find 10 to
the 30th protons 50,000 tons of water so
this tank was built with all this water
waiting in the dark for one proton to
decay for this light you hope the
machine isn't turned off during that
second because so it's been running for
30 years and it hasn't seen a proton
decay
but that's okay because those original
calculations were done before we
invented supersymmetry and that makes
the proton live about a thousand times
longer so we're still waiting but the
important thing to realize is well it
may be observed that a proton may decay
by the way this tank was useful for
other things in the Nobel Prize this
year was given to a group working in
this tank who actually looked at
particles called neutrinos which I'm
happy to answer the question period
about but the point is that we don't
have to look in just one place to try
and test our ideas the universe is a
great laboratory as far as we can tell
the experiment on once and now it's just
data analysis but we might be able to
measure exactly the same physics by
seeing protons the gates and more
importantly if the gravitational waves
for inflation are really there it will
tell us the scale of grand unification
it'll tell us what to look for we can
probe the physics and we can refine
these kind of detectors to specifically
look for proton decay toes should be
predicted but there other places and the
other place we'll do experiments is of
course in Geneva for the as I said the
most complicated machine that humans
have ever ever constructed this is if
you go to Geneva and you land in the in
the airport you look out you see a nice
countryside but underneath that
countryside is a tunnel 26 kilometers
around that goes up not only from Geneva
under the Jura mountains into France and
in that tunnel we accelerate protons at
99.99999% the speed of light in this
direction and other protons at 99.99999%
the speed of light in that direction and
collide them they go around thousands of
time each second between France and
Switzerland without passports or
anything and then you don't really need
them there anyway but and they collide
and and we built this detector to test
these idea these this experiment to
detect these ideas and and it's really
amazing to me this is a testimony to the
these are the Gothic cathedrals of the
21st century you know in the in the
Gothic cathedrals built in the 11th and
12th centuries they push the existing
technology they took a century to build
they're built by thousands of artisans
over centuries those artisans spoke many
different languages and their words for
the glory of God this is for the glory
of nature this machine was built by ten
thousand physicists PhD physicists took
over 20 years to do those physicists
from over 100 countries with dozens of
languages dozens were religions and
everything else had to design things
with specifications of better than a
millionth of a centimeter so this would
all work this machine has to be in fact
set up at once again this has to be done
accurately enough that even the moon the
tidal forces of the moon over the month
change the size of this ring by an
amount that has to be adjusted so that
this thing can work and we build this
incredible tunnel the tunnel itself
involves tons of liquid helium it's the
largest cryogenic facility in the world
the vacuum in the tunnel is more sparse
than the vacuum in space by the
International Space Station and we build
these incredible detectors to look at
these collisions of particles to try and
find and look for new physics this is
one of the smaller ones called the CMS
detector the compact muon solenoid it
contains more iron than is in the Eiffel
Tower the magnetic fields are so great I
think I have a much better picture
because I'm in it the these two halves
when it's running they're not apart but
when it's not running they're apart each
weighs 20,000 tons the magnetic field is
so great that even though they're not on
wheels if it was turned on then be
pulled together each second
speaking of data okay every second more
than a thousand terabytes of data is
being generated by the whole Large
Hadron Collider okay we have to build
lots of new ways to store and analyze
the data than life to throw most of it
out using distributed computing as you
know of course the world wide web was
created at the Large Hadron Collider
what was a Large Hadron Collider laugh
earlier on because physicists wanted to
be able to export data and manipulate it
without worrying about where they were
and it was therefore important at large
collaborations because the
collaborations that the experimental
collaborations here each collaboration
has over five thousand physicists on it
when you look at the paper
McKeen a paper that came out from the
Large Hadron Collider the paper was four
pages long the list of authors was
twenty three pages long the list of
institutions was eight pages long these
are incredibly complex they are this is
literally the most complex machine that
was ever designed as I say and here's
the other one called atlas well
these detectors let me go back I guess
before I talk for the co V as you know
they saw the Higgs particle and as that
mister and glare and mr. Higgs won the
Nobel Prize because because this
validated the prediction that two forces
in nature were once the same but what we
really expected most of us to see well
before the Higgs in fact that we didn't
even know if it would detect eggs was
these new particles in nature due to
supersymmetry the Large Hadron Collider
is now up and running again with twice
the energy that it had before and higher
intensity and if supersymmetry exists as
a force of nature as a new as a new
symmetry of nature then we may detect it
in the next year or two at the Large
Hadron Collider if we do it will tell us
our ideas about grand unification are
correct if it doesn't it'll tell us well
after revise them so we're probing the
very earliest moments of time in lots of
different ways and we don't know what's
gonna happen but the but the last thing
I think I want to tell you about because
I think it's amazing and when I wrote
the universe from nothing I talked about
something called the multiverse which is
a current one could say fad but but an
idea in physics that that has changed
the way we think of the universe we used
to define the universe to be everything
but that's a pretty crappy definition
because it really isn't operational if
you want to implement it in a code it
wouldn't really be effective okay so
operationally we now
about the universe to be that region of
space with which one day we can
communicate or we could have
communicated before so it's the locus of
points that that we could ever
communicate with that that's a sensible
definition of our universe because it's
the region which over which we can have
empirical evidence and now it turns out
if there's inflation it turns out it's
most likely that our universe isn't
unique because remember inflation is
like water freezing okay well water
freezes at different points the little
seeds happen and and liquids suddenly
form ice here or there and icicles on a
on a windowpane in the in the winter and
if inflation happened things get stuck
but inflation will happen at one will
end at one point at a different time
than another point and so when inflation
ends you get a big bang so our entire
universe could come from some small
region where inflation ended but there
can be other regions that are still
inflating now other regions of space
that haven't yet ended inflation and in
fact we predict if inflation is correct
that inflation is eternal that there are
universes far beyond the REME realm will
ever be able to see that are about to be
created and it turns out each way
inflation ends the forces of nature can
be different in that new universe so it
could be that the forces of nature and
our universe are what they are as an
accident that in other universities that
have different data of different
behaviors all of this is very
speculative but well motivated unlike
religion and and but we talked about it
and it may explain some curious features
of our universe that I dealt with my
last book but the insignias that was all
speculation
it was metaphysics but we could turn
metaphysics into physics because you see
if we can measure gravitational waves
for inflation here's the idea of
inflation background space expanding
inflation ends at some point and the
universe and and all that energy is
released in a hot Big Bang and
eventually universe forms in another
region there may be another Big Bang but
the laws of physics are different so
there may be no galaxies
universe a lot of galaxies in this one
etc I think I have another picture of
that so there so it could be that in the
Metaverse or multiverse there are many
different universes
they'll never communicate with each
other because the space between them is
expanding exponentially fast so as I say
it sounded like metaphysics but if we
can measure that inflation happened if
we can measure gravitational waves from
inflation we can determine the process
by which inflation happened we can
determine whether inflation will be
eternal and we will know indirectly that
those other universes exists it's just
like a little over a hundred years ago
when atoms were first proposed no-one
ever thought you'd be able to see atoms
directly but all the indirect evidence
suggested atoms existed now it turns out
we can image them but if if we can
measure gravitational from inflation
then we'll turn metaphysics into physics
we'll be able to experimentally
determine that there must be other
universes out there in which the laws of
physics may be different this is
something that honestly a decade ago we
would have thought was just impossible
we would have thought it was a realm of
theoretical physics it turns out that
this also allows to see if gravity is a
quantum theory but I won't talk about
that today because I'd like to end on
time I just want to say that this is an
amazing journey back to the beginning of
time we're not there yet
but starting looking at their galaxies
and imagining what's out there we've
been able to use the most amazing
technologies you can imagine to probe
for earlier in earlier times and learn
about the universe on scales that we
would never have imagined we could ever
see before certainly when I was a
graduate student I would never have
imagined that we'd ever be able to test
these ideas and learn not only that
we're insignificant but that the future
is miserable because it turns out if
there's energy and empty space the
expansion of the universe will continue
and turns out faster and faster and
faster and the rest of the universe will
disappear so we're living at a very
special time the only time when
observational e-verify we're living in a
very special time
and so those are the two things I want
to tell you about we've learned with our
modern technology by going back to the
earliest moments of the universe that
everything you're doing at this
conference is insignificant in a cosmic
scale and that no matter what you do in
the future it'll all be forgotten thank
you very much
still got five minutes you want to do
something after some questions yes sir
yes still got five minutes if you have
some urgent questions looks like we've
got a winner here mm-hmm
just a simple question what do things
look like when they're a million times
when you get to a scale like a million
times smaller than a so now well we the
answer is that on that scale the
elementary particles that are relevant
are not protons and neutrons and things
were used to the only particles are
relevant are things called quarks and
electrons but so protons are made of
things called quarks we can actually
measure that now and as far as we can
tell quarks are not made of anything
smaller so as far as we can tell the
fundamental building blocks of all
matter in the universe are just these
particles called quarks and electrons
essentially and on that small scale
those are the operational particles but
interestingly enough when you get to
ever smaller scale so that's what what
universe looks like on a millionth of a
millionth of the size of a proton but
when you get to much smaller scales we
think they're a whole slew of new
massive elementary particles that change
the way nature behaves but that's the
idea but we don't know yet and that's
what we want to test what these ideas we
want to see if Forks are made of
something else or if they're new forces
of nature that arise these are
speculations we have very good ideas
we've been batting them around for 50
years but just like people in an
isolation tank and I was once in an
isolation tank near here in Amsterdam
when I was on a book tour it's a good
thing to be doing in a book tour you
began to hallucinate sure in there long
enough well we've been hallucinating for
50 years waiting for the Large Hadron
Collider we have lots of theories and
I'm sure almost all of them are wrong
because that's the one thing we don't
really emphasize much is that when in in
the popular media is most physics
theories are wrong and and that's if it
wasn't the case anyone could do physics
okay and in fact the most exciting state
to be in if you're a physicist or a
theoretical physicist either wrong or
confused and I'm both most of the time
the other questions any brave people
don't be shy oh all the way up down oh
yeah good a shouting yeah well I'm gonna
run up there no I'll run okay well okay
I know four kilograms during the book so
why not okay where are you know what I'm
gonna do my ride this thing while I'm
waiting okay
here the question comes okay I'm gonna
answer while I'm riding this thing
killed myself before design-builder turn
on a large cart recliner yep so I heard
that China wants to build their own
Large Hadron Collider
mm-hm do you think they'll be able to do
it if you were talking about these sort
of Precision's oh do I think they'll
have the technical ability yeah sure
they most of them have been trained in
the United States I'm not joking I mean
that's one of the few good things about
being in the United States is right now
we get the best young people in the
world coming to our graduate school yeah
I don't know whether that'll persist but
that's certainly been the case up to now
and some of them stay in the United
States I'm gonna go back it it will be
in they are proposing a much bigger
Collider and and it's certainly we are
we're thinking about going beyond the
Large Hadron Collider the question is
whether there'll be the political will
elsewhere to build such a thing I mean
the Large Hadron Collider costs 10
billion dollars more or less which
sounds like a lot of money but it's not
a lot of money I'm Corey I mean it's
what the air conditioning bill was and
during the Iraq war for a week and it's
clearly much more useful and so I
suspect that China may be the next place
to build a Collider but at the same time
the next Collider is probably gonna be
required such a large amount of money
and expertise that it's unlikely than
any individual country will build it
already the Large Hadron Collider is a
collaboration of many many different
countries so even if China becomes the
main site of the next Collider I suspect
it will become international it'll just
be too complex a project for any one
country to build that time has long past
and certainly the United States long ago
stopped trying to go alone and and what
wasn't able to and and so anyway well
you know try
certainly is trying very hard to become
a world leader in fundamental physics
and they're doing it by spending a lot
of money I'll be frank what is much more
important than spending money to become
a world leader in science is to train
students to be skeptical and to not
respect their professors that's very
important because that's the essence of
science is that no there are no
scientific authorities there's
scientific experts gonna try this I'm
going to say I nearly killed myself
beforehand with it ok I'm gonna answer
this question while doing this no no no
get awake get awake you in ok so I'll
tell you an anecdote later on ok there
we go now I'm gonna show I can answer
for this question while doing this so
the next question yeah so so bottom line
is that's much more important scepticism
antiphon and as some of you may have had
Chinese students the problem with right
now in Chinese education up to now is
that unfortunately we're professors are
treated with far too much respect and so
that's got to be gone look at that I'm
amazing ok so anyway best question the
last the last question how did the
universe in the very beginning end up in
that unstable state well it it the
universe was cooling very fast and
things that are cooling very fast can
get stuck in the wrong state as I say it
happens all the time
so at very early times when the universe
was very hot the state it was in was not
an unstable state but as it cooled it
got below the point at which that state
was the preferred state of matter and
radiation and the forces of nature so
it's just a matter of the fact that the
universe was cooling if it hadn't been
cooling it would have been an
equilibrium but there are times in our
universe when it can go out of
equilibrium and the amazing thing to me
and I've just written my new book is it
largely it's to some extent about this
is it reinforces the notion that we're
here as a cosmic accident because if if
the fields of the universe had cooled in
a different way had frozen in a
different way
matter wouldn't be
here so where's my last book addressed
the question why is there something
rather nothing my new book addresses the
question why are we here and the answer
is there's no reason whatsoever thank
you I didn't follow so we've got a 30
minute break I did forget to mention if
you want to try these hoverboards
there's bill there will be shop at the
reception dangerous they are dangerous
that's why the sound didn't work
actually in the opening keynote but I'll
talk about our later but you can try
them out next to the reception today and
tomorrow and even purchase them if you
