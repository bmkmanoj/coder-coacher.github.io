developer evangelist for a company
called twilio who's not heard about
twilio here go so quite a few people
twilio is a communications api that
helps develop it like ourselves adding
SMS messages voice video two-factor
authentication I've been messaging
anything to do with communications into
your applications those are the
applications you already be able to in
the languages you already know so this
is what video is if you want to know
more about Philly or later just come and
find me over here we do can be as with
you so just come and find me this is as
much as I'm going to talk about Twitter
right now because I have something that
is way more important and i really want
to start by saying i am not a hacker ok
i will be showing you some of the Hawks
of then and i will be showing you why of
the net and why i was able to do it but
I'm sure that some of you will be way
way better hacking than I am however not
being a hacker didn't stop me from being
able to hack applications and this is
what I really wanted to keep in mind
it's very easy to hack applications if
you don't think about security it's very
easy to have your application hacked if
you don't think about security and
talking about security I kind of want to
tell you a little bit about myself as I
said I'm not harket I really do care
about security I think about security
quite a lot I think about how a secure I
am at times so I think about these all
the time ok and this is not my house by
the way I have cameras there but this is
not really my house just so I get this
one out of the way and I want to show
you the next life as well so these next
slides is really important so make sure
you read the whole of it and I am only
joking the most important part from
these lies is a disclaimer which I'm
about to show you right now which is
this one ok
have not really hot your app and the
reason I have to say that is because
companies tend to get Suey and I made up
this word okay companies tends to get
really suey when you hack their
applications and show everyone how
you've done it so I had to be really
careful about the things I was doing
here especially because I'm showing
everyone this is being recorded so I
need to make sure that I'm not coming on
stage in hacking facebook for example
because that wouldn't be very nice but
let's just like move on here here knows
how an HTTP request works everyone right
cool so the free spool of an HTTP
request is you've got a user the user
makes an HTP request to a server that
server them response pretty simple right
all the logic is on that server that
server responds and everything is okay
however there are ways you can get in
the middle of it and funnily enough when
I say you can get in the middle of it
I'm obviously talking about a very
famous hack which is called the men in
the middle hack which is exactly what I
just did on the very beginning of this
soak I was showing you what the men in
the middle hawk is and what the men in
the middle hack is is basically you have
a new character which I use a pirate
flag to to show you this and instead of
making a request to the server you now
make a request of this new character and
these new character then makes a request
to the server as a user you don't see
that you don't really know what's going
on okay and this is what the men in the
middle does the main immediate
intercepts every single one of your
request sent those requests back to the
server and now oh sorry too early and
now that server returns back to the user
now I just pour best because my next
slide is like a the greatest example of
a men in the middle attack okay
who's playing pokemon pokemon go no yeah
some people playing pokemon girl yeah a
little bit okay why is Pokemon go
importance to this so because Pokemon go
was one of the biggest applications that
was attacked by a men in the middle
request okay the men in the middle hack
wasn't so people to get your information
your google account your passwords or
how many pokemons you had the man in the
middle attack was made because they
wanted to enable this right so the
premises Pokemon go is you walk around
so you've got the street so this is like
a google map thing you walk around and
you find pikachus you find Bulbasaur's
you find Pokemon now some lazy people
decided there well I want to catch
pikachus but I don't want to walk around
so how can I do that and basically they
found out that every single time you
move on the app the app would send they
should be request to a server to say
where you were to show you which
pokemons is which Pokemon Zika get so
this was like a nap this is an app that
is connected to an API all the time
right so we're not talking about hackers
here we're talking about kids who want
to get pikachus okay and why is it
important because their motivation here
is to get Pikachu's so they found their
way to go around the system so they
could build something like this now all
they have to do is they click on the
arrows and they can move around and they
can get Pikachu's but let me give you so
I just talked about motivation right and
when I asked how many people play
pokemon here only some people raise
their hands I bet that a lot more people
drink beer here then play pokemon so I'm
going to tell you the story of Cooper
Gretzky so Cooper Gretzky is a Polish
developer who realized that there was a
way for him to get free beer
so talk about motivation now before I
carry on I always like to point this out
the register is a web journal kind of
thing and this is not Cooper Gretzky
this is what the register thinks is a
polish developer or a Polish hacker I
don't know if anyone is polish here but
do you dress like these on the weekends
when you had someone probably yeah of
course yeah of course but let's talk
about his hack so what did Cooper
Gretzky actually did Cooper Gretzky
managed to hack an application using
loyalty okay now he realized that there
was a loyalty up in Poland that allowed
you to get one token every single time
you bought a beer okay every five beers
you both you get a free beer so stay
with me on the motivation here so five
years one free beer okay so it's almost
like i know we have a starbucks on the
other side of the road it's almost like
you go to starbucks to get a coffee then
they give you a star and for every 15 *
to get free coffee in this case for
every five years this is poland we
talking about every five years you get
one free beer so loyalty was really
really a big motivation to this guy and
he also realized that the way this
loyalty application worked was you would
go ahead by a beer then someone would
scan your phone against one of these
beacons here the beacon would then
return a token through the application
and the mobile application would then
make a request to the server for example
right so the only reason the becomes
were here was so people could just use
the app to get three dias they had to go
through this process what he also
realized was if you were to add an HTTP
proxy to the middle here
so again I'm using the world middle if
you were to add a HTTP proxy to the
middle he would be able to intersect
every single request yes made right and
sure enough he did bad so now he had a
token so this is like a this is the
authentication token for this app he
also had some information about the
beacon and he also had some information
about the products because as it turned
out it wasn't just beer that you could
buy to get free products he only knew
about the beers and this is what he was
interested in so he has all these
information and if you look at the very
top of this thing here so this is taken
from his hack if you look at the very
top it shows you what server or it shows
you what URL you need to make a request
to it's got pretty much everything you
need right so sure enough he made
requests to this server and every single
time he made the request he got a free
beer now one thing about Cooper gretzky
right now it's unknown how many beers he
actually had for free okay like he had a
unknown amount of beer all I know about
Cooper gretzky so this hack happens in
August last year so this was in August
2016 all I know was that Cooper gretzky
hasn't been blogging everything he just
disappeared it could be because he's
still drinking beer he's too busy
without like all the freebies he had or
you know something happens looking at
his blog and i look at his blog every
now and then just to make sure like he's
no like you thought of see if he's back
i want to see what happens the guy he
used to block every month like once a
month like we all do but yeah he's last
blog post was in August 2016 which could
be because he got a job which could be
because he know he got to drunkenness
you drunk right now but this is this is
Cooper great story now what could the
app builders and I'm
he talking about these lawyer Fiat I'm
talking about the Pokemon app what could
they have done to stop it like what kind
of things they could have done that
could actually stop goober from doing
this or stop the kids from trying to get
extra Pikachu so free the first thing
they could have done is they could have
encrypted all the values like edgy so
that Jason packets i showed you had
everything in it like you don't have to
be a wizard to know how to use those
things it's adjacent pocket now if you
are a Java developer or if you are an
Android developer I don't know do we
have any Android developers here go some
Android developers if you're an Android
developer you will be quite familiar
with this so I'm just showing you how to
encrypt a value and the reason I show
this is there's no excuse like it's very
easy to encrypt so this is a greater
file where you download a library then
you have your encryption here so this is
how you would encrypt a string and this
is how you would the crip a string okay
now the one thing that you need to keep
in mind is that when you encrypt the
string you have an encryption key okay
that encryption key is right there and
when you do that obviously as we've all
done in the past your keys are going to
end up in github so that's just
something that's just a caveat okay and
the reason I show this specific page
here is because I think the name of the
guy was Luke the reason I showed this
specific page here is because look made
a mistake once he committed his Amazon
AWS keys into github and by committees
amazon AWS keys to github he gave it
access to the world okay he commits it
to a public repository and he committed
this key for 20 minutes it took him 20
minutes to realize something was wrong
okay and basically what was wrong was
there's people on github who are
basically tracking every single push
every single commit
to see if a key has been other to github
and whenever a key has been added to get
her what they do is they get that key
they spin up spin up a bunch of service
and when they spin up their service they
start mining bitcoins on them you know
as you do in 20 minutes his bill which
is right here twenty-three thousand
dollars over three almost three and a
half thousand dollars in 20 minutes okay
so this is the time it took him for him
to realize that so the reason I have
this live here is because it's a caveat
obviously I tell you like encrypt
everything you shouldn't have your keys
inside your code and we're going to talk
about ways we can actually move those
kids away from your code the other thing
they could have done is they could have
used security features okay when they
exist in so I have to be honest with you
I do not like I beacons okay I do not
like them i think the crack and I've
given the soap once and as it turned out
the esc mode people were in the room and
I said that and they were Satan really
like it so the FMO sleep or people who
make the ibeacon so they were in the
room they came and talked to me but I do
not like I because if you like them it's
so good this is like my personal
preferences I I do not like them but the
one thing about ibeacons is you can
actually encrypt them there's ways you
can secure an ibeacon but as you saw on
my previous example the ibeacons were
completely unsecured like there was no
security around the ibeacon so there's
things we can do with ibeacons which is
like you can clone an idea can you can
do certain things with it and this is
one of the things this this specific up
we've done like just look at the
security features like if you using
external hardware just think about what
can I do to protect it now the other
thing I want to talk about this is to
keep pinning and certificate billions of
funny one because most app developers
like big waves they say yes I am making
API requests and I'm making those
ssl so I'm safe right because i'm making
an https request well no because as you
saw in my example in my own the
beginning of this on the beginning of
this oak i was also using an HTTPS URL
but you can spoof it okay and it's very
easy to spoof so certificate pinning is
basically a methodology for you to pin
your up into the server so now you're
basically saying only when you have that
same key only when you have that same
public key you can make a request to the
server okay and this is why it's called
pinning so if you say right I've got my
app here I've got my server here and I
can only communicate this way if someone
comes in the middle they don't have my
key they don't know what Mike is so they
can't get any of my information so so
just keep pinning this is one example
that's fifty pinning where you basically
start with the host name for the host
name is whatever ap are you using then
you move on to actually declaring the
certificate key and then you basically
just create this is katina ok now
another caveat on this one is you will
notice I have my certificate key here ok
and we'll get to it in a bit now the
other thing I want to talk about is do
not trust the device ok because some
people say wow yeah but when you talk
about Android applications and this also
applies to iOS applications I happen to
be an Android developer but this also
applies to iOS applications the
applications are compiled like they get
into the server they get all messed up
to get all like mangled up and
everything so there's no way someone's
going to be able to just open that file
decompiling an application is very easy
ok this is not a hacker's website this
is not a hacking tool this is a tool
developers actually used to decompile
applications some of those developers
will use this suit decompile application
for kids because they want to see how
they work they want to try and find a
bug some developers will use it for the
bad
now I'm going to show you how just how
quickly you can decompile an application
here and I'm going to be decompiling the
same application i showed you on the
very beginning but basically the
companion application is this okay so
you start off by calling the tool then
you end up with a Z compiled application
and as you can see you've now got all
the folders and everything you've got
access to everything in this live
application and I'm even going further
because I'm like I'm trying to get
information from this application I just
be compiled so I'm trying to get
passwords and everything and you know
sure enough I am doctors getting those
strings okay now we're just going to
very quickly move on to those strings
because like I keep on saying like oh
yeah you shouldn't use strings in your
application so what can you do like what
kind of things you can do because I need
magic strings is like what every single
developer says like I need to have those
magic strings in my application
otherwise I tom like I can't communicate
I need to have like the API key or
something so I need to have this a my
application and obviously when you're
talking about a mobile application
because it on the server it's quite it's
quite different because people won't get
access to your keys on a server unless
they get access to the server in which
case you have bigger problems but with a
mobile app as soon as I'm on downloads
your app they're downloading the entire
thing they've got access to everything
and if they know how to decompile it
then yeah sure enough they can get
access to it so a few ways we can
protect those strings in a mobile
application one of them is obviously
encrypt the key you know you can encrypt
your encryption key for example the
second one is one of my favorites which
is just get those keys from a server so
instead of having those keys inside your
application as soon as the money stole
the application instead of someone opens
the application of the first time get
the keys from the server so that's one
way you could do that
one of the other ways of being
experimenting with is getting the keys
from the SDK sorry from the NDK so the
NDK is the native development kit in
android and the reason I say get those
from the NDK is the ndk is all written
in C C++ so it's way more complex than
just Java ok the code is way harder to
decompile then just been just the
company Java ok so that's one way you
could be back I don't know if you
noticed but I've got links at the bottom
of some of my slides I will be
publishing those lives as well so you
don't need to copy the links now but you
know feel free to take pictures but I
will be publishing those and all those
links will take you to these places so
like this link will take you to this
article which I rate now things
developer so it talks about things
developers can do to stop but what kind
of things can developers do to
proactively what can they start doing
how can they be proactive because you
shouldn't really wait until someone
hacks your application or someone hacks
your website until you start doing
something about it one of the things i
find that is really useful and not many
developers know about is adding
tampering deflection and something
detection is basically a way for you to
detect when your application is being
tampered with i'm going to use in other
words but when your application is being
tampered with so when someone is trying
to break into it someone is trying to be
something and adding some print
detection is fairly easy ok like this is
all code you can copy and paste ok you
can obviously change it however you like
but this is all code you can copy and
paste you will most likely find them on
stackoverflow and this is how we develop
as these things right we're going to
suckle slow copy it and put it in our
codes and delight so this is all codes
you can get from it what I'm doing in
this case is i am checking that someone
actually renamed my app because what
started doing as well with mobile
applications worse people would download
the
applications renaming them and
republishing them and the reason you do
that especially fuse alternative markets
is if the application generates any
revenue now you can start making the
revenue out of the application and
that's very easy because it didn't even
do the application so that's one good
way okay so you can add something like
this year code to check that the
application hasn't been renamed the
other thing you can do is you can check
that the application is being relocated
okay when it comes to android we can
think about the Amazon market and over
to the Play market but there are so many
alternative markets there are like
hundreds of them especially in Asia
there's like loads and loads of them
because most of the Asian phones they
don't really support the play store
because they're not like official google
phones so there are loads of them and
what happens is there's being like an
influx of people actually downloading
those apps and just republishing them
and then all of a sudden you find out
they've got all of these requests that
all of these errors coming from
somewhere else in the world that you're
not even aware of because you didn't
publishing to those markets so what this
code does is it checks like is the
application has the application being
sold from the Play market the Amazon
store if he has all goods if it hasn't
then stop it and this is like it's up to
you you can give an alert to the user as
well to say hey you've downloaded this
application but now you're on your own
because I'm not going to support this
because this is not mine or you can just
like disable the application and I'm
talking to Martin yesterday and he was
telling me he's upset about Pokemon
because Pokemon doesn't support rooted
phones anymore on Android and yeah I
know it's a bummer but that's you know
that's there are reasons for this which
kind of segues into well I'm going to
talk about signatures now check in your
application signature is another thing
every single time you compile an
application signature is generated so
there's a code that gets generated and
now with the magic of these java class
you
can actually check your application
signature you can check that the
application was actually compiled by you
okay if the application was d compiles
and compiled by someone else you
obviously don't want other people to be
using it because if you generate see any
revenue of this application now you're
probably not anymore because if they
went through the trouble of actually
recompiling it they're probably using
their own keys they're probably using
their own like abs account so this is
this is one way you can actually check
so just check the application signature
and and that's that's good now moving on
to this thing marketing doesn't like
which is check if the device is being
routed so why do I I have rooted phones
before and I had the same nations like I
couldn't access my bank at some point
because my phone was rooted my bank was
like hey we're not having this the
reason you would check if a phone is
rooted is because as soon as the phone
is rooted all of this security goes away
okay you've now got axes you've now got
like su access to be phone you can do
whatever you want to do so check in
Ekron application checking if your
device is rooted is important because
now you can make a decision and I'm not
saying you should always make a decision
to block an application when a device is
rooted however if you're a bank for
example then you should probably do that
checking if a checking for device is
rooted is fairly easy what you do is you
try to execute a command on that device
and that command is usually a few so su
is the way you get root access to in
UNIX systems so you try and execute su
and if that succeeds now you know this
phone is rooted okay this is one way for
you to check that there are several ways
there are several people so I think
there's an application called hi my
route which basically hides the fact
that you are rooted so people try and
bypass it people try and move around
this all the time but there are many
ways you can check if a if a device is
rooted and this is one way ok and this
it works
check for emulator ninety-five percent
of every single application that is
hacked our heart by an emulator because
it's so much easier like it's so much
easier to hack an application that is
running on an emulator because it get
access to everything then it is to just
run the application on a phone and try
and hack it via the phone so check you
for an emulator is basically this like
you want to check that the application
is actually running on a generic so the
android emulator is called generic there
are other things as well there's a song
called goldfish but there are the things
you can check obviously if you want to
check for stuff like Jeanne motion for
example which is just another android
emulator so not your Fisher one but you
can check for those things okay and yeah
there's absolutely no reason for an
application to run on an emulator an
application you publish there's
absolutely no reason for someone to
download this and try to run it in an
emulator so that's the one I would
suggest always like stopping if you see
people are using your application on the
emulator stockin okay there's no reason
for them to do that rooted phones maybe
emulators no checking if the application
is debuggable and this is usually the
time when people tell me well for hang
on if I compile an application and
release it then obviously my application
is not debuggable so in android and iOS
whenever you compile an application in
you say believe that application moving
to release mode okay so all of your
comments get stripped out all of the
garbage that you left there gets
stripped out okay and this is really
cool so why do I say check if the
application is debuggable because as it
turns out so this is how you check so
it's it's super easy check as it turns
out there are ways you can change an
application that using release mode into
debug mode and it's way easier than you
probably think so I've got a little
video here which shows you how
to make an application debuggable and so
remember i had that decompiled up what
I'm doing is I'm changing a file the
manifest file and I'm saying debug
equals true and now the application is
available so I didn't really have to do
much like I dick umpires an app which
was easy like there was something that
did it for me I got access to the
applications manifest which every single
Android application will have a manifest
and I just went ahead and change one
file and i turned the application into
is available application and obviously
when the application obviously when the
application is in the bug mode it smells
speaking out a load of like beta about
the application that can be logs there
can be anything and I've got access to
it so this is like a really easy one
like check if the application is in
debug mode if it is don't let it run and
this is usually the point so we're like
I don't know 38 minutes so this is
usually the point when people tell me
right so what do I do now like I'm
bashful's I'm like I don't know what to
this is he's telling me to do all these
things and i really like i don't know
where to go from here so one of the
things I usually tell people to use and
I was on the i was on the high
performance so today high performance
android talk today and programs index
guard were mentioned and and you know
quite rightly proguard is an amazing
tool for you to use and so is the ex
guard some i'm going to tell you a
little bit about programs and backs
guards as you can see their logos are
very similar because they are from the
same company the things to get from
program to program if you have android
studio installed you are using proguard
already so that's that's the good news
unless they have a really old version
but if you have a new version if you
have a new a new-ish project you are
using proguard okay and what programs
does is as you can see well at least or
by default like if you have enjoyed this
video its installed by default it does
name obfuscation so it actually changes
the name
of your methods for you when you compile
the application okay so this is all most
likely to come from a a web background
this is almost like minifying JavaScript
so it does it for you it does cold
optimization as well which is which is
cool because it does tree shaking for
example as he as you mentioned before in
your talk which is like all the garbage
you don't need it will get rid off okay
so you're a decaying like the final
compiled version of your code is going
to be way smaller because you're now
getting rid of everything you don't need
it will rename things like if you have a
variable called banana for example it
will rename that variable to be or
something like that so it makes like
every little helps on this they will
make your application smaller and by
making it smaller it will obviously make
it less readable you won your
application to be very not readable in
this case because when someone goes into
compiles it you don't want them to just
look at your code and know about all of
your business logic then when you look
at decks guards and lex card doesn't
coming sold by default okay and
obviously as you can see Dex guards does
way more ok so that's guard stuff like
class encryption for example when it
does class encryption it doesn't in a
way like it changes some of the
character so like Chinese characters for
example so it makes it really unreadable
I'll let you know Chinese it does Co
hiding through reflection as though so
instead of just calling your class
directly you now calling it through
reflection which makes it harder if
you're trying to go through the code
flow it does a string encryption for you
it does certificate check so you
actually checks that the certificate
that you using to access an ati is valid
it does debug the section which i just
talked about it has emulated a section
as well it does route detection and it
is tamper detection so most of the
things i just talked about Beck's guards
desk for you out of the box okay now to
the good news and bad news obviously I
just said programs is free
Dex guard costs money and the way Dex
cards like this it's a bit funny the way
Dex guards actually charges because it
charges you by the number of users you
have in your app so if you release an
application today for example it's
obviously not going to have that many
users so you pay not much for it and
then next year is to have a million
users in your app you're going to be way
more so it goes like I've seen it going
from anything between like four thousand
euros so like eighteen thousand euros so
it varies quite a lot ok and obvious if
you have a free application for example
then you know having that many users
won't be won't be good for you because
obviously you'll be paying way more even
if you don't make any money out of it
there are some other things you can use
ok so obviously i mentioned proguard the
next guard the safety nets API so the
face safety net API is an API made by
google ok the good news about the safety
net API is that it's free and it checks
for things like is that device rooted
for example so it does the same route
checks the reason I like using api's
like this instead of like just rolling
my own is it rooted or not if you know
like i mentioned roots of devices there
are many ways you can actually hide
their devices Reuters and because this
is an API it gets updated a lot more
often than your code so you're basically
just sending some information about that
device and Google will automagically I
just made up this words as well Google
will automatically tell you hey is that
that device is rooted so now you make a
decision and it also tells you if you're
different if that device is compatible
okay so this can work both ways and
obviously you can enable and disable
those things because a device that is
not approved by Google like an official
google device it won't be marked as
compatible okay because it's not
compatible to the Play Store so you
can't use the Play Store things and that
device will not be marks that's
impossible so this one is a two-edged
sword because you may or may not want to
use that one depending on the
application you won't be able to again
if you have a banking application you
probably want to use something like this
now implement the network security
configuration so this is 1 this is a
very new one so if you're an Android
developer when I say new get to you you
probably know what I'm talking about if
enough that's ok so new gas is the
latest version of Android so it's the
very latest version and the one thing
about android is as versions go stuff
stays behind ok so if you have a if you
have new gassing stored in your phone
you can totally is they think if you
don't then it's just not going to work
for you and I think new gas is like a
0.1 percent so one in four and every
five devices are Android devices now ok
which is which is cool but most of those
devices are still using really old
versions of Android if you if you want
to support something like new gas for
example it's cool but you're talking
about like 0.1 percent of the users who
are actually going to take any benefits
out of it a guy called mark murphy so
mark murphy there's a lot of security
like he writes loads of like security
what polls he talked about security
alert and yeah securities is very much
missing and what Mark Murphy did was he
made some changes to this API so he
works on android 4.2 which is currently
a version that is I think something like
forty percent of the Android users
actually use 4.2 and above so it just
makes this thing a bit more thing so it
just makes this thing a bit more
flexible for you so this is one thing as
well that you could use it does a few
other things so it does certificate
Vinnie for you for example it does debug
overrides for you so it checks for
debugging so it does a bunch of things
the website actually leaves everything
it does it's not the most
straightforward thing to integrate with
but again it's it's worth like spending
some time looking into it and like I
said with Mark Murphy this version of it
work from 4.2 and above which gives you
like a bit more room to play with and
I'm going to open for questions in a
minute but I want to finish this by
saying the internet is not a safe place
okay that there's absolutely no safety
on the internet so there's absolutely no
like it's a very Dodger place and
obviously mobile devices they fall into
that same category because of the you
are going to using so you are going to
be using some internet at some point so
it falls into the same category but the
one thing you need to give you mines is
but when it comes to safety you need to
make sure that you protect yourself like
just think about ways you can protect on
this early talker so today this extreme
underperformance okay so today the
speaker was actually talking about
things we can proactively do to actually
you know trying hot your code going to
like really going to like how your code
runs like and see what it does and think
about ways you can hack it so every
single mobile application I build I try
to hack it as well every one of my
friends who builds mobile applications I
say hey can I have the apk and I try to
hack it and sometimes they think I'm a
douche bag which is fine but it saves
you and it saves them a lot of headaches
like I'm not trying to slide them off by
saying you know you've not thought about
security but it saves people with lots
of headaches with that I was Marcus
pakona my twitter account is here my
emails here github android security
employees the website I run and I works
which video if you want to ask me any
questions about it feel free to ask and
obviously if you want to ask me any
questions about this so feel free to ask
me thank you very much
and obviously I do realize I'm between
you and beer right now so be mindful
about the questions are going to ask it
takes you long then thank you so all the
suggestions you made about being
proactive and doing certificate stunning
and checking your own signatures of yep
I mean that all doesn't help if you do
not do obfuscations correct because if I
can take my APK decompile it I mean I've
got access to that code as well right I
just change it yeah no benefits using so
the one way you can get around it is if
you have your key for example if you
have those things that you check against
if you get them from a server then you
can stop that if you get them from the
NDK for example as I mentioned then you
can stop that or you can mitigate it's
like I you can't stop it okay that's
like even if you have them on a server
if someone really wants to hack a big
will okay lemme know in this sense like
I just don't call that method I got the
whole source code I mean check for valid
signature I just just comment that line
out yeah you're a compile my apk and
yeah you're right you can you can
completely just delete that method and
and then you're done so the one way you
can kind of go around this is by using
code obfuscation and so I know it so I
don't work for Dex Carter proguard but i
know i said like proguard is programs is
is the easy way for you to do some codes
obfuscation but obviously people are
getting clever about it because programs
has been around for a few years right
now and people who really want to hack
applications they know how to get around
proguard decks guards is lightly more
tricky doable as well but X guard like I
I don't think I know how to hack an
application that's being decks guarded I
have hacks applications that have been
programmers and when I say a hot
just want to say that again when I say a
Hawks applications I didn't have to do
anything wrong usually what I do is when
I when I'm able to hack an application i
get in touch with the developers when i
say hey so I've been able to do that and
I found all this and and that's the end
of it or if they ask me questions I just
tell them but I don't do anything wrong
with with the application but you're
right it's if you have access to the
code and it's not obfuscator then every
single security measure you've taken
just goes out the window you said that
the best way is to get the key from the
server but before you mentioned as well
that if you had a key that you needed in
order to decrypt some stuff then you
could just encrypt that one but then you
have to have the key to decrypt the key
that you encrypted you have to get
something from a server man to be safe
me and you can either yeah you can
either get it from the so to say the
reason I say you can incorrect your
encryption key is because it makes it
slightly harder okay like I've seen
people going like 18 19 levels of
encryption of encryption of encryption
of encryption okay so it just makes it
slightly harder and usually what happens
with again depending on the kind of a
three-run usually what happens with
hackers don't really have too much
experience about hacking is they just
give up like obviously motivation is a
different thing okay if you really
motivated to get some more Pikachu's you
are going to go when you are going to
find out how many times you can decrease
that key until you get to the key or you
know the same with beer and I think they
kind of go hand in hand because cheers
and beers but you you are going to find
it like if you are motivated enough so i
say storing keys in the end okay I the
reason I keep on going about storing
keys on the NDK is many people are
scared of the end okay because it's a
pain to work with okay like many Android
developers i know many like really
experienced android developers I know
when I tell them about the NDK to go
like whoa I don't want to talk about
this so that's one good way okay but
i published an entire blog post saying
that you can do that and it kind of i'm
kind of going against myself because I'm
telling you how to do it which means if
I tell you how to do is hackers can read
it as well and they can find out how I
did it but it's just that it will stop
sort of like low medium level pockets
like high-level hackers they don't go
past it really really great any more
questions every anyone writing for BFA
