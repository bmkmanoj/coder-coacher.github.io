me tonight my name is Maddie and I work
as a software engineer for violin many
of you mayne heared about voting before
that UI framework for building amazing
application using Java only this is a
framework that we used to know but today
I'm more interested to talk about
something new the Varden elements a set
of web components to port our amazing UI
component into something new to build
modern web application using our web
components but talking about web
components how many of you have here
before about web components interesting
i would say fifty percent so i will go
quickly over a quick introduction about
what is web component with components in
an effort to port some of
object-oriented concepts like
interoperability and encapsulation into
the web the HTML codes that you are
writing in a way to hide your code from
the front-facing application this
standard is becoming viral a lot of
browsers starting to support it
unfortunately internet explorer does not
and will not support it but Microsoft
promised that their browser edge will
support it soon other browsers supported
partially but of course chrome supported
fully the consists of four main concepts
template custom element or custom
element HTML imports and shadow Dom
basically the template is what you write
to define how your component will look
like and then you insert local dome in
this element which will be called little
shadow DOM and you name your element you
give it a name this is what we call the
custom component when you want to insert
your web component inside an HTML page
you need to use the HTML imports to
explain this a bit further let's take a
look at the simple tag video it's a very
known html5 tag if you never hit about
it please go ahead open facebook and
open any video player on chrome
the tags that or the videos that you
hell is that in front of you is actually
a video tag this video tag if you go to
the browser inspector and take a look
inside it you'll figure out that it's
not a simple HTML tag it contains a set
of inert tags inside it so browsers have
been supporting those shadow Dom
elements since a lot of time and it's
now time to port this standard into your
web application and make developers
being able to create their own shadow
DOM and create your own custom markup
tag so this is all about web components
creating your own custom tag inside your
web application Google decided to take
this even further they came up with the
idea of polymer project they came up
with the idea of polymer project so
polymer project is a way to let all the
browsers support web components using
polyfills but this is not everything
they also came up with a set of elements
called polymer elements you can find
them on their website there are
basically a good infrastructure to start
building a modern application possibly
most of you here before about paper
elements or most probably all of you
used them before when you hit a Google
related product those are actually a
polymer element created with the paper
elements those elements were created
thinking about mobile first strategy how
this is done basically when the design
and develop their elements they think
about touch or handheld devices first
and then later on when everything is
tested developed and fully functional
they start to port it to desktop and
here comes to my mind the idea of how
you can increase the user experience of
your application while building an
application using the set of elements
the rule of thumb imagines that your
user go to a famous Cafe like starbucks
cafe for example and buy a cafe and when
he walks out of the cafe holding the cup
in one hand he decided to use your app
from the other hand the question is when
you user be able to use your app with
only one lump or the cafe will drop on
the cafe on the on the ground so put
this strategy on your head think about
it when you are building your
application to see how you can maximize
the usability of your application and if
really all your users will find your
application handy and usable in all
occasions I'm going to put a more
interest today about one of the elements
which called the Platinum element but
why they are very interesting for me
because they poured one of the important
functionalities that you can find in any
mobile device like Bluetooth managing
messaging push and so on and one more
thing the caching actually if you use
the Platinum SW cash element you can
have part or all of your web application
cache in the browser out of the box it's
as simple as that you use the Platinum
SW register and add auto register with
only three line of HTML code and all
your web application is cached but
probably caching is not the only
solution you might want to have your
application fully functional with having
a database loaded in the browser so if
you use if your user lose signal or have
a weak signal you can boost the
experience of your application by having
an in-browser database there are a lot
of vendors that started to implement
this strategy they provide you with easy
solution to use and in browser database
one of them is love filled by Google
it's fully written in JavaScript that
provide a new browser and HTML and
flourish rational database in your
browser
so taking a quick look and how for
example in Love Field I can select an
element from a table cool item very
simple code fuel line of JavaScript code
and I am done it sound easy but there
are few problems the problem is this
strategy for left field is one
directional you can have your data from
the server saved in the browser but what
if the user modify the data how to sync
it back this is actually a problem in
Love Field and possibly they will not
support it in anytime soon that's why
there are other solutions that provides
this out of the box as I mentioned
before like firebase so far this is the
commercial solution you can host your
database in their cloud and get things
out of the box one more interesting
solution which is powe chibi it provides
you with it's an open source solution
that provides you this service if and
only if you have a server implementing
the couchdb protocol by apache so all
you need is a database on the server and
pouch DB whenever you are online will
continuously replicate your data back
and forth from your client site to
server side once your you go offline and
your application goes offline you lose
the connection CouchDB will manage that
your application actually read and write
inside your local browser when you get
your internet back everything will be
replicated back to the server so this is
one of the power of pouch DB if you are
interested to read more about this and
learn more about how to work offline
with power to be please hit on this link
it has a nice blog post about examples
and details about this but let's go back
to violin elements and how we are
implementing new polymer based elements
that support offline and works on on
browser offline or online button
elements are basically
on a polymer infrastructure they support
the material design concept and we know
a lot of big companies they started to
use our elements right now even though
they are still in beta like the Varden
grid the Varden grid element is not just
a table data grid element but it is
support a lot of features like having a
freezed column freeze dro customized
header customized footer and so on we
are continuously adding a lot of
features to vote in grid and to get
started with this very simple markup in
your HTML you just divine a wedding grid
and give it columns like this and then
from your JavaScript code you can inject
the items using a JSON object or
actually you can inject it using a data
store so giving it a function that clued
the data and you are all done the result
of this simple application will look
like this but with few more line of
codes you can get this enhances
application with custom enhanced grid
with custom rendering custom progress
bar multi select column reordering
sorting and so on we also have a chart
elements they are based on high short
that's why they are not free to use
commercially but you can plot pretty
much any kind of data with the chart
format and much more actually our
elements as i said earlier are based on
polymers that's why they adopt the
material design and they work pretty
much offline as as well as online and
inviting you to check out this demo by
my colleague chemo it has a nice fitness
tracker application that shows how you
can use our violent elements and how can
you build an application with polymer
side by side by violent elements please
hit you QR code on this or open this URL
to check the demo
if not I can also open the demo here and
check it out for you so this is a demo
the URL is demo dividing the cam /
fitness tracker I'm going to reload it a
very simple application with a set of
polymer components a nice animation list
and maybe I can navigate to a previous
week next week one more important thing
that it comes out of the box with
responsive design so here for example
the list is responsive whenever you
resize your browser those kind of
boosted user experience you get out of
the box when you use our elements when
you click on here for example you get to
see our vladan grid so we have here a
fixed column so you can scroll over
horizontally and vertically as well and
here i have the detailed column so
inside the grid you can actually have a
custom render detail whenever you click
on an element so I still have all the
elements here but i have here under this
row i have details like the map it's a
map element as well and the chart
element and let's take this for a
interesting test so i'm going to go
offline unplug my cable here and i'm
already offline on Wi-Fi and let's
reload this application and see how it
looked like so it works everything still
loaded all the data is still available
and if i click here i still can they
seize a great component scroll over my
data and everything hun percent work
offline and still our
short element works and load the data
yep so a lot of futures are coming up
and we are continuously enhancing our
elements if you would like to have more
questions about this or would like to
know more about how we implemented this
please visit us on boost number 20 right
on the left side once you enter from the
exhibition area right behind Oracle you
will find us you'll find me if you have
any questions please come visit us and
if you have time come and build a
budding grid-based component and if you
manage to get it working you will get
one of volunteer shirts thank you for
listening and have a great conference</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
