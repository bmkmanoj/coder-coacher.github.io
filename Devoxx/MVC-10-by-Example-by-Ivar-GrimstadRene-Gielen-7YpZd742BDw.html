for this talk no sorry it wasn't
supposed to be the first phylum for this
talk about Java specification request
371 better known as MVC 10 which is
going to be in Java e8 the upcoming new
and abroad standard so this nice guy
besides me with the presenter node not
working remote this is Eva Grimm set if
you're looking for top person to present
this about this topic it will be in the
top ranks of the list because not only
is the principal consultant for Cybercom
in Sweden he is on not less than three
expert groups in the Java 8 space and
most notably on 371 sure something is
not ok there you should you're sorry ok
bye farewell and if you're so maybe if
you're looking for the worst person to
talk about this specification then Renee
is probably in the top rank he's an
individual consultant and trainer and
amongst others he works for training for
spring framework and sometimes for jsf
and but no most notably he's the project
here for the apache struts project
anyone not knowing apache struts just
look for elderly looking person sitting
right next to you might be able to
explain it what it means so but if it
can do anything I can help you to give
some historical context about what these
days are is about so basically we had
nothing by the time and then came
servlet specification and we had some
problems to solve for tech as our
problems with an technical specification
there because the surf specification
helped us to deal with the protocol HTTP
but it led to
early technical code and it was hard to
get into the business domain so some
people thought it would be a good idea
to start building front controller
framework based on the third
specification and to have a very imp in
Y inated view how to get into the
model-view-controller space afterwards
this guy were these folks were known as
the group that later created struts one
which is luckily now retired and they
invented the front control of framework
which then had the idea of having MVC
behind it and they called their
opinionated view to these controllers
that you would write actions since then
this term came something that everyone's
keep kept using it's called action based
web frameworks and they come a lot
trying to do things a little bit better
than drugs one of course but they have
in common the basic architecture of the
work and they are really built along
request and response so this is the
really most important thing that you
would like to address with this but then
they came some people up and say okay we
have some serious business needs and we
have serious business applications and
we want to go into the browser and do
stuff and actually they thought like
okay we need the better tool to address
this and they've learned from the
desktop space that component-based
working composed based architecture
having stateful components and then
having events to be consumed and to be
thrown it's a nice way to work with this
this problem domain so this mark the
rise of frameworks like jsf which was
addressed in java java ee and basically
it helps you to get really really fast
in a business domain so if you look like
something
someone might have had a problem like
this having some data table or stuff
like that you're really fast to get this
done in jsf but people thought that
action based framework would be over
then and nobody would longer care about
this but this actually didn't happen
various reasons were there one of which
is this handsome guy co-inventor droid
he feeling co-invented the HTTP protocol
and he coined the term rest which is an
architectural style and if you look for
framework that supports you to write
restful applications in the web space
you're pretty well off choosing an
action based framework so actually this
helped to keep us alive I'm not dead yet
so um actually it boils down to
component based frameworks try to help
you with complex stateful components an
abstract way the request response model
while action based frameworks try to
hide away some of the technical details
help you to go quite easily into the
business domain and on the other hand
keep things stateless and really embrace
the request responsible so it boils down
to you should have the right to for the
problem at hand so if you are going to
write a serious business application jsf
is great for you on the other hand if
you write a block a block application
and do want full control over your eltz
and stuff and SEO and whatnot it would
be a nice choice to look after an action
based framework so I think we should
give you an introduction Eva will give
you an introduction who is the best one
to do so about how it it works jsr 371
and I will try to give it a test drive
later yes
so in this section we'll explore a
little bit more of the details of the
embassy one of those specification or
jsr 371 which is called and and the
first question is why why do we create
an action based framework for Java EE
and why do we do it now right we if
we've been fine so far with what we got
why do we really need it now and the
question but the answer to that question
is that the community really wants
embassy and this study was done prior to
java ee 8 and more than sixty percent
answered yes in the community study for
java ee eight that they wanted embassy
and there was apparently no favorite out
there either so more than fifty percent
answer actually not sure when they were
asked where should we look for
inspiration so it's not like we could
just take like struts or spring embassy
and just do this same thing in in July
II it was right really no favorite out
there and another view of this community
story is that is that embassy is
actually one of the Most Wanted features
of Java EE you can see it's nearly eight
percent the ones that's in Java it so it
is it's a warner feature by the
community so this answers more than the
question why and as we said it is an
action-based embassy it's not a
replacement of jsf jsf its component
based and jsf is going to live live on
and Emma C will be action based and live
beside jsf so it will be a compliment
not a replacement another objective of
MSE is that it shall leverage existing
Java EE technologies and use existing
technologies where possible and that
means that you need a Java
container to run it and that may be a
good thing or a bad thing but that is
one of the objectives of this
specification and for the model this
means that we will typically use
technologists like cdip in validation in
jp-a and for the view you could use
facelets J space and more and the
controller is something new and there it
should it be as some new technology or
shall be built up on something existing
the expert work for jazz are 371 it's a
pretty diverse it's it represents from
many of the very large players in their
business and they're also a couple of
individuals remembers me included so if
we look at the key decisions we've done
in this expert or maybe I should say key
decision there was a long discussion I
think was about a year ago should we
build on Jack's Torres or servlets what
should be the underlying technology of
embassy and after a long discussion and
actually we had a vote in the exit we
landed on Jack Suarez and personally I
think that is a very good choice and
I'll show you that later when we should
have some code examples so yeah it gets
you're probably tired of slides now I'll
bear with me there will be some more
slides but at least we'll look at some
code in the slides so first the
controller you start up with just a
basic pojo in this case the hello
controller then I add a path amidation
and those of you familiar with jax-rs
sees that this is exactly the same as
you would do for Ajax resource and this
is one of the advantages of building of
topperjack's vs it's already there and
we can use it we don't have to do
anything near this familiar juice and
then we introduce the app controller
orientation
and in this example it's on class level
and that means that all the methods in
this class are controller methods I can
also put the ad control orientation on a
method and have a controller method that
means I can mix both jax-rs resources
and controllers for embassy in the same
class if I want to and that is totally
up to you as a developer whether it's a
good thing or a bad thing but is it's
the flexibility that ejector us gives us
so that's basically what the race to the
controllers so what do you think it
looking good so far looks a little bit
easier than straws one I would say yeah
yeah it looks here yeah so let's look at
some views if we have the the controller
that we created in la steps and we add a
simple method which we annotate with at
get and that is also from jax-rs so here
is another place where we can actually
use the same technology has jax-rs
underneath and we just return this ring
hello JSP and that's a little weird
injects RS but here actually the
controller kicks in and this will look
for a page called hello JSP which is
located under webbing views this is
configurable so we can put it wherever
you want but this is a default and the
currently the this is a JSP example but
currently the reference implementation
supports jsps facelets timely free
market or mustache velocity ask a doc
and I guess a lot more they're coming
all the time it's very pluggable to
create your own gear engine another way
of showing which you are going to read
actually do is to create an instance of
viewable and then the view will
encapsulate the view and how it should
be processed so you have a little bit
more control over with you can also go a
little more low level and use the
response return type from jax torres
so this is very similar to how you do
within a JAX rest resource where the
entity is the view or you can use the
new Act view annotation and and and this
is new for this specification and if you
have a void return type then you need to
have the advil imitation on it you can
also put the app view annotation on the
class level and then all methods in this
controller will will redirect to the
same view that concludes the controller
and the view select look at the model we
have the controller we had in the last
slide and we create a CDI manage beam
which in this case is request scoped and
it just has a magic message and a getter
on etc then in the controller we can
inject this greeting CDI beam and just
set the message on it and return to the
view and interview we can access is with
the expression language to get the
greeting of message in this case is a
JSP example it will be pretty similar in
the other market book languages another
way is if your view engine doesn't
support CDI it is recommended but
optional to support CDI then we provided
a models object and the models is more
or less just a map so you put your
attributes to it and and the reason why
it's called models is that the roller it
is a model object in model interface in
jsf and we don't want it conflicts with
that one in this case you just access it
from the map like this
it was pretty simple and straightforward
so let's look at the view engines and we
kind of created a new acronym is bring
your own view engine it's very pluggable
and and it's a sink sink blew into place
to implement and you can use Syria
discovery or a CDI producer for an
engine specific configurable and you can
override it if you want there and the
interface is like this implement a
method supports but says that this view
engine supports this view and the that
can be as simple as just check the file
extension if it ends on JSP and then you
have the process view which you can use
the view engine context to render the
view and if you have conflicts in view
engines you have several view engines
that can can handle the same view then
you can give it a priority so you can
choose which the engine is going to be
valid for your application Jack's arrest
comes with bean validation so let's look
at an example if you have a controller
here that just it has a post method and
it takes in a bean permit to form a form
and you have some bean validation
methods the at valid that will throw
away constraint relation exception if
the the contract isn't filled for
example they at main or not not all
whatever being relation you have put on
to be and in Jack's arrest you would
probably have a formulation mapper that
implements your exception mapper for a
constant validation exception
and adjust processes and return to some
error page but what is the problem with
this right for jax-rs application this
is perfectly fine but in a controller
you want a little bit more fine-grained
control because you don't necessarily
want to redirect the same error jets by
error page for every controller because
this will be all for your application so
the one size does not fit all here
that's why we added support that we call
for binding results so you inject a
binding results in your controller and
then you can access the check if it's
failed and you can access that the
binder vining results or the validation
nervous and this some specific odor out
of it that means your controller code
actually has to guard for errors so we
have very fine gain control of what you
want to do and how you want to get there
since embassy leverages CDI then all CDI
scopes are available and all controllers
are in by default in route west scope
and that is what Jack stress is about
but all serious cops are available like
the application session request and
conversation scope and in addition to
this we define another scope called
redirect scope which supports the post
rhetoric get pattern which an example
here so if you have the greeting beam
that we looked at earlier only now it's
redirect scope and not with less code
that's the only difference then in my
controller i injected as usual you
sincerely are so not have that the
controller is still with dress code but
the beam is redirect scoped so that
means that when i post to this from
method
and I'm redirected to the two method I
come in here in the ed controller for
the two method and it's the same beam
and I can access the same message so
it's the content is kept for post
redirect get and that's what we're a
scope is about we've also added support
for security and most specifically for
cross-site request forgery and we have
an annotation buddy fault the the
protection is off so you as a developer
has to say that I want this to are known
and then you can set it as implicit or
explicit and if you set it as implicit
than all post methods in it all your
controllers are validated if it's
explicit then you need to put it at CSRF
valid annotation on the methods that you
want to have protection and the way you
do it is that in the form that you're
posting you can access the csr SF object
from the MSC context and set a name and
a token in a hidden field and and the
the framework will evaluate it
automatically
MSC reuse the existing CDI event system
and and that means that the applications
can listen for events using observers
and that can be used for monitoring
debugging tuning etc and the
specification defines an order for these
events and the events that we are
currently supporting or before control
event after a controller event before
process view diamond after process of
event and control the redirect event and
there may be more coming these are the
ones are supported currently an example
for how you observe these events or that
you've simply on before a controller for
example observes the before controller
event and you do something so to sum up
the jsr 371 section of this presentation
is that if you want to learn more about
this yes or you go into the project page
on java.net you can follow the mailing
list and the users at embassy spec
java.net and you can look at the
reference implementation where you can
have code samples and and how we can
download it and start playing around
with it and the reference reference
implication is called ozark and also all
the code for MSC and the API on and
specification is available in get up you
can just google it up there and read
about it and the final version is
scheduled to be part of Java EE eight
that means it's planned for the first
part of 2017 but it's probably ready
before that and it can already used now
as integrated in the nightly builds of
glassfish and I think also pyara
supports is now so you can actually
start using MSC now so with that
left Renee test drive some of this thank
you go sorry well what he said sounds
very nice um and it makes always looks
good on slides right so you find a lot
of examples already for all this stuff
that even talked about but actually what
we want to see and I have had my fair
share in creating web frameworks so I
have a little bit of experience with
people want what they expect from the
frameworks and I was like okay let me do
a little bit of a test drive and compare
it a little bit to other frameworks and
ask the most important session is it
real world so can you use it in the real
world already when it comes out will it
be usable so of course you want to see
common problems address you will you
will look for solutions such a framework
will provide you with and is it on par
with you know the competitors so there
are quite a few thriller based web
frameworks notably about basically to
our left that are actively devolved
developed which is spring MVC I think
most people know it here in the room who
knows it experience okay fine and I have
to champion it stress too not quite a
few okay fine we're still a good
adoption i would say so actually when i
want to to look at a framework I look at
my experience and i would say spring MVC
arrived around 2005 and for me it got
ready for production around two thousand
eight when spring 2.5 came out and the
same goes for struts to which formerly
was called web ferguson it has nothing
to do with trust one anymore it's just
rebranded this started in 2004 but i
wouldn't have used it i did this was my
fault i got
dragged into fixing it I wouldn't have
used it if I had a choice in 2007 so
basically this point balls down to our
three years for both framework still
getting real so may I post the question
should we all wait three years before
are giving a test drive we're giving a
try to MVC wondered oh but I think we
don't need to be that pessimistic
because the approach the expert group
took was are quite cool i would say
because they said let's not reinvent the
wheel and let's look what we already
have and there is a lot of good stuff in
the java ee space which is you have
jax-rs that is an established for name
framework a CD is really really powerful
and been there for a long time now you
have been validation interceptors and
various view technologies that are
already established so it is not that we
really expect MVC to be something that
is doing quite a lot of stuff it's just
the top layer above these technologies
and helps you to deal with certain
problems so another thing to note is as
you've already said a lot of extension
points in MVC 10 so what isn't there the
first release of the specification might
be easily extended but we will try to
give it a test drive so I talked about
common problems so what are these one
thing is clear to print up simple hello
world and show how nice these pojo
controllers are it's not enough so we
have to do a little bit of a real-world
scenario and of course it has to do
something with corrupt create read
update delete and we will look into it
and we will
try to understand what things we have to
look after so these are just a few arm
you couldn't extend the list that you
want to get help with you want to have
support for dependency injection we have
various needs to support Ajax and
passing validation messages to the view
so how is it done in are these
frameworks we look at and especially in
Jane's are 371 so for the basics just a
little bit of a comparison and giving a
dimension to it all the frameworks we
look at our support dependency injection
as a first class citizen which is really
really important these days and struts
is a little bit like just throw
dependency injector at me I will work
with it most notably when you look at
spring MVC and at jsr 371 you will
notice that you have to make a decision
so if you're coming from the spring
space you have to switch over to CDI but
this is not a bad thing and
unfortunately spring and don't think so
they will they will switch to see the
eye and in your future so basically you
get another kind of dependency injection
if you come from another framework but
that's not too bad and all the nice
stuff you would expect from dependency
injectors you will get even in j's are
37 1 which is also the scoped beans and
one of the most important scope that
people don't realize that is that it is
such important Eva talked about the post
redirect get petrol is which is
something you should always apply to
your stuff and how do I get some
information from the first request to
the second request because the state is
gone so having support for something
like redirect scope or others call it
flash go with something very important
to solve your everyday needs and
actually you have all this in the
frameworks or
talk about something controller
technical decoupling of controllers all
three frameworks nowadays are poacher
based no no more technical are coupling
to some parent classes you have within
some technical framework you can are
really leaf httpservletrequest so that
response alone you don't have to code
against them but you can if you like so
this is important as well to full
control over what you are doing and of
course all three frameworks try to
address how to deal with the model and
how to transport model values to view so
they slightly differ and how they do it
but they have good solutions for it one
thing that a tightly coupled to this is
how testable is such frame any wanted
anyone tried to do tests with servlets
or struts one actions was it nice not
for me i would say so nowadays you have
pojos as your controllers and it is
really easy to unit test them and of
course if you use dependency injection
it's the same way you would test any
dependency injection injected beam when
due to not being technically coupled
it's very easy to mock things out in
your tests as for integration tests or
maybe in acceptance tests the older
frameworks like spring MVC and experts
to do have some supporting live recent
and stuff they can help you with this
topic but well we said MVC's not
inventing everything by itself so
interestingly you can use some test
tools that we're already written for
Jersey to help you do integration or
acceptance testing and maybe we will see
more frameworks coming out so not the
interesting part is that
no one wants to be limited to one view
technology JCP is a little bit like okay
who people keep hoping it's dying think
we will see it in many years but anyway
we want to support many view
technologies and all these three works
do there are view technologies where
they are better in supporting and others
with this basic support I would say so
if you choose spring MVC the natural
most natural fit is to go for JSP forth
imma leave but these are really good
view technologies for what you can
achieve them and basically trays are 371
that's the same every views plugin plug
pluggable what I find interesting is
that they added support for facelets and
I will go deeper into it because you are
can some to do some interesting things
with it so enough talk enough slides so
let's look little bit into code and I
try to destroy the MVC but let's see how
it would it out I've been a small
example with the help of evar that tries
to arm do show some typical craft
situation it is about actors which is
and has nothing to do with type save or
something so we are in the cinema and
Renee I think you should mirror your
screen so we can see oh that's a good
idea to do so I mean thank you intellij
is an excellent editor but I don't think
it I think any tell each a 16 they will
be armed they will be trying to our
address out of a ring when you switch
from presentation but you will go from
that means would you I would go for
nothing's every day ah not me okay so um
what I try to do is to take all the
three frameworks and give them a little
test how how such in
thing would look like so basically we
want to show list are slack here and we
want to add some new to it if we like
and of course we want to edit the
existing ones and we have different
types of information that we show there
so what do we want as well so if I am
NOT an english-speaking person I might
have browser setting let's say German
which is my mother tongue and then let's
see what happens every load so one thing
to expect from such a framework is that
it gives you internationalization
options i 18 n and basically if you look
at this amount here which is how many
you would expect them to get by film or
something like that by movie when i put
in a floating value we in germany would
do it with a comma and if you save it ah
the back end understands it and says
okay he's a German lokale so he put in a
coma and if i switch back to the English
Lee ok then I would see that most
probably i would be better off just to
reload most probably i would be better
off using a point and there it is yeah
and if i change the value then certainly
works though these these are the problem
domains you want to have addressed so
let's see we have said we have some bean
validation support we want to have it
let's look into the actual code and we
have added some been validation
annotations inside it and we want to be
able to use it without any
other fuss so let's see if we make mr.
Daniel Craig a little bit shorter for
the first name how it works out and
basically you see that you will get some
error messages validation messages and
would be nice if these messages were
next to the place where I've made the
error so this is something that is is
nice if you are developing such an
application okay and one thing to notice
just in case you didn't realize that we
always used direct role was great wasn't
it and every single safe that we perform
here is actually a post redirect get so
you will notice this if you do just a
simple reload there is no posts no no
question that form submission has to be
done again because we really redirect to
the actual view that shows the actor
that we are looking at so ah no it
wasn't wrong but it will be it will get
very angry at me so basically how it is
done so when we compare the three
frameworks we see that all three
frameworks nowadays are really really
short in what you have to do in the
controller code so these this the struts
to action this is the spring controller
and there's really no much technical
code no not much coded or a little bit
of configuration and stuff like that and
really the controller in jsr 371 is
comparable quite comparable to what you
would use and spring MVC and nothing to
look for really it's very easy to go in
the controller space so next question is
how to interpret what what what we would
like to see in the views and the three
frameworks have different concepts of
how they want to deal with the views
drugs is a little bit like we we give
you one stop shop one one one stop
solution for this and we take a little
bit of care of everything it's a little
bit of like jsf so you get high-quality
components of it if you don't want to
fill with the HTML stuff and all the
internationalization stuff you have seen
is solved by the framework spring
actually are this thing's a little bit
differently and says okay we have just a
little bit tiny tiny layer of things
that we want to provide from the back
end from the server side to the front
and that is of course dealing with these
validation messages but in the end
you're totally free to do what you like
so it's up to the View technology to
help you with some things like iterating
over stuff in that and it can get quite
noisy if you if you use a sigh meleave
template but in the end it's quite easy
to work with it and it's quite easy to
throw it at your designer so that he can
eight a he or she can can work with it
and have really good example of you two
are to deal with what is interesting
about the MVC spec is it shares the
concept of being quite flexible on the
one hand but it has also the possibility
that you can use higher level components
and are not talking about polymer or the
other up coming up from web parts things
that will be nice for all these stuff as
well this is you can use if you switch
to one of the most supported
technologies view technologies you
switch to facelets you can reuse
components from the JSF word which is
quite strange to us was quite strange to
me to realize but actually you can do
nice stuff with it and you can work with
frameworks like icefaces prime phrases
how they caught everything
name it's okay i'm not sure everything
will work out nicely but in the end it's
quite easy to work and you see depending
on what view technology you have used
things are quite easy to binding part
for example binding to the back and
beans is quite easy in the view
technology of choice so let's look a
little bit deeper into the fields that I
said are nice if they are somehow solved
one of which is internationalization
both spring MVC and MVC 10 say okay if
you want internationalized messages just
leave it to the view engine which is for
spring MVC you get a little bit of pork
butt spring and there's a little bit of
binding goodness in Lima leaf because
I'm belief is a special module to
support spring MVC it remains to be seen
if there will be a special module to
support the MVC one of those back which
shouldn't be too hard to see this
extension in future on the other hand
when we look at these us know we look at
this everything you want we can you know
from jsf and the face let's face about
internationalization will work here so
you can just go and do it as you would
do it normally and some facelets or in
the view technology of choice and you
have this solution around what about
localization localization I mean when
you bind form values to the target type
you will want to have it formatted
depending on your locale
we showed earlier here turns out that
this is something that the MVC spec
doesn't address so if we look at the
actual beam that we are using as a form
being here or domain being here the
actor beam we do have something of type
float here but actually this is quite a
simple model so far that says okay there
is something that I can take as string
and convert into the the target type but
you will not have out of the box mb c 1
dot 0 the support to let's say apply a
number for it but one of the nice things
is you can use it because you can extend
the framework the framework has extended
points to do so we will later on show
you something that we've hacked or
especially Eva hacked a few minutes ago
to support very interesting use case so
one thing to note about binding values
is there's a little bit of a return of
the form beam we see in MVC
specification most people having worked
with the modern frameworks in regards to
struts one will know the concept of
using the entity beans maybe for direct
form binding in the web space so not
having some special value objects to do
to get the value out of the form and
then converting it to the entity values
it's just like just bind to the entities
you can do this with MVC as well it was
solved by Jersey so um when you when you
run the example you will see that's
quite as easy that here the integer
values get get bound but
you will have to use something from
Jersey to tell it that you want a
binding here so you basically have to
use the jersey annotation which is form
parem that will tell Jersey ok I want to
bind this attribute to the following
following part of the form you get in
this is a little bit that people might
not want to see because as such the
jersey annotation bleeped into the
domain objects but the good thing is
it's just annotations so it's not that
you have to extend any class or
interface or stuff like that that comes
from Jersey it's just an annotation so
everyone else will not take care of it
it's just a binding you will get as a
jar afterwards okay what's interesting
besides that so the NBC specification
does support finding in a way that you
would like to see so you just say I want
to work with something of some property
called first name and then if I do get
on the form I want to see this in the
input field and if I do a safe of the
form i want to to have it in the form
being lighter so this is addressed as
you've already said we have the concept
of being parameters which allow for easy
binding and if you have at one more
annotation you will kick have the bean
validation kick in so it's quite easy to
do some of the common problems and
address them what is not addressed is
how to deal with
errors getting them to the front and
maybe separating it to our to various
feel addressed fields but anyway this is
a nice example on how good it is to UM
to extend this is a quite crude
extension which were used for the new
pattern of new creation of the of an
actor and it basically says okay we take
the binding results that we have
injected go through it and at the error
messages to the model so that we can
look at them in the resulting view and
if you go there and see what we have
done just save this one it's a very easy
extension we haven't right too much time
out of it to to work on it very easy
extension that you can transport such
messages to the view so this problem is
addressed what's not address currently I
would say is binding this a little bit
more to to the actual fields but this is
something you can easily do are even
when the specification is released so
one particular thing I stumbled about
was it is quite interesting that you
have both ways catching form parameters
and applying it to form beans and of
course getting your form bean out of
your services domain here and and doing
something to do to view it in the actual
HTML interestingly for the reit part of
the binding you will always have a
prefix which is the model object that
the name of the model object that you
will put as a named beam if using our CD
is cooked beans or if you use a key to
attach it to the models object which I
choose here for this example actually
when you are catching the values from
form arm they will assume that there is
no prefix so you do our fault for Reed
binding you have a vector dot last name
and for right bear bonnie has if last
name so currently in the current set of
the specification you will have to write
this twice so you see here this is
rebinding which is accurate at first
there because we have a model object
called actor but when we want to post
the form we want to display the values
as first name only no actor dot will be
nice to see if in the final
specification things like this will be
addressed one particular thing I really
like about the first part of the state
of the very first specification is that
some problems you really have in reality
are addressed that are not such kind of
common knowledge the SI sirve protection
which is quite hard to understand why it
is a security problem a SI sirve
protection something you would like to
have for really productive arm
applications some people don't know the
same technology that helps you enhancing
your security will help you to avoid
double posts so basically it serves to
two needs and you can use it right away
with the first specification that is you
simply if you go to the new use case you
simply put this SI sirve Tok
into your view and once you have it
there you can only hit save once for the
second time you won't be able to create
a new actor based on this one this is
something where many people have lost
many a lot of time solving this problem
for for each of the projects they made
and having it from day one is quite nice
these examples you can explore more on
our github page and maybe you want to
look a little bit more into it which is
action framework comparison this URL and
basically what i would like to say as
someone who has some some experience in
how these web frameworks work and how
how it is to create such a web framework
i would say they've done a pretty good
job this is wrong kind of marine yeah
here they've done a really good job with
what they've done so funny had really
really really good decision made jumping
on the bandwagon of using jersey and
having so much things solved already so
it's really lightweight easy to extend
and the comm needs a quite good
addressed so um i would say it is a
really good first shot and there are
some glitches left which can be
addressed by the people using it and i
think we will see some things before the
final draft will be pleased yeah so what
r NS s error is there are some glitches
there are some things that are missing
and
as any specification we are totally
dependent on the people doing work the
community building application using
this framework to contribute and you can
contribute by by subscribing to the
mailing lists by reading the gyro issues
by contacting the experts by joining the
expert group the JCP is totally open for
everybody to join and and we're really
dependent on on getting input so we get
it right and I'm as Rena said this is
version 1 at 0 and I'm sure there would
be later versions of the specification
as well but the better we can get it at
the first shot the better it is so we
are really depending on on input from
the community and maybe you could also
champion for this specification to get
more implementations or try it yourself
by the way or even take someone from the
apache struts project to maybe make an
implementation of it to have more
implementations than just those are ya
okay any questions just one back there
yes
so I repeat the question for you spring
is the concept of session attributes and
sessions scope beans due to store things
between requests what's the take of MVC
yeah that's a good question and of
course we support the session scoped we
support all see they are scoped so you
just have a session session cook scope
being that you set your at the written
it's available throughout the session so
it's just a regular session scoped see
the IBM you shouldn't use it you should
say stateless any more questions so not
so far if you like you can follow us on
twitter and ask more questions or just
come here swing by and ask you questions
will be here for couple few minutes
