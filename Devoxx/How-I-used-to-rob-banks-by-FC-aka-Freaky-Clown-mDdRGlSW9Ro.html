you very much thank you all for staying
beyond the reams of what you should be
should all be in the pub and I'm sure
you're just going to be sick of staring
at me over the next three hours left
restriction right so my name is FC and
this is a talk about how I rob banks for
a living so there are a couple of ground
rules if you've got questions leave it
to the end if we run out of time find me
on Twitter or send me an email and I'll
do a quick introduction because my
normal audience is security conferences
I go to let the death columns and the
black hats and the info sex etc and so
this is a bit new for me having
developers like staring up again what
this guy doing um so a little
introduction right so I'm the co-founder
of a security firm I'm also the head of
cyber research from Raytheon UK and I've
been doing cyber security for like 20
odd years this abit crap this you see
these intros with alright so we'll do a
really really short version of this
right so I am one of these I'm not one
of these I'm not one of these I'm not
one of these I'm an old school one of
these until these guys did this right
that got me lots of Fame and ID loads of
talking events now and now I work for
these people these people and these
people I often go to dress work a lot
work dress like this rather I often
casually dress like this but most of the
time I actually dress like this
anyway when I'm not doing this I love
doing this I love doing this I love
doing this which is really handy when
these people do this but so the record
do not break out of handcuffs and police
arrest you because they really hate it
anyway so this is a story about how I
rob banks it's going to be a little
diatribe of interesting stories of
things that have happened to me over the
over the years of doing this I've been
doing it for a very long time I've
broken into many many banks and I've
broken into many many buildings like
security firms military sites government
buildings as well as commercial spaces
so does anyone here work with the police
force
no anyways so what I'm going to show you
is um basically all illegal if you do
not have permission it is illegal to do
all of the things in this talk yeah and
there's some stuff that you cannot get
permission for and use very illegal um
so you're probably sitting there going
why how do I care Bank banks I'm a
developer for whatever company does
anyone actually work as a developer from
a bank oh shit okay right um I'm only
picking on banks because people think
they're really secure right because they
should be alright so there are two ways
to rob a bank you can do it digitally or
physically right now quick hand poll who
thinks that a bank is more secure
digitally than it is physically three
okay how many people think it's really
secure physically yeah okay I'm going to
blow your minds right so um banks tend
to spend billions on inadequate digital
security they also spend billions on
inadequate physical security you think
oh my god all my money is really safe in
these banks it's not right so what do
you need to rob a bank digitally you
need madly hacker skills right you need
knowledge of programming firewalls all
these like cool stuff that you know we
talk about all the time and security
conferences laughs yeah okay you're
getting a needle that I'll come back to
this and physically what do you need to
rob a bank well you just need a bit of
confidence a bit of preparation and
importantly permission is very important
here so we all agree that banks are
really secure physically right so if we
can prove that they're not secure
physically imagine how crap they are
digitally right so how do you prepare to
rob a bank well first of all you just go
on Google and you look at Street View
and you look at council planning
applications you look through everything
you can online now can anyone spot any
issues with this particular building
security is really tight I mean they're
so tight they're not even in the broom
you can just walk in and you can see
everything that's happening in there so
that's going to be a nice easy target
you walk around a bit and I had to wait
outside this bill chakra and it all
points up to seconds so can you see this
room here through this massive glass
window right I had to stand outside this
building for about 40 minutes whilst
they had a meeting projecting all of
their information up on this wall and
which I didn't want to take a picture of
so I had to wait for them to finish
their meetings that I didn't
accidentally take a photo of their
sensitive data that's sensible right and
if you walk around the back of some of
these buildings you'll find stuff like
this it's just rubbish right so what we
call dumpster diving in my industry and
you can see me in the reflection here
taking photos of people's rubbish if
someone is doing that around your
building asks what they're doing and
because what they'll do is they'll take
that well people like me will take it
because it's interesting
so we'll take all these shredding and
we'll take them back to our hotel and
because we're really boring we'll put
them back together I understand the
irony of the fact that I have had to
redact out information from something
has been related that you can't even
tell that it's actually important but
it's really important stuff on below I
promise you that and it's that's all
well and good so we've looked outside
the building who has a look around and
we go okay there's some really cool
stuff and how do we know what it looks
like inside like a key in where am I
going to go but if you walk into any
major office but who works in the big
building yeah so when you go back on
Monday and don't have a look and you'll
find one of these in the lobby yeah this
used by the fire brigade in case there's
any issues they know where everything is
right um you just go in take it off the
wolf or take your photo or whatever
nobody is going to arrest you for
stealing a map and nobody's going to
care because I'll be like where the the
someone stole a map from my office I'd
never get it right so now you've got
complete internal diagrams of everything
including our really sensitive areas
which is really handy and you also find
like interest
things like Ruth for you and how to get
into there so that maybe you can climb
in through the roof and I've had to do
that so you explore around a little bit
and you can find some really interesting
places and it gets a little bit Blair
witchy and most first of the the light
from this photo is actually from the
camera flash it was horrible and dark
and scary but you can look around I mean
it's it's not like you know banks are
gonna have all these like underground
tunnels and stuff and they're going to
leave a safe ah ah are they might they
might leave they might they may just
leave a safe there and you know one of
my hobbies just say fracking so oh well
like I said they're really yeah really
secure so anyway what I hear a lot when
I'm doing security testing and it's
always legal they come to me and they
say can you test our are building
security or our digital security and
I'll be like it's great and whatever
you're in place ah
we've got really sophisticated security
ok heavy alright great yeah you'll
you're the one that has the 50 case and
they're like yeah we're bristling
bristling with like CCTV cameras great
but the people that put it up at
Gideon's right so this Bank and has a
way in here through a little padlock
because padlocks are secure and a little
door which is fit so they've put up a
CCTV camera protecting this tree
it's a very valuable tree I'm sure
remember this green box for a bit later
so maybe I don't understand the value of
trees but people that install CCTV seem
to put it quite hard if you're putting
in CCTV it's got to be the right type of
CCTV and I've been in many many
buildings where the quality is poor or
it hasn't been set right or in this case
it's a head height and you can just
knock it off or unplug it or patch into
it and it's crazy what you see you also
see people having systems like this you
must have seen systems like this does it
anymore anyone want to take her you know
a real hackers mindset here it's going
to take see if you can guess what the
code is anyone maybe 1970 who knows but
it doesn't really matter because it's a
terrible system because you can just
unscrew it and then just bypass er
anyway
so I see this a lot yeah now remember
banks are physically secure so
everything's cool right I'm going to go
onto the subject now which is very
illegal unless you get lots of
permission from lots of people that
you'll they'll probably say no and it's
wiretapping yeah and I want to bring
this up because it's not something you
can do or you could do but you'll be
breaking the law and but I just want to
make you aware of it because it does
happen and if someone wants into your
building or into your networks they will
do this because criminals break the law
right I know shocking so these green
cabinets they're owned by BT and it's
under the Telecommunications Act etc as
is this little barely see it here on
this light lamppost and this box which
was open already by the way I didn't
open it and and inside these are
basically just wires that control the
telephone system and if you were to open
one of these boxes you'd see lots of
pairs of wires and these are like the
wire pairs of the phone system and all
you need is basically one of these right
now you can make one or you can just buy
one off of ebay now or if you're lucky
you can find a BT engineer to lend you
one but you basically open the cabinet
and you clip these I'll and then you're
onto the telephone system it's really
simple and the only thing that protects
them is a little wrench set which you
can just buy simple this is in fact so
simple during our outreach we actually
go out and teach kids how to do why
attack because it's fun right so these
go these young girls here they're 13 14
I think they're and with zero knowledge
it took them half an hour to learn how
to break into a cable that was monitored
physically yeah so you're not going to
have that in your your your work network
and so that if you broke any otherwise
it would set the alarm off they managed
to break in for the cable get a wiretap
on it intercept some data decrypt that
data and steal information from that
scenario half an hour it took four kids
to learn how to do this so you can
imagine a profession
wouldn't need nearly as long and so
going back to the security stuff um
sophisticated security method who has
one of these at their office how many
people think it would stop me from
getting in your building okay so there's
two well there's several problems of
this right so let's do a little quiz who
can tell me an issue with this one and I
want to shout it out you can scrape up
squeeze or walk through if it's you
could easily walk through that one right
so you could limbo but yeah you might so
just walk past it right and however you
could maybe move this elasticated
barrier thing that is it's protecting
this plan I've just realized this
valuable plug or you could just go up
these stairs which are not even anywhere
near the security and what about these
ones who's got these hunger these yeah
these are great these little RFID which
opens up and go through very spot right
right except Health and Safety has
screwed up security yet again because if
you put your hand in between them it's
not allowed to kill people oh no I might
chop their arm off and so we'll just
stay open so you just go hop to in oh
yeah they go you've walked through or
another great technique they use is that
getting really close to people so when
someone is going through it you should
get really really close like that the
more awkward you make it the less likely
they are to ask who the hell you are and
what you're doing
and some of some of the very closed in
man-trap type ones they got quite
awkward at some interesting folks and it
doesn't matter anyway because like I
said people do security wrong all the
time so for example they would just
leave them open so this one here is left
open and not only does this security
guard so okay so on the ball he was
chatting up the reception he noticed me
taking a photo of him failing to do his
job and then failed to notice me walk
through savegame security guards are
pretty terrible they are paying minimum
wage but real and or this one which was
left open and then I proceeded to watch
a bunch of people walk up to it and then
swipe their access card anyway as if it
was there it's like it's not going to
make any difference
idiots I'm all about magnetic locks has
everyone got these at their office yeah
they're protecting probably like the
most valuable areas like server rooms
etc except these are all put on the
wrong side of the bloody door right so I
can just unscrew that and then I mean or
unscrew that one and I mean or this one
doesn't even shut that's what the red
light means as well as its alarm which
is put on the outside so if I'm an
attacker I just need a screwdriver and
I'm into your best places my favorite
one though is this this door is alarmed
I think it should be because this has so
many fails on this on this door it's
unbelievable right so you can see this
is from the outside because if you look
at the reflection you can see the
outside world right so this is where
we're coming in and we've got this glass
door because criminals can't break glass
and they've mounted the mag lock on the
wrong side of the door so I could just
undo that right but the double doors got
an alarm on it so how am I going to
bypass that well the alarm thing is on
here with the key in it so I can just
turn off the alarm unscrew the mag lock
come walk through the door it generally
blows my mind how that even got past
anyone that's crazy but maybe maybe
they're doing it right maybe your
company is doing
think correctly right so I've had to
steal this image from the internet
because that's the only places ever
actually happens so basically I had a
job once where I had to go into a secure
site and they had the guards and like
impr cameras and stuff and if you rocked
up and you were not expected you would
just shoot away all right so there's no
way you're gonna get in ha ha like how
am I gonna get in here and the great
thing is with company they had a
park-and-ride system now who's got a
park-and-ride at their place no I'm
gonna be asleep quite big enough okay
and so the great thing is if you follow
people home from work you'll find out
where their parking right is you drive
into the park and ride you get on the
park-and-ride bus and nobody asks who
you are because who the hell is getting
on the park or right at 8:30 in the
morning if it's not an employee you get
into the bus like this one and which
will happen thick fur and then you write
that in and then they're expecting the
bus so they let it through the gates
nobody's checked Who I am and so you
just get in and just like wander around
the building in the site and then you go
in do not some interesting stuff which
I'll talk about in a second um and this
look comes down to security guards are
terrible right so this guy here he has
lost his job right now this is the sad
part of my job is you have to be a
little bit psychopathic in the fact that
yeah stuff you're going to do is
highlighting bad stuff that people do
and they're going to lose a job but bear
with me this guy is protecting your
money right that's how you have to look
at it and he should have been doing his
job instead if you can see I'm standing
behind his desk now this is what's known
as a dark site and a dark site means it
is basically very few people there is in
fact only two security guards him and
another guy across the building I
convinced them to let me in to this site
because nobody ever visits eat sites and
he's in there diligently watching the
security camera not me because I'm
supposed to be there um this guy however
is watching very diligently for the
sandwich
and to turn up I kid you not so when the
sandwich fan turns up he puts on his
coat he says you gonna be alright here
mate yeah fine he walks out past these
metal like guarded barriers to a
sandwich bound to which I'm like fuck
you I'm off around your sight the
opposition have done that and he also
left his keys so I could get to all of
the other key for the site and there I
am he's locked out of his own building
I'm inside with all the money but I've
learned in commercial ones as well and
then we like to I get quite bored after
a couple of hours running around your
building I'll get a little bit bored all
right I need to teach some people some
lesson who walks away from their
computer and doesn't lock their screen
hands up go on go right right if you do
that and I'm walking around your
building I will I will take everything I
will take everything off of your desk as
well if you've left it with stuff on it
who leaves their keys and their wallets
and stuff because they trust everyone
around them Yeah right what will happen
is you'll come back for your desk and
it'll be clear some magical Pixies will
have cleared it up for you and they're
taking your car keys and they'll have
put it all in your car boo which people
get a little bit annoyed at but I think
it proves a point and I'll take
everything like everything I can
sometimes I'll be asked to like get
certain things like these red folders I
had to get into the building
get the red folders get out and but yeah
I'll take keys phones everything and
people leave their their stuff unlocked
although these 14 pcs that were stored
in a stairwell I carried out of the
building in fact people have the doors
open for me
because if you've got a struggling IT
guy who's carrying heavy pcs and open
the door please
and so people will let what people will
actually help you steal their stuff it's
amazing again more examples of like you
know just stuff left around and more
keys and this guy came back to a death
with just a coffee lid on it I took
everything just to prove a point and but
it's not just like their stuff right so
you can get
got these secured bins for like
confidential Aiona right which Superman
or super one could lift back I think
anyone could lift that Yeah right who
who has these massive will we've
inversions Yeah right
describe to me any person that has ever
emptied them because if I put on any
sort of high-vis jacket and walk into
your building and pick up one of those
will about where we live in so we li out
are you going to notice me probably not
so where did all of these confidential
papers go yeah they get put in there and
if I haven't stolen they they go
downstairs into like a loading bay where
they get shredded or burn or whatever
depending on the severity so if I go
down into the loading bay and wheel one
of these out I've got a lot of
confidential data that I shouldn't have
access to this is quite funny in the
fact that I think this is probably the
most physical data removed from a
government site it shouldn't have been
and to the point where I go out into the
car park and I was like oh shit I need
to put this back really quickly because
if someone comes along and steals it
from me I'm in trouble
alright but we also do asset
infiltration it's not always about
stealing stuff out of the company not
like getting the data out we have to put
stuff in so don't put things in like key
loggers they saw you come in and if
you've left you're like yeah your stuff
unattended I'll plug a key logger in or
I'll put in a wireless ap so I can
attack your network from the carpark
rather than being in the building I'll
put in cameras I had a nice little
hidden camera that I set up on a
security desk that was basically
pointing at the alarm system and in the
next day take it out saw the alarm code
went in that light disarmed the alarm
suite and we also get people in so you
know sometimes you need more than one
person to do a test on that site so you
can like smuggle people in once you're
in and you get a group of people and you
can have like there's one point where we
have ten people sitting in the corner of
an office doing work on this network
so nobody notice this because we give
some acts of company so it's like office
just a new group of people in the corner
working it's great crazy and yeah and so
this is like a proof of concept with the
cyber thing ID and I made this about
half an hour ignite that you know one
evening just as an idea so there's an IP
phone who has these on the desk
yeah great thing with IP phones is
there's nothing in them anymore which
means you can fit stuff like a Raspberry
Pi in it and they've sold with that onto
the network for with the wireless ap on
it and then you're on the network and if
the this has also got the power coming
from the IP Phone as well so if anyone's
looking around for this rogue device
they're just going to see a phone that
works and then that's it I can just
wirelessly attack your network all the
time and the best thing is like I
sometimes get a little bored in these
like tests where I'm running around you
would imagine if you were in your
building and you didn't have any work to
do and you had to spend two or three
hours in there you get quite bored right
so you start like messing with people
messing with ahead a little bit then we
can do anything
yeah so for example you can build an
office this is me in my office that I
built from pieces stolen from four
different buildings I brought in that
including the CSO's blackberry which I
stole from his desk phones this
ridiculously heavy glass table this
chair which was really lovely
uncomfortable which I found in this
really secure building and I was trying
to get it out and I came across like one
of these barriers and I couldn't get it
through and some helpful staff said I
need to find security to get let them to
get you through that's all never hassle
I just want my chair out so they helped
me lift it over the barriers which is
really nice and then I wheeled it across
to my new office and the irony of this
is that wall there is the Security
office and you can tell people you're on
a team-building exercise and get them to
build a teepee out of faeces around the
room
she's great I got in so much trouble for
this I cannot tell how he is apparent
apparently taking down a financial area
of this particular building was quite
detrimental and lost them quite a lot of
money but I thought it proved the point
I have this was my all-time favorite day
I joined a meeting exciting right
and I came onto this phone a lot of
people hanging around liked having this
mean what the hell's going up um turns
out they were having they had the CEO
there he was head ah this is brilliant
we've had like the best security year
this year we've had no breaches or
anything and I'm like okay this is
getting interesting and and I see my
client who's brilliant sitting at the
front of his meetings I pull out my
phone I send him a text saying I mean
you're meeting Lowell and what happens
next is amazing he sort of just gets his
friend answers it looks up looks around
site and I'm like I really hope there's
a Q&amp;amp;A session with this CEO right at the
end where I go who the hell am I and
what am i doing in your building so
you'd have a lot of fun with this but it
all goes to prove a point anyway
so I hope we can all say now how many
people think banks are secure physically
none right so you're all developments I
presume yeah so you're all sitting there
feeling pretty smug right you're like
well that's great physical screwed
digitally we're amazing right so I lied
a little bit earlier and you don't need
these skills really to rob a bank it's
quite easy it's in fact probably easier
than physically I just enjoy the
physical stuff more and so who's heard
of the Black Swan theory right this is
if you observe swans yeah they're all
white so all swans are white
that's the rule yeah Ultron's must be
white if you find a Black Swan you've
completely disproved that right so all
of your code is secure who's written
insecure code before
Wow that's awesome
I was not expecting that Wow
basically everyone for the health up is
great and okay that's kind of ruined my
story now basically you guys have to
develop code and write code that is
secure all the time I nee have to find
the one floor to get past your system
right so how do you rob a bank digitally
now we haven't got long and I don't want
to keep you from the pub too much so
we'll have a bit of a whirlwind of this
right so what you do is the same thing
to do if you're doing a physical bank
you take a look around and you'll find
okay like that is a genuine bank running
a Joomla admin login right okay maybe
it's just one bank that does that right
no so this one runs a webmail because
that's sensible right um or this one
that runs a website administration if
you're doing this just quit your job and
become a carpenter or something because
you should not be allowing this right um
do dumpster-diving
so go and have a look yeah you'll find
stuff like this open directories with
like log files and good old sitting
Chris Chris has been uploading some cool
stuff so I can go and look at this stuff
because I know where it is low alright
so you're probably thinking okay right
maybe I need to learn to hack to be a
better developer right so can you teach
me how to hack
well yes I can it's really simple try
these things try a backtick or a single
quote or put in some hate email and see
if you can make stuff break right so how
many people have like a testing
environment for their code or anything
from put it through security testing
before it was even released how many
people have it pen tested afterwards
yeah you need to get security involved a
lot sooner right and you guys need to
learn a little bit about security in
order to make sure that you don't make
the mistakes that allow us in right so
who remembers this guy the phone jack
err
yeah comedy show on I think it's channel
4 was it yeah and so he had this really
really great sketch where he
found up people and said I'll try and do
the accent but it was terrible right it
was something like hello there's a
pigeon in your bank account and we need
the pin number to get the pigeon out of
your bank account and people like
there's a pigeon in my banking how does
that happen and some people would give
them pin numbers and stuff like crazy
right
so from this a friend of mine introduced
me to this and I thought this is quite
hilarious
we should put pigeons into people's bank
accounts right or into their banks this
would be great so um when I'm doing a
bank heist job thing I'll often put
pigeons into their bank accounts right
this piece this pigeon is not supposed
to be on this page it is a bank and I
have put stuff on to their site right
and I do this a lot I probably have too
many people in pictures this is this is
my favorite one though because I think
that actually improves the sight I think
they should keep it I don't know what
they're done with it
I hope they fix the error just look so
brilliant a little bit alright anyway so
I went from pigeons right so you need to
sanitize your data this is why I'm
trying to say is you guys need to
understand where the attack vectors are
that I would use in order to gain access
into your company or your whoever your
client is right so who's in this xkcd
carting before yeah it's quite famous
right and when people understand it a
fair few actually let's bring it right
see if you're not input if you're not
sanitizing your input data I can put
stuff like pigeons into your into your
site's right if I can put stuff in it
means I can get stuff out because I can
start messing around with the backend
systems that you've got right so this is
a total this is a tool called sequel map
which basically takes those input
validation issues and we'll try and get
control of the backend database right
and so in this case you see we take over
my sequel database and it is now
affecting columns for us and in
this case for a bank we get credit card
numbers yeah I acted them out obviously
because I don't want you people getting
rich so this is the sort of thing that
comes from just a simple search engine
or input form something like that so
this is how we leverage it so we input
commands into it and make the database
error and then we can start making the
the database give back information that
you shouldn't and you're probably
thinking how great yeah it's done some
database hacker here no I make a lot of
money out of this I have to give it back
unfortunately but it shows the sorts of
money that you can get away with if
you're if you're robbing a bank
digitally this is a little bit different
from if you're robbing a bank physically
because the best i've ever got away with
there's a couple of gold bars and
they're really freaking heavy and it's
so it's so much easier to get away
digitally than it is physically um so
i'm gonna do something a little
different here and how many people know
what a zero-day is cool right now
there's going to be a video editor i
hope right where the video is going to
go to just me and not show you this
great because and if you if you go to
any security conference right um you'll
you'll get people so this will very
technical but I'm not going to drop any
zero-days yeah so every gasps terrible
crap alright so first of all was a zero
day and it's some sort of surveys and
questions on Twitter that I did right so
anything that is not disclosed publicly
that will affect the public's data all
right well basically that the remit of
it right so it's not a particular
vulnerability it's not particular type
is if I have gone to the company and say
you have this vulnerability that is
affecting people's data and between them
fixing it and releasing it to the public
that's where the zero day part comes in
right so for this let's see and you're
probably thinking what the problem is
right the trouble is it's really not
that hard to find zero days as we have
probably gathered
right and in fact I find them so often
because I've been doing so often you get
kind of gut feeling of how a site is
broken so even when you're just surfing
they go well that looks a bit old and so
you can literally trip over these things
now most people go hey find a zero-day
maybe once a year or whatever I find one
probably once or twice a week that
they're so prevalent so what I want to
do is ask you for no cameras or cell
phones or videos at this point
so what can you do about it as
developers right what can we get you to
do to help prevent people like me now
I'm a good guy I do it ethically I do it
morally I do it because you're paying me
to do it I'm not a criminal I've never
done any criminal activity before right
I am so what can you do so the first
thing is lower the bar right don't try
and win against nation-states right if
someone is a determined hacker whether
it's nation-state provided or to someone
that's really really pissed off about it
and they will find a way in
right so lower your bar low but yeah
just try and do the really basic simple
stuff yeah because that will actually
help there's a really good story about
two guys walking through woods right and
something a big grizzly bear is that was
my bear impression and that one of the
guys starts taking off he's like
rucksack and he starts to run I think I
was like what the hell you didn't do it
you can't outrun a bear yes I don't need
to I just need to outrun you all right
so you just need to outrun the other
companies yeah if you're slightly harder
to hack into then they're going to go
somewhere else
because they're always about the easiest
target right to fix the simple stuff
first input validation is a massive
thing right what else can we do we can
demand a bigger security budget from our
C suite and you know you need the time
you need the budget to go off and learn
this stuff you need time to like code
into it and and it's not about the money
it's about sending a message and that
actually fitted really well with this
light so yeah you need to demand that if
you're not demanding it then they don't
take it seriously and I can guarantee
the amount of money that they will spend
in security at the that level when it's
being written will be minuscule compared
to the fines they'll get from gdpr in
the upcoming year so they need to make
that call you need to communicate to
that and say let give me time in order
to write this securely so that we can do
this properly build in security from the
start I'll let you read the slides it's
quite funny
and it's a build from the foundation
build a strong foundation if you feel
trying to bolt security on at the last
minute like a little penthouse come in
coming right at the very last bit and so
it's off it's all broken you know you're
not going to tear it down again and
start again just because security is
that it's a bit terrible you need to do
it from the very beginning otherwise
everything you build on top of it will
fail and that is it so yeah you can go
home or you can ask questions I don't
mind it's up to you yeah
are there any questions at all okay Oh
which bank type so the question was what
what bank do I put my money in um
I diversify my bank savings is that
that's the best way um yeah
don't rely on just one night sinful
anymore I with lights so I've been doing
physical testing for a very long time
and I've tested thousands and thousands
of buildings and that to the point where
a couple years ago during Christmas I
was doing eight high street banks a week
right so that it's quite a lot it's not
like a one-off thing it's like walking
to a high street bank getting to behind
the tills get whatever and then get out
again so have I ever been caught there
have been two times where something has
gone wrong it wasn't because I was
caught but because of the client screwed
it up for me so one time was they went
out of policy and procedures and instead
of like going through these checks and
when they got a little nervous they just
phoned armed response and then response
surrounded the bank and then I had to
talk my way out of that which was fun
the other time was a client came up and
I was like right I'm in your building
just to let you know and he came and met
me and then called security on me and I
was like if I hadn't phoned you you
wouldn't know I was here and so I almost
punched him and then we had to be
inarguable I left so yeah so only the
two times but out of the hundreds and
hundreds and hundreds of buildings I've
done no never been caught I've always
managed to succeed with everything so
it's quite interesting it's always if it
gets a bit nerve-racking every time I do
want because it's like oh shit is this
going to end my like one of googles and
then it all goes fine so it's cool
yeah yeah I am
yeah sorry the question was what would
someone have to say to me in order to
make me go armor and sorry you've caught
me by the way right and first of all
I've run away but that's the first thing
I do a lot of running it's very hard on
these when you're jumping over bill l /
stairwells and and but generally just if
you don't know someone if they're not
wearing their badge or you don't know
who they are to say hey can I help you
you look lost me how are you trying to
find something you try to find someone
and it's a really good way of
approaching because people don't like
talking to other people especially if
they don't know them so actually if
they're like dressed up in a way that
makes them look more higher level than
they are so yeah that's probably the
best advice thing if it's just go up to
them thing can I help you know so that
there's no courses for this this is just
I have this is it's just one of those
things where you just fall into it yeah
yeah I I started from a very young age
where I didn't have a lot of money a
family very poor and so you have to like
black a little bit and just sort of
convince people to let you into places
or give you food or whatever and so that
just becomes a natural extension like
well actually I can point out all these
floors and your security systems and
then you just kind of end up getting
paid for it because you could have it
seemed as I'll get paid right and so
that's how I fell into it but it was a
rocky road let's put it that way my
first bank driver Rob was an interesting
story I was very nervous it's my first
bank it's an international bank with
their they didn't dearly like money like
solving a cache they don't like boolean
right so there's massive company in in
London and it's 3:00 in the morning
because that's the best time to like
scope out buildings and I'm sitting
there I'm just completely mesmerized by
this the state of this building I'm like
oh my god how am I gonna get into the
saying and I'm saying they're looking
at it we're gonna get into this and
something to hear someone behind was
like excuse me boy up to and I am trying
to work out a break into this Bank turn
around it's two police officers
let me tell you how difficult it is to
convince two policemen that is your job
it is not illegal so from now on I
always do my research like undercover a
little bit more subtly than that Oh have
you ever been really really impressed
with some company's security um people
spend a lot of money on stuff that I can
name a couple of places where there's
one one system where they spent sixty
thousand pounds on a new door system and
they're like you'll never get in it is
state of the art you need like a special
fob which encrypted you can't clone them
but you'll never get into this building
all right fine
so I spend the early morning before
likes it's like 3:00 4:00 in the morning
it's snowing just gently you know that
may be crappy snow is not real snow it's
just perhaps not right I've climbed over
a barbed wire fence I've climbed through
a bramble bush my arms and legs are just
shredded and I'm having to sit in this
half in this ditch which is a bit full
of water snow is coming down I've got my
nitrogen kit on ski mask on freezing
cold watching this bloody sixty thousand
pound door system in here and I suppose
tiny flaw so after a couple of hours of
just confirming this issue I jump back
in my car and then go back to those help
on a soup walk up to the site okay
getting a bit nervous walking up it's
very exposes obvious I'm going for this
building what looking at my watch just
in my papers just ever so slightly I
walk up to this sixty thousand pound
unhackable door system and it just opens
and it just lets me in right and I just
edged walk in and the after after the
workshop meeting was very interesting
parallel you must have done something
you like some sort of Jedi you shall did
something right you had something in
your pocket and then and just walked up
to it and we reviewed the CCTV footage
and you will just see me can walk up to
watch walk a little bit slower walk up
to it door opens I walk through turns
out that when they installed it they
left it in engineering mode which means
every 15 minutes it just does one
revolution just to check that it works
so all I had to do was walk up to it
it's precisely the moment that it did
this test and then it would I walk
through yes that was about the best I've
ever had
interested doing these talks is it made
your job harder now
no like and almost every building I go
into the like I'm totally going to keep
an eye out for you and we'll put right
pictures at night because I can change
my appearance quite quite quickly and
quite easily
I actually did a normal pen testing job
at a company where I interacted with the
receptionist every day and we got really
chatty and then the day of my social
engineering test was stupidly scheduled
for the end of the week so I'd been in
there for a whole week so they knew my
face so I shake for a bit and change
soup and book well I changed my parents
make all my piercings now etc and I look
very different and they didn't even
recognize me when I went up to the desk
and spoke to them so I'm quite lucky in
that I'm bitter
I can be a bit of a great man and change
no go did you ever get head by some
other heck oh I have been hacked by
another hacker I wouldn't know if
they're really good I wouldn't know
simple as that
and another question do you have any
recommendations how to manage passports
how to how to manage possible a do you
manage passwords and I really remember
mine just in my head that's not
something for everyone um you'll hear
people say I'll use a password manager
that's great a puffin time your
computing you probably get broken into
and stolen anyway so I would recommend I
have a look at your threat landscape
like what is what is more likely to
happen to you are you going to get
malware on your computer that will take
over your pass oh man during all your
parser soul or is someone going to break
into your house and find the little
notepad that you've written them all
down yeah people will say that's a
stupid thing to do right your parsers
out but it's in your house and unless
you don't trust your other half and your
kids
then you have all the problems so yeah
just write down a little notepad and
keep that safe simple as that that's
that's the best way or remember them all
if you're a bit weird yes
hey I'm sitting on one of your slides
caught my eye I was wondering if ever
you've broken in and discovered the bank
is doing something illegal and if so
what do you do ah so something similar
I'm not going to go into too much detail
on stofflet I've found other elsewhere
but I once broke in through a massive
Bank and I go into the CEOs area it's
only through the directors and I managed
to convince the PA that was outside
being very vigilant actually she was
very security conscious and but I
managed to cause a diversion install a
load of paperwork off of her desk and I
went through this paperwork and I found
a letter where the board were firing two
of the directors that they didn't know
about yet because it is on the PAS desk
at which point I was like oh I can make
a lot of money on the stock market with
this or I could take it back and be like
hands out they go you should just have
this back so that's about the worst I've
ever had any more questions no yeah oh I
might I'm curious about one technical
thing what device did you use to do a
pictures do you use glasses with the
possibility of taking pictures or use
some some phone or what whatever right
what is so this is think so the question
was what do I use to take pictures on
these job track
so once I'm into building right I've
screwed just perimeter security and that
means I mean yeah and nobody cares once
you're in they just assume that you're
supposed to be there and so over the
course of a couple of days from there if
I'm lucky enough and I'll start pushing
the boundaries and seeing how much I can
get away with before someone says what
you doing is you shouldn't be here doing
this so my my dress code will change
quite dramatically so you saw the
picture at the very beginning that was
taken by a client after three days at a
place where they only wear a suit right
if you're not wearing a suit and tie
your you'll cut off right but I was in
their dress like that and nobody gave it
give a damn about it right so what I
used for taking pictures well I use a
massive SLR camera all right because I
don't want to be covert I'm not all
about the cleaver I want people to say
you can't be doing this and I had one
job but it's very similar to the one the
bottom right there where I went in I've
ruined the building ruin all the
security and then ah damn I need to take
some photos for evidence right so I went
down to reception I was like I just need
to get camera out of my out of my car
and he let me back in so I left my coat
upstairs at the parson Chavarria find a
cool
so I went over to my hotel got my magic
camera the huge lens on it and I come
back in she lets me through because she
remembers me for like just a few minutes
ago without a pass I go off onto this
floor and I'm not right I'm just getting
tired state taking pictures so I'm
sitting there like taking pictures like
this like stood there brazen
yes someone would go what are you doing
and suddenly these women go what you
doing no just taking some pictures all
right we gonna be in a magazine you're
gonna be in a report
so that so that's why he's a massive
camera as big as possible to make it
like Here I am
you should be stopping me but you're not
there's a guy to mine down here that
aggression yeah so it takes a long time
to investigate lots of things like that
if you take large amounts they'll notice
it very quickly if you take small
amounts with lots of places they won't
notice and that there's there's a limit
I'm not gonna tell you what a limit is
but there's a limit where they'll just
go it's not worth our time fine they got
right with it simple as that
it's a very small amount but it's not
people yeah any any more questions or do
you want to go the arms sorry everyone
there's some small cash if you want to
go you can go if those who want to stay
in ask questions you can I don't mind
are you a specialist to banks only or
note your hand I just chose banks for
this talk because of everyone assumed at
the very beginning that they they're
physically and digitally secure and and
they're not it was just kind of proving
a point if I if I said oh I broke into
loads of commercial offices that do like
kitchens he's gonna care hello oh wow
well done yeah great stole the kitchen
sink literally and I didn't intend for
that pun to happen that was over with
and so now I don't I don't just
specialize in man so it's any any way or
anything
there's no a movie or TV series which
depicts that what you're doing in the
real or or entire hacking and and stuff
like this an accurate way
hacking digitally hacking now if there's
not really any map appeared in the
matrix like one of the Matrix movies and
mr. robot pretty close but is pretty
terrible as for Breaking and physically
the best best thing I can recommend is
the movie sneakers where they actually
do very similar to what I do which is
break into the physical building steal
money and then go back in again this is
what I got so that's a really good way
so that's about it really
so if my company wanted to hire you to
come and break in and test our security
what sort of rough price would that so
my answer to that is how much have you
got so come speak to me afterwards if
you even talk about and so actually I
should really sort of point out here I
think social engineering is as I used to
do it's pretty much dead it's a very
much a snapshot of the security system
that you've got so nowadays I tend not
to do social engineering attacks against
the company I'll go in and go right
click walk me through your building and
I will show you all of the mag locks
around all of the CCTV that's wrong all
the ways I can break into your building
because you'll never get that from a
social engineering test you'll get all
your security guard was yeah away taken
yeah a toilet break for these two
minutes or like that the revolving door
there's like this one thirty second gap
that I have every 15 minutes you won't
ever get told about all of the problems
you have everywhere else so I now I've
now moved into physical assessments
rather than social engineering but we
can have a chat afterwards so how do you
protect your digital world
lots of egg apps egg apps of the king
segregation and egg apps I've seen some
very impressive
systems but you can't just
half-heartedly do it I've been into lots
of companies where they've had an air
gap and then people have been charging
their iPhones on the air-gap system and
it's like what you're doing is doing it
wrong so you need to segregate as best
as possible and obviously understanding
how people attack that's the only way
that you can work out how to defend
yourself but like I said before if
someone really wants in if it's
nation-state level you're screwed
simple as that so anymore or have you
finally given up and just let me go
sink sink that's it right you can all go
home
work it make it do it make sense</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
