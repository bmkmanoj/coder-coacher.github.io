we're here at BOTS days Derek I'm with
Martin something the keynote speakers
though you gave a really cool Kino
engineering you about a practical
approach to software development
learning from different disciplines so
what is some you mentioned in the
keynote a quote from 1968 so it's your
point that we are software developers
you need to look back at different
industries like engineering notice to
refine our own practices I think we're
just like many of the practices gone
before us where I'm learning from the
past ourselves so we were discovering
things again like iterative development
pointed out in the 1960s so test-driven
development pointed out in the 1960s a
personal what I was trying to show to
their it's not Annie's not new at all it
just seemed a bit like we on that
subject that we do have constantly new
concepts that actually have already
existed like functional programming
isn't actually a new thing it's just
maybe been rebranded but your point I
think about revisiting is really good
you do mention in the keynote at
something about emails and embraced
emails an approach to code but I in
particular found really useful because
I'm not a classically trained software
developer I came in by getting a job
that was note states required yeah so
through the fundamentals that you talked
about could you explain the email
analogy sure I topic fundamental design
but also fundamentals of our behaviors
and practices so example with the email
thing is it's we work a lot from
short-term memory and if you're a
short-term memories loaded up with all
the things you want to put into an email
you write that email you reread it
straight away you're actually reading
from your short-term memory not what's
on the page number from your screen in
front of you see cell array so decide to
roast rather than what you did right so
leave it a while go off do something
else maybe even the next day come back
reread it again and you'll read was
truly they're not was just in the short
term memory that you think you've risen
and it's the same with code so we write
some code we go off and do something
else we come back again we'll see things
that we didn't see for fun you'll see
the bugs mistake
the silly little things that are just so
obvious on the revisit that you don't
see the first time and so that really
helps with getting our quality we do
much better first the fundamentals this
being a good software crashed person you
also talked about some of the
fundamentals that you should learn
transcend languages mmhmm yeah lots of
those sort of things are coupling
cohesion separation of concerns in many
ways also in like big words but i reckon
quite simple but we need to practice
them much more often so a lot of them
relate to height angle their code is we
can all kind of relate to could be in
tango but but what does that mean like
two things couple together a little bit
too much if we untangle them linux easy
to work with easy-to-understand mixes
surface area what we're working with
much simpler but there's some
fundamental theory behind that and it's
good to go back and revisit out and
practice it like just even google for
coupling and see how many how many types
of coupling the right there are many
there's even specialized within some
feels like with an object orientation
kinesins is a special form of coupling
that fits to object orientation just a
little bit of googling will he sort of
point out a lot of these things and you
can start to see so let's give a simple
example you want to pass our customer
objects from one system to another but
all you actually want is the customer ID
is it a good idea to pass the whole
object because now you're coupled to the
whole object you just passed the ID now
you're in a couple for that the rest can
change say so we're always changing
sulfur so let's minimize impact of the
change quite often coupling is one of
the best ways of achieving that keep
couple in low so when you talk about
fundamental sense you're what you're
suggesting is that rather than
constantly keeping on top of
technologies and new things coming in
it's a good idea is there as a software
engineer to step back and look at
fundamentals to revisit them and that's
how you refine your coach more than
looking at the latest addition to
Jenkins or the latest release of scholar
yeah so those things useful sort of
keeping up with technology
keeps moving all the time nothing don't
do that but let's just get the balance
and look at some of the things that are
important we get excited about taking up
the new version the Jenkins not quite
sure why you get excited but new versus
Jenkins like a little bit which I've at
University Scholar depends on how you
you're inclined but it so that's useful
but what's much more important is like
do you think day in day out is my code
got nice separation concerns is this
module of this component cohesive have I
got coupling between classes module
functions whatever they happen to be it
shouldn't be there those sorts of
fundamentals are much more important to
practice until it becomes such a natural
instinct that we almost don't need to
think about it but it only becomes
reflexes if you drill it all the time
until it becomes reflexes you see it in
other disciplines that you've heard of
it takes 10,000 hours become an expert
in anything I I love people who do
programming who have also done things
like music or sports or something that's
taken them a long time to get good at if
you go through the whole period of not
being so good you refine over time but
you refine by practice and drilling and
you practice the fundamentals then you
become really good we don't get enough
practice or the fundamentals and
software to become really good at it as
an industry typically for people</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
