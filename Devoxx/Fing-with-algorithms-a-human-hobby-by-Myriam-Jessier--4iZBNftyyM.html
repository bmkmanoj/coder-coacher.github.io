to be talking today about with
algorithms I know that most of you guys
probably think of algorithms in terms of
I need to set something up to solve a
problem my job and my hobby is to
with the things that you make and
there's a very good reason for that so
we're going to dive into that why is
 with algorithms a uniquely human
hobby well let's look at it from the
start what is an algorithm an algorithm
in itself is just a series of steps that
you will undertake to make a decision or
solve a problem it should be effective
it should be well-defined and it should
be finite so it should give you a
solution now with that in mind what is
an algorithm to me well it could be my
recipe for making pancakes that's an
algorithm to and most people have a
tendency to make them way more
complicated than they should be
algorithms are very very pervasive in
our everyday lives why because they make
things easier I don't have the luxury or
the brainpower to wonder if taking left
or right is going to be faster however
Google Maps will tell me so I rely on
algorithms to make my life easier and
that's pretty great the problem is that
they tend to be scary why well when you
think about it it's a more objective way
of solving a problem it brings rigor to
the human decision-making process so it
should be awesome except that for some
reason of humans we don't like awesome
we don't like easy we want to make
things complicated
we like to game the system and gaming
the system is all about making sure that
you play with the rules in place in a
way that will bring the outcomes you
want know the ones of the system wants
and
when I find deeply deeply ironic is that
this expression didn't exist for a very
long time I mean the first time we refer
to an algorithm as human beings was a
thousand six hundred years before Christ
and somehow it took until 1975 to coin
the term that basically explains what we
do everyday which is to with the
rules and what's even better for me is
that it was coined by engineers in the
70s in Las Vegas because of course that
makes a lot of sense so why am I talking
about talking without rhythms because
there's a reason why we do it there's
actually multiple reasons first of all
because it's fun I actually like to say
I beat the system I'm number one there's
also another reason because sometimes
they suck because sometimes I don't
agree with the way things are done and
I'm not the only one and there's a third
reason because we can gain from it
there's actually big money to be made
from gaming the system and making sure
that algorithms that have been put into
place to make sure that people don't
cheat and don't turn up first
well if we mess with them we can end up
number one and make a lot of money so
let's dive into a few examples have you
ever heard the term Google bombing it's
actually a real term in the dictionary
it's when a lot of people get together
to decide what the results should be in
Google and the most famous ones and
we're not going to go into details are
pretty horrible if you're wondering what
kind of car Jesus drives there's an
answer to that because it decided so the
most famous one for me is the first one
in the early 2000s if you type more evil
than Satan himself you have this sexy
man show up it was Microsoft com not
because you know the search algorithm
decided it should be is because humans
decided to feed the Machine and say
actually we think it's Microsoft so it
can get very very fun the problem is
that we see it negatively there's a
difference between working the system
and gaming the system when you're
working with the system you're being
rewarded because it's seeing us
because you are working within a system
so you respect the rules to maximize the
outcomes then when you're gaining the
system it it implies that your game
gaining an unfair advantage to bring
about an outcome for which the system
was never intended a KA you actually
didn't deserve the outcome and that's a
big problem for me why because
most of the algorithms that we use in
our everyday life are actually owned by
people and in effect your giant black
boxes nobody ever tells me anything
about this I actually have to test them
out to know how they play about and
that's not fair why because you may not
realize it but code well it takes your
biases it takes your perspective it
takes all the stereotypes that you have
in your mind which means what it means
that the outcomes that I should have
never engineered myself by gaining the
system well you decided unconsciously
that I never deserve them and that's not
OK for me and this is why it became such
a human hobby for me except that like I
said I'm not the only one and it's
causing huge issues and why I started
thinking about this the whole Trump
Fiasco was not even happening but now
you see it even more I mean algorithms
are so pervasive that now you can see
them as a subtle form of social control
so you have to be very very careful when
you think about these things because the
impact our everyday lives and we don't
even notice it that's the whole point of
them being subtle so I'd like to take a
lighter look at this
how do people gain the system just for
the record I've been happily married for
10 years so tinder is not my thing but I
admire people who play with tinder why
because it's based on the error
algorithm the algorithm well they use a
modified version of what World of
Warcraft people are using and if you
read this properly you will see that the
whole system is based on evaluating
individual players according to the
assumed skills they have against other
players so what
earring is I'm never going to be good
enough for me I actually have to compete
with other people to get more visibility
and more dates well you know what that's
an open invitation for me to mess with
the system because I don't agree with it
I don't want to be evaluated according
to other people for something that has
to do with emotions that has to do with
human relationships and I'm not the only
one quite a few people have had this and
managed to get 10,000 Bates in under a
week there's other ways we can play
around with it and this is very very
powerful for common people that use the
internet whatever you get to mess with
something that you see as highly complex
by typing in a few words it makes you
feel like a champion I mean sure this
guy managed to basically annoy everybody
on Facebook well everybody that was his
friend because he created a post though
seems to the algorithm like it's a very
important post something huge in his
life happened and it turns out that I
got enough momentum that people kept
seeing this post for weeks on end and it
keeps showing up and showing up many
people were telling him yeah it's still
number one could you please make it stop
I'm tired of seeing your news that
aren't news but he was very proud
because he's basically said he took me
what five sentences to reverse engineer
this whole entire thing
woohoo I'm the best well it can be
annoying but it also highlights a lot of
things because you get to see what
happened with fake news he did it for
fun other people do it for profit
and you don't know who they are but
somehow the new seems a bit believable
because you know it keeps showing up so
it must be important so with that in
mind you should think about issues with
algorithms I said that it's a black box
and it is but what happens is we are
convinced that this these algorithms
there so prison in our lives that
they're supposed to make it easier
they're supposed to help us the problem
is most of the time when these things
are put in place especially when their
corporate black box boxes well they're
not helping you they're helping other
people or other corporations for
Facebook and I should know because
originally I work in marketing
technical marketing so I know that
Facebook is helping you because they
want to gain more data about you to sell
you off to advertisers and it's true and
that's the concept of corrupt
personalization it's the idea that in
algorithm is supposed to help you out
but it actually doesn't it serves
another master and it's always at your
expense it's never a win-win situation
no matter how much you know I could do
an entire talk about how it's a win-win
situation I'm in marketing after all but
it's not the case so let's talk about
other people that have messed with
Facebook one of my favorite ones and I
highly recommend you read this up
because the entire story is magnificent
this guy decided to troll his roommate
his roommate was a professional sword
swallower that could not swallow
aspirins so I keep telling you that
we're doing things professionally and
we're keeping information away and you
know personally identifiable information
is it's not attainable on Facebook and
it's okay and we're doing this clean
like No
now this guy was able to take his
roommate and segment the audience to the
point where is an audience of one person
which was the roommate and then he
proceeded to stop the guy for weeks on
end by creating highly personalized ads
that would go on your professional
sports follower and do you have
difficulty swallowing aspirin isn't that
ironic and go to the point where the
roommate got so paranoid because he
thought that his whole into her house
was bugged and he started looking under
the phone under the light until the
marketing guy told him no you made it
you had a prank on me that was my way of
pranking you I've been stalking you for
weeks and you can get really really
terrifying so of course a Facebook then
ran away and went oh my goodness we will
fix this great that's awesome except
that it doesn't really work out because
we still get to mess around with the
system I promise you that there's
different ways we can access information
from people on different platforms and
the problem with that is algorithms are
biased algorithms will target specific
people while may
other people invisible so no matter how
much you wish you would get this outcome
you wish you know you will do everything
right and from how you never make it you
never get to be number one you're never
getting the best and you don't realize
that it doesn't matter how much you
follow the rules that have been set into
place a you don't even know what the
rules are because it's a black box
nobody's telling you be everybody's
telling you trust the system we built it
in a way that's fair and see you know
something is wrong you want to game it
you want to win but then you keep being
told it's not ethical that is something
I think about a lot and whenever
different things show up online I will
try to optimize them and see what
happens so I have tortured quite a few
people myself especially on YouTube
because I don't know if you've noticed
when you search things on YouTube
there's all these hot girls in bikinis
in the video previews even if it's for a
teeny recipe I don't understand why well
there's a reason why it's because people
click on it so what I would do is send
emails going oh I have a very very
important document I need you to see and
it was actually Finnish hardcore love
Gulf metal or something
oh very creative though and so what
would happen is if you get the person to
click repeatedly on different links of
insane videos there's a history feature
in YouTube so guess what they would keep
receiving more and more insane
recommendations showing up and he would
tell me please stop messing with my
history I'm tired of YouTube telling me
I should watch these things and well my
friend is still my friend but she's very
careful about what she clicks now so
there's different ways we get to enjoy
it it can be fun it can be for profit as
well I'm not going to lie my specialty
is while optimizing search engines so
for example LinkedIn has a search
algorithm guess what I come out a lot I
mean did you know I'm specialized in UX
and JavaScript and I also do content and
I will do design I didn't know about
myself until I started messing with it
and I keep popping up in recruiter
searches so I get harassed
but it was fun while I did it because I
figured Alec would be number one even
though I absolutely suck at half of
these things but it doesn't matter I
still get the offers so there's a few
companies that have decided to do
something else something different using
algorithms to actually help people well
there's quite a few but the one I like
the most because it's a success story to
me is skid lagged you've probably never
heard of them but they're an amazing way
to travel if you are leaving with a
backpack why well these guys have tapped
into algorithms that are used by
different airlines and they will find a
way for example I live in Canada if I
want to fly from Cancun Mexico to mobile
which is the French side of Canada let's
say it will cost me $500 if I say on a
flight to Toronto with a stop in mohei
also changing planes then is 300 but why
I mean I don't understand your stopping
my city you're supposed to be cheaper
but you're not well I don't necessarily
agree with these rules and skip lives
they don't agree either so they made a
service available for everybody where
you can actually find hidden routes you
need to get from point A to point B for
the cheaper price you can with them they
will tell you hey the airline will make
a stopover here you just need to get off
that's it and you'll save money except
the airline's didn't enjoy this even
though it was ruled after all perfectly
legal so they sued the guy they sued
this really young New Yorker going we
don't agree with you and we're going to
put millions to put you out of business
and the business itself doesn't really
make money
concept of helping people and the judge
ruled against the airlines on a
technicality but what's really scary to
me is that it was a legal technicality
it was not an ethical issue it was not a
question of who's right who's wrong or
what should we do or should the airlines
improve their algorithms it was just
though the way was done was oh there's a
legal technicality in New York so we are
going to throw this out so he's safe for
now
but we don't know for how long and I
would like to end on a note because this
has been a lightning talk I just wanted
to get you thinking about all this to be
is to be perceived and this is very very
true when you think about it because you
may not realize that a lot of things are
going on in the world simply because
guess what Facebook's news algorithm
doesn't think it's that relevant or
maybe because it's Google News that
doesn't think is that relevant or you
know what maybe there was a promoted
Twitter hashtag that was more important
than the other news that we're passing
around so we create our own echo
chambers and we end up just ignoring
things because they don't show up
they're not perceived so the next time
you have to optimize an algorithm I know
that you're not going to be on my side
of things but think about it and think
hey is the math wrong does that make
sense am I doing this right
validate with someone else just in case
leave the echo chamber and that's about
it thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
