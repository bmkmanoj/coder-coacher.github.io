know I wish Patrick who's talking about
Java 9 module system which is very apt
because it's been a bit of a twist on
yesterday actually about automatic
modules yeah kaliesha Levin yeah the
discussion went about if automatic
modules as they are now should be kept
on the radar or not and what impact that
is based on 40 normal end-user basically
all the library develop that's more or
less the context of it and if you take
the automatic module approach at
existing now we got some problems that
an end user or the library developer has
to decide what depending modules names
would be and even if the mods don't
exist already so there is a bit to the
main problem reading so I'm I thought
that the automatic modules will be
automatically named yes but if you want
to use them if you are a module you have
to specify a required part in which you
have to give a stable name basically and
if you are a developer for example that
uses guava you have to say requires goer
and if you do a library of it and you
push that on the net and someone uses
that and puts his code on top of that
and guava comes out with a final module
and it may be called khue kham guava in
the end that light we will break even
though it is proper module per se but he
when you want if you want to create a
module without any dependencies of all
on others you must somehow have for
Table nine yes which you don't have at
this point and then so aside from that
debate what's your experience
with the motor system so basically if
other other final them in the end of the
chain being developer then you don't get
to the model in the first place you have
plenty enough problems to even get your
old style class box being our key so
there are a lot of libraries that you
may use that uses deprecated API which
you have replacement since Java 1.4142
and they never changed so basically it
breaks already even before you come at
least in near to the model system itself
do you think that's a necessary evil
though in order to and in order to move
towards a nice modular system with
smaller applications do you think we
need to go through the pain of things
breaking well you go always to some some
pain a break and if you use in you and
your external libraries that would
happen from day to day orders already
now so but in the end to have a clearly
separated part of external libraries and
clear boundaries what you can use and
what you don't have to use I think
that's a good thing to do also to to
have a best developed by yourself anyway
so because you don't have any chance to
say well this is public practice this
package I want to have public and in
that one internally that don't touch we
use that in turn so you can see better
and encapsulation yeah of course at the
moment in our company you have to
basically do that how to say like in a
formal process if the package named
internal don't use it we're gonna check
the code based on that but that's messy
it's not ever not a really good thing to
avoid when you're teaching people about
the module system yeah which you find
that the most important message to get
across
think first before to write any any code
at all and always keep in mind that
anything that you put there is first a
public API yeah and have a good
separation of what is public and what is
not public in the first place even too
easy to sell you but we got the tougher
system which is already already almost
twenty years old of like from the days
almost day one of Java and we have tried
a nest egg which you have to solve any
anyway somehow thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
