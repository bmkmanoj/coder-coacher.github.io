afraid we were all really afraid that
there would be maybe four people in the
room never underestimate the power of
free beer Thank You atlassian yay jay is
so normally we start this kind of
session off with a jingle I don't know
who remembers that but apparently we
don't because we forgot to put it on the
laptop instead do you think they want to
say how God so they really do want a
thing who wants to sing well alright
come up sir okay come on up if you want
to sing you can sing it come on just
take the mic down there Geraldo style
Carl ok I will do all right yeah you
didn't know you're gonna do solo right
[Laughter]
well you know what I think the first
live show we had that happen
spontaneously we had not planned for it
and they just burst out in song it was
the creepiest part it's like awkward
enough at the moment yeah it might be my
boo is my bum no one said we're going to
observe a moment of silence for some
happen okay so it's really important to
start this session with the most
important question of all who here
actually remember does anybody know what
the java posse is oh wow how many people
actually listen to the java posse those
are the old people turn up and everybody
else in the audience is ok no ageism
yeah who here is younger than 30 and
knows who the java posse are oh oh snap
alright um little short intro for all
the suffering people in the audience
pre-beard did I mention the free here
all right ah that's us this would at
devoxx what four or five years ago
something like that in Belgium I didn't
have to wear a hat that
spenders of Java since when a little you
do the history dammit you really okay so
in 2005 there were these things called
iPods if you remember those and this
this other thing started called
podcasting and I thought gosh it would
i'd like to listen to one on java and
there wasn't one so we started one
instead and that's in a nutshell the
history of this we did it for about 10
years until none of us were doing Java
anymore and then we thought I did it was
probably a bit disingenuous talk about
it at that point so so we felt in the
last year of its existence Joe Nuxhall
saw the writing on the wall and got the
hell out and nobody else saw the writing
on the wall so they asked me to step in
that was the jumping the shark moment
yeah anybody edited out this show wasn't
clear on that that was it yeah we don't
return the corner by then um okay you
talk yeah I don't I don't want to touch
this all right how's this your eyes I'm
on it I'm on it okay so um if you would
like a piece of real java posse history
you can take home there we go what 10
you can take home these hats the ones
we're wearing right now that are all
signed by all five of us all proceeds
will go to charity it's going to go to
the java posse Disneyland but no sorry
dev ops for kids gonna go for devil to
kids this is the URL we have no idea
what people will pay for these or if
they will pay for them so if not we're
giving them away at the end of the show
because we don't want to anymore the
starting bid is 42 cents yep yeah really
it's not that height you can use them
for we never actually got around to
selling them before we have the best of
intentions and we fail so one of the
things you can use these for somebody
breaks the bills you make them wear the
hat punishment ok that's all sorts of
ways easy useful and you can put our
people at a time yeah it's really good
yeah so you won't run out if you would
like to bid will actually give them way
at the end of this session so we've
recently take them take them away clear
all right the crowd that's
that's you that was the interactive part
of the show by the way you didn't get it
that URL takes you to an ebay that you
can bid on right now literally we're
going to do this or you gonna be bidding
or you can oh yeah alright so let's talk
about you where are you from Silicon
Valley a very good to be here we can
hear that California makes a noise you
gotta make noise they're not going to be
they're not going to see you on the
thing so Mike noise u.s.a you all right
everyone's from Earth America okay an ad
and tonight you in there yeah world and
anyone from rigel 7 i'd say yeah yeah
you just gave it away sir there's always
one we've been watching you okay always
best about this conference how about the
talks Beth talked you went to shout it
out there were several key notes you
have to be specific you have to say the
entire title and the speaker's name yes
and the number in war room Wi-Fi we got
the best I'm sure you did pretty well I
think it did good venue huge huge huge a
great location what about a holiday rock
in town yeah give it up a feminized
gonna do about the weather
right here it was the antrum experience
yep and the java posse reunion plus beer
yeah okay the beard totally without me
yeah I brought them at first and I
thought we better put the word beer in
there as well let me just check Java
kasi reunion job across the reunion with
their okay I think that pretty much says
it all right there all right let me
awkwardly switch over here we have some
nice stats compiled by the official
status Tyler people 650 people here 26
sponsors of Renee's exhibit room as well
as just sponsoring in general 210
speakers that we almost outnumber the
attendees next video we're going to have
a rumble number of countries represented
31 and that's the same as the numbers
date do we know in the u.s. that
countries are not staged okay okay one
of those geography test that we fail if
top five rated talks dr. swarm or Kuber
Nettie's pick your framework optional
the mother of all bike sheds personality
is the new ringtone modular development
with jdk nine and all business of
technology business congratulations i
didn't think it was all serving
statistic for you I don't know who put
that one in there I thought just gone to
one though yeah that literally just went
to one device alternative fact the apps
there was 713 downloads which is more
than the number of people who work here
and there are people living vicariously
multiple devices people in Croatia like
what is going on at the conference now
they wanted to go they wanted to go and
just couldn't make out and thank
goodness they had the ads I just think
you look very clear yeah home location
of attendee you traveled the farthest
Saudi Arabia well done 18 hours are you
here who traveled from Saudi Arabia wow
oh wow impressive yeah I was gonna say
you're probably sleeping in the back now
you better be back at work on Monday you
should leave now
suspect home location of attending who
traveled to leave San Jose nine minute
drive in your dreams or you can it
probably takes longer than it does from
Saudi Arabia usual rainfall for this
week in San Jose is zero but we actually
have an inch very impressive Belgian way
that's where it came from most
frequently asked question where is the
food and I like the fact that they moved
it between different days to just to
fool you coffee too upstairs downstairs
who knows number of tequila shots
consumed Tuesday five wednesday / 27
well done Wow and then Thursday they
couldn't even getting on a thoughtful
person with it it's not purpose it is
not it is prefer different average her
purse and will colleges it was by the
stats compiling people actually which is
why they just they have no stats fellow
came here success they was hang out
number of puppy attendees three and
kitty attendees 3i missed that one oh
okay there's an error in the set sorry
fires a compiler there weren't 899
followers until its lucky nine hundredth
person surprisingly had their picture
taken well look very surprised Eclipse
Foundation employee of the conference
Patrick LaRoque at age 11 I believe in
the US we call this trial ever labor
Frances our lawyers will see you
immediately what are you drinking there
I don't know number of inflatable chairs
for free for the asking outside the
ballroom after this is equal to n where
N equals the number of chairs that are
out there and that's it for the stats
back to the fun word amazingly content
full slides yet wait for it I see
nothing yo day there we go staff from
the conference yes we did that humor ok
this would be the non-serious part a
talk as opposed to wait we're telling
you that just in case you believe we
have some Java true facts this is the
things that fake news has lied about
and we must find memory leakers now well
so I think number one we have proof that
the JCB has bugged the source code in
Java it's been watching us for some time
this one I want to remind everybody let
us not forget the great garbage
collection green Fred massacre this
definitely proves when we need more
security in the JPM true much more much
one and then of course there was the
great variable named famine of 2007 I
thought anybody remember that horror
there weren't enough identifies to go
around we had to start cannibalizing
source code that when PHP took off yes
yeah I was it was dark times in the Java
oh and I want this wonderful weather sun
java curve in the microwave spying on
all of it so wiped out when you're
watching like microwave ovens man that
they're watching you never trust those j
OT devices how about this one I had to
ask them what this one meant do you
remember how we used to cover the ti OB
index on the java posse we were really
concerned about Chavez popularity we
can't to be no middleman well yeah
there's been a lot of legal voting now
that's what what are you doing so hot
right now oh good sort of look in this
direction I don't remember the point of
this like you are everything Liam's
there is there you live one in here
illegal voting yeah illegal right thing
in particular we believe that visual
basic.net has been stuffing the polling
yeah stuffing the Polaris they have this
really easy to build app to do that all
right there are over actually over this
doesn't even say the true fact over a
hundred quintillion p.m. there are more
people using Java than our lives in the
world right it is the most popular
language in the universe ever more
popular than Esperanto yeah
and it continues to be more popular
every day okay now we would like to go
on to the next part of our platform
speech we are going to make Java great
again again huge it'll be huge what were
you who wishes for the good old days of
Java when a hash table was a hash table
but that and date was all you needed
which if you're an engineer and
sometimes be hard to get I uwt i miss aw
see what about those heavyweight
components huh you know you miss a WT
but then there's always java.awt don't
list that comes up first in the import
just as a constant reminder it's just a
constant reminder of what you want u +
pick me yeah still out there you can
still use it if you want and you can use
it to build APIs the future the other
future the future of the future all
right so these are ideas for making Java
great again first of all think you're
going to love every one of them
administrative overhead there is too
much blokes in our society we're going
to eliminate some of that overhead by
removing all of that extraneous
punctuation sample code that looks like
this there's just too much for our
little brains to part noisy boy yeah
yeah too much we don't need all that
stuff what if it looked like this
instead it's more readable I that's
right I really hate GC pauses especially
unexpected once so we've fixed this
we're gonna stop all automatically
garbage collections just there won't be
anyone you on it okay you will have to
call garbage collectors yourself in
intense code you may have to call it
quite a lot like every iteration of a
loop for example we recommend the
practice of involving it with
instructions but you won't get any
causes that you're not expecting any
more effect native languages now you are
in complete control of the memory for
power yeah we're going to create jobs
we're going to create them by
eliminating or requiring line numbers in
Java so we've got to go back through all
that old source code and put line
numbers in them it's going to create
opportunities for many
any people this is what code looks like
today this is what it's going to look
like yeah but better it's like in the
good old days yeah basically is oh yeah
yeah I have a little tip nostalgic team
and yeah totally and we're going to
bring world peace you remember all the
fights between the fans of tabs and
spaces I remember you close about logo
on other stuff yeah well we're going to
bring peace to the table and our
solution for this it's very simple we're
just not gonna have a white space so
let's take a look at the code look at
all that tab it's simply I don't think
so let's see what we're going to do be
much nicer that's concise oh yeah I
agree and we're gonna build a wool
firewall and thought that's gonna play
cisco far and we're going to make sure
we lock it up so basically all the order
is wrong so we're going to make sure
that all variable rates and brights are
going to have to be protected by
individual locks this will solve a lot
of problems can you reveal the code here
so exactly make sure that you require
the right order or some bad stuff can
happen yeah but you're in complete
control again right given the power back
to the people yeah exactly secure the
borders lock it up something like that I
can't remember what this want to be
helped we're going to increase Crowder
and tourism this is about jobs as well
and we're going to do that by allowing
people to go to places this is the way
it works now but look at this code right
and do you see how this feature is
integrated with the line number feature
they go together and it's like well
together it's one less line of code as
well I mean it is fantastic if if a line
isn't there that can't be a bug in it so
this has thirty three percent less bugs
okay yeah nice proof what's that
how does it work when we forbid white
spaces sir I am going to show you the
answer to that later thank you for that
we're gonna have the greatest plan for
that first 30 days is going to be solved
no more deplorable yes I monta probable
no more deplorable we're only Cano allow
approved generics wild camps and
deplorable to write out now so who finds
generics hard to read all right yeah and
the rest of you are lying all right well
it's not going to be a problem in the
future this is what the code used to
look like and now that's it get rid of
the deplorable natural numbers are there
still some punctuation in there that I
want I don't yeah we will get it all
together what pull it all together at
the end and now undesirable types need I
think this is yours at no foreign types
only diameter
something complex like this trying to
describe a dog you've got a whole class
and strings and complex things it's just
why I'm thinking on constrained mobile
devices you're allocating and yeah an
election garbage always on yeah you're
making garbage everywhere that requiring
you to do all the GCS that you don't
want to do there's a simpler way to
describe exactly what you need the dog
in stock that's it need repeal
and replace oh yeah there's a new j unit
we want to modernize it bring it up to
twenty sixteen or twenty seventeen
standards so you may have seen for
example assert false in your code or
fail when something is truly not have to
happen we don't like such negative terms
yeah we're very close we really don't
right so in our improved 2015 edition
we're going to have a certain
alternative true and instead of fail
it's working fine it's a well-oiled
machine make java grade again we're
going to put all of these or at least as
many of them as we could remember
together and this as well this is java
10 you're getting a preview of java 10
right now it'll be here in 10 years this
is what you might write today if you
wanted to call this important function
on that important instance and this is
the beauty of the future of java it's
beautiful bride it's now look at that it
will be great how many jobs is that
going to create one two three five six
seven eight I count eight we're gonna
job well we're going to multi-core it so
we've actually out one separate person
for each line of code on the index that
time still spice this night that's
better yeah they're gonna be on one line
imagine a call yeah what if I get code
review from tour strike the space yep
all right all right let's get serious
now we don't joke we're very solemn up
here I've heard that from IBM all right
uh java since the java posse what's been
going on so we quit I'm sorry we retired
I'm sorry we were tossed out two and a
half years ago yeah I think so or the
lab Jarius podcast Oh probably three
years ago
one that we really did other than a live
show was like three years ago now okay
which is unbelievable so three years ago
and java has gone great leaps and bounds
since then Java 8 yeah such a fright is
out now and I think probably the most
amazing thing about it is lambda we're
heading up west yeah yeah I hold on
there big no-no the point I was trying
to make with lambda is do you remember
when we stopped doing the java posse and
there were all these arguments about
whether lambdas should be there in in
Java well they went Jake fights between
the different the different camps of
which kind of lambda 2 built well I'm
yeah absolutely there was a huge
movement not to put them in at all I
mean there was a lot of rhetoric about
not running gym no one Falls to really
think that anymore I think it has the
Victor has been crowned turns out that
we inhibited arguments came in like a
lion and out like a lambda I told them
I've been waiting for years to make that
joke and that's pretty much the response
ike's streams API yeah streams like the
eyes mail and that's very Landers all
right Elaine Barrish all right so yeah
three years two things so good no well
maybe people think I'd ever yeah what
are your favorite Java 8 features people
use in what do they really like about it
optional duck gets like optional danke
an interesting one but anybody went to
the bike shedding talk that was a joke
huh you had to be there okay Stuart
Stuart now even Stewart didn't go yeah
there's that a joke okay okay moving on
alright Java nine up and coming yeah it
is on the way we have jigsaw teeny tiny
modules causing absolutely no
disagreement within the java community
this one this one's exciting to me now
this gonna get a proper rebel a big deal
for you have scholar right yeah it
really does make a difference but when
you have lambda Sandra Paul you'll come
back to java and now that genies out the
bottle I'm afraid
when when they get type classes what is
he doing he keeps tripping he's so hot
right now he is so hot right now all
right the collection factory methods
okay cells about like anymore afsar okay
please don't take any more off yes
collective so collection factory methods
you're going to have finally have an
easy way to create a collection with
barks and stuff like that that's a
really nice nice incremental features
like let's start I should point out with
an awful lot more going in children this
but these are the ones that kind of
stuck out like me as hey this is kind of
called and then the last forward here I
want to underscore yeah ah very good
very good yes so we're reserving
underscore for future use in lantus
which I was gonna ask the audience again
oh yeah what are you 59 features people
are really looking forward to things
you're looking forward to shout it out
what set that off I don't know what that
is set up is it like is it like a ray
got a slew of okay thank you well the
collection factor methods oh alright
yeah ok maybe we could throw out
requests I want a literal syntax for
constructing maps and things like that I
want a figurative syntax personally my
heart went pittypat watching John Rose
earlier but up for a reason he mentioned
immutable arrays and that's something
that i would very very badly like image
a vm so yeah in the little red ocean of
immutability well yeah yeah because
arrays are really the only way to do
very efficient operations on arm
primitives but they're inherently unsafe
because of the mutability and usually
you know it means you can't share them
basically you've gotta take defensive
copies all the time so that that would
be huge to be able to get some kind of
frozen or amitabh all right that was
quite serious sorry yeah sorry I kind of
I kept looking for that now all right
javed since the java class ii turns out
there's a bunch of JVM languages that
have popped up yeah easily using all
right hey myk's play with Scotland
yeah yeah okay I'm like ah kala yeah
that wasn't fair because dick had a mic
so about the resident a pic yeah okay
that was closure will give me closure oh
ok ok a lot of support for close you are
out there groovy never leave you guys
pretty good yeah they're just noisy I
think JRuby that's sounded more like an
resign yeah it's like that job okay you
caught me Daewon what that means camera
it was that a gathering strangled Jesse
for Tyson how about any J others who's
doing anything any other jbm based
language Jay Charvet shall entitle
choice good lord that's a blast from the
past I'd forgotten all about right
alright what else we got what have we
been doing Carl yeah so I haven't been
doing Java in about three years I had
been I did a bunch at my the company
Matt now for a while built some
frameworks for micro services with Java
but then I started moving into
infrastructure automation been using go
for the last three years and more most
recently I've been working on a game
which is you know PC platform game C++
with lua for the UI so it's I thought it
would be fun working on the game was fun
but I don't know c++ wasn't as fun as I
thought it would be have you put in any
sort of you know like the nintendo
tricks a bab and all that stuff yeah
check to get you give yourself my score
they could share yeah yeah okay all
right up up down down left right left
right ap right so you'll detect a common
theme in all of these bullets where
there's a distinct lack of like core
java development going on which it turns
out was related to the java posse going
away about three years ago we learned
through the process of doing that not to
name your podcast about a specific
language that you have
losing at a certain point in time it got
a little bit silly tour what are you
doing well actually I've write Java all
day long so and I have you have to say
that yeah well because I work on the
tooling I don't know actually
technically work on Android and work on
the tooling for android so you know it's
Android studio and before that Eclipse
so it's all built in Java IntelliJ
though which I work on most of the time
is written more and more in Kotlin and
so I we started right stuff and call in
and I love complet it's really great and
for the podcast part I've been doing a
new podcast Android developers backstage
with this other guy can't remember his
name this guy I was talking to somebody
at a conference a year ago and he said
oh there's this great podcast I listen
to an Android with there's a guy on that
podcast I can't remember what the
podcast is called but there's a guy on
their tour and he used to be on this
other podcast that i really like called
the java posse fought back it was really
awesome ok whoever you were thank you
i'm in my day I'm basically in the same
world as tour I don't write as much core
java I'm not working on the tool so I'm
not writing that stuff we do use the
Java programming language obviously in
Androids so I basically do android and
then occasionally we put out one of
those five tests we do use the Java
programming language TM and I actually
as chapel point out managed to kill yet
another podcast because it looks like
scalawags may not have any more rapid
every now I don't know the job and I
would really see you days fell away it's
not my fault please don't come what are
not careful i'm still doing scholar but
we all got really busy and so the
scalawags hasn't hasn't had an episode
for like six months or something like
that in other news if anyone is even
remotely interested which i doubt i
ended up going back to do GIS work after
like ten years of not doing it which has
been really fun actually so for a long
time GIS was this thing that i thought
was going to be really cool and they
never took off and then google released
google earth and killed it for everyone
else and then all of a sudden it's back
again it's like the new hot thing so I'm
happy about my know what the important
thing is in GIS three most important
things location location location yeah
and Joe who is unfortunately unable to
join us today because he didn't want to
come unable and unwilling who's Jim are
you doing lemon in the line of code in
10 years I don't do this anymore please
don't call me again he rides motorcycles
and he is doing design work or
motorcycles yeah motorcycle company and
you go dune buggies and some mobiles and
the slingshot is loling shot a slingshot
which is pretty cool app you should look
about Thanks yeah we should thank some
very important people today first of all
we've mentioned them before already for
the pizza and the beer free beer thank
you laughing thank you for is the people
that have not joined us for the posse
sessions in dev ox that is actually part
of this tradition every year we would
close the show with one that every year
the last few years we would close the
show with a Java pod see live thing it'd
be very crowded in there atlassian would
supply beer and then it didn't matter
what we said so it's very fun that they
were able to help do the same thing here
as well the more beer the funnier
because everyone who might devoxx
possible which is people who you see
wearing the dev ox hoodies I'd
particularly of course like to call out
and and now driving screen Thank You Ann
and across the farm who we all have a
huge man crush on
and our MC our very own MC chat huh and
anyone you see wearing a DevOps hoodie
please give them argh they made this
possible we love it thank you very much
i'm making for though thank you it makes
it really awkward and sweaty linger for
a really long time until you know it
breaks the personal time barrier thing
yeah there's a huge amount of volunteer
effort going into something like this so
a lot of these people do it because they
really are a big part of the developer
community and they like to help out with
these events so it's not about like a
large paycheck they're getting out of it
they're just giving their time because
they like to be a part of things like
this so thank you indeed and to you the
crowd the massive teeming horde here
thank you for coming and thanks thank
you game sells a bitter end and then we
have to see who won the house um what
was that what was that URL let's see if
anybody got the hand the hackers going
it's going to be as dead we're gonna be
embarrassing you know you know what
it'll be funny if it is I think it'll be
hilarious wait not that one when the
ring in my Road was against doing this
[Laughter]
let's see it's okay it's up to forty six
dollars whoa okay somebody here having a
my glasses on okay uh who's the winning
bidder at forty six dollars i'm gonna
guess Tracy yeah we do that I am wait we
owe them 46 I no no no that they're
actually going to send Carl 46 all up
and then he's going to pass that on to
their boxer kids okay well
congratulations to Wow who who's the
winner who's the lucky winner does
anybody want to own up to it or alright
very thank you oh we make it really oh
whoa it just one up to 50 okay that's
the excitement we're going to have to
