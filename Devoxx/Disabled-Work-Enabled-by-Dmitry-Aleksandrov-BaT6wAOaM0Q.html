you for coming I haven't been expecting
more than three people to show up so I'm
really stressed so many people here okay
so I gonna make it 67 slides in 15
minutes so it's gonna be a challenge for
me and I'm gonna make a social session
and I've never done it because I'm a
teacher guy so one first disclaimer
we're not talking about freelance on
this on this session we're talking about
well remote full-time employees so as
agenda for 15 minutes we'll skip this
one since we're breaking the rules and
actually the idea of breaking the rules
is the idea of 21st century so
everything has changed now and even the
way we work has changed dramatically I
believe so as you see we're gonna talk
about remote work right now as a
solution to a to a current problem I
would say and you may say that actually
not every work can be remote and
probably you will be right yes maybe
that's a good example but not exactly
even now we have a very good idea to
utilize robust and remote works even for
this type or example like surgery you
won't be surprised but there are several
airports which are controlled absolutely
remotely by a different country or city
that made me actually a little bit scary
so and you will probably believe that
programmers and software developers are
just perfect to be remote so and most of
us believe that no typical programmers
day may look like this and you got a lot
of money for that
well now it's actually doing not so much
things so you work whatever you like
you do whatever you like you are free to
travel horrible bosses are far away from
you well you have to work when your muse
is just to come so student programmers
true
believe this thing comes out of the box
for them but it'll be surprised it's not
like this or actually maybe if you work
like this it's not the same so to be
like this you really have to be smart
this benefits ye you have to gain them
if somebody has tried to work from home
before that for more than a year having
actually started in the office
demonstrate a lot of discipline
demonstrate a lot of you know a
liability to your boss you are in a
position that to be able to you use the
Rope work as an option you have to gain
it and to gain this thing you really
have to be predictable so if you
demonstrate predictability in your work
you will gain a lot of trust and
actually to gain this trust this is all
you need to be able to work remotely but
we're in the position when you just
cannot do this just because for example
you cannot reach your office or you just
don't see or you have something else
that stops you from doing this so you
definitely don't have this first step
when you can go to office and gain all
this trust you need so my idea and the
idea of this small quickie is that you
should be given a chance to do this so
you still have to be predictable and
still Trust is all you need so my
deepest concern is that the biggest
companies the big company is actually
not a small one nothing stops them from
doing this so in most cases if you just
talk to a company let's say ok I'm in a
wheelchair
I just cannot go to your office just
because for example we have problems
with transportation we have problems
with you know exiting home I believe
that in Western Europe and
hemisphere in Northwest hemisphere these
problems are not so much viable but for
countries like for example instant
Europe or Asian region and so on and so
on just reaching your work is almost
impossible so the companies should be
able to give you this opportunity so how
do you achieve it in a efficient way I
would say so you will be surprised but
there are really small things that you
need for this so just a messenger like
Skype like a what's up like whatever
like something that can transfer voice
you know just texts and remotes sessions
like remote desktops connections etc etc
some way to communicate in a formal way
for example you have an issue tracker if
you're working as a programmer and some
kind of a knowledge base which is widely
you know accessible from all the remote
connections and a tool like git or
something like this you are already set
that means this is a small set that
actually enables a big a big I would say
a big amounts of really perspective
programmers to join your company the
only thing you need is a really fast
internet in a working VPN this is
something you'll be surprised so I
really have this at home and it's not a
problem but for biggest compass for big
enterprises this is a problem if you are
working remotely and you're big and
surprised actually foresees that most of
the communications go internally working
VPN is an issue so as for me for example
I've worked for more than a decade in in
a big companies VPN was the first
problem I
ever had so and that wasn't interesting
because he for example you have more
than one or two connections to your
company everything suddenly falls down
that's embarrassing but that's true not
all big companies have this ready so and
you'll be surprised but the most of the
resources already are virtualized so as
you come to your work so you access all
of the service you access all of the
infrastructure remotely already so
nothing actually stops you accessing
this thing from your home and by the way
how many of you know that in most of the
companies you have rooms like this
anybody yes just few people who actually
ever used them nobody ok three of you I
was deeply surprised that nobody formica
from the company that I work now from
two systems we have free of this room in
our office and actually most of the
people don't even know they exist so and
this room actually gave us a very good
opportunity to interact so a good idea
is for you to choose maybe you have this
remote co-working space so changing your
culture a little bit may actually bring
a lot of benefits to your company and to
a lot of people because what if a
company goes virtual so you have a big
distributed workforce you've got a
bigger geography of experts by the way
so if you are no longer bounced to a
certain location you can find experts
all around the world so you get a bigger
influence areas so and of course it's
something like cost and time savings is
good because nobody actually loses time
in transportation and in transportation
modern days we use more than you know
hours I like it more for Germany
there's nothing hours but in kilometers
in Germany well people like to
in different in different city so you
know by going through motely you are
allowing a lot of people instead of
standing in this crowds just to work and
not to travel and not to lose your time
because losing their time is losing your
time from the other side maybe you will
lose some social interaction because
there's a lot of you know think like the
the spirit the the building of team is
coming directly in just you know
somebody hurts something somebody
understood something from another making
example of or gaming solution this loss
of accidental communication is maybe a
problem but still it can be easily fixed
just with an internal social network of
flame chats or or actually going to beer
from time to time well at certain point
yes your home may be ruined just because
you're working from them but this can
also be easily solved by for example
co-working spaces if you cannot work
from home and you're far away so
co-working is your option yes and you
see the main idea of this remote working
is all those human interactions are at
some points removed so this means by way
anyone gaming you know playing games do
you know the people who are you gaming
with no you actually just game you have
your enemy or you have your cooperative
you're working to solve this issue to
solve your problem the same with open
source is very hard someone to find the
real person actually committing the code
it's somewhere in the world you don't
care any government human you know it's
Russian it's totally removed as you know
in terms of going so - you don't even
need to know who are you're
communicating with so the ultimate game
is this what the remote work is the
ultimate equalizer so remote work allows
you not to think who is on the other
side with you with whom you are
cooperating so at some point you don't
even need to know whether it's a boy or
girl is a black or white what religion
it you just do your work and you do it
the most effective way so there's a good
success story here it's for example a
github story so then just lets by the
way a very good session so I'm I will
recommend it to you so at some point
these people actually didn't know who
they are but they work on what I wanted
where they want it and when they wants
it so and then we have this awesome
product github people barely know each
other but they have created truly good
product so in Cisco system telecommuting
saved about two hundred seventy seven
million dollars so it was a big benefit
for them as well and they hired people
with disabilities just because they
didn't care who is on the other side so
try it your employees will love it make
a small pool of these people who
actually truly need it because it will
be more fun and you will really gain a
lot of benefits but to do this hire
doers and trust people you hire so this
trust is the very key don't start with
you know arguing just start with your
trust don't micromanage them you know
keep the communication asynchronous as
possible so you don't need to be always
online but you have to define your
protocol on what you do so if you
respond for example in two minutes or
you respond in five minutes or if you're
green you're always able to talk and so
on and so on so define your protocol and
people will definitely love it and
you'll be surprised but now you can even
hire remotely as you know by this movie
all the Skype interviews are just normal
right now and not only you can even
while remotely is you know watch another
movie like up in the air so you have all
the benefits to do this and nothing
stops you so just try this approach and
give a chance to all these people who
actually cannot be your end please that
doesn't mean they will you know start no
walking and seeing again but all these
groups of people will get back to work
this means that's a totally win-win
situation that means that you will
received receive really good employees
which are willing to work I had a chance
to talk to Sir Richard Branson himself
and he gave a wonderful phrase about
remote working and you know people that
work for him so if you give up people to
work they can't even imagine to have
that will become your best employees
there so one example I should mention he
said he went so much deep into remote
working base because he himself works
remotely that he even gave remote work
for people in prison they are not
allowed even to go outside but he gave
work to people in prison and they were
one of his best employees so remote
remote work is one of the good solutions
to people who actually cannot have work
and you are able to give it to him it's
just a small change in your culture and
by this small change even in a small
pool of this you will be able to give
chances and win yourself so thank you
very much hope you find it useful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
