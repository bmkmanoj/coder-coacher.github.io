we hear it devil TK day - I'm with
comments from clever clarify all right
now Clem cloud is there
platform-as-a-service
it started as a platform as a service
but now we are also doing an unlimited
offer from bigger clients like banking
and insurance companies that have strong
constraints on where the data is
actually is so we both have our public
cloud offer and an unlimited solution
and do you think it's clever cloud these
virtual machines instead of containers
that gives it an edge yeah
so basically we're running other people
code so our spreads model is remote code
execution as a service so it we really
can't do stupid things in terms of
security and working with VMs is the
only only good way we know to do that
and at first it it didn't give give us
an edge because people didn't understand
why we would do that and we were forced
to explain again and again why we would
run with VMs and why we wouldn't run on
top of AWS but I think time has proved
that around on a good track so no it's
easier to explain why is it better to
run on virtual machines with the
debatable us oh yeah the main ID would
be that containers they offer a bigger
attack surface since the unlock
containers containers are just processes
with fancy fancy tracking but all in all
a container is a process running on a
machine so it's tight - its tight to
choose the key on stuff like that so
it's a normal process and then you
encapsulated so yeah the attack surface
is bigger even though there is great
work done in terms of combat container
security it's just a bigger attack
surface and there is a coupling with
with a channel which is with which
the big issue with vm's we have better
security and we are decoupling between
the VM camera and the hypervisor channel
it allows us to add a common stuff like
that without touching the answer I think
operators must be biggest acacia trap
that's uh that's a good question most of
the times of bigger secrets biggest a
cottage stresses despise social
engineering and stuff like that our
really simple stupid flows from time to
time there is like the internet is on
fire level breakage like like ugly stuff
like that
and but most of the time it's like an
old issue that has not been patched or
phishing email stuff like that it's kind
of boring actually
but with what lead it was different
because it was it was automated it was
really easy to exploit so that that
could have been a curves that could have
caused a lot of issues thankfully we're
able to patch it really quickly and
reduce the window of service tuner
ability the UDM chief technology
upstairs episode if you've got anything
exciting coming up in the work or
anything that excites you not so much as
the product maybe but in any internal
changes to do right now so this company
grow is growing a lot and I've been
stepping down for from many cutting
projects so I like to cut so it's
sometimes sometimes hard but it's really
trusting to be able to to delegate more
and to to trust people to to do to do
good things but many many things baking
but internally well making big changes
and it's it's continuous improvement
yeah from time to time there is big
migration and we we we can remove an old
piece of code that did its job but no
it's not
for what we do anymore I would say the
most exciting project right now is our
new reverse proxy so it's a new new
proxy that we're writing in rust it's
open source and it's really really
amazing
oh it's called sosam s o value with Sun
get up so if you if you want to check it
out it's a good project okay make it do
it
