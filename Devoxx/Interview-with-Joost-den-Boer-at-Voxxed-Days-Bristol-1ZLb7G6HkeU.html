given a talk about this tu dollar
experience but coming from a Java
background what was the biggest shock
about Scala the biggest shock about sala
that you can do so much more than that
java actually can you give me a specific
example there there are so many so many
handy features available in other
languages like Scala that you just don't
have which makes your code easier to be
easier to understand and also less
verbose and that's also maybe another
thing that you can accomplish the same
same thing with half the amount of code
so i actually found it quite difficult i
had a look at me scala and from my java
brain and it really difficult to be
discarded so how long did it take you to
become familiar with the difference not
really that long because in my opinion
Scala is not really that difficult
they're different from Java and you can
start with Scala almost straight away
with having an experience in Java it's
just you have to write less it's just
that all the additional features that
Scala offers especially the functional
part is where most of the people are
emphasizing on well that is that is an
area the whole functional programming
concept is so much different than the
arrow concept that I'm still learning a
lot about it so that's something you
gradually grow into and you don't have
to get started right away with using
those features but you still can use
scholar and benefit from a lot of other
handy features misconduct
do you think javac relatives should be
learning Scala is a master of extending
their functional programming skills yes
I do think they should learn about Carla
but not just about the functional
programming also just to become more
productive and the 14 all functional
concept is an additional bonus which
which which comes with power which I'll
helps developers nowadays to write
better concurrent applications then you
continue knocking don't you miss about
Java I know there's a lot of things in
this vide Yara so for me for me Scala is
not much different than Java for me
muscala is java version 15 that's
available right now and evolution of
Java I reckon I would it be okay so what
it is three most important things you
want people to take away from you talk
what I want them to take away is that
it's not difficult to get started it's
Carla you don't have to learn all those
functional concepts that you can
accomplish the same thing in in much
less code and more readable code what
kind of application do you write in
Scala perfectly personally I use
colorful almost anything if I have to
start from scratch using a Java library
like a party kennel or whether I
completes do some home automation stuff
at home or I just always use scholar at
the moment because it just allows me to
write less code and accomplish the same
thing Joe Kochi language now yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
