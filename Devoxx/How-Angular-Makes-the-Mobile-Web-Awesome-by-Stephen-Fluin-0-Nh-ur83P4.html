for coming
my name is Steven fluid I am a developer
advocate on the angular team at Google
so a lot of people say what does a
developer advocate what does that mean
so I'm an engineer with really two
missions my first mission is to help
developers organisations companies
building things with angular be
successful and then the other half of my
mission is really to understand the
experience that developers go through
every day when it comes to building
applications I need to understand the
opportunities that they have the
challenges that they face all of the
problems that they encounter so that I
can reflect all of those needs and all
of those opportunities within the
angular team to make sure that we're
building the right thing in the right
way to make angular better and to make
web development better in general so to
give us all a little bit on the same
page I want to talk just briefly about
what angular is so before I even start
here how many people are familiar with
angular ok basically everyone here
that's great to see and now of those
people who are familiar than you were
how many people here have built
something with angular 2 here ok quite a
few of you so there will be a little bit
to learn here because I'm really talking
about how angular plays when it comes to
web applications being run on mobile so
I always want to come back to part of
how I perceive the angular mission and
so there's a few kind of version that
he's running around but to me angular
exists to make building applications
with the web easy and so these words
have been chosen relatively carefully
just because for example you see the
word web in there when I talk about web
I'm saying web technologies so for
example JavaScript es6 typescript kind
of all of these technologies that have
been driven by and primarily used by the
web but not necessarily because the the
other part of angular is that angular is
really meant to be run everywhere so in
kind of the history of angular we had
angular one for a long time one of the
most popular frameworks ever for
building applications but then what
happened was we started building things
at scale companies had not
one or two angular products but had they
had a hundred and things the crack
started to show in angular 1 and so the
team decided that a new approach was
needed a little bit we wanted to take
the same philosophies and so they
started working a few years ago on
angular 2 and so we were fortunate
enough in September of this year to
actually have the the kind of first
final release of angular so we had two
zero zero which we were all very excited
to share with the world and since then
we've seen kind of thousands of
developers millions of developers taking
a look at a new or two and saying hey
what is this how is it different the two
biggest things that I'll call out and
there's there's a number of different
important differences between the two
number one has been a focus on
performance and then number two has been
this idea of Dom independence and so
angular 1 basically did a lot of things
where it would take a string or a set of
HTML and it would pass it into the web
browser and say hey please figure out
how this needs to be rendered on the
page but an important design goal of
angular 2 was that anywhere doesn't just
run in the browser any more we can
actually now run angular in more pure
environments whether it's server whether
it's mobile and then have a render
target that ends that may end up being
the browser but may end up being
something else and I'll get into this
and give a few examples of this so this
talk is roughly gonna have four sections
first I want to talk about the
importance of mobile experiences in
terms of when it connect to your users
and your audience second I want to talk
about angular's mobile ecosystem so
really all of the different tools that
we are thinking about and all of the
things are at your disposal to be
building these great experiences and
then I'll give some guidance in terms of
framework for thinking about how to
decide what you want to do when it comes
to building an application and shipping
it on mobile and then we're gonna get a
little bit riskier we're going to try
some live coding and we'll actually try
and build and launch an application on
mobile so I wanted to start off talking
about mobile experiences so when I first
started talking about mobile more than
ten years ago I had to ask a question I
said how many people here have a
smartphone but I don't ask that question
anymore because that's a stupid question
now right everyone has a smartphone
everyone here probably also has a laptop
and
possibly even a tablet and so I think we
all see these devices and we start using
them and we know how important they are
but we don't often take it a moment to
really reflect on that in terms of what
it means to us I remembered that when I
started using a 10-inch tablet for
example my thought was oh is this going
to replace my laptop and unfortunately
it didn't right and then I started using
a 7-inch tablet I said oh is this gonna
replace my 10-inch tablet and it didn't
what ended up happening was my my mobile
experience my mobile use cases kept
fragmenting further and further where I
would always want to be reaching for the
right device at the right time and
because of the pervasiveness of these
mobile devices that we have often your
phone or any sort of mobile ice is going
to be the right form factor right and
often as developers it can be very hard
to remember that because we use these
devices as users but when we're
developing we're typically building on a
very powerful desktop or laptop machine
and so we have to always kind of Rhian
courage ourself so as a user what am i
doing to make these experiences great
and when it as a user am I going to be
wanting to use this device some of you
in the conference might look a little
bit more like this today playing a
little games but that really comes back
to the idea is we're gonna do what's
easy for us right we're gonna use these
devices and we're gonna engage as easily
and as quickly as possible and so I
talked about this idea of what I call
barriers to engagement so there's a gap
between when you think about wanting to
do something and when you're actually
able to take action on that so a few
years ago before I joined Google
actually I was a big fan of the idea of
Google glass and so I wore Google glass
for about three years and the primary
reason I wore it was because the
barriers to engagement were virtually
non-existent
right so if you wanted to sent a text
message to your friend right now on your
phone you have to pull it out you have
to unlock it you have to launch an
application and then you choose what to
do right now I've timed that on a number
of people and that takes about 14
seconds whereas on a technology like
Google glass that that can take merely
under five seconds and then if you
compare that to a laptop or a desktop
computer we're actually have to go
somewhere physically and make that
choice that can take much much longer
and the importance between 5 seconds and
15 seconds doesn't
like a lot but it actually ends up being
a really big deal because it actually
changes the behaviors that we end up
choosing to do so because you're able to
do something on your phone like send a
message or respond quickly to an email
or check in on a stock price or
something like that you're actually
going to be acting differently on those
things than if you if there was a higher
burden and so you're able to more
fluidly interact with technology and
hopefully more fluidly interact with the
world the second real important thing
about mobile experiences is that you
kind of have to go and meet your user
where they are right got long gone or
the years where we could say hey I'm
gonna build an application I'm gonna say
you have to use this version the
operating system and you have to use
this version of a framework and then go
and run these 17 install steps to go
work an application know we have to go
and meet users now because the user
those expectations are continuing to
change and that this is where this term
that I use tyranny of the user which is
users expectations are very high for us
in terms of the applications and the
experiences that we build for them and
they're not static so the applications
that you were building last year for
mobile or for web they had a bar here
but this year everyone is expecting
those applications to do more to be
faster even when they haven't
necessarily gotten a faster device and
so trying to keep up with those users
can be a big challenge and that's
something that we're trying to make
easier on the angular team another
example of where this this happens this
actually happened to me last night in my
hotel room I exhausted two laptops worth
of gigabit internet in the hotel room
because users on these mobile
experiences don't have the same level of
connectivity that we often expect right
so at the conference here that I've
actually found the internet to be quite
good but at my hotel
it was quite terrible it was fast but
they cut me off after a gig and so that
prevented me from being active in terms
of the ways that I wanted to engage with
the world using technology all right so
now that the bulk of my talk here is
going to be really about the different
ways that the angular ecosystem allows
you to build these sorts of mobile
experiences so I'm going to talk about
five I'm going to talk about kind of
more the pure web so how do we build and
launch applications that are targeting
mobile devices and then I'm going to
talk about progressive web
locations which is a a little bit more
modern way of progressively enhancing
the sites that you're delivering to your
users I'm going to talk about Cordova
briefly and then I'm gonna touch on
ionic and finally I will come back to
native script which it takes a little
bit of a different approach to how we
build these experiences so you may be
asking why only five what about my
framework of choice what about all of
the other ways that we can build and
ship these experiences you're totally
right there are lots of other great ways
to build applications but this talk is
finite and the number of Technology
frameworks is infinite so I cannot get
to all of them in this talk so let's
search first started talking out about
pure web or the mobile web experiences
so this is the idea that we're going to
use the same technologies that we've had
for a long time the web browser servers
and then JavaScript and HTML and then
build those experiences targeting the
mobile user and when you're targeting a
mobile user there's really kind of three
things that you need to think about
right they have a different level of
network connectivity they have less CPU
and then they also have less memory on
these devices so all of these things are
getting better with time but as you saw
in the example before there are always
use cases where you lose these things
and you don't have access to them when
you need and so one of the things to
think about when building kind of these
pure web experiences is how do I dog
food my application so this is a
screenshot of a application in the
Chrome browser if you open the dev tools
there's a nice little icon in the upper
left hand corner that puts it into
device mode and so what this device mode
does is it's going to change the form
factor of the screen to a mobile device
of your choosing and then it's going to
send all of the appropriate user agent
strings back to any sort of server or
into any CSS media queries and then it's
also going to do things like emulate
touch events differently right so
instead of being a onmouseclick right
it's going to be a non touch or non
point using the new pointer api's
there's two other things really
important things that you can do to help
dog food your applications when you're
thinking about targeting the mobile web
the first is network throttling so over
in the top right corner you see no
throttling right there as we all know
mobile devices even when they have
perfect access to Internet connectivity
they're still going to be slower in
terms of their network and so you can
actually simulate very
levels whether it's 3G whether it's 2g
and then you can also simulate various
levels of quality so because not every
HP request that you make is going to
come back successfully you probably want
to emulate hey what if I only ninety
percent my requests come back
successfully another thing that you can
do in the timeline tab in the dev tools
is you can actually emulate slower CPU
so not a lot of people know this but if
you click on timeline in the same upper
right hand corner you're gonna see CPU
level throttling and you can throw all
that back to X 5x or whatever you need
to for your CPU to understand hey my
users have a fundamentally different
experience than I do as a developer how
do I think about that and how do I
engage and take care of that and you ER
when we think about the mobile web the
kind of the pure web it makes the
experiences on mobile devices awesome
for the same reason that I feel like
angular makes the web in general awesome
the first is performance so in in terms
of the shift from angular one day or two
as a lot of you already know we moved to
a directed component graph basically so
we do a single change detection pass
throughout your application and then we
can say hey we know that nothing else
changed there were no side effects of
the change detection pass and we can
kind of be satisfied with that which
means it's really really fast and we've
seen numbers from 5x to 10x for most
applications and you really see this
when you start getting thousands of
elements on the screen so for example if
you're building a dashboard or some sort
of visualization that ends up mattering
a lot the second thing I put on this
list is the idea of material design so
Google came out with these design
standards that they feel are pretty good
and are very cross-platform centric
right so the idea is I want to have the
same type of experience whether I'm
building for mobile or desktop or laptop
or any sort of touch interface or non
touch interface right it's the a unified
design language that makes building
applications a little bit easier and
angular as you probably know has an in
your material 2 project which is doesn't
has over 20 components right now and
it's designed to make adopting and using
those standards easy third we have ahead
of time compilation so once again not a
lot of people knew this in angular 1 but
we actually had a compiler but you it
was very small it didn't have a lot of
sophistication but in angular 2 the
angular compilers is relatively
sophisticated
can say hey your template didn't match
up to some other thing right so if you
built an angular 1 application you'll
often see these problems where if you
miss name a variable it'll just kind of
fail silently and so we have a much more
sophisticated compiler right now but
with that came a little bit of extra
bundle size and so as well as the
performance to interpret these templates
at runtime and so angular 2 one of the
things that is possible and that we
highly recommend is the ahead of time
compilation step which is to say that at
Build time instead of at run time you
take all of your templates all of your
components and you compile them into the
JavaScript and what we do is we take
what was HTML declarative HTML and we
turn it into all of the document create
elements in a VM optimized way that you
can just ship that and you can actually
leave the compiler out of your bundle
entirely and then the last advanced
strategy that really makes experiences
great on mobile is the idea of using web
workers so if you're building any sort
of web application it's typically going
to be single threaded even though you're
doing all these asynchronous calls the
JavaScript virtual machine is still in
lining basically all those things into a
single thread but using a web worker can
actually allow you to get out of that
and because of the idea that now angular
2 we have Dom independence we can run
most of angular in a web worker and then
just propagate back the Dom updates that
need to happen and so that can give you
this ability to process large amounts of
data or to do very complex processing
without interrupting the UI thread right
so without preventing user input from
being successful we also want to give a
sneak peek it's something that we're
evaluating and we're something we're
thinking about possibly doing here which
is the idea of adding our own layouts
library or module which would be a
collection of directives very similar to
what we had any other one that would
allow you to lay things out and
basically be a wrapper on top of Flex
box to make it easier to position
elements and make things flow as you
want them to but the other thing that we
can do because this would be live in
angular and have really be components
and directives and templates is the idea
that we can make it more of an active
responsiveness so instead of just
letting CSS and letting the visuals
change we could theoretically say
if I'm on a mobile form-factor maybe we
don't show some components right so that
if you flip your screen and with the
screen resolution changes we can take a
more active understanding of what that
means within your application and then
propagate that back to you the next
piece that I want to talk about as part
of the ecosystem is the idea of
progressive web applications
how many people here have built a
progressive web application okay a
couple so to understand progressive web
applications I think it's really
important to go back to what a users
expect and what our users really hoping
for every user they want an icon for
your application or website on their
home screen right because they don't
want to go launch a browser and then
figure out how to get to your site and
bookmarks are not very easily exposed or
readily available on mobile they want
notifications because applications
aren't just living when the users
interacting with them but they typically
they're being driven by services that
are running all of the time and so how
do we enable them to be a little bit
more reactive responsive instead of just
being proactive in terms of action to
launch the application in order to do it
and then lastly users want your
application to work offline right we've
come back to this a few times already
but the idea that my network connection
is going to be unreliable and I need to
take ownership and control of that in
order to build a great experience so
progressive web apps handle these three
things in a number of different ways the
first is and a lot of this is going to
be Android specific but it's you know
Chrome Android specific but I think it's
coming to Firefox and I think I
personally have high hopes that someday
we'll come to iOS but the first thing is
a install banner so right now on an
Android device using Chrome if you pull
up a progressive web application that
has itself registered in this way
several times over a period of time and
you indicate to the browser that hey I
actually care about the site I'm a
repeat visitor a little pop-up will come
up at the bottom that will allow the
user to say hey this application has
more functionality and can be a better
experience if you install this to the
home screen of your device and so this
is the the browser's way of giving you
those deeper hooks into the application
from the operating system level at the
heart of a progressive web application
is what's called a serviceworker
it's a little bit like a web worker
which is
a basic kind of second thread with
message-passing but it's on steroids a
little bit so service workers actually
get a number of additional capabilities
that web workers don't have first and
foremost service workers allow you to
implement basically a proxy within your
application that handles all of the
network traffic so that means instead of
when your application launches
automatically going out to the network
to get all of your assets and all of
your data you can actually intercept
those requests and say hey I'm gonna
decide based on the whether or not the
user has internet connectivity and based
on the current state of the application
how do I want to respond to those things
and so one of the most common patterns
that we see is the idea that hey I'm
gonna take all of my assets in my
application write my JavaScript bundle
my HTML my pictures and I'm gonna just
store those in the cache within the
serviceworker so that when that user
clicks on the icon or tries to visit my
website even if the internet connection
is unreliable I'm still gonna be able to
respond to those things and not only is
it an offline concern but it's also a
performance concern because if we're
serving from the local disk of the phone
or the device we're actually able to get
much much faster response times the
second thing that a serviceworker can do
for you is as I said it can register for
notifications so this means that your
application can actually wake up and run
your processes when a user has not taken
a proactive action right so this is the
standard paradigm that we've had in
mobile for a long time of the ability to
respond to an event that's happened on a
server and then engage the user and say
hey this thing's happened what do you
want to do about that so personally for
example I'm a big Facebook user and
about six months ago I actually
uninstalled the Facebook application
because the Facebook application on
mobile is actually good enough now that
you don't need the native mobile
application you can almost use the web
application for everything and so what
that means is I don't need the discs on
my phone anymore I don't have any sort
of battery implications of this
application sitting and running in the
background sometimes but I still get
that same sort of experience because I'm
able to access all the application
functionality and I still get all the
notifications when a friend mentions
mentions me for example pwace are
the exciting piece of technology and
they're really designed to progressively
enhance an application right so if you
don't have a phone or a device that
supports pwas your website is still
gonna function great but it's a way of
adding extra right it's a way of
building that engagement where it's
available with the hope being that it's
gonna be available more and more places
with time but if you go to this URL
Chrome colon slash service worker -
internals on a Chrome browser on your
device you'll actually see that there
are a number of service workers probably
already installed on your device and so
I looked very recently at my device
appear in Twitter whether comm duolingo
these were all web applications that I'd
been using that had installed something
to my device and as user I didn't really
know that they had done that but maybe
I'd seen in the past a pop up saying hey
we'd like to allow notifications or
maybe they're doing some level of
offline caching that I as a user don't
have to think about but still benefits
me at the end of the day and so I
encourage everyone after this talk I'll
pull up that URL and see how many
service workers are already installed on
your device how many applications are
already doing this sort of progressive
enhancement angular when week comes to
progressive web applications we make
this awesome because we we do a couple
things the first is what we call app
shell creation so we give a demo at
Google i/o earlier this year where via a
set of directives that you put on your
templates right so you say app shell on
any of your HTML elements that you want
we will actually then use angular
Universal to pre render a version of
that application with just those
elements because a huge part of building
great web applications especially with
progressive web apps and Service Worker
is this idea of performance and speed we
want the first time to first paint to be
as low as possible and we want to have
this nice experience that maybe it
starts with the right colors and the
right shapes on your screen and then
loads of data as we get more
connectivity as we get more data and so
will automatically generate that app
shell that loads very quickly and looks
good for you and then the second part is
a web pack plugin that actually
automatically creates the serviceworker
for you that will Cashion's
ship all these assets to your users so
more to come on that
in the coming weeks and months the next
ecosystem component that I want to talk
about is the idea of Cordova so Cordova
has been around for a while and what
Cordova basically does is it takes your
web applications and it runs them on a
phone inside of a webview but the thing
that it does that that really helps
build good experiences is that it gives
you JavaScript API s in mobile api's for
all of the things that a phone can do so
when you think about all the things that
I might want to do on a phone there's
camera there's file system there's
databases there's kind of tens of these
different API s and while most of these
are coming to the web in the term in
kind of pure Atmos script style such as
I think the camera API in particular has
gotten a lot better over the last couple
of versions in terms of being able to
point to a file input and saying hey I
need a picture take it from the camera
for example not all of those things are
available and they're not available to
all devices so when you think about
reaching the largest audience Cordova
can be a big win because it can give you
access to those things even on older
devices and there there's even a project
called crosswalk that will allow you to
ship and bundle your own webview so you
can be 100% certain that they the
browser that your user is using matches
the one that you're testing and
developing with another thing that you
can do with Cordova is you can actually
mix and match it with native components
excuse me native kind of Java iOS
elements so think of an example
architecture where you take a native
application targeting iOS or Android or
whatever platform you want maybe you
want to build a native authentication
step and login right so you get that
very smooth first touch experience
pulling in Facebook API Google API has
things like that for that login flow but
then I also want to expose the settings
natively but then for the rest of my
application I want to share that code
with the the backend of my web
application right you can then just
embed a Cordova webview in that part of
your application and kind of the the
handoff will happen seamlessly so if
you're looking to get started with
Cordova it's relatively simple all these
examples are gonna require NPM so based
on the number of hands that have are
familiar to angular I won't go into NPM
very much here
but you install cordova globally and
then you can create a new application
cordova create app - name and this is
something that i've done before and
we'll get into in the live demo and then
i'll show you the next steps and how
easy it is kind of extend that and
connect that to an angular application
angular applications I think in this
really applies to any single page
applications or spas they're inherently
architected in a way that really matches
the mobile paradigm so any single page
application that you build already know
is for the most part about the content
that it's gonna be loading it can say
hey I want all these assets up front and
then it knows how the user is going to
flow through an application and it takes
control of most of the navigation
paradigms and that fits very well with a
mobile application mindset because
that's the same thing that that's doing
the next one I want to talk about is
ionic so ionic is actually a project
from an awesome team that it can visits
us out in Mountain View regularly it
they are built on top of Cordova so
ionic is a few different things so first
and foremost the first exposure a lot of
people are gonna have is their CLI so
ionic has their own CLI that allows you
to build and run applications they also
have their own build environment as well
as kind of this set of back-end services
that try and make it easier to do things
like authentication or anything that
requires a server Cordova can sometimes
be a little bit messy in terms of the
the raw power that it gives you and it
exposes all the 8d mobile api's as well
as its own build process ionic does a
really good job of extracting those
things and making it so that you don't
have to deal with necessarily some of
the problems that Cordova is gonna throw
at you the other nice thing about ionic
is it was actually built for angular so
a group was originally built for angular
1 and now it's got fantastic support for
angular 2 and so what that means is all
of the paradigms that are gonna be used
in ionic and when you build an ionic
application are directly related to it
and work perfectly with this idea of
building an angular application and so
part of that and a great example of that
is the fact that ionic has a set of
components and so they have actually one
of the largest UI libraries in terms of
components that are out there so a lot
of people use bootstrap and things like
that
Bionic can be
also a fantastic choice so this is an
example where they've gone and done all
of the work necessary for your
application if you use their components
it's going to render native-like on iOS
Android and other platforms so here we
have an on list which is their kind of
list view then they've got an eye on
list header and then they've got I on
items and so this is a check box that
not only looks a little bit iOS and a
little bit Android on both platforms but
also behaves like those platforms right
so matching these user expectations on
mobile is a huge part of being
successful ionic was really designed for
mobile experiences built from the ground
up using angular so when you think about
ionic you really want to imagine
yourself building first and foremost a
mobile application that is going to be
cross-platform it's gonna use the web
technologies so all of those components
they are still rendering to Dom at some
level and then running in a web view for
for your users
the final player in the ecosystem that I
want to talk about is native script so I
I'm a big fan of native script because
they they've taken the traditional how
do we apply web technologies approach
and bring them to mobile and they
they've tweaked them a little bit and
they do them a little bit differently so
native script really leverages or allows
you to leverage the angular platform so
you're building an application in
angular for example in the same way that
you'd build any other application so you
get the same change detection you still
get the same graph of components you can
still use modules in the same way so all
of the learning that you're familiar
with with angular works but then instead
of rendering to DOM and instead of
rendering tej to moments they're
actually doing native rendering and so I
have an example of this if my clicker is
almost out of power so to use native
script you actually need to NPM install
native script just like we saw with
pretty much everything else here and
then I'm going to use TNS which is their
CLI and create an application and then
you can throw the dash dash ng flag and
so what that actually looks like under
the hood if you're building an angler
application this should look very
familiar to you
right so we've got the AK component
decorator you've got this
selector so this is how we do component
composition in angular and then instead
of a template that has HTML they've
actually built a instead of a Dom
renderer they've actually built a native
renderer and so what that does is it
takes these elements and instead of
running spinning up a webview within a
mobile application it's actually
instantiating widgets from iOS so if
you've got a text field it'll
instantiate the right iOS widget
instantiate the right Android widget
based on the platform same with their
entire kind of component library but the
important difference to note here is
that once again this looks like HTML
uses HTML syntax but fundamentally you
are not running a browser you are not
going through that Dom layer because of
angular Dom independence so angular
really makes native script awesome by
letting you build angular app so this
idea that you can use all the skills you
know to target these native UI elements
in a way that you wouldn't otherwise be
able to do so I've presented kind of
these five options that have relatively
different implications both for
experience and for development
capabilities and so I have a set of
principles that I want you to think
through when you're trying to make these
decisions
first and foremost come back to meet
users where they are right so if you are
have users expectations that are one way
or another you have to think about those
things so an example of this is quality
of interaction if I'm building a highly
transactional retail application the
expectations are different for my users
then if I'm building a line of business
application right you know line of
business application maybe startup time
is less important because I'm gonna sit
there for eight hours a day using this
device whereas maybe in a transactional
startup time is more important and the
interactions don't actually need to be
as performant and so when you think
about the speed of a performance you can
actually achieve really high performance
and really good interactivity sixty
frames per second was really any of
these approaches but it's sometimes
gonna be easier if you use something
like native script because then you're
relying more on the mobile platform for
handling the rendering and then another
principle to think about is the idea of
code reuse all the developers in the
room here
you all have hundreds and thousands of
features and bugs that you could be
fixing right now but minimizing the
amount of work that you are maximizing
the amount of work that you don't do
should be one of your biggest challenge
there are opportunities and goals right
because if you can develop faster then
your product is probably gonna be more
successful right you can build more
things you can feel better things and
then I was I was speaking with a fortune
500 company last week and I was actually
surprised to hear that they were using
Cordova to actually ship applications
for iOS Android for hundreds of
thousands of users and they didn't have
a single Mac across the team so that
struck me because I've always been you
kind of have to have a Mac and you have
to have a Windows PC if you want to hit
Windows devices and you want to hit I oh
s devices anyone hit Android you kind of
have to have this cross-section of
devices for development but they were
actually so reliant and so trusting in
what Cordova and what coming for example
called PhoneGap was able to provide that
they would build their application they
would do all the appropriate testing
they had all the unit testing and end
and testing doing cross browser but then
the to actually get the IPA to actually
get the binary that they were using on
mobile
they were just relying on PhoneGap to do
all of that that build step and that was
huge right for them because they didn't
have to go and learn mobile right they
didn't have to go figure out how do I
use Xcode and how do I hand all these
provisioning profiles they were just
relying on someone else to handle that
which was a big deal for them the other
thing I want you to think about is its
2016 there was a brief period where and
this was probably 2 3 years ago where
you could ship a mobile application and
not have a web experience but once again
it comes back to that tyranny of the
users users kind of expect more if you
look at all of the Best of Breed
kind of large-scale mature applications
they're gonna end up having both a web
experience and some sort of installed
mobile and in a lot of use cases you'll
still see even if you build the best
installed mobile experience possible
you're still gonna see 70% of your users
using that web experience because people
are gonna send a link right I'm gonna
just switch phones and maybe I don't
have the app installed yet and so I'm
always gonna
we're often going to end up on that
mobile website and so if we can deliver
a great experience for them that's great
right so you're already building these
things if you can take advantage of that
and ship the same code into a different
form factor and get that installed
mobile that can be a huge win the web is
also really important when it comes to
transactional interactions so think
about the way that your users are going
to be touching these applications
because everyone kind of thinks that
they want a installed mobile application
but do they really need one right
because if you're only coming in for
short transactions maybe once a year
type of thing right my dentist I'm
probably not gonna go install my
dentist's application so if they can
build a great web experience maybe
that's that's the right answer for them
and then as I said before there is a
huge psychological perception bump to
this idea of being in the app stores and
being on the the home screen of a device
there was a term that was being thrown
around a few years ago and my home
screen worthy right and we all want to
be building good and applications that
our home screen worthy and so thinking
about whether or not you are home screen
worthy and how to become that way can be
a real important guide to deciding what
sort of technology we should we be using
to build this and how do we want to
build it and then lastly is think about
the skill set from the developers on
your team so this is a picture of the
angular team and a bunch of contributors
in London a few weeks ago and so does
your team already have web development
skills right are they JavaServer faces
developer JSP developers that have been
building HTML and shipping HTML for a
long time maybe it's going to be easier
for them to take advantage of things
like progressive Web Apps and just this
pure web experience and is to take
advantage of something like native
script all right so now we're gonna get
into a little bit of live coding so our
mission here is basically from scratch
I've just scripted the networked
intensive parts we're gonna try and
build a responsive web application and
make it installable using angular and so
I'll walk us through as we go here so
I've done two steps prior to this so
I've run npm install and the
your CLI so npm install' - g angular -
CLI and i created a brand new project
which i called mwa for mobile web app
and so this is scaffold out a very basic
application using the CLI so if you run
ng new which is our CLI command to
create a new angular project this is
what you'd actually get so let's go up
to demo and oh you ain't and let's open
that and let's make sure you guys can
I'll see it alright so this is the the
default scaffolding that you're gonna
get with a annular application so you've
got all the the build things that you
need all the configuration things and
then testing unit testing index.html and
then up here in our source / app folder
we've got really the heart of our
angular 2 application and so I'm gonna
follow a few steps here to build out
this application so the first thing I
want to do is we want to make this
application look okay or maybe even good
I'm not a great designer so lower lower
your expectations just a little bit but
in order to use material design I need
to install material so what I'm gonna do
is I'm an import or improv which ever
comes out I'm an import material module
from angular slash material so once
again this was one of the NPM installs
that I ran before and then I'm gonna add
that to my ng module
I'm gonna call dot for root to make sure
that we get all of the providers that we
need for that alright so with those two
lines I have now basically installed
angular material within my application
and then the the last step I need to do
to install it is I'm actually in a copy
and paste this CSS which does a couple
things if I can find my Styles at CSS
here first we're importing the default
theme for angular material which is
called I think deep purple amber and
then I'm just clearing up some of the
styles of getting rid of the kind of
default margin and padding and then I'm
giving a little bit of margin so that
our application doesn't look terrible
here so let me give that a save and in
the background one of things I'm going
to do is I'm going to run ng serve and
so this is our command at the command
line that goes and pulls into your
entire
does all the bundling steps and then
spins up a web server and then watches
your application for changes so this
should save bundles valid and then we
should be able to pull up in our browser
here localhost 4200 and we should get
app works all right so we have a very
basic application so let's what's given
a name now actually so I'll call this
Cordova demo all right so we have an
application now it runs it works because
of the CLI it's got a new material
design but we're not actually using any
material design components so first
let's go ahead into our HTML and I'm
going to swap out these each one's for
MD toolbar and I'm going to tell it that
it I want it to be colored primary and
this is once again coming from that
theme so hopefully what was just plain
text should turn into a nice purple bar
here very nice alright and then the
second thing I'm going to do is I'm
going to start adding some content so
maybe I want to do a list of people on
the angular team that I might need to
call at a moment's notice so I'm gonna
create a variable called people and I'm
gonna put in an array of objects here
and so we'll just have someone's name so
we'll have Igor here and then we'll have
a description for them come see Igor's
talk later today at devoxx and i'll just
quickly add a couple more people will
say nice girl so we'll give him the
description of founder awesome guy AKA
papa Mieszko and then we'll throw in
maybe Alex what a great developer person
and then I'll throw last here Rob give
him a description of always able to
answer any question you have
all right so now we have that array of
people let's go ahead and start
rendering that out so I'm gonna use a
material design card for this so I'm
gonna say MD card and then I'm gonna
make an MD card for every item in that
array so I'm going to use an NG for loop
I'm gonna say let people a person of
people hopefully my variable is called
people here and then in there let's just
start off by saying the person's name so
as I said it's watching all the changes
that I make and then it's recompiling
them in the background so we should see
a material design card here with each of
those people alright perfect so we've
got your mieszko Alex and Rob but now I
want to actually expose the rest of the
information about them and so I'm gonna
go ahead and add a few other things here
so in the MD card I'm gonna add an MD I
believe it is called title but I just
wanna double check empty card header
excuse me and I'm gonna put the name in
there and I'm gonna have an MD card
content so these are optional parts than
material design library for material
design cards that you can use show their
description and then I also want you to
be able to call that person so I'm gonna
make a fake little button here called
MD card actions and in there I mean
what's that
thank you and so it's actually funny so
we are working on something called
language services right now that are
extending the HTML understanding and
adding semantic understanding so you
should see that soon hopefully where
this will actually use all of its
understanding of your models so your
your components associated with this
HTML and then actually render out hey
this is not a valid property of your
object so that's coming soon it's very
cool we're just trying to make it good
before we release it and then in here
let's make a button and we'll make this
one in be raised and we'll call
all right if I didn't make any other
typos when we save this should refresh
in the background I mean it should give
us some relatively nice-looking cards
perfect so we have Egor Mieszko Alex and
Rob and you can see because we're using
material design if I pop into developer
mode here this still looks pretty good
right this this looks mobile optimized
it doesn't necessarily fall iOS or
Android standards but it does follow
Google's material design which is really
designed to be cross-platform
so from here what I want to do is now we
have a working application theoretically
and it works I'm gonna actually go ahead
now and build this out to a bundle and
then I'm gonna load that within cordova
so I need to make one tweak in my
index.html that allows Cordova's weird
file name rewriting to work and I'm
gonna go in my second tab here and I'm
going to kill the ng serve and I'm gonna
run ng build - - prod - - coyote and so
this is instead of serving it live it's
gonna go ahead and do a production build
so it's going to minify it's gonna strip
out all the comments things like that
and then it's gonna store that in my /d
IST folder which is the default for the
CLI and so on the other tab here what
I'm gonna do is I've already I just
cordova create so if you remember that
command
I ran cordova create and created this
folder and in here it's got a bunch of
different things so a config file so I
just added the name dev ox mobile and
then everything else here was scaffold
it for me including @ww file which I'm
actually gonna blow away right now and
then what I'm gonna do is I'm just going
to link directly to that mlwa slash dist
folder as the www folder and so what
this is is this is a default Cordova
application with a name that I gave to
it pointed now to the build folder of an
angular application that wasn't really
designed necessarily to be installed
mobile but we should be able to make it
installed mobile anyway and then I just
have to do one more thing because
Cordova does not like gzip files for
some reason I have to remove the gzip
files so now if I run Cordova run
Android so I already have the Android
emulator
as to case set up here Cordova
it should take that distributed package
bundled angular application and now
embed it within it Android application
and then run that on my emulator so
let's go ahead and take a look at my
emulator and see if it's there there it
is so now we have a mobile application
running on Android this could run on iOS
just as well with the same kind of
visuals that we saw in the responsive
web but now a user can take that we can
put this in the app store we can user
can install it and they can access all
that those additional API is that
Cordova provides so that was the the
live demo so as I said we built an
application for angular that was
responsive because of our use of
material design and then we shipped it
into the Play Store so that was the last
section here I will be posting all of
the slides here and the source code on
Twitter later so if you want to follow
me at Steven flew in STP AGN that will
all be available and then I think we
have a little bit of time for questions
so if anyone wanted to ask a question
you can come up to the microphone there
on the left or you can come up and ask
me after thank you guys so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
