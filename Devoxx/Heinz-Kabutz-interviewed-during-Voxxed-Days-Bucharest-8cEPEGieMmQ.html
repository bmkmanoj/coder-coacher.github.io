we've roped in Hinds again this time to
talk about the progression through you
know we're not going to talk about well
then it's a good cause we got a wig at a
bit so we searched him we talked about
but from novice to Mars for you thank
you yeah so what is that well you start
with trying to get the stupid program to
compile yeah that's how we all start and
I restart x why does it fly need a
semicolon why doesn't it need us to
makeover I think I started with what
public yeah well that's it well why sure
yeah there's one of those puzzle that
somebody gave me which is print hello
world without using a semicolon how do
you do it well that's the question yeah
do it okay are you just going to leave
that one yes how much anyhow the wolf
jarvan got a good job it can't be groovy
can't be scholar and your java program
to compile run without a semicolon and
print teller we'll all right that's a
fun one so but beside that precise is
City puzzled I was fine that program a
start of the very base which is all my
fault if it's something which is
completely counter to adjust to normal
people yeah and if you sure to fold it
to my mother's gonna go like what is
that you know you guys on drugs or
something so she so we start with that
this pompous a while it sort of the do
world and ways amazing a forever do
while loop on my slides do you're like
why usually do Wow hey well because it
actually fits what I'm doing I want to
do something always at least once not
just Emma and the program is like so
just fall of that and Stefan are we're
talking about the video that's your
lambdas and
the you know there actually is at that
level at the most basic level nada
generic it's the most basic level if you
want to do any java programming not as
you have to understand you know you have
to understand that but yes understand
scream like that you lost you will not
understand anything is going on so
that's no longer like that foreign stuff
that's the beginners stuff the most
basic lip is lambdas for loops variables
fields what is it local over what is a
parameter one of it that's the most
basic stuff i think i'm still at that
level i will are a better than at some
point and then above that we go to data
structures and all good and those are
very important that's so stuff you'll
learn if you're going to a bit more
formal computer science education and
learn about you know what is logarithmic
complexity what is linear complexity i
was looking at the apple language Swift
near language and what's quite
interesting as it in their data
structures they have immediate access
only what the what the complexities of
all the different functions so they'll
say accessing gears or the end or
sorting this is order n times n when
evidence or searching as login whatever
so that is it's not as base because i'm
trying to get my code to compile but if
it is still fairly basic for Vinny basis
if so you know you're getting a lot of
winds out of having good old with
formalin then trying to paralyze or
trying to you know come up with reactive
system any of that you all rhythm just
going to be more powerful than anything
get a good one and began to have fun
Joyce bad one going to take forever yeah
oh we talked about about this fork toy
thing before and whether the first
algorithm I had would have taken ten to
this 200 years to complete very very
long time do we have a character well in
serial sex o'clock might take longer for
sure that the feet of we'll never know
and if you were to paralyze if you would
maybe get
four times faster five or ten thousand
sixteen times fast if anybody calls it
good but you're never going to get it
that much faster from tee to the 200
years at the 40 seconds I can have this
problem so your algorithm is always will
you stop and then above that is another
level once you've mastered algorithms
and data structures as we look at the
design of the application the long term
impacts of the application what is it
what's the cost going to be off the
technical base that you put into the
system and how can you change it future
how can you reuse parts of this building
for extensibility you can get yourself
horribly wrong with that because it's
very hard to predict the future and so
people change sometimes over engineer
and I'm partially German so Germans are
very good at a visionary stuff you know
as you know if you take any German
products like completely over genere and
it softly that we tend to do the same we
could have also partially German that
sometimes we be over here stuff we over
to science so it's interesting I I kind
of think I suits this you can film
interstellar yeah you know at the ends
where he's suspended in space in the
multi-dimensional library and the books
of culinary climbing space it does feel
like there's a kind of something through
timely basic cuts to those levels
because I know at various points I've
looked it I mean I definitely look at
the house compile on a regular basis but
I've definitely looked at all of those
levels or is if I had to categorize
myself I put myself right down at the
brushes I'm sure that's not quite true I
think you I think you're not giving
yourself enough credit it looks
constantly can't go to be later I'll say
linear if I do have some idea what I'm
talking about like many regression you
know that like if I'm searching for an
item in a list for want to make sure
that the item is not there I've got to
go through the whole list too yeah make
sure Libya both of the tree is the
binary search yes you've heard about
this yes so you not right at the bottom
I mean
he was also quick okay for them I don't
feel like those levels of segregated I
feel like you can maybe you can swap in
and out oh yeah you need to so what I
find is that a lot of programmers they
they stayed mostly the lower levels
where they're just happy with the chrome
composite I can go home yes they don't
take the time to think how could I do
this better how clear do this with the
nest code most of the time when i add
functionality to earth to existing code
i end up with Miss code at eight so I've
added work at a function at the ends are
produced the code base as opposed to
what motivated the copy and paste the
code and changing variables and end up
heavy mortar and the problem is having
more code that there's more code to
maintain yeah it's one of the best
things I learn actually why the
beginning of my career had a really good
mentor there's the best code is the code
that you don't write you'll never write
anymore code and you absolutely have to
absolutely and that's actually quite
quite a nice lesson we think I've can
relax I don't get a piece of people who
live 2,000 miles of connectors so what
you know I don't we write negative
numbers so that's you know my opinion is
to it if I can reduce the codebase
substantially to be much better than
having you know thousands of lines and
chest against to maintain must like
about this and thessalonica and other
events and I looked at different
characterizations of people and some
people are lazy in a good way and others
are laid in a bad way though they're
there are three characteristics of a
good programmer one is nativist are the
one is impatience and the third one is
hubris interesting life but not my ideas
from from some famous guy that I can't
remember now that's those three and
laziness is the characteristic that you
need as a program because you need to
think how can I save us off work in the
future I cannot avoid having to do this
over and over here yes
and so the one lazy programmer will go
copy and paste or because exchange a few
variables but that's lazy in a bad way
that's a really bad lazy because it
means all the bugs that you've produced
on our duplicates of over again yeah so
if you need to fix the bug you got to
fix it in 10 different places it's got
mostly paints apainian same bug that
repeated copy and paste give people
advice too and the the second type of
program of is not lazy about is the one
who goes and types everything over again
you remove the wheel every single time
that is also going false prophecies you
going to waste a lot of programming
effort in doing business you work with
which has been done before almost a
third type of laziness a good lady all
right well you can't be looking at today
you know I've done this not twice and I
are then a third time but before did the
third time is there a quick way that I
can optimize it but enough to do the
fourth time this is a constant its
constant way of thinking it's not
something which you which is take off
when you stop program it's a life it's
the last way of thinking how you think
of the person how can I avoid having to
do this this job urban over again so how
do you people advance from the first or
second stage all right first a second
stage there are a whole bunch of good
books you can read on on data structures
and algorithms think of that is of
course the classical art of computer
programming which I I don't want to
recommend because it is incredibly hard
to read but interesting Lee it's used
it's referenced quite a few times in the
JDK all right but I just want to see how
does a threadlocal work do you think
it's worth reading even because it's
difficult then it's something which
which you should do at least one as a
programmer
ok I've got I read it once when I was at
University and I bought a copy it's like
the thick 3 vil three or four volumes on
my home whatever time I probably will
never read it but if they can say ever
have nothing else to do I'll read it
again but but I've interesting because
there are three local it's like a class
which you might never think about that
actually inside there is a special hash
table are they using the gold ratio
which you'll find inside auto computer
program all right okay for the way they
do the distribution inside the hashtag
the people who don't know the golden
ratio is most commonly found in
classical art right the compact is
somehow related today I caught them as
executive exactly tell us what it's like
is it some calculation number to make
sure that the numbers are water species
that's interesting so actually asked the
computer programming what's nice the
next one you have to read is the Gang of
Four design patterns book what a stack
of books like this on design pizza hut
and they're not bad but the one that you
have to read as a programmer is Eric
Eric gamma at all gang of four the
library even if it's got p plus plus and
small token a third party of Java but
it's like 20 years old so funny vanity
book but that's like the foundation of
of all the other books have been written
about that so if you don't read that
book other books will obviously make
sense first love other books spent don't
have very good explanations or fourth
day huh so that money has to meet at the
program on the books which are found
breeze feels like the pragmatic
programmer yeah it's very good then sign
which I like a lot is hit first design
purpose I like the head so serious it's
great yeah yeah I've got head first java
as well I think I like this it's very
acceptable it under interesting
discussion of the job of champion
analyst at the moment about what tools
authors used to write books and write
some guys like as latex beyond baymax
later yeah and and one of the head first
authors said you know the problem is
doing that you make yourself you make
your life easier the writer author but
you're pushing the efforts the cognitive
effort on to the reader yeah and I think
that's very true I think what's
happening is that most books to pick up
that all looks the same certificate of
us all of the same they look like the
university thesis even that's really
what they are yeah they are it's like
all over the show and you can't do that
reason with latex you need a different
tool for them problem is that very hard
to find to like that because there's no
market in those tools somebody's got to
build those tools like Adobe used to
make their store but what it's make
those tools but those tools are not very
popular because people don't want to pay
money to write books there is no money
in writing books yeah so why would he
pay for to it without the tool the books
can look terrible so people went by it
and it's a vicious circle but from so
the right person hit for Samantha's
great book and then the next day of love
horses concurrency and reactive systems
those those two together they're a bunch
of books for that as well I tell us your
huge necessary yeah but hundreds of
articles are written about java java
special for the year to tourism budget
stuff no i'll have to talk again when
I've read all of the book so 2025 is
that good for you yeah i mean i'm not
sure what well because i'm sure i can
make some height
key box food or something yes okay well
I wouldn't say no space i will see
whether or not Stefan's got it in there
in the budget oh thank you very much I
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
