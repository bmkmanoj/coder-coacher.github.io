talking to Chris from Twitter
sorry maybe one day you're talking about
swishing and growl so girl is a run-time
no no so maybe you should tell me all
about it yeah maybe I should
so hotspot the JVM in in the in open JDK
there is something called cheat
compilers it's basically the compilers
that compile Java bytecode to native
code that's then executed just in time
right during runtime and and growl is is
a JIT compiler and the main difference
between the existing ones and growl is
that so the existing ones are called C 1
and C 2 and they are written in C++ but
growl is written in Java that's that's
the main difference and it's just a
different approach of doing it and it
has advantages but also disadvantages
and I never really worked on a project
that was never part of Oracle labs but
I'm involved with the project for many
years now and I'm just trying to push
the project because I think it's the
future
ok so compared to the C 1 and C 2
garbage collector no how does it work
well so the way it works in the che VM
is we have to add since it's written in
Java you know with the C++ written ones
you just compile it when you compile the
JVM and they're just linked in and
that's how it works with growl it's
slightly different since it's it's an in
Java it needs an API to talk to the VM
and vice versa the VM needs to tell
growl hey I want you to compile that
method and so we introduced something
called
JVM CI which means JVM compiler
interface in in JDK 9 under chapter 43
and and when you have JDK 9 today you
can there's actually a gray version in
JDK 9
but you can also download like a an
up-to-date version from github and build
it and then run it with an existing JDK
you mentioned some of the advantages and
disadvantages what are some of the
advantages of the growler
it's it's much easier to understand it
has to do with c2i I go into that a
little bit in my talk it's c2 is very
old so the code is very complex it's a
good compiler but the code is very
complex and and it's written in C++ and
and these days you know I haven't been
at the University for a long time but I
think these days they're not really C++
courses anymore but people still do Java
right it's maybe work with the young
kids it's an old language by now but
it's but it's something that's still
taught so it's just the the access
accessibility or you know it's just
easier to approach crawl then then stand
C - that's one of the main advantages
what about the disadvantages
disadvantages are it's like the biggest
advantage is also the biggest
disadvantage is it's written in Java so
that means you have to basically it's a
meta circular problem right it's written
in Java but you run on top of a JVM so
if you just there's something called the
bootstrap involved because as soon as
the compiler starts working it's it's
Java code itself so it gets hot itself
and it compiles itself so if you have
this bootstrap going on that's one of
the big issues which can be solved with
a ot compilation you can put it ahead of
time like which we did there's an a ot
feature now in jdk 9 exactly for that
purpose and then if the second biggest
issue is it's it's using Java heap
memory to do compilation right it's
allocating from the Java heap so we need
and we don't have a good solution for
that yet you need some type some kind of
heap isolation between the compiler and
the application the the worst case that
can happen is if that part is actually
add manage as well because you can in a
in a container world you know you
memories being used anyway with c2 as
well it's just native memory and you
don't see it and you can't really
control it that well with growl you
can't control it because it's part of
your childhood but it takes away from
the application at least when it's
compiling not all the time but when it's
compiling in the worst case that can
happen is that you compile a big method
takes a long time and you get an out of
memory in your application that could
happen so we need we're still working on
this but we need some kind of a heap
isolation between the two thank you very
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
