you in a very interesting topic one at
least for me is very interesting and I'm
very passionate about it which is the
legacy code which is probably not what
you associate with something interesting
so how many of you have heard that one
field development okay so this is
probably what the spitter technical but
brownfield in is a technical term in the
building industry that means 111 to
build something on a field that that
does something before but also in our
inner kid at least in London is a common
term that means imported that is not
from scratch which will be the
greenfield development but they say
product that they basically will ever do
build a future of something that is
already there and probably not in the
best of shape and when people are
usually heard about brownfield
development basically they just go away
so when there is the interview people
are very scared to say something about
but well that was until I went to Japan
and I founded this very interesting
Japanese a tradition that is basically
if you break a copper something valuable
instead of throw it away or instead of
to do some kind of transparent invisible
fixture which for sure one will be not
invisible
you kind of a emphatize ID that fact
that the object was working and then you
repair and this is a is a story with
about Japan and his favorite carp or
something like that and in I mean this
is a
kintsugi it's coal and it's a Japanese
older tradition but okay the delicious
very interesting and you can study about
it
what I wanted to talk about today is
that is that this kind of made me think
that maybe we can do something similar
with our code no I mean not something
that we can put in a museum but at least
try to fix things before throw it away
and what is the ideal state the other
state of our budget will be something
like the the blue cover something like
that
every time we add a new feature in our
project they will take more less a kind
of constant the time would be a little
more little less but more less a future
or lesser the same content if I wanted
to add this feature today or what we've
added in next year you should take more
less at the same time this is the idea
in the reality was happen is that as the
department became more complicated
adding new feature became more slow and
it take more time and it's very costly
so at some point someone will say okay
let's cut to the gloss and start college
but let's discuss about the common
problem of a legacy system and I mean I
think a you know more less what do we
intend with legacy system so how many of
you work on the legacy system of course
hopefully not 100% but I think we all
know I mean at least our IT professional
with a bit of experience of experience
know what is working in obsolete
technology and all legacy system tends
to have
more or less a similar problem and that
you know the technical debt idea so how
many of you know about the technical
idea of technical debt is something like
you've read the code and you try to do
the best code possible and at some point
someone the manager came and say yeah we
don't have done you have to deliver now
otherwise there will be no day after
tomorrow so we have to do it by tomorrow
and so you say okay I can do this stuff
that is really bad but we have a to fix
in the future so you kind of accumulate
a kind of interest on the petticoat and
this is what the scholar the bigger
technical but for legacy system and the
technical that is so huge that you
basically don't care anymore because you
say there is no way we can repay this so
let's just go on and sometimes I mean if
you is in a bad situation but he was
good I mean the original system was a
good system for what was supposed to do
but then you know people get carried on
and other stuff and stuff and then this
also bring up a kind of a situation
where you don't care about safety
anymore you just say whatever it works
it works
don't let's get stuck in the
technologies security or stuff like that
it worked ok let's let's put the
production and there is a reason of this
and the is called the law of important
windows which basically say that if you
see
building with nice you probably don't
want to take a stolen bike on Windows I
mean it's not something that normal
people will do but if you see a building
very abandoned with 90% of the window
spoken and there is just one intact
panel I mean it's very tempting to break
also that because hookah said you know
and so this is a great integral about
the grade and indeed legacy system we
have what is always cool I mean I work
in a project where basically every
single week there was a p1 I mean it was
in a big bank in financial sectors or
something with a lot of money and the
software was making a lot of money so it
was really important I said every with
single week there was some property one
I mean some parks that really create the
problem with the business that William
awesome and was active every week and
every week everybody seems completely
surprised
Wow how can be possible I mean it was
symulast week yes it was a completely
fine okay but yeah and then I surprised
her on the cell callus remover this
project from the stack and then nobody
really close can we cannot whip we don't
know because the system is so
complicated that maybe someone it really
really wanted to that water so this is
the situation I think we are on the same
page and so what is this usual situation
okay
let's rewrite it let's watch the Shannon
a new yeah I mean my daughter I really
like this movie so
- but I wish you that because something
is new will be better
I mean sometimes is not that you need
the atomic bomb just to get rid of some
bugs
and also there is a kind of a feature
creepin tendency so when you thought to
do something you the people say we can
add another thing so to that we didn't
before and then also of course you're
rising something new but then you put
some okay it's new let's put something
temporary there and then you kind of
forgot and this is a whole stuff that
happens every time so quite something
new and I mean it's also quite sad but
it happens but then you will feel poor
data that you got attitude white
molested the half of the project that I
decided now really really this project
is not cutting we have to shelve it and
fixing the old one because of the new is
not going to work and so what you do now
you cannot do the finish then you are
not because it's not working and that
the old one is very very that you hate
it in the meanwhile I mean I've been in
that situation so maybe and every time
this is a bit when we start thinking
about a reply to do what is always very
attractive but there's always this
tendency to underestimate how difficult
is to apply something because we have a
old system that is working and the old
system occurred is clearly crap because
we didn't write or maybe wind it right
in the path of it's bad and it's working
so I mean if those are terrible
programmer able to do we can definitely
do better but this is a kind of bias
because it's in that situation but it's
still working and
absolutely not given that we are able to
to write it again and then there is
always the data equation which is always
underestimated it's like and no matter
how much you estimate for the data
migration the data migration will take
more even considering that you know
about this so the idea is a something
different so let's change our
perspective
let's change how we look at the legacy
code so they get the C code basically is
a code that it works it works and it
give a value to the business and that
those two things are really really
important and the so it's kind of scary
I mean you can have all the problem but
if it's not working it's not legacy code
it's just something that you want to
throw it away
and don't forget about but if it's
working and these small s is sustaining
the business like was in the example
that I did before that every week but
you're still working I mean you were
still making money must have done so
it's something that is really valuable
for sale and instead of revising
continue we can take a kind of a page
from the Boy Scouts and trying to do
something better with it and so instead
of us looking at the big right we can
stop thinking about the progressive of
why when we want only to fix one thing
then make it work and then fiction
and every step because the big
difference is that we wanted for have a
step that to be able to stay alone so we
do step one and then if step one is okay
enough we can live with this
it must have not a temple solution it
must be something that it works for sir
the problem with this is that sometimes
the takes longer than just on the paper
at least that just a straight white
because you have to take a lot of
complicated part but the big advantage
that will be safe because I with a man
you can stop and by the way this is in
Japan and I really have no idea why why
they decided to cause a water in this
way I thought that is very good but this
is yes kind of aesthetic so for example
the bit of classic honor our high tea we
have a choice ever application with our
goal and we wanted to put something new
with you I done in JavaScript running on
Cassandra
so how we do that I mean is doing that a
revised from scratch from the beginning
is very risky so my idea is that we can
for example take the current application
open a REST API on the current
application so we keep at all the logic
in the current application and we just
start to write in a new UI so we will
keep at the current application without
using the UI and we use JavaScript that
speaker with the girl
once we are kind of happy with the
JavaScript part we can start overwriting
a new back-end and then when we have add
a new back-end that is able to manage at
least one user case we can start off
split in the UI that goes a bit of on
the old on oh we can also do another way
we can keep at the current application
and start to flatten the new back-end
instead of are going to work on let's go
to Cassandra and bit by bit
transfer the backend and when we have
the pequeña we start working from time I
mean we can do but way across each
application has a different requirement
but that's the point not looking at the
legacy code as a liability as a problem
but looking at the legacy code as
something that is a treasure that we
just have to fix and make it shiny
because the big problem is that while we
have a legacy code and we cannot touch
the code that is really a bad place to
be but if we can improve we can do and
okay that was a big variety but there
could be also less drastical case in
which we don't have a to change and
completely the architecture of the
application but we want only to change
the decoder I mean we're kind of happy
with the application with the main
technical choice but the code is
reliable and so we want only to a factor
the code but when I was basically
preparing the slides I found this little
difference that if you change the code
in a in a way that they improve the code
is not simple factoring it's a kind of a
coda rejuvenation because you wanted to
fix bugs you don't want to exactly 100%
respect that equipment the behavior
you wanted to do something better so it
is a kind of a coda rejuvenation so you
apply new pattern to decoder you try to
simplify you try to avoid box but to
keep in the main domain is crazy
so the idea is a change in the I mean
forgetting about the total rewrite and
the small fix that
that's tape you know that small fix that
just a broken windows just okay let's
just fix Windows maybe with cardboard
and instead start thinking about the
it's just a kind of mental change called
rejuvenation and then we can discuss
this is a kind of open discussion we
wanted to write I wanted to rejuvenate
it well it really depends if we are able
to those are a bit of suggestions but if
we are able to revise something in less
than two weeks for example that probably
means that we know what we are talking
about because we if we estimate the
bottom two weeks probably we don't
really know what we are talking about so
if I we can do at least a single step in
two weeks
okay probably is faster to just provide
identities but you know when I was a
young Paloma I was in this company she
was still in Italy and there was another
young programmer it was a bonus or lucky
and we were given the task to - a factor
to rejuvenate the some code and
basically he spent a week on a function
that was a fact very complicated
function that couldn't
really understand so say okay you can do
that and spend one week on that function
and he said it's too complicated to fix
so I'll write and in a bottle function
one week and the cool thing is that the
new function well the dual factor was
working fine in like nineteen ninety
percent of the cases but there was one
two or three cases basically out of and
I swear it was failing and a new
function curiously was working fine
ninety ninety percent of the case but if
you drink a certain dose it was not
working and he has no idea why
so we've already completely is not given
that yeah why even if you know the other
stuff that happened before and curiously
when I'm talking about this tougher to
other colleagues that this conversation
really really kind of happened all over
again and someone a was complained to me
how you like it like a saccade know I
hate legacy code our legacy code is
terrible but is critical for business so
we cannot throw it away and say okay do
you know but you can rejuvenate you can
improve our existing code yeah yeah I
know that I can show you how I don't
need any help with that we absolutely
not how to do that so you can start to
rejuvenate oh no no our code is
impossible to touch and I have this
conversation over here so I I did this
talk because I really think that no it's
true I mean if you really don't want to
believe it's your problem but it's true
that you can really rejuvenate any
possible code at least I never found a
kind of code
you really cannot improve but so let's
go on something technical now these are
a bit of anti patent which are kind of a
classical for legacy code and you may
have heard of home anyway stuff pipes is
probably the most typical we're
basically in the bigger legacy system
you have a lot of a copy paste basically
stuff that is almost identical apart
from few key things that does almost the
same things over and over again because
of course when someone say okay we also
need for the power work in a financial
need someone skin mister we need also to
work on swabs what a swaps out the world
I smoked like an option but the with
this and this and this and different
okay let's take at the option code copy
paste and then rename to swap okay tell
me wherever to change and Epson all the
time so this is how legacy code and then
there's a lava flow which is another
thing than some pointer someone say we
have a to clean up at the stuff let's
bring everything to XML because XML will
sure give us the solution you start
translating everything to XML and at
some point someone schema say XML is so
old I mean we have to switch to JSON I
mean come on guys you cannot still use
an example okay let's start the
rewriting all the XML specific code to
JSON code and the mullahs in the middle
someone can say cheese' you're still
using just now you have to use Yammer
necessary right away from Yemen is so
much cooler than Jaisal
and so you have a bit of code that is
using configuration in XML someone that
is taking a parameter in general stuff
and yeah another typical is the shotgun
surgery which is when in a sense is a
bita that the opposite of the stove
stops so it means that there are a few
clinical functions which are malicious
everywhere so every time you don't know
add a new parameter to some input you
haven't to other these new parameters to
half of the of your code because it's
used everywhere
I mean it's using some method which are
used everywhere so you have to manage
these new fields in a lot of place that
they really don't know what to do with
that field and ideally we should say
okay if you wanted to fix a bug only to
touch one module one class in a module
one method in one class or something
that is cohesive but in a legacy season
sometimes you really have it touches so
many things just to fix a single things
and the opposite is that yeah the
classical to go to class when I use that
have been classes so big because you
wanted rather if you want to put
something specifically and you say okay
I don't have a determined to factor this
I don't have to tend to rethink the
architecture just as other this 50 line
of course one other line so-called stuff
like that you have metals of a thousand
class of more than 10,000
okay one little suggestion a friend of
mine wrote this book which is really
really good and basically the idea is
that if you you have a key to grab some
flash or whatever and there's a lot of
social information associated with the
code and if you have a for example to
explain to some manager while you have
it to do an effect
Oh exactly also the opposite that you
are kind of support either you want to
check that the team will factor the
piece that is really critical because
also sometimes people just like Kota
just for factoring sake and basically
this there is a lot of information on
this book about how to pick up the right
piece of code which is more critical
because you will see that I mean
basically scanning a ticket logs or some
fashion locks you see the piece of code
over so many people are working on and
visually those are but let's say that
okay we dentists I what do we want to
say and how we do the factor and then
you should take any books about of a
factory you say it's very easy if you
wanted to do some factoring first of you
write to your unit test you put
everything you want or a factor under
unit tests so you are sure that you're
breaking anything and then they had this
nice server factoring patterns okay
that's nice but how we can put on the
test if we don't refer to the code
because our class is not exhausted the
we can I mean in my case all my classes
they cannot just take if I they started
from unit test from the beginning
it's okay but if all the classes I
cannot ever put them so we have a kind
of a catch-22 situation the idea of
catch-22 was a nice novel and basically
it was a bomba in the second world I
mean a pilot of a bomba and of course he
didn't want to fly so you if NEMA crazy
you can avoid it to flood the public
would be stupid put the crazy guy on
pilot but if you wanted to avoid the
world you are not crazy by definition so
this is what and this is the kind of a
similar situation and basically working
on this tougher I came up with a bit of
a suggestion which I call a chemical
rejuvenation and the main ideas that we
wanted to take our called seal splitter
in modules and then a clean up a slice
of the code which is small enough to be
and what I call a chemical well it was a
cool but also I was reading this box
which is another nice book if you are
interested in science history and
basically the idea that I can ask me in
the middle age and beginning of arena
science was a really played in hydro
science and I was able to do very
complicated experiments and their
scientific former was not completely of
basically there was thinking that all
the methods was a kind of degree of
purity so you can take a kind of impure
metal and then clean up and deplete all
the fast
impure which are not pure and basically
come up with the finally with the gold
which at that point of a portal I see
was kind of was a testable session that
also give us a lot of our chemical
experiment and was not completely stupid
idea to start with and so I mean this
idea of purification our coda
I like so
simplify your body this is something
that when you have a Legacy Project and
you wanted someone to to work on inter
this is always something that people
forget about because if you have a to
work on a legacy project sometimes it
took us weeks to be able to touch the
code just because you need a special
environment you need a special setup in
the IDE sometimes you cannot work from
the IDE you need some tools you need
some special other some special machine
and it's an idea and but it doesn't have
to be I mean there is no way why if
someone with the good legacy system
knowledge can set up
I mean can be a docker image with a
machine possible can be just a few bash
scripts something that you take a new
guy
Your Honor this wiki page do everything
that is that are you able to touch the
code this is very important because
makes everything so much easy
and that you needed to have a ended 20
test and under turn the test what I mean
here when test is that something you
take the system that we are talking
about something that must be monolithic
application a bunch of services or
whatever but without anything that we
don't care about and with all the stuff
that we care about and just to look at
what is at the important without the
other
I mean output can be fighting on being
can be fighting on sister bus input can
be you I can be trusted by message
assistance but what do we want to do
basically is having some test that this
important is this impetus this output
and it will be nice if the input is
something that makes sense like user put
some - fraction and the result is that
these lines on the tables are created
this is kind of a nice situation because
we have a use case or with the test
sometimes this is not really possible
because the system is so complicated
there are so many system report so you
just take a dump of what the inputs are
and you have a dump of the output and
the students are completely unreadable
for you months I mean doesn't make any
sense
but we just wanted to preserve the state
I mean to shoot that this is what the
dual system does so we can make sure so
this cannot be as normal now what I want
to point that I want to make is that
okay you start this process you first
tell you did that the simplify the
access to the recorded second your white
intestine it takes time I mean you can
also take some weeks to do this but you
don't have to see these weeks as a waste
at a time not even investment time
because you already have a very
good article so after these two weeks
you already have something that you
prefer didn't have you already have a
because you have a some test that before
you didn't have so you can run this test
even if you don't do any other of the
steps of this process you already have
the test so you can already have a some
value that you before they don't have
and you can help you and you have at
your boarding process that also help you
so it's okay you can take one week you
can take two weeks you can take you know
mouthing a big project but you already
have something that is actually useful
so for the business but okay
then once we have this we can finally
touch record but before doing some real
improvement we are able to take a small
chunk of code that's something that we
want to work on and when we split the
modules remember like an onion always
split vertically we don't want to have a
UI module domain module persistence
model we want to have a I don't know
optional module security model
everything that is vertical that goes
from a UI to to persistence to to define
a lot
there could be some because of some kind
of shared library for the persistence
and whatever but each of the modules of
our application must be completely
independent I mean you can have some
for example this module to do where he
complicated financial product is calling
another module to do a simpler financial
portal but just call the module at the
beginning get to the results at the back
and the keeper processing it's not going
inside the model so they can call each
other but on the other top level and
when we have our small module okay this
is something that we can finally enjoy
yourself when we clean up
so basically this is a visual recipe and
this is more acid area but each step
notice that you can step on this test I
mean you you don't have a timer to split
completing the module okay you still
have a sample value you have only to
split to one module okay you have a
still some value you can do other stuff
but one you want to do and of course if
you just have a to add a new feature
once you clean up a single module you
can add that feature to that module and
close it and maybe you don't need to
touch that application for another year
but if after one of the year when
someone want to touch something else you
can just do step this i should kind of a
stop at the low important windows
because you started to bring up things
and yeah so I love present here for
simple techniques and then everything if
you don't understand the code ever
finish the episode so first day is a the
first step in alchemy was put the fact
in the Detroit game so let's put a
factor these singlet us we don't want
singles and for signals here I mean some
object which are shared between modules
I mean I tell you I don't really want to
singlet on ascent modulus 8a but that's
not a big deal there what is really
important is can I mean if you have a
independent module there cannot be some
objects that are causing all the modules
directly for stuff that really have it
to be used for the modules for example
database connection can be you have you
can use something like an upper context
pattern that basically you give it after
the up context at the beginning of the
module and then set the model you just
touch the of context but then you can
decide exactly what they can be done or
not done by each model so this is the
first step which is more or less
automatic I mean you just have to look
at their most of these steps should be
something that I mean IntelliJ should be
able for support to a factor of my
dreams
and so you don't really need a unit test
for this tougher because it's almost
automatic you just substitute the world
I find another fancy and so this is a
bit more difficult so basically okay we
wanted to create a new module and I
assure you I'll show you some code
example and so basically this was almost
almost I mean and the problem was that I
wanted to create a new module from the
stuff but I don't wanted new border I
don't want the new modules to have
anything to do with the connection and
config manager here the config manager
was to itself configuration and
connection was the connection DB the
stuff I don't want them in the new model
but all the rest of the execute method
yes I wanted so what remember that we
have this kind of I love a mock testing
but we don't have any testing at this
point of our factory so we we happen to
do very slowly and very precisely to do
some change of Dakota because we don't
want to introduce bugs
so basically the idea is that we create
a new interface the one on the top left
data context and this basically this is
a idea of the application context so we
have this interface that will remove
from our module the stuff that we don't
want to look at and when we introduced
the new interface basically we created a
new interface and then we don't touch
the actual code because we just created
the interface we put the stuff inside
the interface and and record the code as
before then we want to actually okay
data is a first step but then we splice
okay why we are passing config manager
to that model to my coder and looking
inside my code I see that okay I tell
you - that they need for Humanity just
one configuration module which in this
case is a which kind of SK we wanted to
use in this method okay so instead of a
passing the world conflict manager and
that can look in any possible
configuration just a place and just
passed the device which is a string so I
just changed my and so in the new
decoder from before after basically
instead of a passing the config manager
I passed my new facade and then instead
of getting the risk of former config
manager I just got get two weeks ago so
I will finish inside the interface
and and then we do the same with with
the other stuff and that at the end I
just clean up the corner I mean it's not
a big factor it's not really anything
complicated but that's the word point
that I don't need a unit tester to do
this kind of a substitution and at the
end of the day I have this data context
is something that I get from aside from
outside my module so it can be in the
module or in it or something like that
and then my actual code that is a
response executed that the one that I
want to put in my code will be
completely unrelated to the two
connection doesn't know absolutely
anything about the connection
and another idea is also with a kind of
nice chemical is this in the argument
there was this universal solvent that
can solve any metal and we can use the
lambdas because we are in java 8 and to
simplify when there was a very similar
method so for example here i have in
interest calculated that they use a lip
of the rate and another calculator that
they use a credit check to do it other
stuff and decoder apart from the red
lines is identical so better for
something from the loans from ID and
then do something on the nose but the
two lines are a bit different and it's
not i mean we can kind of create a kind
of in abstract class on top of the third
class try to apply the template pattern
for example or the strategy pattern but
i mean it's a lot of code that maybe
there is also a code of is of why we
don't want to really do want to do to
touch the classes so we can just use
lambda without touching anything eyes
apart fondest tomatoes and basically
what do we do is that okay we have those
are two piece of code that we want to
change okay let's make a toast to block
of code to lambdas and we are one
lambdas which is at the ID 30 context or
whatever is the context because the idea
of the piece of code was to get to
something and then apply to each loan
and so we can kind of do it this way
and the nice thing is that they will not
have even having to specify what we
wanted to share between the init and the
calculation because we can use generics
and it will be can be a stranger can be
the complex object can be a number so
after doing this a small change of the
code we can see that our class is
basically use the static method and just
pass a different and this is just
something simpler that doesn't need unit
tests because I mean iterate works and
doesn't work it so it just touches those
two lines of code and at this point
basically we should not be able to put
everything in I mean I say even before
this in the previous one we should be
able to put everything in single modules
so one we have the module we can started
using unit tests and 30 for this one the
solver coagula which was another phase
of in I cami where we took something we
dissolve and then we go we make a solid
and then so this was a way to put fine
we can kind of clean up those kind of
spaghetti called shotgun surgery kind of
code so let me show
I know that is bid I mean for him to see
cordless lights so many anything is a
monkey table so if you want but just to
give you an idea so this is the nice
code that does something really really
fantastic like of writing at this output
deliver from some address and de cuenta
called up that does about something
there was this class printer label
advice and that was completely referring
each other and using each other in the
method it was quite complicated so did
okay we have a toast for classes with
the batch of method that each one is
calling each other and we want up I mean
there should come some fantastic design
but do we have a know what it will be
so one solution is okay we can look at
the code and try to think of something
but there is something that is let's
take all the method of all these classes
and let's create a public stock class
function and just put all the methods
here there are static methods so they
need us all to have a parameter with a
stands where the method is called at
least but this is just a copy paste just
to take all the metals put in and when
we have all the metals together in this
class we can start looking at the
methods and say okay if the matter's has
only one parameter others that clear
dismantle should go in the others class
there is no other way
but this method sent to printer should
be something that address send to
printer which would be the printer that
have a method like I got the address
I mean it's debatable probably we need
the code but we also can think something
like we can keep it static we can say we
don't know which you want to so let's
keep a static method that and also the
same for the other things and of course
if one of the yeah like the last one if
one of the parameter is a string of
course we cannot put the method to a
string so we go to the printer and so
basically just move in the method around
we cannot affect the main basically this
is completely done with the automatic a
factor in ID will be much cleaner
because how do I say we have a client
with the nuts inside and that we just
say to the printer printer this to the
label to to pass the printer and the
client
which is kinda quarterback sense
okay so I try to explain why I think
that the rejuvenated legacy code that
can be more interesting and rewarding
than now working on a greenfield budget
that's also any question
are you convinced I am something that is
really passionate about this so you can
follow me on Twitter trying to collect a
bit material maybe to write the book so
if you feel like you want to share some
ideas or stuff just let me know
Thank You omelette</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
