that you came here to see my
presentation I know that there are some
really good talks taking place at the
same time so thank you very much once
again but you're here and because you
probably have no idea of Who I am I will
tell a couple of words about myself and
my name is Bart hua Meis whata if you
find it hard to pronounce you can simply
call me Bart if you like and I am
software engineer from Warsaw Poland and
I'm also speaker and I run a blog
I am Diesel's most valuable blogger and
the main areas of my interests are
object-oriented programming software
craftsmanship micro services and all the
stuff summer around software
architecture and I currently work at a
gel tag I can you can see here in the
slide and my shirt and we are the
technology hub of financial giant
Hargreaves Lansdown from Bristol UK
which is the largest financial service
company United Kingdom and HL is looking
after over 86 billion pounds for over 1
million of customers and they opened a
technology hub last year and up there in
Warsaw we have currently around 50
people but we have plans to expand to
the number of 200 and what we are doing
there is that we are developing software
of the latest technologies with latest
techniques and we are bringing a lot of
innovation into the company and working
there is a really fun believe me here
you can find some of my contact
information you can follow me on Twitter
you can visit my blog page and all code
examples that you will find there and
during this talk you will also find on
my github account and don't hesitate and
write me an email if you have any
questions regarding this presentation or
my articles or whatever and if you're
interested in my career just visit my
LinkedIn profile alright today we're
going to talk about transaction
synchronization and spring application
events and I'm just wondering how many
of you know spring framework and
that's a big number and how many of you
have professional experience with spring
boot that's also a big number but
because this talk is open to the people
of all levels of experience I will tell
in a big big short what spring framework
or spring boudoir and spring framework
in a big short it's a Java platform that
provides comprehensive support for
developing applications we have core
support for things like dependency
injection transaction management day
taxes messaging testing and many many
more in spring boot though helps us to
develop production ready standalone
applications with embedded application
servers like Tomcat natty JD and it uses
its magic to help to configure spring
whenever it's possible just looking at
dependencies that we declare in our
maven pom file or in the build Gradle or
looking at the beans that we declare in
our application context and getting back
to the main topic application even since
spring framework are a great way of
communicating among beans declared
within the same application context and
they can be even more powerful when they
are used within the bounds of
transactions and during this talk I will
give you a real-life hands-on example
explaining to you what transactions
generalization really is and how to
implement it with spring application
events you also see with this example
how can you possibly use it when can you
use it and where are the threads that
you should be aware of and at the same
time I will try to focus on some simple
clean code principles that application
events help us to follow and at the very
end and I also tell you a few words
about even reliability and data
consistency in distributed environments
and because I don't like slides this is
the last one you will see today and we
will switch to the ID and do some live
coding but just before that let's
imagine a simple business use case which
is based on a real one that I worked
with in my previous company and imagine
the situation when you need to create a
customer and as soon as you create the
customer need to generate an activation
token this token will be afterwards
used in order to produce some unique
activation URL and this URL will be sent
to the customer via email and in those
emails will encourage our customers to
click the link activate their accounts
and start using our brand new and shiny
system and from the business perspective
these two processes creating an customer
and generating a token are two
completely separate processes what does
it mean for us the programmers that
these are two separate processes well it
means that when we materialize this
abstraction and write our code just
follow the single responsibility
principle and clearly separate these two
concerns in the code as well so let's
move to the IDE and start to code our
example and what we have here is a
simple spring booth application and like
you can see here I'm using spring boo
starter parent with the latest spring
build release version and I also have a
couple of dependencies over here like
sprinkle starter test start of data GPA
in order to communicate with database I
also have an embedded h2 database we
have also a couple of tests utilities
like spring booster tests and our
agility which is the library that I will
describe to you in a couple of minutes
and let's move to the main application
class and let's start with our example
where to start with let's create a
customer class and let's annotate it
with entity annotation this way we are
telling spring we are telling dads there
is a mapping between the object world
and relational world and let's start
with a simple field call it ID and it
will be a primary key in terms of
database and let's say that it will be
automatically generated with the
strategy of identity identity and let's
also put here I have a type over here
yeah let's also put here let's say name
let's also add here email address let's
put here token as well
we may argue whether talking should be
placed here or not probably shouldn't
this is not a clear customers property
it could be some value object or some
external identity depending on every use
case but for the sake of simplicity just
keep it here I've also created a simple
constructor let's say that I would like
to create my customer for a given name
and email address and because we are
using JPA we also need to create a no
argument constructor which is very bad
and let's also put some gathers over
here for ID email and name and let's add
some business methods into our entity
let's start with this kind of business
method I would like to say to my
customer that he will be activated with
this particular token ok and the body
will be as simple as the assignment I
will sign the attribute value to the
token field like this and another
business message that I would like to
have here is a method returning boolean
and that would tell me if my customer
has token as token or not and I will put
you there return negation of string
utils is empty token and you might be
wondering why haven't they use this
simple gathers and setters over here and
there's a couple of reasons actually
first reason is that we are developing
in Java in Java is object oriented
programming language in that Roberts
object oriented programming language
should follow its paradigms and the
basic part I'm of AOP is abstraction and
this is what we did here is that we gave
our object a real-life behavior we
modeled the behavior so this is no
longer a dumb and anemic data store it
has behavior and another reason for
doing this this way is that we have
hermit eyes the data representation of a
token and secondly we Herman ties the
logic regarding token regarding customer
activation here in these methods so that
doesn't leak anywhere else all right now
we have our customer model let's create
a way to communicate with database in
order to persist the customer in the
database and retrieve it from the
database and order to do so we will
benefit from using spring data JPA
and it will be as simple as declaring an
interface let's call the customer
repository that will extend JP a
repository for a customer object and for
the primary key of ty blach and with
this one line of code we gained
practically for free methods like find
all fine bye ad safe remove etcetera and
let's create also a class where we can
put some business logic so let's create
a customer service
let's annotate it we have the service
method so that Spring Framework creates
a proper bean in the application context
and I would like to have here a
transactional method that would create a
customer customer for a given name and
for a given email address and what I
would like this method to do is to
create the customer object persisted in
the database and return so we have to
adhere a dependency to customer
repository customer repository and it
had a constructor like this and I always
prefer using constructor injection to
fill the injection and again if you're
interested Y you can catch me after
representation and we can discuss that
in detail and like we said we will
create the customer object with the
constructor customer for given name and
email email address and we will return
the result of customers repository save
method invocation customer yeah and how
do we have our service let's write the
test I hope you already have the habit
of writing tests don't you let's write
the test and check if everything works
just fine okay and this will be a simple
spring boot test which will run with
spring run our class and because it is a
test it won't be a crime if I do some
field injection over here and I would
like to have here a customer service
object customer service and I would also
like to have here a customer repository
customer repository
like this and let's create the a unit
test let's find some fans name for it
for example should create and persist
customer okay what do we want to test
here is that when we create the customer
of the customer service create customer
method for name like Matt and for email
like mad at gmail.com come then I expect
that the customer that is residing
currently in the database let's call
them persisted customer which I'll
retrieve from database using customer
repository find by ad method using the
ID from the newly created customer
object and because this method returns
an optional I also need to call the get
over here and what do we want to check
here is that our persisted customer has
properly set properties so let's make
some assertions first of which would be
that name is equal to Matt get name
assert equals Matt gmail.com persisted
customer get email and because we
haven't done anything regarding token
generation yet we shouldn't expect our
customer to have a token so let's write
a cert false here and let's call
persistent customer has token method and
let's check if we wrote everything
correctly the test will take a couple of
seconds yeah and it works okay we can
get back now to our code and it's time
for token generation but remember what
we said at the very beginning is that we
need to follow the single responsibility
principle so it means that neither the
create customer method nor the customer
service at all
shouldn't perform any logic regarding
generation so where to put the lodge
again let's create another class class
token token generator that's also
undetected with service annotation and I
would like to have here
that that would generate token for this
particular customer and what I'd like
this method to do is to create the token
tell my customer that he will be
activated with this token and persist in
the database so again we do have a
dependency to private final to customer
repository again and we need to add a
constructor and let's create the body of
the method so let's firstly calculate
the token and to keep this example
simple I would just use the customer
object hash code alright so alright like
string value of customer hash code and
forgive me for not paying too much
attention to checking whether the
customer object is null or not because
it's completely not relevant from the
perspective of this example and we need
to tell our customer that he will be
activated with this token and we need to
persist it with the customer repository
safe method already using customer over
here and yeah and now we have a place
where we have a lodging regarding
customer creation we have another class
realizing token generation now we need
to connect them somehow keeping in white
keeping in mind that we need to have our
code clean and decouple at the same time
so in this kind of cases a good idea
would be to use the observer pattern so
that we could inform all interested
parties that a particular events took
place in the system and in our in our
case this will be like hey the customer
was just created if anybody is
interested do whatever you want do this
so following this consideration we will
use spring application events and spring
application events are nothing more than
just an implementation of the observer
pattern so now the question is how to
model our event in the code and
fortunately since Spring 4.2 we no
longer need to extend the abstract
application even class and we can just
use plain old Java objects
so let's write our class representing
our event and let's call it customer
created and that's also right the final
over here and what do we want to have
here is a ID of our customer customer ID
again because this field is final we
need to create a constructor and because
we probably will want to get this
customer ID well so I gather over here
and we have our customer created even
modeled now it is high time we start
producing this event so in order to
produce the event to publish the even in
Spring Framework we can use the
application even publisher which is a
super interface for application context
and this is also kind of an abstraction
over the even bus so let's get back to
our customer service and let's add
another dependency over here right final
application even publisher let's call it
a publisher simply of course we tell
it's constructor parameter and we to
make some refactor over here so let me
remove the customer object creation from
here to here and instead of having
return statement or stay with the
assignment and over here I will take the
publisher and publish or even let's
create event customer created and pass
the ID of the newly created customer
object over here and what we are missing
here is the return statement whether the
customer alright we have just published
our event but in order to be able to
react to this event we to subscribe to
it somehow
so let's write another class called
customer created listener and let's say
that it will be a component oh okay this
is a compound and I would like to have
here a method that would simply handle
the customer created even alright and
what do we want this method to do is to
take this event grab the customers ID
from it then try to find this customer
in the database using this ID and
generate token for him
again we need to have two more
dependencies over here first of which is
again customer repository second one is
token generator token generator and of
course we need to create a constructor
again and let's create the handle method
so like we said we need to take the
customer from the database using
customer repository of course and find
by ID method and the ID we will take
from the event object and because again
it returns optional let's call the get
melt over here and yeah and now we need
to call the token generator and generate
token for this particular customer are
we done
no we are missing one thing which is the
event listener annotation with this
annotation we are telling the Spring
Framework that this particular method
handle should be invoked whenever a
customer creates the event occurs in our
application context all right
so we have our even modeled we have
producer we have consumer so let's get
back to our test and check if our
persisted customer has token right now
let's change the assertion to true I
hope it will work and works fantastic
all right so you have just seen that
spring application events help us in
following single responsibility
principle as we have a clear separation
of concerns over here but at the same
time we are following also the open
closed principle because if any other
business requirements occur for example
we need to react to the customer created
event in some other way we need to do is
just add another listener we don't have
to modify anything in our code but now
let's have a look at our even listener
and let's try to answer the question do
we have a real separation of concerns
here and the answer lies in the way that
Spring Framework handles application
events and by default Oh
application even since Spring Framework
are handled synchronously what does it
mean it means that our even producer
once proceeded until all listeners are
invoked which means that if the producer
is running inside some transaction this
transaction will be by default
propagated to all its listeners which in
turn means that if anything wrong
happens in any of our listeners if any
exception is thrown there our
transaction will be rolled back what
does it mean our case it means that if
our token generation fails our customer
won't be persisted so let's answer the
question again do we have separation of
concerns we don't but fortunately Spring
Framework provides something called
transactional even listener which is an
enhanced version of the novella listener
that gives us the ability to collaborate
with surroundings transaction and here
we meet the definition of transaction
synchronization and transaction
synchronization is nothing more than
just registering callback methods that
should be invoked whenever our
transaction meets particular face you
may ask what phases can be synchronized
with let's open transaction face class
and you will see the phases first one
before the transaction is committed
after it is committed after it is
rollback or after it is completed
regardless the success and what do we
need in our case in our case when we are
generating the token we want to be
hundred percent sure that our customer
is successfully persisted so we would
like to use the after comment phase
which is also a default setting for
transactional even listener notation so
let's get back to our code and let's try
to replace our inner listener with
transactional even listener right
transactional even listener and because
we have a test we can check if
everything works fine let's rerun our
test and hope it will work and it
doesn't work let's see what happened
our persistent customer has no token
what have we missed let's open an IRA
class called transaction synchronization
let's try to read the top Javadoc which
be done before using the transaction
synchronization at all and because we
are using the after comment face let's
have a look at the documentation that is
written about the after comment method
and I see something interesting here the
transaction will have been committed
already but the transactional resources
might still be active and accessible and
as a consequence any data access code
trigger at this point will still
participate in the original transaction
allowing you to perform some cleanup
we've now come into following any more
unless it explicitly declares that it
needs to run in a separate transaction
what does it mean it means that we have
synchronized our token generation with
the transaction that has already been
committed so we shouldn't even expect
that anything would be committed twice
inside the same transaction as
transaction is an atomic object of work
we shouldn't expect that so what can we
do now we can follow the advice given
over here and declare the autonomous
transaction and are we okay with
autonomous transactions in our case I
think we are because we need to have a
clear separation of concerns we have two
separate processes doing something
completely different so if they run in
separate transactions we're fine with it
so let's try to do this let's get back
to our code again let's find our
listener and in Spring Framework
declaring the autonomous transaction is
as simple as using the transaction
connotation and changing the propagation
mode to requires new and again because
we have a test we can check whether it
works or not and let's rerun it and like
you can see the tangy autonomous
transaction helped us to get rid of the
problem that is generated with the usage
of the transactional even listener and
now let's have a look again at our
listener and let's imagine a situation
when the token generate
it's a very long-lasting process for
example it takes 20 or 30 seconds to
execute and let's also imagine that you
give your end-users a user form when
they're when they can create a customer
with two fields name an email address
and a button and imagine three faces
when they need to wait for 30 seconds so
their customer gets created this sounds
insane so in this kind of case is the
first thing that should come to your
minds is to use your synchronous tasks
and if we are talking about as interest
asks transactions and Spring Framework
what you should keep in mind is that in
Spring Framework transactions are by
default thread bounded what does it mean
that they are thread bonded it means
that our if our producer is running
inside some transaction and it is
starting some other separate thread this
new newly created thread won't belong to
the previous transaction so we no longer
need to declare the autonomous
transaction over here because it will be
autonomous
if we run any transaction over there the
transaction won't be propagated so let's
try to do it and in Spring Framework I
could say that declaring a synchronous
task is as simple as using a second
notation and of course I'm
oversimplifying a bit because this is up
to you to manage all the thread pooling
etc and of course in Spring Framework we
to also explicitly tell the Spring
Framework that we need to enable the
ancing processing with the enabling
annotation and because I said that we no
longer need the autonomous transaction
we can get rid of it and because this
method will be run synchronously we
can't perform our tests in a synchronous
manner because we can't be sure that our
that the token generation will be
finished before our test so we need to
change a way that we approach the the
testing style right so let's open the
test again and now I will show you how
can you benefit from using the utility
library which is as simple as that
you can write a wait
imperat static wait for example we want
to wait at most five seconds until until
some condition is fulfilled in our case
let's call this condition customer has
token and of course we are talking about
the customer with this particular ID and
let's get rid of this piece of code for
a while and let's create the has token
method it should return the boolean
value so let's declare that and I'll
paste the code again here I will get the
ID from the method argument get rid of
this piece and instead of asserting true
here I will simply return the has token
invocation and what I will do is that it
will do the probing will be checking if
if our condition is fulfilled
is it fulfilled is it fulfilled is
fulfilled and if it is fulfilled in
within the period of five seconds our
test will pass otherwise it will fail so
let's try to run it and check if the
works and let's check if the synchros
tasks also deals with the problem of
transaction synchronization with the
after come and have to rollback or after
completion phases and yeah
now maybe without any more coding let's
have a look again and our listener and
now I'd like to tell you a couple of
words about even reliability and data
consistency in distributed environments
and we won't dig too deep into details
as this could be a topic of a separate
talk but I would like to give you an
overview of how complex the topic really
is and as you look at that were even
listener again what if I tell you that
we managed to produce the customer but
right after that and just before
persisting the token our database
connection goes down and in real life
some other business requirements may
occur for example we may need to send an
email and one if we manage to persist
our customer but right after that I mean
my service is not available it goes down
in but will describe cases we lose
consistency right so it means that our
application events are not reliable and
will this consistency in the system so
what can we do to improve that even
consist even reliability and data
consistency in our system well first of
all we want to be able to retry all
those failed operations in the future so
in order to be able to do that we to
persist or even somewhere and somehow
and now the question is where and how to
persist them and if we're talking about
events persistence etc first thing that
comes to my mind is to use some JMS or
AMQP broker like Apache Kafka RabbitMQ
ActiveMQ whatever but they may feel as
well we may have the similar situation
like we have in our group of our email
service the second option that would
recommend is to prefer to persist all
those events in the same data tester as
we store our customers and we could even
persist them inside the same transaction
and it would be the most reliable option
well then then we could write a simple
scheduled processor job that would take
even by even do the rest of the stuff
for example generating token sending an
email or for winding this even to your
name could be brokered whatever and you
may also say that this also bears the
burden of not consistent solution and I
would agree because what if we take the
event try to send an email but our email
service is up but it's not responsive
and we are getting timeouts and we end
up with sending ten emails the same
customer and again we lose consistency
and it's a real problem and how can we
deal with this if we are the developers
of the even consumers if we are the
developers for example of the email
service you could write it in an
idempotent way so that it can manage the
duplications and the last thing I would
like to say to you is that what if I
tell you not to persist either the
customer know the token in the
relational JIT
database at all and to forward all those
even straight to the AMQP broker then we
could take all those events and recreate
our customer aggregate and anytime in
the future whenever we like and at the
same time we could react to all those
events generating and tokens sending an
email during whatever else we want and
this this is what we call an event
sourcing and here's where I'll leave you
with all those considerations I know
that there are some talks today or maybe
tomorrow about event sourcing and secure
s and I really recommend you going there
because this would be a natural
continuation of my talk and during this
talk you could see on a simple example
what transactions huma's Asian is how to
implement with spring application events
you could also see how spring
application events help us in forming
single responsibility principle and
output closed principle at the same time
you could also see what transactions
transactional evil listener is all about
and what I'd like you to remember from
this talk is that you can write your
listeners both in synchronous manner and
in a synchronous manner but you need to
remember that if you're synchronizing
with after coming after rollback or
after completion phase there won't
become it's procedure invoked anymore so
neither use autonomous transaction or
choose the asynchronous task processing
and with the assing you need to remember
that transactions in Spring Framework or
by default thread bounded and that's all
from my side thank you very much that
you came here thank you for attention
and I apologize again for my voice and
if you enjoyed the presentation then it
means you should follow me on Twitter
definitely and if you have any questions
regarding this talk or whatever topic is
we can talk afterwards but remember I'm
losing my voice so yeah thank you very
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
