my name is Sarah Saunders I'm a software
engineer from Manchester England and I
work for a company called capgemini
she's a global IT consultancy and
originally I was a Java developer but
the nature of working at capgemini means
you get to work on lots of different
projects and I've tried to pick projects
around Manchester so I've had the
opportunity to work on a number of
different technologies and platforms
including some platforms of service type
product architectures and
implementations and part of this talk is
about my fight to make that interesting
and so the agenda for today the first
thing I want to talk a little bit about
is the culture of working in IT the way
that we work together in how that's
different then i'll make the
sensationalist claim that I've put on
the title to get you all in here and and
then I'll talk about how in reality a
developer's skills are required on these
kind of no code projects and then I've
done a few of these sort of platforms of
service no code implementations and I've
noticed some sort of reusable pieces so
I've called that my platform as a
service run book so after I've talked
about the rest I'll go through the
highlights of the pa's run back through
the story starts here this is a chateau
la Fontaine's it's kept geminis
University on the outskirts of Paris see
the beautiful chateau building where we
have the restaurants and bars and then
there's a state-of-the-art campus
building sets in the ground and every
year for a week the suits and major
players of cap toe and I come to life
Fontaine's talk about the next year the
strategy for cap German in the year
ahead and last year they also held a
hackathon during the week so I got to go
along those part of the hackathon
so here we all are and they gave us
these lovely brightly colored t-shirts
and so while the suits were wining and
dining in the Chateau we were down in a
campus 24-7 building some applications
for our clients but we didn't escape
completely unscathed we got called into
the chateau at one point and they SAT us
all down and they said you are different
and we said well you and it gave us
these t-shirts but it turns out that
wasn't what they meant they were talking
about the culture that we have in the
development community and how we work
together they said that in other areas
of capgemini you know some of the
business consulting areas there isn't
this culture of sharing people have
their documents and mel hoard them on
their personal laptops and they don't
even share them you know within their
divisions let alone outside their
divisions and so they were looking at
the way we work in software engineering
you know the way we release open source
code we post comments to communities and
if then why is it why is it that you do
that and we thought well that's a really
interesting question so took some time
out from the hackathon to to sit and
debate it and we thought what is it
about the culture of IT is it it does it
heart back to the hacker culture you
know leave these sort of definitions
says that you know hackers are promoting
the sharing of data that all computers
should be for everyone and there is a
great definition hackers are
anti-authoritarian and creative is it
this hacker culture that makes us want
to share and then we thought well the
structure of some of the applications
that we use things like stack exchange
encourages gamification so you know is
it that is it because of that but we
that we share and we thought no it's not
necessarily because we were all
wonderful creative individuals it's more
the fact that we actually get valuable
kudos from sharing you know if somebody
was looking to recruit some IT staff
they would look at their open source
contributions they would look at stack
exchange does this person asked
questions living answer questions and
the more that you share the more kudos
that you get and that actually
add value to you as a developer so
unlike the other communities within
capgemini where they don't get any
benefit from sharing we are actually
benefit benefiting from sharing this so
the question is why are we so open to
sharing our code you know if you wrote a
nice new sorting algorithm you would
probably post it you probably wouldn't
even write it to be honest you probably
google it and copy and paste someone
else's and that's fine that's just part
of the way that we work no other
division would do that and why so the
more we thought about it the more we
thought well actually the value of these
little pieces of code is actually low in
itself you know that's not where where
our specific value is you know the lines
of code that we write they really have
any value at all so it we started to
scare ourselves into this idea hang on
coding as a concept you know we are they
all identify as coders but we've just
realized that that it has no value is
coding debt so there's my am
sensationalist hypothesis for you to
elaborate a little bit on what I mean by
that I was thinking it's a little bit
like the obstruction given by the Babel
fishing Hitchhiker's Guide to the galaxy
if you don't know the Babel Fish it's a
concept that Douglas Adams uses to get
over how these intergalactic species
communicate the idea is you put a fish
in your ear and the fish translates for
you between all these alien languages so
you've abstracted above the actual level
of language just going straight to the
concepts and so I was thinking how we
got to that stage with coding where
we've abstracted above it every little
piece of code that you could ever want
already exists and it's actually using
these building blocks and building at a
higher level of abstraction that that
gives us the value that we have today so
a hypothesis for my claim is this
product code mendax it has anyone heard
of mendax before it's a platform as a
service
and it allows rapid application
development using just drag-and-drop not
writing any code you just fill in forms
in your drag and drop and you produce an
application with a presentation layer a
persistence layer and some business
logic in the middle so the kind of thing
that you would write for an enterprise
as a product you know over and over
again so and I want to do a demo of how
you can use mendax to write an
application just to give you an idea of
what these low code no code products
look like today so here actually I
dislike problem with a demo in that I've
got F the mend except on the Virtual Box
but for some reason my virtual box
doesn't like the network here so what
you would do with the platform is our
service of course is you would start
accessing it in the cloud so mendax is a
is hosted in the cloud so you would
first log on to the home page create
yourself an account and then you would
just click create app and what that will
do is it will set up a development space
for you so if I look at some that I've
built already you see the kind of things
that it gives you it's not just the code
itself it will give you a space where
you can work in an agile way so it gives
they have something called team server
which gives you a repository where you
can check in and check out code and do
versioning they give you a link to
something a bit like deer so you can
manage your teams and the people who use
it well we'll let that side of it plug
away and i'll show you how you would
actually create the application so this
is the IDE it's called mendax modeler
and this is what i've done here is i've
just created a blank new project so the
first thing that i might want to do is
create my data model so to create a data
model you can just drag and drop your
entities so this is an example from the
mendax website of just creating a simple
employee website to manage your
employees in the company so you might
have an employee
table and then you can add attributes
and have a name email phone number what
else and address county and then they
might have data birth which would be a
date so you can see that there's some
representations of different types
slightly of the screener and then you
can do things like you can create an
enumeration so if i wanted to represent
the different levels you can have in
your company i could create an
enumeration called level and i can add
junior associate senior and then i might
want to table to represent department
department might have a name description
call that department and then if you
want to lick the tables it's simple you
just drag and drop to create the
connection between the two so easy to do
and then the next thing i might want to
do is create a home page where i can
display this data so to create a page
you choose a template so this massive
detail i'll have a list of all the items
at the top and then when you select on
it will show you the details you can
choose different Navigation layouts as
well
then unfortunately this isn't fitting
the page too well how do I get this to
display better on my screen does anyone
know because I can't see my minibar
haha the things that I want just out the
screen that side but basically if I
could see the thing then you can drag
and drop from your domain model onto
this central piece to populate the grid
and then you can drag and drop the
pieces in well okay let's move on to
tryna do the interesting bit which is
the data layer in the middle so i can
add an action button and i might want to
call it promote and then i can create i
can say well what happens when i call
that action i can say i want it to call
this mendax concept called a micro flow
and and i'm going to call up remote
employee okay and then if i say go to
the microphone then you can see again
i'm going to struggle here because the
building blocks on the other side of my
screen but so here i can say i want an
exclusive split so i want to split based
on the input and it's going to be the
level so because when you want to
promote an employer you want to change
their level so I want to say look at the
oh that's good i can't drag the table
onto the page it doesn't know that I'm
talking about the employee oh this is so
annoying even know code demos can go
horribly wrong is there a way that I can
change the resolution of my screen so
that I can actually see the whole screen
is it I don't know but it is in a
virtual box which is running on here so
or maybe if I exit the full screen of
that yeah yeah yeah okay so now i can
show you how you simply connect a grid
to a data model so want my employee here
and then you can add the relevant field
just using drag and drop to map your
data so now my promote button should
know that it's an employee so when I
edit the Micra flow it should be able to
i might have to recreate it
to think up okay so
so there's my flow i want my exclusive
split and this so finally got my level I
never put it in my data model I don't
think I didn't so first thing to do is
add that enumeration to my data model so
then when I am in my promote mode I can
split based on level huh so there are
three options for a level you can be a
junior senior or an associate so we'll
add those in or you could not have the
value set up at all so we'll add that
one as well and then I can say what
would I want to do under the situation
that an employee's our junior I'm going
to promote them I want to change that
object so we'll drag in a change so you
would say change the level and it would
go to associate and similarly if you
were going to promote an associate then
what you would want to do is change a
level to be a senior if they are senior
already then we don't need to change
their level so we can just show a
message saying already at the highest
level
so I just need to add in my exclusive
split which is which so that's jr.
that's associate that's senior okay so
if you're not a developing you might
find that marginally interesting you
developers are probably dying of boredom
but you can imagine quite a lot of the
applications that you build could very
easily be developed like this just by
dragging and dropping and then what
mendax is offering you is the cloud
solution to then host that so when it's
up and running this is one that I made
earlier you can see that I've got my
employees watch me here on the internet
and so we'll leave that running and it
may well show the page but in the
meantime I could pulley if we look at
the source of what we've actually built
here you can see it's not just like a
flash or an image it's got proper
technology in it it's got bootstrap it's
got dojo it's you know leaf and
marketing could build this and what he's
effectively built is a Skylar
application with a bootstrap front end
that's hosted in the cloud and so what
you might be thinking is isn't this the
same old x versus build argument yes it
is but I think it is worth constantly
reconsidering this because the factors
around it change and the potential cost
of buying versus building is coming down
because when it's hosted in the cloud
there are different models for instance
there's you know you can pay per CPU
paper user paper data so you're not
buying one big product and you can you
can cost it in different ways which
makes it more affordable for different
companies and another of the arguments
that was on the x versus build scale is
or well you've now got this dependence
on say mendax as a company but if we're
hosting the cloud you know if we're
already using infrastructure as a
service we've already got that
dependency so you know why not just
increase the scope of where that depend
it's alive and I think also we've got a
better idea of an enterprise application
and lifespan so when I say enterprise
application I mean you know you couldn't
like mendax in mendax you couldn't write
you know a new language in mendax
there's obviously a limit to what you
can use this for but I think a lot of
what I would say enterprise applications
things that we at capgemini build for
companies to support their business
processes but you could use mendax for
we get a better idea of how long their
their life span is and it's not 10 15
years it's five six seven eight years so
your dependency on mendax existing is
only five six seven eight years it's not
decades and the ability to customize is
getting better as these applications get
better as i mentioned mendax is actually
written in scala so it runs on the JVM
so if you wanted to go down to the level
of customizing for the sort of you know
8020 rule the twenty percent of your
clients requirements that don't fit into
the medics model you can actually write
custom Java classes and and they will
run because it fits on the jva so yes
it's the same argument but worth
reconsidering so when you show mendax as
long as you don't doesn't go too wrong
to you know project managers they get
really excited they go even a baby could
do that and then they look at the
developers and they go why do we have
these really expensive guys when you
know we'll just get Lee from marketing
to do it and you know there's those
words that send a chill down the spine
of any developer you know all these
years of creating a robust engineering
disciplines why do you need that we've
got Lee for marketing now so we all know
that you know these kind of projects
require engineering software engineering
knowledge but do we ever stop to think
about that as our value you know what I
went to the mendax tour which is mendax
went round Europe to different cities
and held meet up so everybody got
together and talked about their success
stories and there were a lot of success
stories where you know be a small firm
with a small IT division they had two
people
then the CTO built the proof of concept
himself and it went swimmingly but then
after that stage after the
proof-of-concept layer people were
saying things like this to again oh I
wish I could just look rap down there
people to stop fiddling with it or
people don't understand how to use this
properly you know all the things that we
as developers learned years ago these
people who are coming in thinking you
don't need development skills I've got
all of those hurdles to overcome and so
yeah I think in conclusion don't worry
you know our skills are obviously still
necessary we know that our jobs aren't
at risk we know will be around for years
but we probably need to kind of
emphasize that we are software engineers
my official title at capgemini is a
senior developer but I think of myself
as more of an engineer because of the
range of projects that I work on you
know my skills is not the fact that i
can write an array copy in 16 characters
it's the fact that i commend robustly
deploy that array coffee you know
between environment and so in the next
section of this talk i want to talk
through a couple of projects that I've
worked on which have been platform as a
service load code there hasn't been any
development but we've still wanted to
robustly package them as development
projects we still wanted to work in an
agile way we want to plan design or to
make repeat these you know so basic goal
of taking a deployment unit and moving
it between environments is the same even
if you're working with a with a no code
product and so the first case study I
want to look at is a tool called API
connect it's an IBM product they used to
call it API management because that's
what it does you know it's it's between
a company's internal api's and their
clients so they can do things like
create subscription packages that can
use throttling they can get people to
pay you know different amounts for
different usages of their internal api's
and they can make all their api's looks
standard so it's sort of a pipe a proxy
between the two layers and the tool
allows you to configure these interfaces
and so when we were working on the
project there are a few interesting
issues that we came up with and a few
sort of hurdles that we had to overcome
so I'm just going to sort of talk
through those so we still wanted to
implement it in the same way and the
first issue that we sort of hit up
against is the concept of a cloud
environment so they went out and they
bought from IBM these five environments
which they named after their five
environments that we had internally and
and then they studied just playing
around with the development environment
putting a load of data on it and
granting you know low level access it's
like why are you granting access to this
this is internet exposure everybody can
see this amazing art only of a
development environment and getting that
concept across to the client and to the
development teams and the test teams of
okay just because we've called this
virtual machine development doesn't mean
it's any different from the virtual
machine that we've called production and
in fact you need to think more about
security at the development side because
you want less people to access it
probably the new during production so
that was our first change of definition
that we came across and then when it
came to the deployment to these
environments we came across another big
hurdle of what actually is our
deployment unit because if you think
about writing code you might get it
compiled to you know some form of jar or
war or whatever and then you would move
that compiled unit between environments
and the thing that would change would be
the configuration so with your dev one
points to the dev database and the sick
one points to the sick database but all
we have here is that configuration piece
so that's what you're changing as you
move between environments then you know
what's the purpose of having these
different environments are you testing
you know all that you're all that you're
deploying has changed so there's no real
point moving it between the environment
so I was thinking about it how should
you use cloud environments to line them
up with internal ones so the conclusion
that I came to you is
the concept of a cloud development
environment is flawed I mean call it a
sandbox if you like and go and play in
it and learn about the tool but don't
connect it to any of your internal
systems it should be connected to mock
endpoints inputs and outputs and then
sit I can see a valid case for
connecting up a sip interface because
you need to do things like performance
testing load testing and how is the
system going to perform so I can see the
value in having a sip interface
connecting to an internal sit interface
and then when it comes to uat your uat
environment should probably contain the
production configuration so you want to
get your users to confirm that the data
they're looking at is the production
data then you take that configuration
unaltered and you move it to pre prod so
that you're practicing the concept of
moving the configuration and then when
you're happy with that process you can
then move it to production so you know
from my opinion uat pre pradhan prod
cloud API management interfaces should
probably all point to production the
client had a complete collapse about
that and say oh and you can't have you
know non-production things pointing to
production so we ended up doing it this
way but I really do think that we're not
really proving anything by changing the
configuration between these environments
so that was a big hole and then the
third arm is testing what we've
effectively built is a pipe we don't
want to be testing the underlying system
and we don't want to be testing a
calling system so all we want to test is
the middle bit which isn't very much at
all I mean API management can do things
like translate between a soap api and
expose a REST API or it can you know
stick to API is together to create a
third in which case you have got a bit
of logic in that you need to test to
unit test and then to pass through you
know your validation process but a lot
of the time if you're just mapping
endpoints you don't want to test the
underlying endpoint so we came up with
the concepts of okay a successful test
we don't care what the data in is and we
don't care what the responses we just
want to know that we've sent it in and
that we've got a response we had tests
around
valid credentials can people with no
credentials not get in can the right
credentials reach the right data and
just the right data so we weren't test
in that area we tried not ever to look
within the actual package we were
posting unless we had done some
manipulation on it so then I moved on to
another project with a product called
past iron which again is an IBM
WebSphere product cast iron purchased it
but they don't seem to really have a
strategy for its use which is a shame
because it really was an excellent
product I've got a picture of Marvin
here because the robot from Hitchhiker's
Guide to the galaxy brain the size of a
planet and you ask him to open doors
that's really what we were doing with
cast iron we were using it as an API
gateway but we could have done so much
more with it and it's hardware bats and
that phrase always really impresses me
and again it was designed to transform
an exposé api's and what we were using
it for in this project was to act as a
proxy layer between internal company
api's and the external cloud products
that they had purchased so they were
using Salesforce they were using a
cloud-based identity management system
and they wanted all the cloud API calls
to come through cast-iron so they could
use that as a sort of proxy level for
for mapping their content and so I've
just got a few screenshots of what it
looks like to developing cast iron again
they have an idea it's sort of drag and
drop you can see that you create a kind
of flow so there you set up an input and
they have a number of forms based
connections to common input if you want
to connect the Salesforce it will give
you a form and you just fill in the
fields at you want and under the covers
it will create the right kinds of sort
of Oh auth connections for you and set
up set up database connections things
like that and then you can see you have
a sort of workflow so you can add in
manipulation pieces to change the data
you can connect to different sources and
combine them and then there's a little
bit more complex you can have variables
so you can have state univ activities so
you can have functions
and you can even go down and create your
own functions you could have custom
JavaScript so it is a little bit more
than API management there is some code
going on there if you really needed to
use it and again we've started to come
across the same sort of queries and the
first issue that we had was was with
security we were using a cloud hosted
version of cast iron which was a bit of
a waste really and the way that it was
used we would connect to it via HTTPS
and then inside it would have a basic
user name and password but the SSL
termination would happen at the cloud
layer and then inside we'd be expected
to connect to your books and there are
client said oh it's okay because we'll
use IP whitelisting so you might be
white listing to a cloud only everyone
in this cloud can come in and in fact
all you have to do to create a virtual
machine in cast iron is just log on to
the website and create a free 30-day
trial so it's not actually very secure
we had to spend quite a lot of time
explaining you know the architecture of
this to the security guys with the
client because they just weren't used to
working with cloud security and then the
second issue that we had was a kind of
limitation of the product the version
control strategy that came with car
assignment every time you open one of
these flows it would create a new
version and we just had a proliferation
of versions so we had to create our own
strategy which was around the naming
convention that we used for the xml
configuration of these workflows so it
wasn't ideal we ended up duplicating the
version control we ended up having to
create our own subversion repository to
manage the xml files again it was a
limitation of the product which is not
something that you've obviously come
across if you're building your own and
then again we hit this issue of how to
test we wanted unit tests so we wanted
mock endpoints but we're not in their
happy world of Java where you've got j
unit mockito and all the libraries in
the world to back you up so we ended up
writing our own python script and we
ended up deploying things to amazon
that would act as an internet-based
empty mock endpoint because of course
you can't just spin something up on
localhost when everything's in the cloud
because we're going to be able to see it
so yes a new world in the space of
testing so the conclusions that I drew
from working on these projects was yes
we can approach it in the same way that
we approached development projects and
we should and we need to keep the same
principles in mind we still want to be
unit testing we still want to be
automating everything and there was some
reuse in them in the projects that I've
seen there were some sort of
similarities that I could draw so here's
my past project renwick so I just sort
of roughly broken it out into areas so
if you're working in an agile way
there's a sort of design stages of
testing and building stage as a proving
stage documentation and then you want
this all automated you want to
continuous integration pipeline so how
does that work in the platform as a
service world well the design and
planning stage you need a different
focus you need to be looking at the
limitations of the product that you've
chosen and you need to focus on security
because they're going to be limitations
on how you can secure things and you
need to check with your client
straightaway whether or not it complies
with what they want because if it
doesn't with a poz product you're stuck
so the testing and build phase should
obviously be much much smaller and in
fact the reality we found that it was we
did get a lot of quick wins out of this
when I was working with cast iron there
was a separate development team building
the front end and they were speaking out
little micro services that could talk to
their restful pages and they were
hosting them all on amazon and so they
were very carefully setting up a complex
array of virtual machines with little
Mike services running on them and and
they were running very behind with the
project and we said actually cast iron
could do that now you've bought the
license why don't you use it why don't
you you know do all of these small data
manipulation microservices in cast iron
and we built you know seven or eight in
a week
whereas they'd been planning that over
several weeks so you know once you get
to that stage there are winds in in the
build area but then the testing area
becomes much harder how do I have a
scriptable unit test when I've built a
platform as a service module so we had
to do quite a lot of work in that space
we were writing Python scripts and and
creating you know using online tools
I'll talk about later some sort of Handy
online tools for testing has product so
and the proving stage as I've already
mentioned you had to think about what
you're actually testing a lot of these
integration pieces were just pipes and
we didn't want to be testing the
underlying system so we had to really
think of what's the use case of the
actual product here and how can we test
that and in your tape automation space
some platforms of service products will
provide an API or a command-line
interface that allows you to deploy and
change variables of your configuration
but it's a limitation of the product
again if they're not offered then you
probably won't be able to script the
build you know if you're expected to log
onto a website and press a button it
becomes much harder to script to build
for your system and then there's the
security as well api connect comes with
a command-line interface but it doesn't
have certificate-based security so you
basically have to type in your password
so I think Jenkins will offer a way to
at least obfuscate password so that
they're not sitting there in clear text
but they're not encrypted and so that
there were security issues around
whether or not we could create the build
pipelines that we wanted the least of
documentation bit is much easier and
most platforms as a service obviously if
you have built something that automates
the writing of the code it's fairly easy
to automate the documentation of it as
well so mendax cast-iron API connect all
off a really easy ways to generate
documentation whether anyone ever reads
it or not
is another matter but it's quite handy
in the API space to be able to use
swagger with API connect you can just
write your swagger definition and then
you can load it in and it will generate
the connections for you to make that API
and then the continuous integration
space of woods talked about having the
API is in the command-line interfaces
that you really need to get your
pipeliner it will depends on product
limitations and again how do I monitor
it a lot of these platform as a service
offerings do actually provide monitoring
but if they don't then you need to build
it yourself and we had to do that with
cast iron because they're monitoring
piece was very poorly linked with the
actual system so if the system was
completely down the monitoring piece
wasn't getting any negatives responses
for it so it was just saying
everything's fine so we eventually
realized this and we had to build our
own little slow that pinged cast iron
from an internal system going are you
there are you there are you there so we
could do it fortunately but we had to
build it ourselves and then the support
site is the most frustrating for a
developer if you're used to being able
to just you know log on to a box
attached something that can look at
memory put breakpoints in when you move
to working with a platform in the
service type product it's like Homer
Simpson when he's trying to manipulate
his piece of radioactive material and
yet sir but is handling for those big
rubber gloves and grope with it you know
you feel completely tied you can sort of
say I think this is going on in phony I
could see these logs and I could
probably confirm it or not but all you
can do is open a support ticket with the
with the company that owns a product and
just wait so there was a lot of churn of
his n while we waited for support
tickets and I spent some of the time I
was waiting for support tickets thinking
about what would a support ticket grass
look like over time when you implement a
platform as a service product so i can
imagine when you just get the product
and you have no idea how to use it you
might read the manual might not read the
manual and so you're just opening ticket
after ticket go well this doesn't work
if it doesn't work and they're all
closed quite quickly because most of
them are user error
and then when you start building an
anger you start doing things like
performance testing then you start
pushing the limitations of the product
and you get a smaller subset of tickets
open which a more serious and actually
require the the powers vendor to make
some changes and then you get a much
slower rate of closing the tickets so
not that useful aggress but it kept me
busy while I was waiting for my ticket
and then the final piece is the kind of
tools that we use when we were working
on these projects so soap you I and
postman i'm sure you've come across
invaluable in in scripting tests a lot
of them we could we could just put a
load of course together and validate the
outcomes and run that as a script and
then these products HTT bin and request
been you could use as mock endpoints so
you could configure your cast-iron api
to talk to this mock endpoint and so
when you send in your request what HDTV
bin does it will just print out what the
request was so you can see what you've
actually sent and which was an
invaluable tool when we're building
these sort of pipelines and then we did
a lot of manipulation of data XML to
Jason XSL passing and we use this
product called XML spine which I don't
know if you've heard of but it did
everything that we needed and we ended
up purchasing a license for it really
was incredibly useful for working with
API management and cast iron and then
Python was the language of choice for
writing our own automated tests I think
it was just because we had a lot of
people with that skill and we could get
it running on any kind of testers box
quite quickly and so we had quite a lot
of Python scripts holding our API calls
together so that we could create a sort
of Jenkins s pipeline
so here's my conclusion just to say that
yes we are all developers but it's not
necessarily the actual writing of the
code that gives us our value it's our
software engineering expertise it's are
seeing this is an industrial process but
we can do in a repeatable and manageable
way it's our understanding of security
and how we can work together and as a
slide say as the devil is no longer in
the details so thank you very much for
listening I don't know hopefully we've
got a bit of time if anyone had any
questions good well thank you again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
