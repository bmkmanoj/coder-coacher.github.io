the final day of DevOps us we are here
to talk about CDI - oh and how you can
use it in Java SC my name is John Eamonn
member of the CDI - expert group I'm an
architect for Sparta systems I've worked
on JMS in the past as well the Apache
Delta spike and activemq and the hammock
project as well which is doing mark
surfaces with CDI so with the CDI 2o
specification it's the first time we're
moving CDI beyond the EE
realm giving you the first chance to use
it in your plane SC applications
directly both implementations owb open
web beans and weld supported a sort of
se mode that you could use but now we've
standardized on how to develop
applications using CDI on Java C we
always want user feedback we want input
from those out in the community who are
working with it so please go to CDI spec
org provide your input we have the JIRA
issue tracker hosted by JBoss we have
mailing lists hosted by JBoss just
everything is out on the open and free
to use all code is out on github from
the CDI specification as well as the
actual asciidoc files that make up our
text if you want to grab the slides
they're a hosted on my github page CDI -
- Oh
presentations and there's currently a
whole bunch of projects that actually
supports CDI in SE Pachi Delta spike has
a container control module that allows
you to boot up the container it was sort
of the precursor to anything being
available and gives you that backwards
compatibility down to CDI 100 and 1:1
apache camel has also supported some
form of CDI and SCE container so you can
actually run just plain camel as a main
application and get a fully functioning
CDI container as a part of that
and allows you to bring in any cattle
components that you may want to use in
addition to any beans that you're
developing hammock is our first attempt
at doing a pure CDI micro-services
framework pack CDI was one of the
precursors to this being able to use it
in OSGi environments so you can do some
lightweight either
web-based or playing Java SC apps with
it micro profile is well supports it to
some extent with the fact that we're
trying to move things into a more
lightweight consumable format JBoss weld
and Apache open web beans both supported
as being the core implementations
there's never been anything blocking you
from leveraging and in either weld or
open web beans weld has exposed a SE
module for quite some time and open web
beans and then really specify that you
can only use it in the servlet container
and if you look at their core dependency
injection you're actually just
bootstrapping it in a SC container so
what does it look like to start off with
CDI in an SC world it's literally two
lines of code creating a new instance of
an SE container and then initializing it
this will go through find any managed
beans that have well any bean archives
that are on your class path with
appropriate beans XML files following
either their annotated all discovery or
non discovery to locate beans it is auto
closable so I am using it within a try
with the resources block this gives you
some basic I can start it for the scope
of a test and then tear it down later on
or start up a main method that just runs
it in the background for you it's really
simple to bootstrap as a result so what
is the SE container from a CDI
standpoint it's a handle for your CDI
runtime it gives you a reference back to
your CDI container for you to do bean
resolution as well as stopping the
container and getting a reference to the
bean manager it is auto closeable we
wanted to make it very easy to use
especially within test cases if you look
at some of the core
test cases that just tests weld as a
container they're all doing try with
resource box you have within the scope
of single test method a container it
starts and then stops
it also has access to the beam manager
there is nothing stopping you from
having multiple SC containers running at
once but as a result you need to be able
to differentiate the B manager from
container one and container two to do
that we have to give you direct access
to the beam manager which is our core
entry point for CDI it extends from
instances so this gives you some basic
programmatic lookup within the container
to find beans instead of having to go
through the beam manager to do
creational context to bootstrap an
application and you can still use CDI to
current and SC so there's nothing
leverage blocking you from using what
you're used to on the EE side to gain
access to your CDI runtime in fact
they're all in extending from the same
classes and give you the same
functionality you can reduce your class
path as well so you don't have to rely
on properly defined beans XML files to
go out and look at what beans should be
discovered what shouldn't be discovered
if I create a new container adding
packages let's say bean doc classes at
the root of my application I'm at comm
that food up bar top bean class I'm
going to find everything child to that
by recursively going through the package
structure this allows me to control what
my runtime is going to look like and
only pull it in classes that I'm
interested in for my application it
gives you much lighter feel when working
with a SC application you don't have the
heavy memory consumption that you might
have in any world and within the scope
of this try with resource block you
would be able to look up
programmatically any of these beans you
can also make it as configurable as you
want so you can do things like
programmatically add extensions
decorators alternatives and stereotypes
to your container
you don't have to rely on what's in
beans XML you don't have to rely on what
has been annotated to enable features or
disable certain features we also allow
some amount of container specific
feature set doing things like add
property over here would allow you to
control weld specific features around
let's say executors for para a a
synchronous event firing you can lab you
can set point to your own custom
properties as well the other key thing
around CDI in an se environment is doing
things around request management so
certain SC applications you might have a
GUI that when you're clicking on the
button you want that to represent a
request context you may also be doing a
TCP listener as new traffic comes in
through that request you're able to
start a context programmatically one of
the things we couldn't figure out and we
left it in open is whether context
management should be a framework problem
or a developer concern do you want to
drive that based on your application
logic do you want to drive that based on
your frameworks needs so we added
support for both we allow you to
programmatically start a request context
through a built in beam in addition we
allow you to add it as a interceptor so
simply by going in through a manage
being that is annotated with activate
request context that will start and stop
a request context through the methods
invocation makes it very easy to work
with and reduce the amount of
boilerplate within your code so we can
inject the request context controller to
do programmatically we start what we
call the activate method to start the
request context this acts just like an
HTTP request would in an e environment
any incoming well any incoming code from
here to whatever happens before
deactivate would be within the bounds of
request context
if you later on after this deactivate
activated another request context you
would get to discrete request context
any beans created here would not be
available for use after here as the same
instances you would get brand new
instances for each of them you do have
to be mindful as to whether or not you
are the one starting that request
context so if it started at a higher
level you may need to not close the you
may not need to deactivate that request
context as a result you may
inadvertently deactivate someone else's
request context and then the interceptor
approach the it's much easier to follow
because all you're doing is annotating a
single being method
saying within the scope of this method
I'm going to activate and deactivate a
request context if it isn't already
active by doing this you're alleviating
yourself a lot of the troubles around it
and hiding the complexities of having to
do things like check and see if you're
the one who started the context instead
that's all had it managed for you in CDI
we're keeping track of whether this
invocation actually started a context or
not another cool feature is around
asynchronous events in SC so especially
with desktop applications as well as
some lightweight server based
applications you're going to want to do
a lot of asynchronous processing this
can include things like publishing to a
Kafka queue handling user input writing
to a database asynchronously and feeding
that result back to the client so to
deal with that we introduced the notion
of asynchronous events because
asynchronous events are inherently
multi-threaded those are automatically
gain access to a started request context
by starting that request context the
asynchronous observer is able to have a
single bound by itself of where it's
processing the event however because
we're a Nessy we don't have that
functionality with a synchronous event
so as a result
have to build some amount of logic
that's going to say for asynchronous
event I want to have a request context
active so in this case because I'm
blocking I sorry I am operating within
the same thread I need to start a
request context within the bounds of
firing an event simply to separate out
what my event is doing from some other
event that might be getting fired so
imagine that you had a sender method in
sum being that all it did was fire some
pojo object that could be application
scoped or it could be input that the
user entered in a screen when we go
through the ascender method any receiver
that's going to observe that object will
be bound within a shared request context
so that you can share data between the
different methods but it won't go beyond
the invocation of the sender method it
makes it so that you are able to use the
same type of programming model that you
would have used in EE or even if you
were doing an asynchronous event instead
in a synchronous fashion so I want to do
a short demo on how you can leverage
this with tools like Neddie so I was
able to put together a simple demo of
how you would start a container using
that e using my own main method to
instantiate is everyone able to see that
so in here all I'm doing is I'm starting
an SE container initializing it to
discover everything that's on my class
path because I'm doing that I'm allowing
everything to by default just occur the
way you would be used to in CDI there's
no extra anything that I would have to
do if I wanted to I can actually break
this down and do something like add
packages and what this will do is only
add the packages that are child to main
as well as main itself so if I were to
look at my project structure you can see
that all I really have in here are some
four classes so it's going to limit my
discovery to these four classes giving
me full control over what is actually
present within my container
so what I've done here is I've created a
channel read handler which is just
responsible for handling anything
incoming on my nettie server I'm just
gonna be bound to its I'm actually not
tying this to where it's being bound but
what I am saying is that a request
context will be active anytime this
method gets invoked for the channel read
allowing me to read that data and have a
dedicated request context open for just
the duration here my time provider is a
request scope beam and because of that
every time I invoke this method I'm
getting a new time provider and sanshi
ated so if there is any sort of state
that I wanted to maintain within that
HTTP request I can by simply saving it
in here my time provider is very simple
in that it's all doing is providing the
current time in Milly's as a method call
what I'm coming in all I'm doing is I'm
printing out the current time as well as
the data that was entered by the user so
I'm going to start a TCP listener on
some port and expose that as a caller
and then the last part of this is a
server initializer there is no tie
between the server initializer and my
main class I didn't have to do anything
however what I can control from here is
the observing of the application context
being started on the CDI container when
I do that I can have a post construct
method or an observer method that will
on startup start the server so just as
easily for this I can do at post
construct and this method will be
invoked before the observed method is
actually invoked if I wanted it started
after then I would uncomment that and
instead allow the observer method to do
the invocation of this server startup I
define a port I'm going to bind to this
could come from a configuration setting
if you wanted it to
so what I'll do is I'll go ahead and
I'll start my container
right so anytime you're adding packages
manually you also have to disable
discovery on your container or else
you're going to end up with duplicate
beans defined okay so my container
started up and now if I were to go down
at localhost eight seven six five and if
I were to send over something like
devoxx US is awesome
I'm going to see as output over here
oh boy there we are that I was able to
capture the time that that text was sent
over as well as what the input was from
the user this is all tied into a CDI
request context allowing you to manage
your state while not having to have any
hard dependencies on any specific
implementation this is all straight CDI
starting from the SE container all the
way down to any annotations that were
defined on my beings because of that
you're getting much you're getting a
very easy to develop with framework
without having to have a huge amount of
dependencies you're able to bring in as
much as you need to to manage it and
work within what you consider to be your
standard development frameworks
if I wanted to I can do something like
create a static int to keep track of my
counter of number of times that this is
getting invoked
now if I were to restart my application
we can see that each of the data sets
that came over is incrementing the beam
it's always showing a brand new instance
being created so there is no hard
dependency on anything
EE here at this point we were able to
create a very simple TCP listener bound
to a CDI request context all pure CDI
development no external dependencies no
third-party libraries required to make
this happen which is a huge step up from
where we have been around CDI
so another thing I want to just show you
is how you can actually bind this with
any servlet container as well obviously
I don't expect you to worry about all
this boilerplate but when I'm looking at
something like jetty as a servlet
container you now have the ability to go
in and do things like add your servlet
context we're hoping at some point to be
able to standardize how the integration
to a servlet container works so if you
look I've had to do things like override
Jetty's decorator to say that it has CDI
support or have to go in and actually
bind listeners to the context there is
no standard TDI listener unfortunately
but I do hope at one point at some point
in the future we do get to this where
we're able to override and specify
listeners to alleviate a hundred percent
of dependency on your container
so it gets you away from having to worry
about using very container specific
logic to override things like how your
CDI objects are managed and instead
moving towards a pure standard we're now
even though this is neti based all I've
had to do was add logic here that
started up neti and I'm good to go
this is just injecting a channel read
handler so I don't have to worry about
where it's coming from I just have them
available to me if I wanted to I could
actually replace this with an instance
of them
and do stream for each the
so I'm able to go through and find
automatically through discovery and each
any handlers that might be out there
what's the base interface here
simply by relying on the channel inbound
handler interface if I were to start
this back up
I can see that it's still picking out my
handler automatically without having any
direct dependencies on classes that I've
built so in a nutshell that is CDI 2o in
SC well 3 is the reference
implementation it should be out as the
final build sometime in April we've just
passed through all public ballots so
we're hoping to get a lot of community
input and see everyone start to use this
a lot more be able to start moving some
of you what you've learned from working
with EE technologies into more
lightweight cloud applications so we
have a couple extra minutes any
questions out there yes so the question
was does it support JDK 9 well 3 has
initial support for JDK 9 they did have
to move some of their packages around to
support JDK 9 and its most stringent
fashions but well does support it and
they well I think officially well 3 will
be the first release to support and I
think they've back ported some of the
fixes 2 to 4 but because of the
incompatibility is it was limited and
what they could do yes
these are gonna be part of the okay so
the question was we're looking to
standardize the servlet container
registry is that part of the - Oh April
release that is not currently that's
early discussions for CDI - one anything
else all right well thank you everyone
enjoy the rest of your DevOps</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
