let's do it behind the scenes look with
Stephanie answer he's right there let's
pick him up Stefan come with us show us
a behind-the-scenes look of death Fox
take you over there it's a long walk
it's a long walk probably have to make
this faster we can run yeah no we're not
gonna run I can't forget so those are
the screens as you can see so those are
the screens digital signage as we call
them so basically see who's speaking at
what time so he started at one-thirty
what other sessions will take place and
all of this is running on a raspberry pi
it's javafx and it basically gets
updated automatically if the schedule
changes at all so let's go and see the
projection area but we'll have to go
through the building so fun
yep so this is really behind the scenes
and this is where they make the popcorn
so this is where they store the popcorn
basically so these are already pre-made
and you can smell it really smells
really nice so I'll show you where the
projection is
so this is a the projectors that we use
so we don't use actually the projectors
from the cinema so we have our own
projectors here and the reason why is
that we want to have every pixel
highlighted on the screen and we are
doing a picture in picture as well so
you can see the speaker the slides and a
backdrop even if it's not that big but
it's like you know it's full HD
projected life on the different screens
so this is basically the you know the
the galley of the projectors these are
all digital projectors there's 24 rooms
here we're using eight of them the
eighth biggest ones so here you can see
it even better so that's the one for the
movie and that's the one we're using
basically and pretty big stuff we can
see Antonio doing a talk here
what's that that looks amazing so this
is really the control area so what you
see here is first of all on the left you
have the minutes left of the speakers
and then you basically see all the
different camera angles the ones the
direct ones and then the composite ones
so they basically glue them all together
into one stream so that way we can
actually more easily record them and
this is yeah it's a really nice overview
not all the rooms are used now because
during University we only use five rooms
during the conference we have eight
rooms so that's why you still see a few
black rectangles and then on the right
this purse is very busy recording all
the sessions so all these macbook pros
are basically recording encoding the
video signal and we have a backup
session which is what you see on top to
make sure that you know if something
does break because software does
sometimes crash we at least have a full
backup on a solid-state drive yeah yeah
one thing that's working really well a
deficit this year it's the Wi-Fi can you
show us the Wi-Fi equipment as well
point you over there I know you're proud
of it
it took us basically eight years to get
it right this is the main hardware which
actually does all the Wi-Fi so we we've
actually have a fiber optic cable coming
into the building only for dev ox it's a
fixed cable so it's been there for four
years before that we actually had an air
bridge coming from the main highway and
it was a real air bridge with one cable
so now it's fixed we have some you know
sophisticated hardware here doing
different load balancers we have access
point about two to three per room they
have different frequencies so that what
is a two point five and five gigahertz
we've got 500 megabits per second going
out we consume around 450 in peaks and
we allocate about 12,000 IP addresses
over the week we only have three thought
well only we have 3,500 developers but
on average one developer has three IP
numbers you know his portable his mobile
and maybe it's tablets or for a
wristband so yeah this is where really
don't don't fall over the wire but this
is where it comes me we've got more than
40 kilometers of cables going out but
there's they left here so in the early
days when Java police took place we were
actually clean it up and then I had to
like throw it away because if there was
one small hiccup and cracking the cable
they had to redo it so so this is really
the heart and soul not a beauteous look
at that that's for people running the
whole show here and then you have an
audio guy in each room so basically bit
today we have five rooms and for people
so with you know a small team of 10
people we run the whole conference so
that's pretty good so what parts doing
part we're doing a small interview
but part basically on his very nice Mac
device here he is doing all the uploads
to youtube and vimeo so basically all
the talks already stored on the on this
20 terabyte hard disk or what is it Nass
then they get transcoded once on the
portables and then he uploads it on
youtube and what's new for this year is
that all the talks should more or less
be ready by the end of the conference
we're uploading on on YouTube we only
discovered this morning that vimeo
blocks the amount of gigabytes you can
upload per week so we had to actually
stop it vimeo because it's only 20 gigs
a week and i'm willing to pay for it but
it looks like that's a fixed limits so
but the cool thing about this approach
now is that for the first time when
delphox is finished all the talks are
live at for free so people can share the
knowledge show it at their office i'd
share with their colleagues so there's a
nice anecdotes there i think this is a
new one right so this is where all the
audio is done basically to mix
everything and so on and the previous
version there it had a screen in the
middle and it was actually running
windows and of course if you know
windows it sometimes gives you a blue
screen so i remember it was a few years
ago I think six or seven years ago and I
remember that well because it was
goessling was doing a talk and in the
middle of his talk we got the blue
screen of death from windows and the
whole audio was gone so there was no
audio anymore in the rooms so these guys
I chala as we are they basically
circumvented this panel and connected
the audio cables directly rights part
and a bit in a matter of 15 minutes
everything was back up and running and
people were speaking and doing a
presentations again and the next day
they delivered a new panel if I'm not
mistaken right and they could continue
so you know that's a war story for you
yeah awesome well he's one of the
Rockstar speakers the room is packed
it's his second talk already he did a
talk this morning now is doing another
one and that's the room you was gonna
see when we walk out
on average rating of between one and
five is every trading is 50 that's
awesome so have a look let's go should
have a single unambiguous that's it
goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
