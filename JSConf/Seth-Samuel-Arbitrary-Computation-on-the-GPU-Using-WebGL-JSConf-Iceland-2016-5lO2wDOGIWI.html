uh yeah very first thing you can get all
the slides for this right now on Seth
Samuel github do if you want to follow
along if you can't see if you have
accessibility issues the there's a
couple demos that won't work quite right
on mobile but if you run into any other
problems please let me know after so I
can improve it moving forward all right
my name is seth samuel uh new york
portland various other places portland
back to new york i can never move again
without ruining the symmetry of my life
and just driving myself crazy i am here
to talk about arbitrary computation on
the GPU with WebGL which is a really
convoluted way of saying we're gonna
take WebGL which does cool graphic stuff
and we're gonna make it do weird stuff
for fun and not so much profit but fun
and it is heart WebGL because I was
testing Unicode and emoji and all of
that and I finally got it working and I
do heart WebGL so it stayed that way
I'm south of Samuel on Twitter and said
Samuel on github one last piece of
boilerplate this is a talk that goes
pretty far into the weeds if you don't
know the idiom it means I'm gonna talk
about a lot of things really fast and
most of them are pretty far outside the
normal developer life if I lose you I'm
sorry it's totally my fault please come
up afterwards ask me questions on
Twitter and real life hopefully everyone
can still get something out of this talk
even though it is pretty weedy alright
what's WebGL WebGL is a JavaScript API
that lets us as web developers talk to
the graphics card using an API that's
very much like OpenGL
what that means is we can run graphics
in about the closest way to the metal
that you'll ever get as a web developer
web assembly maybe down the line will
get you just as close but right now
WebGL is the best way to run things
really fast so what this looks like is
there's a nice little browser sandbox we
write JavaScript the JavaScript gets
piped to WebGL WebGL talks off to the
operating system and the graphics card
and then the graphics card draws your
graphics back onto an HTML canvas which
you can then talk to you like any other
HTML canvas one thing to note all these
arrows here are one-way except for the
canvas arrow which we'll get to why
that's important so the basic structure
of OpenGL is something called shader
it's one of many questionable
nomenclature choices made it inside of
WebGL but we're just gonna go with it we
inherited it from OpenGL who probably
made the decision while drunk it's
basically a functional pipeline you put
in data that data goes through a vertex
shader the vertex shader takes your data
and maps it to 3d points in space so
typically your data's gonna look
something like a series of coordinates
that look a lot like 3d coordinates but
it doesn't have to it can be anything
you want to pipe in the vertex shader
hands that information off to the
fragment shader the fragment shader is
the only one here that sort of makes
sense with the word shader because it
shades color onto a fragment of your
graphics and then graphics happens so
here's a very simple snippet of what's
called GLSL the JIT the OpenGL shader
language which we use in WebGL as well
and because this is a weird descendant
of C JavaScript is a weird descendant of
C as well but this one's a weirder
descendant of C the way you actually say
what color your your pixel is going to
be is you set a global variable called
GL frag color equal to a vet for which
is just a fancy way of saying in RGB a
tuple so we're going to get past this V
cord thing which is the vertex shader
telling us where we are in space and
we're going to set the red to be s which
is the same as X and T which is the same
as Y because again nomenclature and
we're just gonna be blue out and make it
fully not transparent so this is
actually WebGL this is all the demos in
here alive if you want to go see the
source go check out github and now we've
got our gradient so you can see in the
upper left where we're at zero zero it's
all black on the lower right red plus
green
equals yellow as we all learned in
kindergarten and in the top right red
bottom left green and what's really cool
here is all of this is happening at once
so it's not like WebGL is stepping
through every single piece of this
gradient and calculating it order the
graphics card is actually actually
calculating all of these colors at the
same time so we can use this to do some
really cool things so edge finder for
those who don't know an edge finder is
exactly what it sounds like if you have
some image and you want to find edges
inside of it that is
of what we would think of as the
outlines of objects what you can do is
basically you pass in a texture that's
what we call images and then you use a
sampler to get a pixel from it and so
we're gonna do the same thing where
we're gonna look at a pixel we're gonna
look a little bit to the left with that
minus 0.005 and then we're gonna have
some threshold that tells us whether or
not this is an a Giunta fits an edge
we're going to paint bright pink if
we're if it's not we're just gonna paint
black so here is a small child
attempting to eat an entire block of
cheese this is not my small child but if
I did have a small child she would also
probably try to eat an entire block of
cheese because cheese is delicious and
here we have her in edge format so you
can see I have this nice little slider
here that threshold that we saw earlier
I can decrease the threshold which means
basically everything looks like an edge
or I can make it really high which means
nothing looks like an edge and I can
sort of go through here and this is all
happening at liquid smooth 60 frames per
second and depending on the size of your
image that's not the case if you're
doing this in JavaScript you can do this
in JavaScript to some extent but you're
probably not gonna be able to do large
images and be able to do all this for
exactly the same reason as before which
is that every single one of these pixels
is being considered at the same time and
last it's not a WebGL talk without a
particles demo particles are cool here
we're using GL position instead of GL
frag color which is the equivalent
version for the vertex shader which
basically says take some data and swirl
it around you see a sign you see a
cosign you know you're talking about
something swirly hey so we got one pixel
that even visible no not really
okay well that's some more I can see it
on my screen there we go some of them
are showing up now we're up to sixth and
this is gonna take forever and I have to
finish on time they said there we go 200
more more more more there we go there's
a hundred thousand this is about work so
I'm still going at about 60 frames per
second here on my little MacBook Air
that is slowly trying to rise from the
podium on my power book at work I was
trying this out I could get over a
million pixels going before it started
to even
budge yeah that's pretty pretty bad but
still better than if you tried to do a
million pixels in JavaScript so why is
it so powerful you probably guess
because I've said it like five times
because WebGL lets us pass data off to
the graphics card it can do all of this
math at once so you have two main
engines inside your computer you have a
CPU which is your something processing
unit I'm gonna say central but I think
I'm wrong someone tweeted me that I'm
completely wrong about that I am yes I'd
like being right which is a general
purpose tool it can do lots of things
and it can do them pretty well but not
as well as a specialized tool your GPU
your graphics processing unit is a
specialized tool what it does is takes
lots of small operation and does them in
parallel this tweet was remarkably
fortuitously time it came out just like
a week before when I was getting the
slides ready suppose you wanted to do
thousands of kindergarteners math
homework at the same time on the GPU and
that's exactly what we want to do is
lots of little simple math operations
but all at once so someone noticed wait
a second we could do something beyond
graphics here it happens that graphics
can generally be represented as lots of
parallel small math operations but
there's other things that are lots of
small math operations all at once
there's lots of things we do in in
research in math in you know all sorts
of regions where that's useful so this
sort of construct of the data pipelines
that's meant to draw graphics is not
ideal if you just want to get down to
the actual math and so they came up with
OpenCL as a complement to OpenGL and so
if OpenGL lets but WebGL lets us do
OpenGL on the web what lets us do OpenCL
on the web it's web CL and it's coming
soon it's never it's never coming we're
it's been coming soon for a very long
time and it doesn't seem like it's ever
gonna get here because the the specs and
the standards for the other side of
things have evolved past where it is
there's compute shaders which is an even
more ridiculous stretching of the
shaders nomenclature it's also coming
soon for a while there it was kind of
looking like it might actually come soon
and now it's looking like it's probably
gonna be replaced by something else also
but we might get to continue traders so
we're developers we like Bill
building things if they don't give us
the tools we build them ourselves so how
could we do this well we can get data in
right let's really good at that already
we can do the math but we have to get it
out so is there a way there is a way and
it's pixels in fact it's the only way
but thankfully that two-way arrow with
the canvas means that we can pull data
out of it in a basically serialized
pixel format which is just numbers and
that's all we need for math there are a
few implementation challenges there's
lots of little niggly things as far as
getting all this to work smoothly but
there is one that is not work around a
bowl and that's serialization it takes a
time and effort to get data into the
WebGL framework and it takes even more
to get it out of the canvas in fact it's
incredibly slow to pull pixels from a
canvas nan anyway you'd probably notice
in normal web operations but if you're
trying to do lots and lots of pixels in
and pixels out it adds up really fast
and so we come to an example that
actually works matrix multiplication
for those who don't know or who have not
taken when your algebra since many years
ago like me and had to go pull out the
definition of matrix multiplication for
this demo this is matrix multiplication
so it's just a fancy way of saying a
matrix is just a table of data
multiplication is exactly like it is
with normal numbers but we're gonna
define it on two different tables of
numbers these column and row highlights
are not done with that horrible CSS hack
but I am gonna go back and edit them so
that they are in the future because that
was cool and weird so yeah so that
highlight the top left cell is going to
be the sum of the product of the first
row of the left and the first column on
the right so if this example will be 1
times 9 plus 2 times 4 the only way I've
ever had this explained to me that makes
sense is you take the left one you
rotate it and then you slide it through
if you are not a spatial learner that is
absolutely no use to do and I'm sorry
there are a lot of resources on the web
to try and explain it in different ways
and hopefully one of them will make
sense for you there so you can see that
bottom left notice the bottom row and so
on and so on basically we're just doing
a lot of kindergartners math
and you can see that we're basically in
a pass in the two input matrices as
images because of reasons and we're
going to iterate through for each
product cell we're gonna iterate through
the row of 1 and the column of the other
do a bunch of math and output it as a
color it turns out a color is nothing
more than four bytes and you can fit a
decent number of numbers into four bytes
all right so it's demo time all right so
here's our 2x2 again so this should be 1
times 5 plus 5 times 5 which is 30 yeah
yeah it's 30 good I succeeded in
kindergartners math homework so you can
see that that's 1 times 0 plus 5 times 8
that's 40 it's so on its own all right
so that's 2 by 2 and now let's do it on
the GPU and it's the same which is good
it's really bad when you're trying to
make a new implementation and it doesn't
agree with the one that you know is
right so it's correct but it's really
slow right we got point 4 milliseconds
on the Left 28 on the right that's a lot
more that's like 60 times slower which
is really bad so let's try this with the
3 by 3
all right that's still really fast on
the CPU and not so fast on the GPU and
all right let's let's try bigger let's
go up to 64 I'm showing a 3x3 slice here
cuz I don't want to show 64 by 64
columns and rows on the slide 4 times
because no one could read anything just
gonna have to trust me that they're all
here at 4 to 6 all right what's sort of
actually we're faster now in the GPU by
a little bit there's a lot of noise down
at this side so I'm never sure if this
one's gonna come out this way uh let's
just go all the way so this is a 1024 by
1024 matrix where we're gonna be
multiplying so that's a million elements
in each matrix that's a lot of math all
right and now we sit around for about 3
minutes but I will keep talking to you
because otherwise would be really boring
so this is where I just talked about
random things today let's talk about so
a little spinner in the middle is just a
little div it's got you know width and a
height its position apps
there's a CSS transform as you probably
heard today if you didn't already know
is CSS transference happen on the GPU
which is great right now I'm not gonna
open dev tools because I don't want to
risk hosing this and having to do this
all over again
we're just hammering the CPU the
JavaScript implementation of this
multiplication is just iterating through
math and math and math and math and the
whole thing here is basically
unresponsive but that spinner is still
spinning and you'd think oh that's cool
it's because it's hardware accelerates
on the GPU and it's really great and
that's true except to actually get this
spinner going you have to do work on the
CPU so if I started tried to start
calculating the CPU version of the
matrix multiplication and start that
spinning at exactly the same time it
wouldn't work because the CPU will get
locked up before the browser has a
chance to add the class to the spinner
which enables it renders it and ships it
off to the GPU to spin so that was a fun
little lesson here another interesting
lesson is that whatever is doing that
spinning whatever timer that's doing all
of that is not on the main thread
because it's still spinning right now so
even though the rendering is being done
on the GPU something has to tell the GPU
okay now it's time to tick that there's
no time built into most GPU framework so
something is firing off saying keep
spinning that and it's not doing it on
the main thread and that's cool if
you're really big nerd like me uh let's
see I forgot to start my timer I'm just
gonna have to keep talking about
anything what else do we have to talk
about here I hope this is it hasn't
actually popped up the little warning
usually it does my computer's to be
feeling very kind to me today or it's
not doing any work at all and I'm just
gonna sit here making things up until I
run out of time and they like take the
cane to pull me off the stage usually it
pops up the little you're the thread on
tab whatever this tab is called has
become unresponsive do you want to
interrupt it and it turns out if you
don't click that thing it's still doing
work on the background so that little
pop-up thing is really just a courtesy
chance to get you to kill it it doesn't
it isn't no way stopping the completely
of control JavaScript execution which is
going on right now which is kind of cool
and still hope this works
I'll just keep waiting it's probably
working see last time I did this I
talked too long and actually to stop
talking about random things well when
that the answer came up this time of
course I completely ran out of things to
talk about way too early you have to you
know prepare material next time oh yeah
what about the what is the local sports
team here in Iceland other fun things
that learned about while working on this
project oh here's another fun thing the
way this is working
it's just hung for a second the way this
is working is basically a GPU shader
code gets all compiled and shipped off
to the WebGL but oh yeah all right whoo
okay 200 and we're into the range of
benchmarking here where milliseconds is
kind of a goofy thing to be measuring
this in but that is 200 let's it's three
and a half minutes that's a really
really long time as a benchmark that's
that's the sort of thing where it's like
why are you in benchmarking this this is
silly all right let's do the GPU I guess
I guess you get another story ready just
in case no we're fine so that's faster
that's about well that the GPU is a
little slow today which makes this math
earlier easier so that's about 200
something times faster that's that's
better
that's that's way better
all right cool so why well all right
this is big no notation and I promise
it's the last really Matthew thing in
the talk basically to calculate an N by
n matrix that's a million times a
million and then for every one of those
output cells you have to go through a
row in a column so that's n cubed if n
is the width of the matrix because we
can do every single output cell at once
on the GPU
we can be finished in n the earlier edge
finder is N squared if you do it because
you have to step through every pixel and
it's constant time on the GPU which is
constant times awesome alright so for
those who don't have like a visceral
understanding of what those those
numbers mean and you got the bottom line
and squared is the purple one a constant
is a constant and n cubed is the Big O
so this is N equals zero to five so this
is like those first two examples we did
here there and already N cubed is just
running away from zero to ten around a
hundred we can't even see and anymore
and N squared is looking pretty n ish
and yeah 1024 which we just did you
can't even see the lower lines there
because n cube just gets so big so fast
so that's why we get so much gain from
doing all these things in parallel all
right this is awesome we've got a
working proof of concept we've shown 200
X speed gains this is amazing let's go
do really cool stuff with this all right
we can do hash collision are you a white
hat hacker you can make sure your
passwords are secure are you a black hat
hacker you can crack people's hat
passwords we can do Bitcoin mine
basically all Bitcoin mining happens on
the GPU in fact the original thought
process that went into this talk was it
would be cool to have a distributed
website where people could pay their way
not through micro transactions or
anything like that but just by crunching
bitcoins for the site owner it's a nice
little background payment system and
they wouldn't have to install anything
just drop a script and it would run but
you want to be able to do it on the GPU
because that's how you do Bitcoin mining
media encoding a lot of media encoding
you can do really fast if you can
paralyze it break it up into chunks and
then you encode it machine learning is
basically again just a lot of
kindergarteners doing math which you
know in all senses of the words signal
analysis and process this is a little
cheating because audio is really just
the same as video it's all just media
but it's kind of different cuz it's
sound alright protein folding you might
notice some of these are sounding really
familiar they sound a lot like things
you can download screen savers for
because these are highly chunk able
parallelizable tasks that benefit a lot
from running on the graphics card
alright actual application this is the
big payoff nope can't do have collision
can't do Bitcoin mining can't do media
encoding
you might be able to machine-learning
signal analysis and protein folding I'm
intrigued by possibly getting these to
work but the first three big obvious
things you could do here no all right
why this is not my cat if I had I do
have a cat she would get into this
trouble if I had blinds which I don't so
the only thing saving this from being my
cat is I don't actually have blinds like
that all right this is the big one there
are no bit operations in the current
version of the shader language server
it's supplied by WebGL you need bit
operations for basically anything you
want to do with a fancy algorithm very
very smart people have spent the last 40
or 50 years coming up with really good
ways to do things with bits because all
our computers run on bits so if you
design your algorithm using bit
operations you can usually optimize them
really well and we don't have any of
those that's why we can't do hashes we
can't do Bitcoin mining which is
basically just hashes can't do any of
the other fun stuff boo unresponsive
window so if you paid really close
attention you might have seen the
spinner actually freezes a little bit
during the WebGL version and the reason
is because if you're hammering your
graphics card having it do nothing but
kindergarten or math then it can't do
anything else like draw your window as
it changes it's it's the the normal
problem we have at JavaScript developers
is Oh get it onto the GPU so that it's
not hogging up the main thread here we
put too much stuff on the GPU and you've
lost everything again and oh it's a
little time s this is a fun little
landmine it turns out different
operating systems have different
thresholds at which they will say no
your shaders been running too long it's
time for you to just stop and there's no
error there's no guaranteed return state
sometimes it'll give you something
sometimes it'll just return a blank
pixel and you just hit these completely
without any warning and it's terrible
when you're trying to figure out why
your code doesn't work all right what do
we need to make it work this is a big
one it's super easy we're probably not
gonna get it but I can still hope in
newer versions of the shader language in
OpenGL have bit operations as much other
cool stuff and if they just implemented
them in WebGL we'd have all of that but
there's a new graphic standard coming
out there's a few new graphic standard
coming out one is Vulcan there's also
apples metal and there's always been
Microsoft's direct3d
and it seems more likely that we'll get
a web version of one of those than a
increase in web GL but I can always hope
canvas WebGL in the web worker Mozilla I
believe has this implemented last time I
checked they were announcing it and I
believe it works now so this is great
this means that you can take all of this
work and the serialization and all of
that which does hog up the main thread
you can push it off in a web worker and
it will get all of that off for you all
right let me sum up WebGL is awesome
graphics are fun we can do really crazy
things if we want to try and push it
really far and with a little bit of help
we could actually make this into
practical applications that's it thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
