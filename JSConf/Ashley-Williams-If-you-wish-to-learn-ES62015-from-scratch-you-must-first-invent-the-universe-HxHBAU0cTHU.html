Queens actually a neighborhood called
Ridgewood two blocks over from Brooklyn
I actually walked between the border
every day I have some slides here if
you'd like to follow along I recommend
writing it down just because I'm about
to quote a lot of people and so the
reading list for this is well documented
in the slides and I suggest that you
check it out so yeah hi I'm a Jew dubs
you might know me from Twitter where I'm
very prolific I don't recommend you
follow me i always apologize when I hear
that happen so wouldn't do it so I'm
from the United States but I like to say
that these are more of my red white and
blue I took these pictures when i was in
cologne this is actually my second trip
to germany this month which is pretty
cool because i really really really like
it here oh this is something I treated
you guys are really awesome and I really
really dig it so yeah I am a software
engineer at the Mozilla Foundation and
you guys might have gone upstairs if you
haven't check it out and at the end of
this talk there's a chance that you
might be able to get some swag from them
they've got some really cool swag and I
have some for you alright so at the
Mozilla Foundation a lot of people don't
really know exactly what we do but the
way we talk about our mission is that we
want to foster universal open web
literacy so that's kind of a mouthful
but the idea is that we really want
people to be ethical consumers and
creators on the web and that can be a
lot and I'm not going to really dive
into almost any of that but it's a cause
that's important to me instead what I'm
going to say is for me this means i like
to think about thinking especially the
type of thinking that happens when
people write code and this kind of idea
of mine my goal leads me to do projects
like this where i take the idea of how
people take things apart and try and
create new learning tools for them
you're going to hear throughout this
talk that I care a lot about learning
tools and I actually kind of think
everything is a learning tool so what's
my talk about who knows maybe we should
just talk about cows in space right
that's why you guys are here right to
hear about cousin space no all right
well so some people have talked about
art maybe we can talk about art this is
some cool art that i found on the
internet full of cool art ah but yeah
maybe maybe we'll talk about javascript
write javascript and maybe more
particular we'll talk about es6 right
yes 6 all right but what you're gonna
find and hopefully this doesn't
disappoint you but this talk is all
about a lot more than es6 and so i'm
going to start off by talking about the
idea of abstraction all right cows in
space though maintain that so this
wouldn't be a good talk if I didn't
quote Dykstra right this is what again a
good computer scientist would say and
here he defines abstraction he says the
effective exploitation of his kind of a
bad pronoun let's say their per hours of
abstraction must be regarded as one of
the most vital activities of a competent
programmer I didn't turn my phone off
whoops alright so again what we're
seeing here right is that when we are
doing programming in its most
fundamental we are abstracting so the
abstraction principle is defined by
Benjamin see Pearson one of his most
foundational books called types and
programming languages if you haven't
read it you should check it out but here
he says each significant piece of
functionality in a program should be
implemented in just one place in the
source code where similar functions are
carried out by distinct pieces of code
it is generally beneficial to combine
them into one by abstracting out the
varying parts and this should be
something that we're probably really
familiar with as developers for me this
is actually the joy of developing I love
refactoring things I love this feeling
of abstraction but I want to take this
idea and take it
further I want to get a little bit maybe
more academic or theoretical with it and
so to do that I obviously went to
Wikipedia which is definitely the
academic source here it says abstraction
tries to factor out details from a
common pattern so that programmers can
work close to the level of human thought
pause on that close to the level of
human thought we're going to come back
to this but that's pretty questionable
alright so we're close to the level of
human thought leaving out details which
matter in practice but are immaterial to
the problem being solved we're going to
flag that too in material to the problem
being solved we got Danger Danger all
right keep this in mind as we continue
all right so another little anecdote uh
I was the lead instructor at a boot camp
program in Brooklyn and if you have
questions about boot camps I understand
but this one was awesome basically
really took people who had never
programmed before but also were
unemployed so you had to meet a certain
criteria and then over the six months we
taught them to become developers and we
also got them jobs and so this was a
really really great program and it's
still funded today it's called the New
York City web development fellowship but
more important I think is that this is
really where I began to understand that
teaching was one of the fundamental
skills that a developer needs and so
about a week before I was going to start
I was at a ruby user group with the Dean
of the school and he was talking about
how great ruby is as a development
language it was designed to be read as
if it was spoken by a human being
consequently it is in English and this
was by a Japanese person which is
extremely complicated but either way
what he said was he's like look at this
Ruby each loop even your mom could
understand that sidebar that's not okay
moms are smart and cool do not be rude
all right so you're looking at this and
you're saying Oh Ruby is so great and
though you might be getting the sinking
mission that I don't agree with him uh I
will say that at the core he had a
really important thing to say all right
javascript maybe too much punctuation he
is saying programs must be written for
people to read and only incidentally for
machines to execute and this is a really
important thing to understand all right
the people who are interfacing with your
code are primarily people the computers
involves are kind of over here the
people maintaining it the people using
it the people writing it all right they
are the people interacting you have to
realize that they are not computers but
the idea of people being able to read
something is tough this is my door in
Queens and you can see here I wrote some
notes and then you can see down here the
UPS person saying nope we miss you and
we could not open the door so again
understanding what the level of human
thought is what people can read and
understand is a tricky thing so another
anecdote and as you may have guessed I
am NOT going to come out on Ruby's side
here so I was sitting at my computer and
my assistant instructor was sitting in
front of the class and he was teaching
iteration all right iteration is hard
for beginners and I could hear just
through the one side of my headphones it
was not going well at all and this has
been going on for a while and so if any
of you guys know me I decided to do
something bold and that's quite in my
nature and so what I did is I
interrupted the class and I said hey I'd
like you for a second to ignore all of
the Ruby you just learned this probably
shouldn't be hard because you're
extremely irritated and frustrated with
it right now and then what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna teach you iteration using a
language you don't know and they're like
that sounds like a bad idea like I know
I know but look just let me try this is
already kind of terrible let's let's
just roll with it and so that's exactly
what I did what I'd like to point out
here is we understand that the concept
of iteration
is really three concepts state condition
increment in that Ruby that's all hidden
away inside that keyword each but in the
JavaScript I can point to it right there
because it was exposed by the syntax the
developers that I were teaching were
able to see that and I could feel more
control over it all right it exposed the
underlying concepts that the abstraction
hit away it has experienced developers
we love that it's hidden away but
beginners hated it's very very confusing
it's this idea of magic which sometimes
we think is good for beginners but it
turns out that it's not all right so my
secret physicist boyfriend Richard five
minutes has something to say about this
a bit he says the real problem in speech
is not precise language the problem is
clear language it is really quite
impossible to say anything with absolute
precision unless that thing is so
abstracted from the real world as to not
represent any real thing and so remember
with Ruby we were trying to be real
we're trying to be human language all
right and so we have these kinds of
dichotomies that we run into the desire
to be precise but also the desire to be
clear and at the same time we also want
to be abstract because we don't want to
be writing out everything but there's
also a desire to map things towards
reality so they're easier to reason
about all right and so Pablo Picasso
kind of leads us in a direction he says
there is no abstract art you must always
start with something afterward you can
remove all traces of reality so we kind
of have an origin problem here when
we're designing programming languages
where do we start on the edges of these
dichotomies all right this is my
favorite slide from every conference
talk ever you may have seen it already
but what I want to imply is with
programming languages we're often doing
this to our developers all right so if
you can't read it it says
how to draw an owl draw some circles
draw the rest of the fucking owl that is
the only curse word in this talk unless
I mess up alright so but we need to
understand is both of these instructions
and the instructions themselves are
terrible this is no good all right we're
in this kind of lock all right and this
is all this is from Brooklyn not queens
so you can kind of be right all right
we're stuck here and so hopefully some
of you got the reference the clickbait
eNOS of my title which is I'm going to
be walking you through a little bit of
some Carl Sagan all right and he says
when we're doing this we need to think
about thinking all right and for him he
says the journey starts here so let's
talk about cows in space right yeah you
guys remember that Towson space from our
man Pablo Picasso all right all right so
when we think about thinking we need to
know humans are amazing at pattern
recognition we're able to look at
something like this and see this you see
it right now well someone saw and
convinced everyone because then we have
this right a cow in space so we need to
realize when we do this pattern
recognition all right we recognize
patterns and when we name them we're
building our abstractions now this is a
very dangerous activity because bad
abstractions are probably one of the
most dangerous things out there so you
might be familiar with horoscopes the
entire field of cosmology has come out
of this all right and people spend so
much time and money and worrying about
it this is my horoscope from today maybe
it's right I don't know maybe I'm wrong
about this being a false abstraction i
also had this one which told me that i
have nothing to worry about you guys are
charming so we'll see how that works out
all right so what I'm trying to say here
is that when we are recognizing patterns
building abstractions paving the cow
paths yes I'm sticking with this
metaphor we need to be very careful all
right because again bad abstractions are
extremely dangerous so now let's talk
about JavaScript all right javascript
has been a delightful beginning
programming language because it has left
a lot of abstractions and that's all
about to change so September 28th 1980
is when javascript was invented come on
guys really that's not true all right no
that's when they show cosmos came out
and again this was by Carl Sagan and the
key to this show was to make available
the underlying scientific concepts that
ruled our universe make that available
to the layperson and this is extremely
important all right and in doing so he
kind of had this catchphrase where he
said if you wish to make an apple pie
from scratch you must first invent the
universe and that is to say that to
really understand what's going on in our
world understanding the fundamental
concept is extremely important I heard
this and I was like yes this is the
issue we have with es6 oh yeah by the
way I'm not going to say that he has 6
2015 thing if you get upset about that I
don't care all right so this wasn't girl
say again this is actually be but I'd
like to think that he supports this
cause all right so let's talk about es6
alright so as jenna mentioned we're
going to read some of the spec now yay
all right so ekman script syntax is
relaxed to enable it to serve as an
easy-to-use scripting language now
relaxing is cool I love being in Germany
I like relaxing around here have some
beers but it's not always the right
message that's a real thing that was a
first message on the okcupid dating app
all right is is relaxation really the
problem that javascript is trying to
solve is divert their not enough
relaxing languages out there and so we
have javascript now probably not right
so what problem is JavaScript trying to
solve like mobile JavaScript's legacy
you and we look back at it as this like
strange artifact from computer science
and that's a really heavy question and I
don't really know the answer but I think
it's going to have something to do with
this all right and this is Laurie Voss
CTO of em p.m. and he says fundamentally
it's hard to think of a compelling
reason a brand new web dev would learn
two languages when they can just learn
JavaScript now that might sound pretty
controversial they follow up by saying
if I could pick any language in the
world to use them both the server and
the client it might not be JavaScript
but we don't get to pick so let's think
about that and then we'll talk about
ekman script six classes you can tell
what I'm going to say right robot there
all right so sugar makes me sick but
like literally it makes me sick I have
type 1 diabetes up but also syntactic
sugar makes me nervous unspectacular
sugar makes me nervous because again we
see that syntax always obfuscates these
underlying concepts so back to the spec
even though ekman script includes syntax
for class definitions acma script
objects are not fundamentally
class-based all right so you might not
need class syntax all right so this is a
man who if any if you take anything out
of this talk take this away he says
remember that all models are wrong the
practical question is how wrong do they
have to be to not be useful won't that's
it in all right so how long are we all
right so in a class-based
object-oriented language in general
state is carried by instances methods
are carried by classes and inheritance
is only if structure and behavior an
ECMO script the state and methods are
carried by objects well structure
behavior end state are all inherited
alright so that might be a little bit
difficult to parse if you've never read
this before really dealt with them so
I'm going to use a blog post by this guy
named Reagan Walt who I'm going to shout
out for being awesome for saying stuff
like this he wrote a blog post called
prototypes or not classes we're
basically and I won't read this to you
he explains the idea that classes are
described as often as boiler plates
alright their blueprints the class is
the blueprint and then we make a house
from it alright and the house is the
object but that's not true with es6
dropship classes our model homes the
idea here is that you have a model home
and you can build a house based on it
and you could leave the model home empty
but someone could move in and in that
sense things get a little tricky all
right so what we understand here is that
we have a syntax that cloak Lee really
obfuscates the underlying functionality
all right and so you might be thinking
that I'm saying you know you know
JavaScript classes are there objects
there they're not classes really and
maybe go home tc39 you're drunk this is
me and that is ginger ale all right but
no that's not what I'm saying at all i'm
saying this is not a hate talk in any
way shape or form instead what I'm
hoping to suggest here is that we take a
different perspective when we're
evaluating new features for language and
that that perspective is the educational
one and so I do want to mention just
briefly all right that you could easily
shut me down by being with what even is
a class is that even defined and I'd be
like meet me afterwards and we can talk
about this this language which
introduced them it is super super
awesome all right so you might be
thinking that I'm trying to why wage
class warfare because I told you I was
an anarchist right this is near my
apartment here that's a real thing I
don't even want to deal with that all
right but instead what I'm trying to say
is that JavaScript might be trying to do
a lot of things and not be any of them
if you ever go to Penn Station this is
by Madison Square Garden it wasn't open
when I took the picture but I intend to
return yeah so uh Leslie Lamport has
this amazing talk all thinking for
programmers and in this talk he says
writing is nature's way of letting you
know how sloppy your thinking is and so
I like to take that and I say teaching
is nature's way of letting you know how
sloppy your understanding its how many
people in here have ever topped
programming everyone who has their hand
down do it it is by far the own like one
of the best ways to improve your
programming skills alright so those
fancy people who were talking about
programming needing to be able to be
read by humans they wrote this amazing
book alright and this is a huge change
in computer science education what they
said is we need to be teaching
programming concepts not language
features when we're programming we need
to understand the activities the
abstractions that we're building not
where to put a semicolon all right and
this is super important when we think
about the idea that we have programming
concepts that conflict with our syntax
in javascript javascript will be the
introduction to programming concepts for
an entire generation of developers
whether we like it or not and so we need
to be cognizant of this idea and 2.2
miles this talk we need to be empathetic
of our users our javascript users which
is going to be people learning
programming all right we need to be
thinking about the problem that's being
solved and oftentimes the problem that
javascript is solving is teaching people
how to program so to follow up that book
sicp written by abelson and Sussman was
this excellent person named peter van
roy and so what I'm not trying to say is
that these new features are making
JavaScript a terrible programming
language but something a little bit
different so he came up with this book
that followed it up and he said we need
to teach programming as a unified
discipline and the way he did that in
here
class alright was to talk about
programming languages as tools
programming languages solve problems the
solutions that they provide combined
with those problems all right to be
paradigms and so preparing the images
are able to do well at one programming
paradigm sometimes they do better at
others but there's not necessarily any
bad programming language all right and
so when he tied his classes he would
insist that people start from the
beginning to invent the universe you
might say and what he did is he had them
build an entire kernel and he says a
good way to organize a programming
course is to start with a simple
language and then to extend this
language gradually so I'm obviously
saying all right we must invent the
universe when we teach programming we
need to make sure that we teach the
underlying concepts before we teach the
abstractions you need to feel the pain
before you know how do you use that tool
all right so obviously every beginner
sure at a current language right this is
a really terrible idea no one should
ever do that unless yeah just no all
right but what we can take from this is
this idea of creative extension all
right and we actually are kind of
familiar with this all right Ron
Jeffries who did extreme programming
even know if that's a thing anymore but
this is something that we know always
implement things when you actually need
them never when you just foresee that
you need them don't pre optimize all
right so what we need to know is that
prototypal inheritance is a big part of
the JavaScript universe we might think
classes are useful but they're not good
for teaching and we should not start
with them all right this is how the
apple pie gets made vegan friendly
metaphors all right so this is a tldr
slide so if you go back as a teacher I
always kind of like giving it index for
my points all right but I'm trying to
say is that when we look at programming
languages we need to be empathetic to
our audience and we also need to
understand um that abstraction is a
difficult thing for beginners all right
and that no matter what we do with our
language when we teach we need to start
at the beginning and now I'm going to
take the last five minutes I have to
kind of put you guys on call because I
have to
kind of kumbaya question right what do
we even mean when we talk about
programming right so this is one of my
favorite philosophers Martin Heidegger
and you wrote this book called what is
called thinking which is a very bad
translation of a German that I'm not
entirely sure about pronounce either but
in it he says this the most
thought-provoking thing in our thought
provoking time is that we are still not
thinking and you might see where I'm
going with this because i'm going to ask
are we programming yet when we look at
the JavaScript language remember the
Dykstra said abstraction is at the core
do you feel like that's what you spend
most of your time doing or is it dias
lint is it I missed a semicolon all
right a lot of people like to think that
things that are difficult like C++ all
right is made to be difficult to make
sure that you're a good programmer and
doing it right but I don't think that's
a good idea at all all right there are
people in the Academy who are taking
this idea seriously and really trying to
think about what programming should be
and as they design language is designing
for that all right and it's frustrating
to me because this seems to only be
happening in the Academy like MIT with
scratch why are we not looking at that
in the industry and I think it's
something that we should be doing so
Thomas Kuhn is a philosopher and a
scientist and you wrote in this great
book the structure of scientific
revolutions that scientists worked for
models acquired through education and
through subsequent exposure to
literature often without quite knowing
or needing to know what characteristics
have given these models the status of
community paradigms why do we want
classes are we sure that's the right
thing or did just Ruby do it and a bunch
of other people did it and now we've
decided that we need to catch up is that
the perspective we really should be
taking so we have an awesome opportunity
to more radically think about how we
extend
and JavaScript all right we can think
more radically about how we build the
abstractions and which ones we want to
build all right I'll leave you with this
Carl Sagan says it is far better to
grasp the universe as it really is than
to persist in delusion however
satisfying and reassuring so I ask you
reconsider your ontology think about it
a lot is this the language of these the
abstractions that we need and always
stay a beginner thank you
alright
alright i have a final thing and i
always like to take this back to my
students because as I said this is where
I've learned everything they have built
a kind of silly website called clap for
Ashley and if you tweet at this hashtag
it will pop up and clap but I asked and
as I mentioned the Mozilla swag before
if you could tweet something about how
you're going to stay a beginner or
commit yourself to teaching other
beginners we've got some really cool
Mozilla bags that I will hand out to
people who tweet great stuff so again
thank you and I'll leave this here if
anybody wants to dive in assuming that
the internet works this is always
awkward cuz it's like no one's clapping
for me I understand it might be broken
