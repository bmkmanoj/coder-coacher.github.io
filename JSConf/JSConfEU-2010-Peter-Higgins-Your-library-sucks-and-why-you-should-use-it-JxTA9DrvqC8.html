down and everyone's going the direction
they choose my title is two slides
because it doesn't quite fit I mean
incredible font size of that here there
are absolutely photographs in this talk
there are no words that are nails and I
will not mention the word node outside
of saying I'm not going to mention the
word nodejs so beyond that i am peter
Higgins I am the dojo toolkit project
lead I am a JavaScript engineer at just
which was acquired by a Connelly called
a Baconian I work in advertising
theoretically I'm mostly just a
JavaScript hacker within the company
that does whatever I blog very very
frequently code Twitter and beer
drinking expert I did not make it to
oktoberfest with the rest of the
beer-drinking experts that are in this
crowd I'm sure but that's those are my
absolute best qualifications and I am
besides being a regular JavaScript
engineer the corner of the phrase it's
just JavaScript which is Lester auditory
than it sounds a lot of people
especially job engineers and whatnot
will say oh oh yeah exactly it's just
JavaScript it's not worth our time it's
not worth thinking about but it's
exactly the opposite in fact that the
principle is its JavaScript it's lovable
it's simple it's a great language
probably the most compelling aspect of
it is the ubiquity of it which is huge
right and we'll get into that a little
bit later but in the end it's all just
JavaScript it's just bits and bytes and
whatever that we've formed and mangled
it's self healing which is part of the
elegance are
the language itself and of course it's
promiscuous which is just a great word I
use for for something else in fact so
I'm not going to pretend to be as
knowledgeable or well respected as mr.
crockford but i have my own good parts
and I don't necessarily agree with his
good parts whatever these are my
favorite good parts right we've got
context very very simple context
switching we get applying a call and
which is great and then we have coming
in the spec the kind of the bind partial
argument I call it hitch because that's
what dojo calls it we've had this
forever aop aspect-oriented iming is
super super cool i'm sure i'm just kind
of preaching to the choir at this with
these bullets but these are mine
prototypes of course also pretty cool
and then module loading which is the
hottest thing that javascript has offer
and then these are the bad parts i spent
two and a half hours staring at this
slide trying to come up with my least
favorite parts of javascript and this is
all i could do it's like the date that
took from java and we added our own
extra evil to it and it's a horrible
horrible implementation done is designed
with evil of course which is the reason
these libraries ultimately popped up in
the first place right and then crockford
will tell us with an email are allegedly
or also inherently evil I call them
allegedly evil but they're not entirely
evil so these are the libraries that
have three years since 2005 kind of
bubble to the top right we've got dojo
which is mine right and I UI which is
another way we've got Tom here
they to tell you about why you i know'd
which is awesome and then the tools in
prototype which i put on the same line
because they they both kind of follow
the same philosophies and principles um
and I ran out of bullets space on the
page so i had to put them because i
wanted to include fuse jas as well this
one doesn't exist yet our that's right
and John David Dalton may tell you about
this paper where in the coming days I'm
excited to see it because Jones and
programming and I'm interested to see
what the actual outcome of this is embed
j/s is another one that no one's ever
move but hopefully will be coming out
very nice it's a from exceeding a crew
bunch of German kids yeah i saw from
here ok and of course you know jquery
everyone's heard of that one and then of
course there is your own right it every
one of you I'm sure has your own
miniature library thing that you've done
at some point in your life that that is
there so these are the libraries that
exist in the mainstream right the ones
that get talked about all the time I'm
sure I'm offending someone did I forget
any major major library that I should
have no I don't see anyone complaining
well creaks to oh my god how did I
forget that one it's too hard to
pronounce that's that's what it is so
yes it cooks ooh is another one there
even on my little task speed thing so
and actually the fuse j/s developer john
made an interesting point he actually
quoted dijo words endless in his summary
that we're all ending up looking like
jquery in the end and now it's just a
pissing contest between size and speed
which I disagree with two to a number of
a number of points but it is basically
that anymore and that's why it's just
JavaScript right we're not doing
anything we're not doing nothing
revolutionary anymore we've done
everything just about everything we
possibly can in the browser and when we
kind of let into the server side now so
the first point is is a lovable little
bit simple language it's the the ease in
which anyone can get started is is
tremendous all you have to have is the
browser hey there I'm coming back so has
anybody want me to just talk about note
for the rest of the talk yeah all right
nice I'll just leave that there and i'll
try not to move too much Oh actually
it's probably a bad idea so the simple
language it's beautiful and in the last
couple years we've seen many movies i
just say millions because it's a great
number right eleventy billion
coming into this world quick show of
hands who is relatively new to java
script and just here because it just
penetrated the server officially nice
one guy nice somebody buy that guy a
beer he's got a lot to learn of
developers so I say to people you should
not use a library you should learn
JavaScript first you should have some
fundamental understanding of JavaScript
and on before you get into any of this
stuff and it's it's evident in various
IRC support films and deaf channels that
a lot of people don't and it's it's
scary and this is the next generation of
developers that are coming up to us and
it's our job as experienced developers
to stop them the friendly doing stupid
things and and be very very vocal about
it we should know enough about
JavaScript to have very strong feelings
against it we should know what we don't
like and what we do like and what are
the positive and negative whatever we
should learn to supplement those parts
right we should know how to abstract
around something that's broken and fix
it for ourselves and once you've done
that it's not so much a crush on you as
it is a tool this is giving me
difficulties okay sorry and don't give a
little prototype right that's one of the
most exciting parts or is one of my
boats for for why it's so good don't be
afraid of it if you don't know that
dollar sign function is an alias two
dollars on prototype you should quit or
find someone that does and have them
explain to you how wonderful world this
is in the end so promiscuous loose
typing I don't want anyone elses
languages coming to this language I
don't enjoy this is me personally right
I don't
a the idea of you need to know that it's
a number needing to know that it's a
string or forcing that that upon anybody
I can do this myself I know I've written
the function I own the api's over it in
the RPC it's just jason and if it fits
in Jason it can only come through and we
can mix it and match it and do whatever
we want so it's a very promiscuous
language it just kind of allows you to
do whatever it is also so healing
anything that's wrong with it we can fix
probably the most evident thing is this
is my favorite absolute top most
favorite thing to do in javascript basic
a OB is anyone not entirely comfortable
with the idea of call and apply sure
phrase that differently can I see a show
of hands of people that are entirely
comfortable with call and apply all
right because you know is going to say
like yeah I don't know how to do
anything but it said I thought that was
horribly mean if no but it's really a
call reply what make JavaScript very
very very simple to fix so here I've
decided that the old function in the new
space is terrible it's a deadly it's not
terrible enough but I'm just not
recalling it later on that the point is
before and after this old function apply
I can do whatever the hell I want to the
arguments to to the scope I don't have
to apply it in that context this is a
wonderful thing so it's something you
can fix it there's nothing that it's and
what happens is we get into a
philosophical debate about how to fix it
and instead of there's basically two
ways to fix these things as we can fix
them by wrapping them or we can fix them
by extending native prototypes we're
working by by extending
similar language itself so perfect
example is we need a trial function a
lot of orientations don't have a trim
function which is certainly what
speaking to the server side before these
modern modern rendering engine
interpreters on the server side but for
the rest of us they're doing clients I
self we still don't so the history no
trim if we do let's use the native and
the fun stuff down here is again up for
discussion right there's a 100 million
ways we got Steve Leviathan I believe
doing a huge like performance s on
what's the fastest string trim where we
can't really defer to faster CPU cycles
in the end it's like oh great it's like
our processes are going to get huge we
can do whatever we want as long as it's
you know does what it says it's going to
do this falls apart and then I didn't
know philosophical bit is that what if
somebody put a string prototype trim on
there is faulty what if what if it
didn't really trim and what if they just
picked that name and put it on string
yeah well well screwed because I
instantly becomes recomment I actually
choose chose my lab a specifically to
because I wanted the most generic
library there could be and I want to
steal the google searching for thou my
library which contacts manipulation
right same exact same exact pattern we
have bind in the upcoming ekman which is
awesome but in reality we will have it
in all of the you know 150 billion 1.5
billion implementations that already
exist so what do we do about that do we
turn it on the functional trying it on
the function prototype and that our
implementation is right or do we wrap it
as we're doing here the ques- banana
splits i buy a beer for whomever can
tell me why this is wrong i'll wait no
it is not to spec find okay so partial
arguments the rest of the arguments that
are you to pass to the actual binding
are as the first arguments to whatever
so we need we need to call a rate
prototype sighs in the context of
whatever the arguments to get them and
then shift them off to because we're
using to function so okay and then again
we're doing that how many times you want
to type out a ray prototype slice call
whatever you need a ture a function with
a basic to a function that just wraps
that so we can pass it arguments or
whatever again so we have marveled 2a
equals function array index whatever so
we should do that we supplemented
supplement it for the rest of the insane
browsers that do not have this and then
we'll maintain API compatibility and
this is kind of its kind of abstract is
like I told you I anything sex yet but
I'm hoping to set up something right
here it's very very easy to abuse
JavaScript which is with these yay
herds of developers are come on I keep
singing code that looks like this and it
makes me want to quit really like I
don't enjoy it and it's we need to speak
to the people that are doing this it's
our job it's our responsibility as
talented JavaScript developers to to
stop people from doing that's of course
being that the selector is probably the
most inefficient way you can do this you
register click function and then
repeating the selection three times to
do this and then trigger the click
function which then goes back through a
bunch of work to just call the function
really that you just set up so in the
height of performance I wouldn't say
that to do that this is how you could
write thats an easy ugly code in dojo
for what it's worth it's just as bad
just as bad so I just here like this
right like a little function it's all
functional programming whatever make a
function with does some bar clicker
we bind the function to the click event
and then if we need to call it we just
call it we avoid all the overhead we
avoid all of the work we're avoiding the
triple look up the don't look up three
times to do this pretty basic step but
you would be surprised at how prominent
that code is this type of view source
the new view source of the web is look
at the script the metal can look at it
like whatever it does you know if you've
ever seen something like that like jetty
output from its jsps or john whatever
you like it's all just disgusting markup
so we're beyond actually trying to agree
on this like beautiful semantic markup
and we're getting into the JavaScript as
like what is the actual rendered dumb of
this look like like firebug formats it
for me now so that's what I actually
look at so the resource is um look at
the script and you can in front of it
and then you should be able to get that
information
to whomever actually wrote it and say
wow you're doing it terribly wrong so
that's our responsibility we need to
despite which library it is we need to
tell people how to do it right and the
importance of doing it right so the next
point being its ubiquity is part of what
makes it so great right we have with
building implementations of this and
back you know it's been a trend you read
slashdot this became our Linux right
it's any time a new device ever comes
out as but cannot run linux and the
answer is but it are you run JavaScript
so everything comes with the processor
everything is pure JavaScript ready in
some in some way or another right so the
device presentation is we have desktop
browsers we have mobile browsers we have
devices we have any kind of device
eventually has a browser in it right on
the server side we've always had Rhino
right so server javascript is not a new
thing it's just a little popular thing
and rental is horribly broken for a long
time but it's always been there you know
v8 spider monkey this is why server-side
javascript is becoming mainstream right
v8 i told myself i wouldn't say note but
well of course we've gotten our wall as
well back there it's huge it's
everywhere and then the future browsers
right like wouldn't it be great if you
could get a ground notification through
something like Jason an RPC type thing
when your laundry's done and instead of
like a bell it's like a growl awesome
the the usefulness of this in a simple
the Jason which you know haven't origins
in javascript is an awesome data
transport and it's native to all these
things that already speak it so it is
to make my poly foam aware of my washing
machine through just a few lines of
JavaScript and through whatever it is
right and I'm happy to making new
friends from here on out is where it
officially goes downhill I say that
conscious is piggybacking it's it's
piggybacking the hook that the
client-side developers have been doing
for the past I'd say seven years now
seven whatever modules we should be
fighting for that in language and not so
much worried about the implementation
that were that we're working with I
honestly believe that coming this kind
of disregarded the browser and that it's
being done by server-side developers and
with no regard for the initial the bread
and butter where the ubiquity of
JavaScript came from in the first place
mostly mostly related to modules there's
no doubt on the server side as well
which is see exactly exactly it's a the
bad parts back to the bad parts about
JavaScript it's the doll orientation was
written medieval and at we can all agree
on that but it's three that we've
learned and through researching an
actual practical application we've come
to terms we've come down to a single
reduced set of AP is that we're tolerant
of right like place it here use a
reference answer before and sort after
destroy whatever we don't have to think
about all the weird abstracts and the
index seat in the season summer so the
dog is evil there's no definite server
that's beautiful what do we do with all
these tools that are not done related
better tooling and that's we're coming
Jess comes in but they're not actually
providing
they're just kind of saying how it
should work it's a bit late I think I
think that we've done this on the fly
inside that that a lot of the cloud site
implementations for pure JavaScript
things should just kind of bubble up
anyway and unfortunately all the time
hotel right it's coming days is too late
to the game with had to search we've had
a client side and it's too early again
with regard to server side so all the
time time will tell bike shadow will get
us to the point where where we can all
actually agree I would love to actually
agree on anything in a language context
and we actually have them we've actually
already agreed on this to a degree or at
least to the point where we've taken
this implementation whatever it is the
NBC is pretty pretty definitive spec as
far as server side as far as the
language goes right and room so for
instance the arrays are a prototype it's
always banana it's showing up in things
but again you have the same problem it's
open i showing up in the newer things
which are not the browsers that we
already have the in an iceberg if you
can get something like chrome frame in
as Alex basically gave up on the client
side he admit defeat I don't know
whatever it is you decided that you
wanted to go forward this like okay I'm
tired of fixing for IE let's just fix IE
trendy thing is if you're not aware that
you should definitely take a look at it
but it implements you know same
JavaScript interpreters I eat so away
for each map filter but we're not even
doing it suspect none of us are none of
the libraries that I listed with the
exception of the vapor
may not walk over sparser raised
properly as says the spec but then
that's just another point that maybe we
don't need to walk over sparse raise
I've never I've never hit a thing but so
we've never had a use case where I
needed to use a sparser rate but the
spec says so the standards say so does
kind of just say that does come to JSA
we should fight the ECMO can be and say
like do they speak as a unified voice to
the ECMO committee because everyone's a
bit ultimately deciding the fate of our
language it would be nice to have had a
thing so what's what's the answer right
that's kind of an open question any
suggestions I do not mind at all
interruption and questions and and
criticism immediately no as an answer
good all right my name is I'm Lance
right you know the answer is as I've
shown that with the my library right is
just write a function an API for
yourself that fixes it wherever you want
defer to the moves well you can handle
sparse arrays if you want if you want to
follow this back I think such a trivial
pulpit it kind of becomes reappears in
everything so and we've got a jquery map
versus the map are these selections
there are lots of fun things that go and
i'm just going to say that it offends my
senses it it hurts every time I go to
use jQuery map if I ever do and but it
but at the same time the dojo map we do
this thing where you
those are up in the way and we actually
remember in the function complex item
index array so you can reference them
with all the string and ultimately
underwear conferences just got their new
function like normal function on
whatever but people like this and we
actually had to take a lot of it out
internally so that we could run in
things like air which don't allow new
functions or even being done so we don't
use it internally it's there for legacy
reasons I'm of the opinion that we
should just go back to spec and forget
the syntactic sugar so but there's
there's a lot wrong here portability
right so here's here's the different
ways I didn't know the API for a few so
i just called it one but i'm assuming
it's going to be spec standard base blah
blah blah item index access to the
original array and a second text ad yeah
that doesn't allow you to set context is
jQuery all the rest of them to do this
whole I don't the next thing and that's
it's really great so that we have the
run a wildly popular one that diverges
from this so do we do we all diverge
from this is that the right answer or do
we wait on them to fix their
implementation unfortunately it's called
each so they could implement it for each
and provide it but they haven't so
they're the point being that if you use
the North array for each anywhere in
your library say said prototype of that
the Android apart of it if you have if
you have something that's already
extending the native its and this is
simple to go back and forth the film
from server writing this like you can
extend all the prototypes you want to
use
if I inside sing for dojo it's if you
happen to have dojo in your server
environment which it's perfectly suited
for the API is the same there's no
different there's no different thing you
have to do you don't have to jump back
and forth between okay jquery each one
two three oh it's this within this i
lose the ability to set the context or f
ok i'll just use the native for each
here but then i'm going to load this
into the browser unless the natives have
been supplemented it just turns into a
nightmare so again we should follow the
standards we should follow this back
yeah prototype bind we all provide this
and simple example this counter plus
equals how much and then in native
prototype away i'm i'm only actually
assume i'm not sure they they do the
kerning but we all basically follow this
back right so we have a function object
in which is that function we're going to
bind it to the scope of object so that
that we don't have to worry about about
the context that we're calling it in by
five so anytime called pfm that's going
to increment by five and then same with
Dogo Dogo hitch we do this weird another
thing that I'd love to see in the spec
huh right object in quotes on ink which
means exactly the same thing the inner
function of object added five we do it
actually backwards because of the way
hitch works we do it scope or context
function arguments jquery proxy is i'm
not sure if it's known in red faux fur
or if they just happen to discover it in
a 1.4 but I've been with firing tickets
so Jake ready needed you know some kind
of context manipulation and they their
answer was proxy I don't understand the
name
stuff is hard so they object it also
doesn't curry arguments and they
actually do it kind of to the spec when
it's just direct function references so
that's great but this is an important in
JavaScript and we were to make sure that
everyone is able to easily control their
context and you're not missing the point
it's probably not your fault it's just
that I'm not been clear yet on anything
I'm just kind of kind of rambling I'm
actually not usually this server because
it's very early and these jazz comps if
you've not made it too humble for a
pretty epic with the beer so I'm not
being here your library still sucks
right I'm a this shaking grumpy old man
I inherited this from alex russell being
the moment that he kind of transferred
leadership of dojo to me um i got
actually instantly grew gray hair in my
beard it was it was a very very sad day
and I understand now I understand why
he's the the grumpy old ranting man that
he is um i would that would love to not
be that way um but the point is like
there really is no compelling reason
like despite all all of your flaws all
of your libraries files whatever it is
that you're using there's no compelling
reason for you not to use it especially
if you already know the api's it's a
developer cost them at some point it's
how proficient can you get the whole
thing provided you understand the
underpinnings on reddit's providing of
what it's changing from the spec you
should be able to go to a different
library and pick up the patterns that
the library presents but understand
under the covers it's all just context
switching and whatever I would greatly
appreciate if everyone who never ever
ever put more than the library on your
page if if you have known in the library
in the page
doing their own or the things that you
are using are not agnostic enough to
just supplement you should either know
how to write whatever little I will try
to plug in for lack of a better term a
module you should either go and hang on
a scale to write it or at least port
another implementation to your favorite
library or pick a different library
module tasks is like that's what they're
there for it is a crutch but at the same
time it's it's a crutch to help you get
over over the hump over the the whatever
the barrier to entry is for you Wow
portability sorry about that so cool so
rad develop your RA which is a perfectly
valid thing especially if you have a
team it defers the development costs
right is that only I crunched on your
own to help you through it smart a
wheelchair so you can just kind of
cruise along and not have to put up too
much effort to until you hit stairs and
that's actually rather difficult if
you've never been in a wheelchair so you
don't have to worry about the
development costs you just know that
whatever it is is just seeing or working
for you it's the open-source nice thing
the same principle and its really really
open source thing is it if there's a bug
we're going to find it by buying sheer
number that is doing this the
battle-tested we're
Harold on this all the time so all of a
sudden any bugs is provided the the
library is receptive to your fixes is as
long as it's an open development cycle
you can these fixes you can provide
patches github pull requests I guess is
the new cool thing to do that's right
the common consistent API is throughout
your library that you can use and build
on in your use to write so I've decided
at this point I had I had another 15 or
20 slides lined up in the last night I
decided I wanted to change topics I
totally tangent so I propose anything
comes up as rjs right so let's take what
we've learned as I would say library
authored there are other library others
here and this may be speaking directly
to you I would like to see that we take
what we've learned over the years and
reduce it to the least common
denominator follow something that we can
all build upon that is the supplement to
the language in the browser that we've
wanted and we've needed right so no
magic no syntactic sugar nothing just
pure supplemental fixes provide bind
provide a function something that we can
all agree on an implementation it
shouldn't be that hard the hardest part
about is it is no no that's the
hardest part we've already got all the
code if you look at the code of these
libraries ultimately we're all doing the
same thing our HTML creation area
we're using bone fragments right John
John did a bunch of research on that and
everyone kind of went along with it
turns out it's pretty fast that's great
so we're we're doing that eraser that's
great we've all kind of like you like
passively agreed that we don't care
about sparse arrays so we don't need to
worry about that speck what we still
have incinerator idea that we can all
use and then whatever so are you a snips
that's we've decided we collectively
they kind of forcefully have decided
that you a sniffing is bad it used to be
the end-all be-all and actually I don't
know it that's kind of a chicken in the
egg argument right it started with are
we in an explore / Netscape Mozilla and
then okay so anyway we can most
standards base so they're gonna throw
Mozilla there so we start taking the
actual working paths and that it was a
big monkey wrench for everyone so we
have to get away from that we need to
actually look at the features that are
present in the environment that we're in
and we need to pick a model system we're
going to actually implement it's
actually been implemented if depending
on you know what's spec in the module
system in common jeaious we've chosen
but the there's a project called
probably three competing i want to say
competing module orders for javascript
requirejs rob jess and steel Jess are
probably the most common that we've
heard of require jess is inspired by
dojo in the sense that the author who
wrote it wrote also our module living
we've had module loading for was
probably the first things that we that
we have a moment to have the community
is catching up and saying yes we
actually do new modules like our
application
are getting a little bit higher than
injecting script tags and continuum of
dependencies and one of these things so
we need require jazz or something
similar that is a very fundamental base
only thing that we can all kind of agree
on and build on and it needs to be able
to load comedy aspect like there's
nothing wrong with the common GS back
necessarily accept that in the client
side we've all understood and rinone to
understand that it's asynchronous and
the best way to do it is asynchronously
it fits perfectly in the progressive
enhancement like at some point these
modules will be ready and at some point
they will do something to my dog we have
the legacy synchronous loader that we
use in dojo for development but that's
just because we don't change ap is so
come to dojo two point oh we're probably
going to adopt the required jazz pattern
and it's going to be completely
asynchronous which again this is the
third time I've said no do I get um
tokens or something every time i say
note i could say html5 a couple times
that would be cool no i'm just trying to
go for you know buzz words get everyone
excited about buzz try to be agnostic
right like I'm kind of anecdotal I work
now when I changed from juice juice is
an entirely server-side dojo app that's
been in development for two and a half
years it uses Rhino because that was
what was there at the time so we've got
a beautiful server-side framework it
uses dojos SMD system which is another
interesting spec that would be in sm d
would be an interesting thing to put
into the commonjs world because it's
basically just RPC calls based on
adjacent definition and the reduced was
purchased by an advertising company and
i kind of went out of the public-facing
and client-side development into all
these nasty internal applications that
we're using old old versions of jquery
I you I and sometimes prototype all
mixed in and it was not pretty it was it
was just hodgepodge very very sad so I
wanted that porting a bunch of dojo code
to jquery so that I could use them and
then we're looking at the dojo code I
was realizing the only thing that the
dojo code was doing was the common
things we had a couple is array checks
and we had package system and that was
it so I stripped those two lines out and
then all of a sudden i have a jquery
plugin so i have a repository on my
github called bloody jquery plugins
which are just code i put there because
i was frustrated that i actually had to
take the time to port this because i
should just be able to load them um
because it's nothing it's it was a date
a date packaging or a date edition thing
because ever like working in dates is
disgusting in JavaScript so we have like
date ad and you add to a date object and
it's you know very very simple so I like
that and I'm used to that API so that's
what I've I'm proposing right to a
degree small problems are easy we've got
the standards we've got the list of
stuff we've got what we've actually done
and once where we go from here right I
the where we go from here is is getting
everyone to agree on doing it and
building off of a common thing and then
we'll figure out what the important
parts are so we have modularity which is
something that dojos already addressed
as something that common JSE's already
addressed it's it's actually kind of
ironic though that the one thing about
about node again the one thing about
node is that the only thing about it
that is synchronous is the require
system which falls apart in the browser
world so you have no no portability
there so stability we need to agree on a
way to handle deprecation regressions
and some kind of Saint versioning that
can be adopted by other people if we're
wanting to use this as a common language
common common foundation supplement to
the language and an organization and
internationalization especially here in
Germany right like everything is America
eccentric or at least it seems most of
the sites i visit our hey everything is
a comma-separated with dots for the
period or that's for the sense which is
just simply not the case and this this
stuff doesn't happen by magic right wait
someone is actually formatting these
numbers or or converting them somehow
and it's it's not not a small problem to
solve and we need to agree on a way to
define localized or internationalize
resources and then a way to handle
localization within the language itself
so i made a first pass Tim it's great I
made a first pass I didn't expect to go
to someone would actually talk about
this a little more as jeaious I've been
living in a dojo branch for some time
though which is pure feature detection
we got rid of all the browser sniffs um
it's not quite complete yet but in doing
is talking to John and other other
developers it would be great if we could
share these tests and share these things
that we've learned share these things
that were there skipping around so the
hardest part would be naming them it's
basically the feature detect some
constant moon-like does by ID work on
forms with name whatever sounds like
what do we do what idea so the API of
this is not as important on converging
test implementations right but I want a
common test implementation I want to do
this I it's an open proposal to anybody
that wants to to jump in on this I want
to start a new base library that pure
feature detection and these common shims
that we're using so we can all go from
there but again naming is hard so
and then this one is for a looming up
there who is was expecting to random
intervals say that
majority did it dojo already has done
that and this is or at least everything
that I feel is necessary I've stolen
things from prototype I've stolen things
from jQuery in my own implementations of
things that really we probably have so
if it's a JavaScript question at least
look at the implementation and maybe we
can converge on a different name of
things so actually I was hoping to have
a whole lot more discussion kind of
open-ended talking so I'm gonna skip
this slide real quickly and thank you
