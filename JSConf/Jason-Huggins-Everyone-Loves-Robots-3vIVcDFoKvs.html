demo doesn't work today I brought it out
last night I was working at all today so
there are some people who actually did
see it work so let's see if the demo
gods are nice to me so everybody loves
robots right ow Jason Huggins co-creator
of the selenium project and co-founder
CTO sauce labs you should follow me on
Twitter alright so this is for the next
three slides and only the next or two or
three slides is repeat after me thing so
everybody get your vocal cords warmed up
repeat after me testing let's try that
again testing is not cool let's try that
again all I won't I'll just let you do
it you don't really believe it i don't i
don't believe it anyway you're wrong by
the way you can stop repeating so here
is a nice little philosophy thought
process here robots are cool robot
contest therefore testing with robots is
cool tada so this project really is i've
been in this whole testing thing i'm
kind of you start as a developer fell
into software testing by accident it's
actually really interesting intellectual
problem for me and i think if you don't
care about testing it means you don't
have an appt with any users or that
makes any money right which sounds like
an insult but actually if you're like a
stealth startup it's more important to
you know if you're two guys in a garage
two girls in the garage the more
important thing is to ship anything
something that's relevant that people
care about and so at the very beginning
yeah testing is actually not important
but once you do have users once you do
have revenue what it comes down to is
once you're at 3am and you get a page
that something is broken you're going to
fix that problem and then want to start
doing testing so you never have to do
that again of course it's you know it's
harder than that but testing and testing
is important
anyway so today the the the thing I've
been doing all these last years is doing
all the software stuff and this project
I call it it's made of this building
material called bit beam so that kind of
the home for this projects called bit be
morgue and I'm really kind of taking the
software out of the computer and making
a test in the real life so it's kind of
like if you remember trong the movie you
know he falls in the computer this is
kind of like the reverse Tron I'm taking
the selenium the software robot out out
into the real world so let me tell you a
kind of briefly a little bit like where
this story came from or where this where
this kind of crazy thing came from so a
long time ago Sony came up this thing
called the robot dog and I've actually
always been interested in robots ever
since I was a kid and then the late 90s
Tony came out with this thing is like oh
my gosh the robot revolution is on which
is also weird robot revolutions also on
now it seems like it kind of goes in
waves like every 10 years there's like a
new revolution anyway back then robot
dogs so I had this idea to you know long
story but I was going to do robot fish
right why not right and so I started
rings 3d simulations of house fish swam
I bought books i went to aquariums and i
learned this crazy thing that fish swim
and a sine wave if you kind of look at
it especially like an eel it's it's very
much a perfect sine wave thing so i
started doing 3d simulations and on the
software not on this thing but i but i
had this thing called pin arts hope
everyone's kind of seen this not
everyone knows that's called pin art but
everyone knows what I'm talking about I
had this kind of this thing was sitting
on my desk and I was doing 3d simulation
of swimming fish and sine waves and
stuff like that on my desktop and I
thought it was ironic I really want to
see this 3d animation but it's trapped
on this 2d piece of glass so this is
kind of you know not talking about
software robots but this is kind of like
this art project hobby thing that I've
had going for a while it's motorized pen
art ideas something I'm still I want to
have exist in the world um so I started
again just this hobby not related to
testing not day job related thing I
didn't know what to call my motorized
pen art thing so i called it pin thing
and I've got a demo here the
thing about this I guess in the room I
don't I haven't met mr. Dube yet is he
here or is he around anyway babe this is
three Jas on the software and then i'm
using the REM Remy's console and so the
idea for this little art project is to
you know if i want an array of pins i
can do all kinds of animations but to
kind of start simple I think maybe if I
get four of these I could do a clock and
you know the whole point is really this
project is like I want to get into
robotics and mechanics and all kinds of
fun stuff again still not related to
testing not related to anything Jay
job-related but this pin thing I want to
exist and while I was still working on
this project actually i'll switch
forward I was prototyping in Lego I have
to figure out what the actuator is for
each one of those pins and i did a first
version in Lego and I realized okay now
that I have it working here's that the
clicker the linear actuator but if I
scale this out to thousands of pins wow
this is going to be really really
expensive so then I so I could kind of
put the project on hold for a little bit
I then went to a maker faire and
discovered this project called grid beam
this is for making for like standing
desks and tables and beds and all kinds
of crazy things this is one of the
co-inventors Richard Jorgensen he lives
in Northern California and yeah this is
standing desk am i kicking in the shins
like yeah they should it's a really cool
building material it's like life-size
lego rector set kind of stuff anyway so
I I knew of this project and so like
wait a second Lego is cool i like the
geometry but it's expensive so i had
this crazy idea to like combine lego the
geometry of it with grid beam basically
report lego geometry to different you
know cheaper materials and now i've got
this thing again this thing is meant to
be vertically aligned for my pin thing
project but then as i was walking around
the house with this and you know I
actually you know held it upside down
kind of noticed actually you know it
could be a pin simulation thing but it
also is kind of like a glorified button
clicker you know and realizing that's
kind of what selenium that's what
testing really is that's actually what
makes testing uncool is people that you
pay probably offshore somewhere and just
they just paid to click buttons all day
I was like wait a second this this
potentially could be a button clicker
and this is where it became not so much
an art project but potentially related
to the day job so I designed this this
robot basically the first version of it
around around this clicker and so now I
have got that this is actually
generation to you see over here bit
being bought and of course you know
testing you know selenium and apps that
i tested originally you know what I'm
expense apps very boring makes for a
very boring demo but so trying to go for
the most ridiculous thing I could think
of I was like well if I can make it play
angry birds that can do anything right
so that that was that was the mission
make this robot clicker thing play Angry
Birds and so there's there's kind of the
thing I've realized in building ground
of robots that's really kind of like a
triathlon of things you need the
electronics the mechanics and the
software most of the stuff I think in
this room we're mostly really geeking
out on the Arduino and and the software
side so the demo I have thanks to Chris
Williams at the Johnny Five and fermata
you know ups killed my software was the
latest node stuff the thing that
struggle that I struggled with the most
is all of our robots need skeletons so
like the node copter stuff is cool but
it's kind of an off-the-shelf
proprietary thing and so for me too i
want to do robots i want it to be a
completely open source stack all the way
down so the mechanics was I think I
really stumbled I stumbled on but now
that I've created basically an
open-source Lego I now can do the
software the electronics and the
mechanics all open source so that I
guess the way I call the bit being
project it's you know linux is to
Microsoft as bit beam is to lego my only
problem though is no one hates lego i
hope i picked a really bad enemy there
but they do sue people they do that
patents thankfully most of them all of
them i hope most of them have expired so
I I mean it is public domain they're
expired to expire patents at least so I
can kind of a they might sue me anyway
but we'll see you know so that there's
this idea this this again I've said this
before but you know selenium and
starting from that is a software-based
robot it's really just a glorified
button clicker you know so you know
could we make a robot that does that
does the same
thing so long a dream for this then is
to have the selenium API where I don't
have that today but at some point you
can say you know I want to drive Firefox
I want to drive Chrome Safari or I want
to drive an iPad in a robot and as far
as you're concerned the API is the same
so I'm still driving towards that vision
right now is kind of low level api's yes
let's switch to a demo so I'm using a
photo booth it's inverted the the screen
here so let's get my windows all set up
so the first thing that you want to do
when you want to have a robot that play
Angry Birds you need to select the app
right right so I'm in the app and I will
get to the frontier right yes so the one
of the things this is this generation 2
of this robot this is actually called a
delta robot you could perhaps see it
here if I can kind of a shall do a
little tour of the robot here there's
three arms that's why it's called a
delta it was invented I can't forget his
name but it's actually a swiss engineer
in the 80s and no joke he he designed
you know the dis Delta robot design to
from Switzerland of course it was
conveyor belts of chocolates coming off
the conveyor belt and they're trying to
get chocolates into packages and they
were noticing that everything was
automated except that last parts where
the chocolates were being picked up by
humans and putting in boxes like all
could we do that so they needed as the
conveyor belt was going pretty fast they
need a very fast robot design so as I
was embarking on this video game robot
thing it needs to be fast someone saw my
first version of its like that's really
slow you should check out a delta robot
thankfully the patent has expired so hey
I can I'm legally allowed to to build a
delta so anyway there's this thing so
yeah it's kind of it's kind of creepy
cool right yeah so keep going on with
the demo here
now for the big point actually hybrid
manual testing right okay so i have to
get into position wonder if this
actually work oh yeah sure famous last
words nice
okay now once is just luck right so
let's see if I can do it again want some
Lucky to I'm good right let's see can I
improve my score I think that was one
star how many stars do you think it is
12 I think that was one if you hit that
if you hit right that corner you get
three only one Sarah okay so I've got
I've got a room for improvement right so
so let me actually show a little bit
actually one of the things i just got
working today there's this really
robotics is ultimately very simple but
they use if you study robotics classes
they've used all these big words so you
can sound very smart at a cocktail party
but it's very simple stuff one thing is
to tell a robot to go to a point it's
very simple like you don't even think
about it as a human you just like oh I
want to pick up the glass boom that is a
that fancy phrase and robotics is called
inverse kinematics and I have an inverse
kinematics library i'll put on github
after the talk and there's really
there's two things in robotic lands
there's inverse kinematics basically
saying like there's an XYZ point in the
universe I want to get to it it's what
you have to do is like your robot
doesn't know about anything about
geometry in the world but it knows that
it's got a motor that can go 180 degrees
and this motor can go this and so what
you have to do the inverse kinematics is
to say given an XYZ point in the
universe what are the angles for all of
the motors to get to that location so I
I've had this robot actually for you
know a couple months now I've had a very
low-level API i granted all these go
commands that's pretty low level but
it's higher than it was a couple hours
ago what I can do then is just give it a
particular location and then it figures
out this very fancy algorithm translates
that to what the servers need to go to
so if I can do some simple things now
again it's XYZ so X
so the origin is in the sensor and let's
see negative 1 120 that's in the z axis
and I can kind of go there and if I want
to go down I can kind of keep doing that
the surface so the tablets right around
150 so I'll just keep it to keep it safe
there's that so you can kind of see the
input go is XYZ and the output is going
to be the angles that the servos need to
be when it's on the origin they're
effectively all the same but if I go you
know often in Cartesian on a Cartesian
adventure that's negative 50 X and
that's plus 50 X or I can do that's why
and then negative Y so now i have like
anywhere in the XY Z plane I've got I've
got the that got the power right also
because of the kinematics the
calculating forward it's a little bit
opposite of what I would think would be
but so you got inverse kinematics
forward kinematics means i am here tell
me what the position of my servos or
what my angles are so I could do the
count the forward kinematics and I'll
just say it's what 1.5 4141 that was
roughly the the output from the last
function and it should inverse it yeah
roughly zero fifty- point anyway
rounding errors right but you can go
forward and back for me I needed it was
really important to have the XYZ thing
so so future steps for this project if
you kind of noticed some people are
saying like how do I know where to tell
this robot this is another thing in
robot lands this is an open loop right
which means I'm telling it to go
somewhere and it really doesn't know
anything it's not very smart there is no
feedback mechanism from the robots to
back to the computer to say like oh you
told me to go here but I'm actually here
and let's course
to get to the right spot so one of the
things I'm also working on is then using
Peter Braden's opencv bindings for node
and that's where things get really cool
with an ipad 2 and up and in the iphone
4s and up you can get a vga adapter and
get a mirror we get a video signal out
of of the ipad once i have that i
actually use a device called prosaically
named vga to USB right so it takes the
VGA signal and then i plug it into my
laptop so now I actually can grab like
JPEG frames of of this of the ipad
screen once i have that i can use opencv
and I have a little thumbnail picture
where I can find the bird on that screen
open computer vision algorithms can
translate this bird to a particular XYZ
coordinate on the screen once i have
that XYZ coordinate i can then feed it
into this inverse kinematics function
and then and then go so the other dream
for this is i can sit back and then
watch it completely you know play by
itself and then on top of that then once
we have a robot that's kind of sort of
autonomous and course correcting we can
then start having competitions about
Angry Birds playing robot you know
efficiency and you know find the pig
find the bird figure out the angle you
know how far to throw so I envision
Angry Birds robot contests in the future
like is make it as ridiculous as
possible but yeah there's lots of things
there's lots of things that we can do
with this and one thing I think after
after my talk I'm going to go back back
to the coffee spots but I need it I need
to help i need you might I need your
help implementing the tweet function so
I want you know by the end of the today
get this robot to just you know say
hello j/s comp and then the key thing is
sent for my robot so that's that yeah
that's coming up coming very soon but
yeah anyway so the inverse kinematics
and all that all this robot stuff there
are some really good classes at Stanford
they put them all on long online iTunes
University and I thought I was really
interested in robotics you know like a
long time ago but because I didn't have
a project to do something it was very
dry very boring
I think this is one of those lessons
learned of college because I didn't have
a project to work on I couldn't I
couldn't survive the first class but now
I now I need these functions I now I now
get it but don't get scared by the
science and the vocabulary just realize
a lot of this stuff is very simple I
mean robots are ridiculously stupid even
at this level they're not very smart and
so the things that we're trying them to
do to get them to do it's just geometry
and and thankfully lots of other
people's you can kind of grab people's
algorithms and run them in your stuff
and get them to work but so at this
point actually I think I would like to
open it to questions yeah
there yeah oh holy cow I forgot thank
you so much yeah Chris Williams actually
implemented this last night the dancing
robots and then let's see if you want to
like take a break and chill right let's
just stop I was that dance oh oh shoot
right can't see it there you go thank
you let's try it again
so Chris also he he got the the wii
controller we got it working so we can
actually can kind of play the video game
you know abstracted through throw all
this so you can show that see the demo
letter any other questions what was that
well microphone is the code for this I
just went to the get the bit beam repo
but that's for the yeah for this demo
right now i'll put that up right off the
top thank you right i want to see it
that it's Johnny Five stuff Johnny Five
right it's yay ok thanks Johnny 5 is the
robot is the node library and then
fermata is on the Arduino side yeah um
how much does this thing cost
approximately oh right so it's a lot
cheaper that we're gonna do it in Lego
and also the other thing is Lego doesn't
make parts like this long so it's
actually about a hundred dollars and
most of it actually is the Arduino their
Arduino in the in a prototyping board
that's like 30 or 40 the servos each or
10 apiece so just in electronics
actually two thirds of the cost is just
the electronics the wood and the bolts
are probably like maybe ten fifteen
dollars or so and that little ipad
stylus i overpaid and got it at bestbuy
or something like that I could I could
make my own dirt cheap there's actually
one I did put this project up on there's
a website called tindy TI n di e dot com
it's kind of like an electronics version
of Etsy where you can kind of put your
project up there now granted it's it's
for sale but I don't want you to buy it
because I'm really it's a manual process
to make this right so what I need to do
next is to make the robots that can make
this robot so I need a conveyor belt and
any more bit beams that can I can shake
the bolts onto the conveyor belt I can
find the bolts put them in a kit so I
haven't done that yet so that's there
but yeah so the you know plans are out
there of documented like a whole flickr
for all the construction steps for this
and yeah it's about a hundred dollars I
laser cut the wood at techshop San
Francisco so if you have if you have
access to an epilogue laser cutter you
can kind of you know by the wood at a
and this is actually just two foot
length of basswood for like 99 cents and
learn how to laser cut and and do it the
thing though I think the laser cutting
is also to to manual too labor-intensive
the better idea is to download the the
bit beam file from the Thingiverse so I
have the cool thing about open source
and the fingerprint Thingiverse all
these things i uploaded the the 2d dxf
laser-cut files and within an hour of
being on Thingiverse someone uploaded
the the 3d version that can is reprap
printable and so this was this is abs
plastic the same as Lego and anyway it's
pretty cool so I think actually the the
best weights if you're going to make
your own is you know get the electronics
from wherever the Arduino and the servos
that's kind of been known how to do that
sparkfun or something but i would
recommend getting a 3d printer getting
the bit beam files and then just
printing a bunch of them so that the
other the dream i think is you know
besides robots that actually can be the
equivalent of selenium and test all your
software the other one is kind of
imagine a toy company that it's kind of
like a modern company instead of a
factory in some country where I make
stuff for you and send it to you for a
ridiculously high price imagine there
are just 3d printers everywhere and so
there's you know building up a community
of people to putting kits up on the
website and then that has the
instructions on how you can print it and
so you can send an entire you know bill
of materials to your printer and just
say you know in the morning you now have
your own kind of Lego kit I didn't have
to you know wait for shipping and
handling for that kind of stuff so yeah
that's kind of the dream so you can make
it yourself or at some point once I have
the whole robot assembly line I'll get
it to ya so can you tell us about
controlling that with a go we controller
maybe lady later the wii controller yeah
because that was pretty cool um yeah
i'll probably going to i'll go into that
i'll go into yeah let fly
laughter yes yet any other questions
okay thank you thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
