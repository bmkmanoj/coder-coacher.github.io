sencha touch hopefully you're in the
right place my name is Dave Canada that
is an awesome cartoon of me I so I wrote
about three years ago I wrote a plug-in
called jqtouch for jquery it's a plug-in
that sort of makes you allows you to
create web pages that feel a little bit
more like iphone apps or mobile apps
about a year and a half ago I moved over
to sencha and we started to kind of redo
the same thing but based on a JavaScript
API and way way more powerful so that's
my Twitter handle that's the company's
Twitter handle if you have any questions
if I go too fast I'm going to rush just
shoot me a question on Twitter and I'll
try to answer it and full speed ahead so
sencha touch is a free JavaScript
framework for building rich mobile apps
we are an object-oriented framework so
you know we use the classical
inheritance model we have things like
MVC we have things like data I'll talk
more about those in a little bit but
first I think it's important that you
just sort of get an idea of what it can
do so that being said i'm going to show
a couple apps this first one is
travelmate so again this is a web app
this is built with JavaScript you can
see things we have like we have things
like a carousel this one's a little
translation tool we have these sort of
pickers and again that's all being done
just in a web app this next one is the
schedule for a conference I just went to
a couple weeks ago in Dallas the
breaking development conference anyone
there anyway go there yeah I know you
and you can see we're adding it to the
home screen we get a custom icon and
when we launched it again no browser bar
some startup screen and it feels like a
real native app right we think we have
things like the A to Z controller on the
right we have the grouped headers in the
list pull in some tweets custom
messaging little map component I really
like how recently they added the ability
within the Google Maps so that you can
actually do the street view directly in
it and it works great within the
framework all right that's pretty cool
right and some basic pages whatever and
then this last one is called
irresistible this is done by a friend of
mine Nick he's sitting over there this
is for a food delivery service in the UK
Nick built this I should have asked
beforehand but I think it took him about
a week and I think he said within the
first weekend it basically paid for the
entire time he spent developing the app
because so many people used it awesome
little CSS animation done with our CSS
animator tool but we're here to talk
about since you touch so and this is
something new so I wanted to try
everybody's just going to be on their
laptops the entire time I figure anyway
so you might as well be checking out our
stuff while you do it this is for our
kitchen sink demo this just is sort of
like a big combination of all our demos
has some data features in there but
mostly shows off all the UI so go ahead
and pull it up it's got to be in a
webkit-based browser so open up Chrome
check it out JMP / touch sink so the
reason I think sencha touch is cool is
details matter this was something brian
fling friend of mine said in dallas a
couple weeks ago and i think it's true i
think in terms of you x in terms of
usability when you're looking at mobile
apps the details the way somebody
interacts with the app is important
for example that travelmate app when you
have two Pickers side by side when
you're converting languages that's the
best way really to show off or two to
get the user to switch two languages
right that would be a lot harder to do
and a lot less pleasant to do with to
select elements just the you know
microseconds matter to a user and that
being said I think such a touch is sort
of the sweet spot in mobile web app
design between web and native so you
know there are benefits to doing things
natively you have all of your UI all of
your apps sort of on the device and all
you're doing is requesting data that's a
really nice thing to do that speed stuff
up a lot for your users everybody here I
assume those the benefits of web
development better debugging lots of
developers they're cheaper it's fast
it's awesome it's cross-platform I don't
have to sell you guys on web right you
guys like the web I hope devices we
support iOS the only thing I want to
point out is that we do support the iPad
really well which is something some
other sort of players in this field
don't do at the moment we have a very
rich layout system and it looks awesome
on the ipad the ipad 2 is insanely
awesome blazing fast i can give a demo
later somebody wants then there's the
bajillion androids we support all those
the tablet again and the same thing with
blackberry tablet all these things are
just WebKit so basically we're saying we
support WebKit on mobile I think we are
getting ready to start looking at touch
20 and hopefully we will look at some
extra platforms and things like that but
I can't talk about that now so what you
get and this would be a good time to
open up that like sync demo and just
sort of play along because these are the
dry slide portion touch events so at the
very core of what we do sort of one of
the base layers is abstract all the
touch events on the device by default
you get 42
events touchstart touch n touch move and
touch cancel we go a step further than
that we abstract them all to the
document so that their performance so
you're not binding you know touch events
to every list item or things like that
it's all handled in the background for
you when you bind an event our way and
in doing so we actually get to add in a
whole bunch of sort of more sensible
default events so you get things like
tap double tap pinch rotate stuff like
that stuff that makes sense stuff you
want to bind to the next thing we do on
top of the touch event is our own
scrolling layer how many people know
what I'm talking about when I say fake
scrolling on iOS mobile safari that is
awesome this crowd rocks alright so I'm
just going to show it then because you
guys know what I'm talking about it's so
smooth right buttery smooth we've spent
months simply on this scroll both in
getting the right momentum the right
physics and then actually making that
performance on things like android and
blackberry which if you go out to do on
your own good luck then we have a whole
lot of components I won't bore you with
the whole list but you guys can read and
again play along JMP touch sync you can
try them all out in Chrome or if you
even have the you know some sort of
emulator throw them in that try it out
on the theming side of things this is
sort of my contribution my brainchild to
the framework is my favorite part all of
our themes are first of all of course
based on css3 because we're targeting
WebKit so you get all of the awesome
gradients text shadows box shadows etc
but then we've actually taken it a step
further and abstracted that with sass
and compass so basically sass and
compass give you the ability to use
things like variables and mix-ins within
your CSS and we've created a whole
framework on top of that system
including our own mix-ins our own
variables so you can actually take the
default sencha touch theme
and change it pretty pretty incredibly
on the fly and hopefully if we have time
I will get to show that off the other
important thing to note is we include a
ton of icons by default icons are
important on mobile you can optionally
include them all in your app they all
come in base 64 encoded into your CSS
which is great for latency on mobile and
then the last thing I want to mention is
they're all resolution independent so
one big goal we've had from the
beginning of our theme is trying to get
it so that a button is the same physical
size regardless of the PPI of the device
across all the devices which is a
challenge so then this is something the
more techy audience might appreciate we
do include a full data package with
sencha touch as well as our desktop
counterpart xjs this gives you things on
the client side like an ORM like
client-side associations you get you
know validations field validations and
then we have a whole bunch of data
stores data proxies etc that make it
really easy to work with any sort of API
endpoint XML rest JSON whatever you want
and then we also actually have a proxy
set up specifically for offline storage
so you can easily take some data you get
online and take it offline and that
being said all of that sort of comes
together into a full application
architecture which is something that not
a lot of frameworks nowadays offer we
include things like MVC we include data
we include the theming as you saw some
others I didn't get to mention our
history support device detection
orientation events this is just kind of
become a catch-all for just random
things I don't talk about layout system
animations etc at any rate I encourage
you to play around with it that being
said we're very rich framework we have a
lot of features law functionality so
it's important to note we have a lot of
sort of support venues for you we have
the API Docs which are getting an
improvement very soon little makeover
you can check them out
xjs for and then we have forums that are
super active we have over 200,000 active
members of our forms and we have a learn
section which with a bunch of tutorials
getting started guides all that kind of
stuff and that's actually getting a
makeover soon as well I hope and then
lastly once you create your awesome web
app with sencha touch how do you
distribute it like you saw in some of
the preview movies you can just
distribute it in the browser works great
you may want to wrap it up in something
like PhoneGap if you want device access
or you want to put it on the app store
the Android Marketplace blackberry app
world I think it's cool so yeah fung gap
rocks highly recommended works great
with sencha touch and then lastly just
sort of looking ahead to the future some
of the things we're going to bring in in
touch two point oh we're still
discussing features so this isn't
exactly the feature list of what's
coming in touch to point out this is
just sort of the hard set minimum we
know what we're bringing in we're going
to improve the MVC system a lot we are
implementing a new build system which
will automatically create an optimized
javascript file and optimized build for
your app by literally launching your app
in the background seeing its
dependencies and then automatically
creating one minified javascript file
for you of your appt and taking out
everything you don't use that is awesome
I'm just throwing that out there now
charting extension which is sort of
based off of our desktop charting that
we're doing right now a dynamic loading
system which sort of goes along with the
optimized builds and improved history
support the one more thing referenced at
the bottom of the slide is our GUI and I
apologize this is a little butt ugly
right now but this is way alpha
prototype we are working on a
drag-and-drop system to put together
your views which will be awesome
how's this rate going for everyone too
fast too slow I think it's good yeah
should I had an extra shot of coffee
before I came up save few minutes I
think this is going to be really sweet
once we get this thing together so sure
the concluding slides if you like some
of this stuff and you find it
interesting you like sort of recreating
native interfaces with web tech come
talk to me because we are hiring and
like crazy we are growing an insane
amount i think i joined about a year and
a half ago not even i was the eighth
person on the team and i think just last
week we did a recount we've just hit 60
so come on board will take you all right
so that's pretty much it again our
website sencha com my twitter name I'm
not done yet though I am going to show
you guys some code because we actually
did that in 14 minutes and 24 seconds
round of applause for the time come on
that's usually an hour presentation just
throwing that out there you're like
thank God because I couldn't sit through
that for an hour all right I'm going to
go back to the mirror
destroyed my desktop
lame
Twitter Shh nobody at reply me right now
okay it's okay you can keep them coming
all right so this is an app i did with
O'Reilly conferences for their
conferences scheduled appt you'll kind
of recognize the one we showed earlier
that orange one the breaking Devlin they
kind of pirate patch this one so again
you know we have a list you can see I'm
running it right in frome right now I
have to do the whole drag to scroll
thing but other than that it's pretty
awesome right cool app cool app all
right you guys have seen it you're bored
so let's look at code is that readable
good awesome well first I'm just going
to sort of quickly look at this class
for this app keep in mind this whole app
this whole conference app which you saw
is pretty rich has a tab bar as tweets
brings in data all this kind of stuff
it's about 600 lines of this JavaScript
of JavaScript that looks like this which
is pretty short for such a full app so
just to give you guys some idea you can
see we are creating a object called the
session list which extends a basic panel
EXT dot panel we throw it some config
options like the layout card some custom
options I threw in there then within
that panel we throw a list which we just
create a new EXT dot list again give it
some config options we have a quick in
line template for each of the rows in
that list for each session and basically
all we do is set up a data store against
a model and i'll show you real quick
those models are wacky easy and if any
of my colleagues saw me putting all of
my models in one class i would totally
get yelled at but uh or in one file
rather
sorry but anyway there's my proposal
model you can see it has the association
with speakers and then I just sort of
say what the fields are going to be I
then pass that model into the datastore
say that we're going to sort it by time
the group string is going to be a pretty
time variable on that data and then the
proxy is basically just a JSON one we
say script tag coming from this API
endpoint we're not going to cash it
that's for my own purposes I think I was
keep bugging something and the root node
is proposals and then after that it
basically looks at that JSON goes to the
proposals node looks at that array grabs
all those objects matches up the objects
in there sorry the attributes in there
against this template and then creates
that list it's pretty simple right
louder no I don't care so we have a
selection change event when you tap on a
list item so this is cool when you when
you click one of those dates at the top
so we have these guys right all we're
really doing you know in the sort of
jQuery mentality and totally not bashing
jquery I love them but you know you
would be when you click one of those
dates you would be clearing a Dom list
you would be saying grab this UL clear
the Dom you know go through my JSON
re-inject it this way here dealing with
sort of a nap architecture dealing with
data stores day a miles etc you can see
we're really simply just clearing a
filter on the datastore that's bound to
that list and then re filtering it on
the date from that button which is way
simpler right it's all about you I
binding and then I scroll to the top
just because I'm a sucker for details
so does that look cool to everybody that
kind of makes sense it's kind of all I'm
gonna that was not nearly strong enough
a reaction to the cool part come on no
as long as you get it and hopefully I
can squeeze in like a few questions just
real quick i'm going to show off the
theming system so this is what the theme
for this app looks like you can tell it
is a little custom we have kind of like
a pink thing going on right now let's
say we didn't want it to be pink next
year we're remaking this app for the
next conference but the next step is
actually green we could just throw that
in there this is actually getting
compiled behind the scenes with sass oh
no it's not so I can just run compass
watch that the folder where that files
living it's going to take a look at it
recompile the CSS with that new color
change and now everything's green right
so we have about 50 to 60 variables in
touch you can see even the selected
state is green back buttons green it's
sort of taken over every possible place
it could again with about 50 or 60
variables you can get a lot more
granular with your control I'm just
changing base color because it is the
most sweeping change it's the most
noticeable some other sort of big ones
or we could say the overall base
gradient is glossy all right make sure
that fires and now everything's glossy
you guys see that
and as I mentioned we can get a lot more
granular so let's say we just want the
tab bar at the bottom to be glossy got
get a little more iOS feeling I guess it
only does the tabs yeah it's still cool
so that's it do we have some time for
questions yeah let's say yes that would
be difficult the question was you know
are the is the scroller components are
separated enough that you could be used
outside the framework not in the same
way things like glove box and you know
touch scroll or I scroll whatever it's
not as componentized as that it does use
some of our other classes hypothetically
if we get the build system to the point
where we want it to be fine then don't
show the thank you sign oh did I kick it
then hopefully that will be possible at
a certain point yeah that's a good
question so the question is is it really
free yeah it's free so basically just to
sort of explain it a little bit we do
have a commercial license and a GPL
license they're both free sounds wacky I
know but uh basically we do it so that
you can't create a tool that creates
other sense of touch apps and then
distribute that and sell that and all
that kind of stuff but in general if you
just want to use it to like get you know
you have five apps that you want to put
on the app store at the android
marketplace go for it free if you are a
school or nonprofit or you're doing
something open source you do the GPL way
still free so yeah totally free we do
have paid support options stuff like
that but really the company rests a lot
more on the XJS side for the commercial
licenses touches just open we figure
it's a lot more consumer centric so we
just kind of want to get it out there
all right so I know I'm holding up the
next guy thank you guys a ton find me
afterwards okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
