&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Hello everyone.  This 
morning, we're going to open up 
with another
React talk from Sarrah
Vesselov.  She serves as a 
director at women who code.  
Let's hear it from Sarrah.  
[ Applause ]
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SARRAH: So I had some 
snafus with fonts and notes.  
But thank you for coming this 
early.  As you can probably tell
from the title
of my talk, it's based on 
painful personal experience, and
I wanted to start today by 
sharing that experience with 
you.  So in 2015, I worked in a 
small Tampa start-up as a senior
UI developer.  My main role was 
to build scalable, maintainable 
CSS
architectures.  We worked for 
months on a vapor concept.  
There was a lot of buzz, and we 
snagged our first client.  So it
was time to get down to business
and begin writing production 
quality code.  There was an 
build exciting opportunity to it
out from scratch, and we decided
we were going to do it in React.
Just one problem.  There were 
not any best practices for 
styling in React at that time.  
And this is where the Strubel
trouble started for me. 
My ten plus years of styling 
applications meant nothing.  It 
meant that I was a dinosaur.  In
2014, My ten plus years an 
engineer at Facebook gave a talk
that changed everything.  His 
talk was putting CSS in your JS.
And this really represented a 
shift from traditional 
architectures to more 
component-based ark tech
techture.  So the next few 
months, honestly, were some of 
the worst in my career.  Every 
presentation, every conversation
became a confrontation.  It was 
meant to shame and bully one 
side or the other into seeing 
the error of their ways.  By the
end of it all, none of us were 
friends anymore.  If this sounds
crazy? It was.  If it sounds 
familiar, I'm really
sorry.  But it didn't have to 
end this way. 
The team imploded not because of
bad technology choices.  Most of
what we tried would have worked 
if we stuck with it.  The 
problem was Us and the way we 
approached the problem.  We made
things far more complicated and 
personal than they needed to be.
If we had been asking the right 
questions instead of avoiding 
each other, we could have 
avoided the whole mess.  It was 
two years ago.  A lot has 
changed, but the debate has not.
This is a recent Google search I
did just for
CSS.  I want to talk about
that today.  
    So let's look at both sides 
of the debate.  We all know that
CSS is
broken right? CSS dependencies 
make style collision and 
overriding inevitable.  Looking 
at separation of concerns all 
along on the CSS side.  We look 
at separation of concerns as a 
separation of technologies.  And
in CSS and JS, it's really a 
separation of components and 
what each piece is doing.  And 
then the cascade causes 
thousands of lines of dead code 
and doesn't work with CSS
at scale.  There are equally 
strong gripes against CSS and 
JSS.  CSS
isn't broken.  Why are we 
cascade is your friend if you 
know how to use it, and of 
course, inline styles are
inventing the hackable.  So both
styles have some pretty serious 
concerns about what the other 
side
is doing.  So now that we've 
heard the two sides, let's look 
at the
options. 
wheel.

The
has a class.  
Elements should never be 
directly styled.  No nesting of 
styles.  Choose clear naming
conventions.  So in this 
example, I have my friend 
component.  Friend is a block, a
stand-alone entity that has its 
own meaning and identity.  Any
    friend is an element of that
block.  They are tied to that 
block and have no meaning on
their own.  And modifier is just
an extra class name to change 
appearance or behavior.  
Modifier should only modify the 
their own.  And modifierblock, 
never replace it.  In terms of 
component structure, here's a 
simple component structure to 
start with.  I'm by no means 
telling you this is the way to 
do it, it's just one way to do 
it.  I think it's very 
personalized from project to
project.  Here we've got a 
they are stateless and they 
simply takesimple  props.  They 
make API calls, etc., etc.  
There's a lot of benefits to 
this approach.  You get better, 
but different type of separation
concerns, and you get 
reusability in other projects, 
if that's something you're 
concerned with.  The 
presentation components can be 
worked on by the design team, 
without concern that it will 
affect the app's The
componentsusing  We're straight 
C NothingSS.  to
configure or  put together.   
Using BIM and presentational 
components, each component can 
be used over and over again in 
other projects.  It is 
impossible as long as everyone 
is following that syntax.  So 
the less there is to evaluate, 
the faster it's going to render.
And I think that BIM structure 
lends itself perfectly to 
linting so you can make sure 
that every structure added 
conforms to the same standards. 
But there are some cons.  Let's 
face it.  Naming things is 
really hard.  It's probably one 
of the hardest things we do.  It
sounds crazy to anyone who 
doesn't do this for a living, 
but most of my time has been 
spent figuring out what to name 
something so someone else knows 
what I'm talking about.  The 
rigid structure of BIM is what 
makes it work and also what 
makes it difficult to write
it first.  It can be frustrate 
to being do something you can do
faster in another way, but 
you're being forced into this 
syntax and this particular 
method.  So you've got to get 
team buy-in in order for this 
system to work.  And losing the 
benefit of the cascade can be 
seen as a pro or con, depending 
on which side of the debate you 
fall on.  The cascade can keep 
things dry or result in
a bloated code base.  
    It's possible to use BIM for
theming, but I would say there 
are far better methods out 
there, say maybe something 
that's important to you and the 
work that you're doing.  And it 
may not be a serious con, but 
something around the underscores
and dashes feels really ugly.  
Again, if it goes back to 
writing something that's 
difficult or doesn't come 
naturally can make things a lot
slower.  
    So next I want to look at 
pre-processors.  We're turning 
this into that.  So CSS 
preprocessor takes a language 
and allows you to write dry code
faster.  Variables, operations, 
mix-ins, you
name it.  I think sass is 
probably one of the most well 
known extension languages, and 
that is what I will touch upon 
in this talk.  So the bad news 
about SASS is that you still 
need to name things.  So in this
example, I'm continuing to use 
the BEM naing component.
Nothing changes here.  The 
component itself is set.  The 
difference here is that instead 
of having to write out each 
class in its entirety, we're 
nesting using the ampersand in 
each class.  There's a lot of 
ways I could dry this up 
further.  Once compiled, the CSS
output is going to be exactly 
the same as in the original 
example.  And again, with the 
folder structure, nothing is 
really changed.  We're still 
approaching each component as a 
whole entity.  We're no longer 
separating 
HTML, HTML and CSS.  
In this example, I actually have
the SASS outputting to an 
individual CSS file that lives 
within the component.  However, 
you can do it a number of 
different ways.  You can compile
this into one style sheet, and 
load that whole style sheet 
instead.  
So pros.  What are pros to 
preprocessors? SASS gives you 
the power of variables, mix-ins,
nestings.  It's got a lot of 
features that we have grown 
dependent on.  You can dry up 
your code quite a bit using 
these features.  I also think a 
lot of them are really easy to 
pick up.  If you already know 
CSS, there's no overhead to 
jumping in and working with 
SASS.  You can really do it 
straight away without much help.
And similar to a first set-up, 
each presentation component is 
modular.  Each SASS file can be 
loaded into one sheet.  So it 
lends itself into working for 
your team the way you need it 
to.  
    There are some cons.  To use
SASS in your project, you'll 
need to add dependencies.  It 
isn't a big con considering what
we already do, but it's 
something to keep in mind.  It's
just one more
layer.  Nesting can get out of 
control very, very quickly.  I 
have seen new devs nest 
themselves straight to hell.  
They're like ten deep, and they 
can't figure out ohow that 
happened.  So you have got to be
careful with SASS and nesting.  
Having said that, I would argue 
that the component composition 
resists the needs of mix-in and 
nesting.  They should be very, 
very small.  They should be 
very, very concentrated.  And 
the amount of styling you need 
should be relatively small.  So 
you may not even need these 
things.  And you have to name a 
lot of things, right? We just 
don't want to do
this.  It seems to be a really 
popular refrain.  So I want to 
talk about inline styles.  
Inline styles are not the same 
as CSS and JS, and I'm going to 
get to that in a minute.  And 
the first two methods I just 
talked about have been the 
standard for a long time.  I 
think CSS inline goes back even 
further.  But in 2015, the idea 
of using them to style your 
entire application seemed kind 
of crazy.  Just like it sounds, 
inline styles attach your styles
inline to the actual DOM node.  
This is the same frame 
component, so a simple example 
of inline styles.  This is the 
first example that the CSS and 
JS folks brought to us in 2015. 
And I got to say, we were 
horrified when we saw this.
And to be fair, this is not how 
most people are using inline 
styles.  Most are using style 
objects.  It's much more 
maintainable than the first 
example.  It's also the way 
React handles Moin styling.  
Most will place the styles in a 
separate document and import 
that into the component.  Sound 
familiar? It should.  So, at the
time the thought for many of us 
was seriously? You want us to 
style an entire application like
this? The very thought of 
styling an entire app by 
injecting styles seemed 
laughable at the time.  The big 
argument, right, had been 
working with CSS at scale.  From
the perspective of the CSS 
folks, this was not scalable.  
The font size, color palate of 
the application had changed 
several times since working on 
the proof of concept.  How will 
we manage monumental style 
changes like that? Surely there 
was a need for global
styles.  
    Even more at the time was 
distressing it couldn't do.   
learning whatInline
styles only supports a subset of
CSS.  CSS and JS allows you to 
use all the power.  We're going 
to get to those in a minute.  I 
know I keep saying that, but 
we're almost there.  While 
inline styles are lacking quite 
a bit, I think there are 
positives to them.  Inline 
styles forces you to change your
mental model and see each 
component as its own entity.  
This was something that it 
really did for me.  I will admit
that I was not against the idea 
of CSS and JS, but it did go 
against everything that I had 
learned in my years and years of
best practice, and it really put
my hackles up.  But sitting down
and writing a component and 
using inline styles really 
changed my view on that.  I was 
able to see the component as its
own concern and see the value in
being able to localize those 
styles.  And obviously, inline 
styles are the trump card in 
specificity, right? There's no 
way someone's going to 
accidentally override them or 
leave unused styles hanging 
around.  And if you intend to 
stick with React long term, your
styles are still going to work, 
it's going to be much easier to 
move those over.  So the cons 
list is a bit longer.  
So, you'll need to depend on a 
library to access basic CSS 
features.  And this was one of 
the big arguments from the CSS 
side at the time.  We're just 
adding all these things that CSS
does naturally.  Why would we do
this? And if you're not using a 
library, it's necessary to 
program JS work-arounds to 
address queries, pseudo 
selectors, all of the things 
that CSS gives you just out of 
the box.  And again, depending 
on which side of the debate 
you're on, you lose the cascade.
So you're not able to make 
mobile style changes using the 
cascade.  Every component would 
need to be touched if the 
changes were going to go across 
all the
components.  I got to say, it 
was really difficult to debug in
the DOM.  I did most of my work 
in the inspector.  When you're 
not using Mac and class names, 
it's difficult to tell what 
you're looking at, even when you
know what you're looking at.  
Because the styles are jammed in
with the rest of your elements. 
And interestingly enough, the 
components themselves don't 
really lend themselves to 
outside use in other code bases.
You're placing these styles 
directly in line.  You would 
have to go in and reconfigure 
every single one by hand in 
order to use it somewhere else. 
And another interesting thing 
that we found was that 
performance was not very good.  
A page full of inline styles 
were each tagged and needs to be
parsed is going to be less per
perform
mant than loading a single style
sheet.  CSS-in-JS is pretty hot 
right now, but in 2015, it was 
on fire.  There were not a lot 
of libraries.  I think at the 
time that we were developing, 
aphrodite had just come out.  I 
think it's evolved quite a
bit.  
    So, style components weren't
around in 2015, but I think they
represent a giant leap forward 
in CSS-in-JS libraries, so I'm 
going to talk about that today. 
So here we have our same frame 
component.  Should be very 
familiar with this component by 
now.  But there's a big 
difference in the way we're 
putting this together.  So style
components actually utilizes 
tagged template literals to use 
real CSS and Cree act normal 
React components.  We're 
importing style from style 
components.  We're importing 
that library, and we're able to 
construct a wrapper component 
that applies the styles to a 
section tag.  So 
wrapper=style.section.  In the 
DOM, that's going to generate a 
mapped class name that maps to 
those styles.  So it's a big 
difference in the way that you 
handle inline styles.  It's 
generating a CSS style sheet.  
So at_run time is loading at 
your document, and applying the 
class name to the styles.  
So, I would say that how you 
structure your component folder 
is going to be a team decision. 
And in most cases, should be 
decided before you ever touch 
the styles.  In this example, 
I've actually broken that 
component down even
further.  
    Here, the way we've broken 
it down is we've constructed 
each piece, and then I'm just 
building in my render, each 
piece of that component.  Here, 
I've actually broken out each 
one as its own separate entity, 
and I'm bringing them into my 
index file.  I can use these 
over and over again in other 
components and other areas and 
build like a bunch of le go
blocks.  This allows more 
flexibility and scalability long
term as you can easily move 
those pieces around to construct
larger components.  
    I think style components 
have a lot going for them.  And 
CSS-IN-JS libraries do, too.  
They allow you to write without 
context shifting.  It also 
enforces best practices by 
reproving that mapping between 
the HTML and the CSS.  Because 
you're building small, purely 
presentational components, 
they're independent and 
reusable.  Single-use class 
names -- there we go! Single-use
class names make naming easier 
with no chance of collision.  
You have containers and 
components, so you're separating
out your presentation from your 
logic.  Style components 
actually has basic SASS support 
so you can do things with 
variables, mix-ins, nestings.  
There's a lot of cool features 
there.  It even has native 
mobile support and theme 
support.  
    So there are some cons.  
Choosing CSS-IN-JS -- is one 
choice followed
by another 
choice.  CSS modules
question the So,is,what       
should I use? It

I know you were looking for one 
answer today, but there really 
is no one answer.  I think it 
really does depend.  There are a
lot of choices out there.  I 
think you need to start by 
asking the right questions.  So,
what are the mental models on 
the team? A mental model is 
based on belief not facts.  It's
are based on what users
think they know about a system. 
And understanding each person's 
mental model of styling can 
foster productive conversations.
I think having a good idea of 
how each person sees styling so 
that you can speak to their view
on it a little bit better can 
help you in those
conversations.
    And I think it's also 
important to acknowledge the 
different skill levels on a 
team.  If there's a mixture of 
skill levels, as I said, a lot 
of times you have designers that
are implementing your CSS, and 
may not be as comfortable in 
JavaScript.  Simplicity and 
clarity can really help everyone
stay together.  If you're a 
group of highly skilled devs, 
then I think introducing new 
technologies or complexities 
probably won't pose much of a 
problem.  And what do you need 
to build? Make sure you 
understand what you actually 
need to build.  There's a lot of
pressure in our industry to know
the latest framework, language, 
or whatever tech is making the 
rounds today.  And it can be 
really tempting to jump on the 
latest technology.  So before 
adding libraries and building 
complex styling
systems to make usability, make 
sure it's something you really 
need.  
Start as simply as possible, and
build from there.  
    And how you plan on 
structuring your project.  React
is not opinionated.  It will 
help you determine the style 
method that is going to work 
best for you within the rest of 
your team.  Are they going to be
kept together? Will you have the
need for access to global 
styles? Is that something you 
anticipate having to have? And 
these are a couple of 
considerations.  Think about 
these things before you jump 
into making that styling
decision.  
    Even more importantly is to 
create the right environment.  
Building things successfully 
requires more than the right 
technology.  It really does 
require the right environment.  
I think there are four 
ingredients to making that 
happen.  First, avoid dogma at 
all costs.  Taking extreme 
positions on a subject creates
tension and defensiveness before
conversations even get started. 
Build trust.  Taking risks is 
really hard to do.  It's even 
harder if you don't trust the 
people you're
doing it with.  
Embrace change.  Whenever you 
feel the urge to push back on 
something, lean in instead.  You
will be surprised how much you 
will learn and how many friends 
you will make along the way.  I 
think lastly, you need to be 
vulnerable.  It's okay to say 
you don't understand something 
or that you don't see the 
benefit in it.  Being honest 
opens up the chance for greater 
understanding for everyone on 
the team.  
    I think it's also important 
to remember -- I love this 
quote.  Having a thoughtful 
understanding of CSS to begin 
with is going to help you build 
greater things.  Whether you do 
it using CSS SASSless or 
CSS-IN-JS, understanding what 
you're building and how to use 
it is very important.  Thank 
you.  
Sarrah.
I have one question for you.  
You mentioned how to
[ Applause ]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; style React components.  It's
a very divisive topic.  You 
mentioned great tools to 
convince team members.  What if 
you have to work with someone 
who still does not agree with 
you? What do you do? How do you 
not lose friends that way? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Not everyone is going to be 
your friend.  I think at that 
point you have to agree to 
disagree so or commit.  Whether 
you agree or the other team 
member agrees, as long as you 
all commit to making that work 
and moving forward with it, it's
going to be just fine.  
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; First acknowledge  that 
not everyone can be my friend.  
And then commit to my decision? 
Okay.  
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Commit to that decision 
and keep going with it.  
Otherwise you will go round and 
round and refactoring, and it's 
going to be a much,mess.  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Makes total sense.  Thanks a 
lot, Sarrah.  
go into a ten-minute break.  The
next talk starts at about

@smiley845 with @whitecoatcapxg 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Hello.  How's everyone doing?
Everyone's still quiet.  
That's all right.  So I'm really
actually looking forward to this
next talk.  As JavaScript 
developers, we get used to a 
certain way of doing things.  We
get used to pushing pixels and 
working on complex UIs and all 
of that.  This talk aims to push
the boundaries of what you think
JavaScript is, and take you a 
step beyond web apps and 
websites and hopefully inspire 
you to, you know, further push 
the envelope on writing and 
utilizing JavaScript.  Please 
join me
in welcoming to the stage our 
next speaker. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Ow amaze  -- how amazing is  
in welcoming to the stage our 
nextJSConf so far? Let me start 
with a confession.  JavaScript 
is amazing and weird and 
peculiar and awesome and 
strange.  JavaScript is the only
one I know
like this.  We constantly 
complain when people contribute 
things.  And JavaScript is 
everywhere.  So my browser runs 
JavaScript.  My server runs 
JavaScript.  My TV runs 
JavaScript.  My washing machine?
Well, that doesn't run 
JavaScript.  It probably runs C
+ +.
It can even run weapons guidance
systems.  Only if you're using 
JQuery, that is.  They haven't 
uploaded the code to GitHub, so 
I haven't tested it yet.  But it
looks legit.  JavaScript is 
ubiquitous.  Everybody uses it. 
You don't have to trust what I'm
saying.  You can trust this book
from 2003, literally titled, 
&quot;how to do everything with 
JavaScript cooties.  It
-- it teaches everything.  
 So JavaScript does a lot of 
things.  But I'm here to show 
you maybe things that you 
weren't -- you thought weren't 
possible with JavaScript or kind
of off of the beaten path.  The 
cool thing about technology is 
that they allow all of our 
ideas, the good and interesting 
ones as well as the dumb and 
silly ones.  
    Okay.  I come to you from
Tel Aviv Israel, wheresilly 
ones.  
Okay.  I come to you the spoken 
language is Hebrew.  You might 
not notice, but my name, Opher, 
means fun.  Like Bambi.  
I'm not sure why I told you 
that.  It seemed important at 
the time.  I'm a designer, 
musician, and sometimes a gamer.
It turns out that JavaScript is 
really good for all of these 
things.  So that makes me a 
developer.  In my day to day, I 
work at a company called echo as
a creative developer.  What is 
that? According to some 
definitions, those being my
definitions, that means someone 
who works with other creative 
people like film maker, game 
makers, musicians, designers to 
do all sorts of cool interactive
things on the web.  And I want 
to start by telling you a little
story about myself and how I got
into web development.  So the 
year was 1997 or 1998, and I was
15 years old.  I was was 
spending a weekend at my 
grandfathers.  It was a there 
that I found a book about HTML. 
It was mesmerizing.  I remember 
hours of notepad and Netscape4 
trying to figure out what this 
thing does.  And I read about 
amazing technology called links 
that allowed you to connect one 
page to another web page, and 
that seemed amazing.  The 
problem is, it didn't work so 
well for me.  I didn't know what
was the problem.  I knew I did 
something wrong, but I wasn't 
sure what was wrong.  And then 
it hit me after a few hours.  
You see, it's not called a HIRF 
element, but a RIF element.  
That makes so much more sense.  
You understand why I didn't have
a girlfriend until the age of 
20.  But fast forward a few 
weeks later, and I had my first 
website up on geocities.  Does 
anyone remember geocities? Yeah,
I don't care.  It looked kind of
something like this. 
    Actually, it looked more
like this.  And you're laughing 
at this because it's hilarious. 
We didn't have fancy technology.
We didn't have CSS or the cloud 
or have any idea what we're 
doing.  We had to build our 
websites with nested tables.  I 
mean these kinds of nested 
tables.  And not long after, 
like I honed my skills, I worked
on making websites in the early 
or late '90s, that is.  And I 
finally as a teenager was able 
to make some pocket money by 
making websites for companies.  
So, like, one of the first 
websites I've ever made, an 
actual company paid me actual 
money for this thing.  I don't 
know why it looks like this.  
Maybe shoe-shaped side bars were
all the rage back then.  But the
funny thing about this is it has
a button that allows you to turn
off JavaScript.  That's an 
amazing feature.  But okay.  
Enough about me and my sense of 
nostalgia.  Let's talk about 
JavaScript.  What is JavaScript?
It allows us to add 
functionality to websites.  Turn
them from static things to 
interactive experiences.  Take a
look at this simple phone number
input, for example.  It's styled
nice with CSS.  But, this has a 
slight issue.  If you want to 
use this, you need to point your
mouse at the input and then, you
know, use the keyboard to input 
your numbers.  And, like, that's
inefficient.  It's inconvenient.
Maybe we can add buttons so that
you don't have to use the 
keyboard if you don't want to.  
That's easily solved with 
JavaScript.  Let's add buttons. 
Problem
solved.  I know what you're 
thinking.  Like, this is a joke.
This is an inefficient method of
inputting numbers.  I hear you. 
Let's fix that.  
Let's make this more efficient 
with JavaScript.  There.  We're 
done.  And I know.  We're like, 
we're already there.  JavaScript
gives us so much power and 
strength.  We can make this just
better for all of our users.  We
can just, you know, it's
endless.  
    So I studied design at the 
academy of arts and design in 
Jerusalem, which is one of the 
best design schools in Israel, 
with one of the worst design 
logos in Israel.  I don't know 
what they were thinking.  I 
can't even... When I studied 
there, I came to realize, how 
amazing would it be if you could
connect technology and art? And 
what technologies allow us to do
that? Check out this example.  
Here we see, using
canvas and JavaScript, an 
interactive art work.  Every 
time you click, you get 
something completely new.  
So every user that just plays 
with it gets his or her own 
artwork.  How amazing is that? 
That's JavaScript.  That's just 
code.  Just JavaScript.  And 
this creates these amazing 
patterns.  You can take this a 
step further.  You can transform
this into 3D.  So this one from 
the Google arts team generated 
machines via JS and web JL and 
JavaScript.  So every time you 
click generate, you get this new
machine, a beautiful thing that 
is generated from seemingly 
randomness.  Or another example 
would be this example where you 
have procedurally generated 
old-timey airplanes.  So every 
time you click on the next 
button, you get this new flying 
machine.  That's super cool.  If
you want to learn more about 
generating things, I definitely 
recommend you to take a time 
machine and go back into the 
talk yesterday.  If you don't 
have that, when talks are up, 
you should check that. 
    So, those are all personal 
experiences.  But JavaScript can
do so much more.  It can go out 
of your personal monitor and 
turn into a public thing.  So 
this work by a Polish born, San 
Francisco-based digital artist 
lets players and generate 3D
objects using the tools.  This 
is a public art piece in a 
public space.  And users can 
then take the thing
that they can print in the 3D 
printer.  
You can go bigger than that.
There's a country somewhere 
close to the north pole, or so I
heard, called Iceland.  And 
sometimes they do a conference 
where you can actually paint on 
the building where the 
conference is at.  If you ever 
get a chance, I definitely 
recommend going to that
conference.  But art is a really
good way to learn and understand
things.  It's -- it serves as a 
good way and a learning tool.  
    So this is a project that I 
made while I was studying there.
And I was obsessed with the idea
of evolution.  Evolution is a 
hard concept to understand and 
visualize, because you have, 
like, mutation and survival of 
the fittest and time and 
generation.  I thought maybe I 
can create something that will 
help me understand it.  So I did
this little code with some 
JavaScript.  And this has 
digital creatures with very 
simple rules.  Big creatures eat
little creatures.  Little 
creatures eat food.  Little 
creatures run away from big 
creatures.  From simple rules, 
you get this
amazing system, which it's kind 
of like a virtual aquarium that 
you look at.  And all of these 
emerging patterns arise, and 
it's mesmerizing -- and simple 
JavaScript.  I thought okay.  
How can we take that a step 
further? And I turned this into 
3D.  3D is always nicer.  But 
the cool thing about that is the
web is all about sharing.  So 
you can share your experience 
with someone else.  I thought if
I have my aquarium and you have 
yours, what would happen if 
these two eco-systems were to 
meet? If I have my creatures, 
and I open a portal up to your 
browser where you have your 
creatures, how would the two 
ecosystems interact? Would one 
of them completely obliterate 
the other? That's super cool and
something you can do by typing 
JavaScript and hitting in 
refresh a lot of times.  How 
amazing is that? But there are 
different ways to do learning.  
One of these is machine 
learning.  And JavaScript also 
allows you to do that.  So think
JavaScript might not be the 
first thing you of when you 
think about machine learning.  
But it turns out that it's a 
possibility.  So deeplearn.js is
a machine learning library in 
JavaScript. 
And I'm going to show you an 
example here.  The way it works 
is that I'm going to play a 
little melody, and then via 
machine learning, we're going to
hear another melody that's based
on the one I just played.  Let's
try this out.  
[ Notes playing... ]
    I didn't say it's going to 
be a good melody, just that it's
going to work.  If we're on the 
topic of music, music videos.  I
remember, again, as a kid, being
glued to the screen watching MTV
and
and those all were passive 
experiences.  But the web allows
us to be interactive.
ThisVH1, is an old but really 
cool example where you have 2D 
and 3D animation, or wherever 
you point the mouse, the stream 
of animals run around on the 
building.  And that way every 
user gets his or her's own 
personal experience.  
And it doesn't end there.  
This video clip for arcade fire 
&quot;Reflector&quot; uses web GL and 
cheaters, wherever you point the
mouse, there's an image 
collector there.  And also some 
3D where the dancer in the video
has this 3D thing overlaid on 
top of her, which you can play 
her.  Super cool stuff.  And the
options are endless.  This video
by real Estate is an actual 
canvas that you can paint on.  
Here I
tried to paint the sky blue.  
This is really hard ren the 
video keeps moving.  But it 
gives you something to play 
with.  You're creating art on 
top of someone else's art.  This
is something that is only 
possible due to web technology. 
    The next project is 
something I'm really proud of.  
This is the official video for 
bob
Dilan's like a rolling stone.  
The characters in the video are 
lip syncing to the song.  And 
the end user can pick which 
channel to watch.  So instead of
watching one music video, you're
kind of creating your own 
personal music video.  
And again, this is like web 
video.  It's just a video player
in JavaScript, and there are 
challenges here, but it's just 
pointing your browser somewhere 
and seeing this. 
Cool.  
    You can clap.  It's okay.  
That's one of the things
we do. 
One of the ultimate forms of 
interactive entertainment is 
video games.  A subject close 
and dear to my heart.  And video
games come in all forms and 
sizes.  Video games can be 
something really small
like this mini game and website 
for magicians where they use 
canvas 
and HTML to create some element 
while you're interacting with 
the website.  Or a video game 
can be like a 2D thing.  This is
a game I made to teach kids 
concepts in evolution.  Have I 
mentioned that I like evolution 
already? Never mind.  This is 
done with 2D library called 
phaser, which is based on a 
render called pixie.  You can 
take this to 3D.  So this is an 
actual 3D pinball game running 
in the browser.  The interesting
thing here is there is physics 
involved.  There is a library in
the background actually doing 
the calculations.  So you have 
physical simulation running in 
the browser.  But everything 
that we just saw is a 
single-player experience.  It's 
just you sitting in front of 
your computer or mobile or 
whatever, playing.  But the web 
is all about connecting people 
and sharing.  So the natural 
step from this is multiplayer 
games, players that have many 
players.  This one called wonder
by a game developer.  It gives 
you control over a tribe.  And 
then you fight other tribes for 
resources and land.  And that's 
super cool.  Games are usually 
written in things like C or C + 
+, but then you have to download
drivers and update your graphics
card.  But what if you could 
point your browser and just play
with someone else without having
to download anything?
That is what I had in mind when 
I wrote this.  It is a server 
and client that allows people to
create their own online, web 
video games without having to 
worry about writing net code or 
synchronization and all the 
other things I had to pull my 
hair out.  What can you do with 
lance? This is a game I made 
with lance.  It's called 
sprocket leak.  Each player 
controls a car, and these cars 
actually play soccer.  And this 
runs with 3D physics engine 
running on the server on the 
client.  And again this is all 
web technologies.  This is all 
stuff that you can do with just 
notepad.  You shouldn't do this 
with Notepad, but you can if you
want to.  
    Okay.  Another really cool 
technology that's up and coming,
but also out there is web 
assembly or its precursor, ASM. 
Which essentially allows you to 
take other languages like C or C
+ +, or could be anything, and 
compile them to anything that 
the browser can understand.  And
you have the browser running 
something far more effective at 
computation.  What does this 
help us with? An example would 
be porting the entire unreal 
really going is to be  great for
a lot of things that need real
game engine.  juice powering it.
I'm excited about things that 
had to do with virtualization 
and running in a browser.  So 
bear with me.  What if you could
run Windows 3.11 in a browser.  
How amazing would that be? So 
you could open up Paint and do 
something or Slider.  You could 
completely reimagine how it was 
when you were sitting in your 
mom's basement in the '90s.  And
this gets us to the next 
technology, which is web virtual
reality, or web VR.  Maybe 
you've heard about this.  But 
the way to learn about subjects 
that I don't know is to -- the 
way that I like is to look at 
stock photos of that specific 
thing.  
So if we look at stock photos of
web VR, we can learn all sorts 
of things.  For example, web VR 
is taking a stroll in nature.  
And maybe we have rainbows 
coming out of your crotch.  Or 
maybe web VR is sometimes being 
attacked by really old phones.  
Or maybe you don't need to put 
VR goggles to be in web VR, but 
maybe you take headphones and 
put them on your eyes and point 
at something and that works just
as well.  But VR and web VR 
specifically is all about 
putting you inside a virtual 
world.  In this example, you're 
in this musical landscape, where
you have -- sound? Okay.  And
we have these cute, tiny 
creatures where everyone has its
own little sound.  And you can 
kind of play around with them.  
And you are completely immersed 
in this thing.  But virtual 
reality is often times a product
of 3D models and something 
that's completely virtual.  And 
at work, I did something really 
cool.  It's this project called 
Broken Night, which is a 
live-action film which was shown
at tribeca film festival last 
year.  You're inside the film, 
and you can control it.  So the 
plot for this without too many 
spoilers is there's a couple who
had an argument and coming back 
home.  And then there's an 
intruder in the house.  And you 
get to live that moment.  So you
have, like, for example the two 
characters, the man and the 
woman.  And she takes the gun.  
And then as a viewer,
you see the project splits into 
two.  
And wherever you look, that's 
where the story is going to take
place.  Does the guy get the 
gun? Does the girl get the gun? 
You get to choose.  And then you
see with this interactive video,
the story that you would prefer 
to see.  The story is not 
linear.  It's completely 
interactive.  Cool right? 
This leads us to our next thing,
which is web augmented reality. 
Or as I like to call it, web-AR.
If virtual reality is about 
putting you in the virtual 
space, augmented reality is 
about taking the virtual space 
and putting it in the real 
world.  This example allows you 
to take a tablet and point it at
a kid's coloring book, and 
whatever the kid draws comes to 
life in 3D.  So recent 
developments in AR allow you to 
actually do that, or potentially
do that in the browser.  There 
was a talk about this by Raisa 
yesterday.  We talked about web 
VR.  And we talked about web AR.
And today there's a new buzz 
word.  If you combine these two,
it is now called web XR.  Or 
WebEx tended
ed -- web extended reality.  I 
know that Mozilla is pushing 
hard on a standard to progress 
this forward.  This is super 
cool stuff.  
    So the last thing we're 
going to talk about is the 
physical web, or the internet of
thingies.  There are a lot of 
interesting stuff going on 
there.  So one
of these is Nobot, which is a 
movement which aims to get 
JavaScript on actual robots.  
So, for example, if you have 
robots, and you have Node, and 
if your computer is in Spanish, 
then you can actually control 
the robot via JavaScript.  And 
that's pretty cool.  Or, you can
do something more, you know, 
something better.  You can make 
a cat remote control.  So all 
you need to do in order to get 
that is you need the Johnny 5 
JavaScript library.  And you 
also probably need a cat.  
That's a requirement.  Or, how 
about controlling a drone from 
your browser on your phone? So 
this is done via web Bluetooth. 
This example shows us how he is 
using JavaScript on his browser 
on his phone to connect to a 
drone and fly it.  He didn't 
download any app to do this, 
just like JavaScript API.  And 
this works today on mobile 
Chrome and also on Samsung 
internet, which turns out is a 
browser.  Super cool that you 
can do that.  
    So everything that I just 
showed you is out there in the 
wild.  You can just use that 
right now.  What does the future
hold? What's coming up next? 
    So, according to an HBO HBO 
sci-fi show about AI robots that
run a theme park, these are 
written using React.  I saw 
Dan's talk yesterday.  He didn't
say anything about robots, but 
maybe that's in the next 
version? I don't know.  
Hopefully.  Yeah.  Fingers 
crossed.  But other upcoming 
technologies? 
    What allows you to connect 
peripherals directly to the 
browser? Web NFC for near field 
communication from the browser 
or web MIDI for the music people
among us.  And I wanted to end 
with something that gives you a 
little perspective.  This was 
the first web
server ever that the team used. 
It literally had a sticker that 
said &quot;this is the internet.  
Don't power it down.&quot;
This was the first website that 
was used that it showed.  And 
you know, what a way that we 
have done from that day to what 
we can do today with what 
technology is.  That started 
there, and here we are.  400 
people who are passionate about 
web technologies coming together
to meet in Iceland to talk about
this thing that we are 
passionate about.  How amazing 
is that? I'm going to leave you 
with a parting gift.  An idea 
that might, again, not be the 
best.  But it's definitely not 
the worst.  And that is 
JavaScript dance party! 
[ Music ]
Okay.  Thank you so 
   much.  
[ Applause ]
before you leave, before I 
relinquish this stage, my 
friend, I had to show her that I
had more fun than her.  I'm 
going to take a selfie with you,
and you're going to make it 
appear as if you've had the time
of your life in this talk.  And 
then I am going to win.  Because
winning is important in 
marriage! Okay.  Okay.  Ready? 
One, two, three! Raise your
hands! Thank you so much.  
[ Applause ]
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thank you so much for that
talk.  I am definitely really 
inspired to play with all of the
technologies that you've 
introduced.  So I wanted to ask 
about what kind of experiences 
do you think that you're looking
forward to in terms of like web 
XR and web AR in the world of 
mixing art and JavaScript? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah, I think the interesting
things have already happened 
when the technologies are super 
ubiquitous where AR is not just 
in one form, and the forms are 
strong enough that it will be 
common knowledge that you go up 
to a store or open up a book and
something pops out of it using 
your phone.  I think that will 
be really cool in the near 
future. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I think so, too.  So our next
talk is happening around --
what time is it? 11:20.  So go 
take a break.  Drink water, get 
some coffee, and come back here 
around 11:20.  Thank you.

... we get a huge traffic spike 
at that point in time.  We get a
lot of hits on the website.  A 
lot of traffic comes in.  is the
To give you an idea, this kind 
of numbers that we -- oh.  
Slides are almost half cut off. 
Sorry about that.  Just a 
second.  Can someone
check this?
I guess, I can carry on in the 
meantime.  All right.  So, 
getting back to the content.  We
have it on 150 million 
registered users, and we have 
around 200 million visits over 
the five days of sale that we 
have.  In those kind of events, 
we usually sell close to half a 
million units of specific 
devices in under 15 seconds.  
That's a lot of traffic coming 
in at the exact same time.  That
makes the concept
of scaling important to us.  
Technically scaling, this is a 
definition I got from another 
book.  
Scalability is the capability of
a system to handle a growing 
amount of work or its potential 
to be enlarged to accommodate 
that growth.  It could be a 
system interface, a process, an 
application.  Why should it 
concern the JS
community? So, recently, JS is 
running in the browsers until 
recently, and that meant it was 
already distributed.  A lot of 
users visited a website at the 
same time.  It's a central 
location where all the traffic 
comes in and you run into a lot 
of issues.  The next is an 
article on medium.  And he 
mentioned that the concept of 
observability.  He mentions 
It tends to be less tested and a
more -- a new entry into that
picture.  
        [ Captioner is awaiting

manager.  Now what happens is if
you're rendering on the
server, bandwidth usage can grow
really fast.  This is a graph 
from one 
of our load tests.  And what 
happens here is that the numbers
on here, what happens if you are
serving 1,000of our load tests. 
And what happens here is 
kilobyte, and your machine is 
serving 100 requests per second 
and you have 100 machines in 
your cluster, that output will 
be 10gigabits pre second.  If 
you have another layer in the
middle.  That layer may not be 
able to handle that load.  So 
you need to make sure that your 
end-to-end chain in the graph 
can support whatever load you're
putting on them.  
You might -- so an easy way to 
solve this problem, and an easy 
way we found was compression.  
So you compress the HTML going 
out of your Node servers.  
Compress the amount of data 
you're sending out.  And 
compressing the HTML is a good 
idea.  So the easiest way to do 
that is drop in the compression 
module, and you're good to go.  
Not really.  We tried this as an
experiment, and it doesn't work 
very well.  What happens is the 
compression module has a high 
CPU cost.  The nodes cannot take
anymore requests while the 
stream is still being 
compressed, which is really bad.
It will just reject those 
requests.  What did we do? We 
found another solution, which is
to have a proxy capable of 
compression.  It is highly 
efficient, and it's very 
effective.  You can customize 
these kind of tools to have 
varying compression levels.  And
for us, another benefit was that
these are engine X crosses.  It 
has a proxy cache, which you can
use to cache static
files.  So this is what that 
likes like.  
You have node processes, a 
process manager in front of it, 
and you have a proxy cache or a 
compression layer in front of it
before it goes out of the 
machine itself.  Now how do you 
find these kind of issues? The 
key here is providing.  And that
can lead you to many other 
issues, also.  So what happens 
here is you need to understand 
your host operating system 
in-depth.  Like I mentioned 
before, why is this important? 
Like why does the host operating
system of your server,  why is 
it relevant tofront-end 
developers? We're in node, and 
we need to understand the
concept that when you serve a 
file, when you're running an 
application server, you are 
using ports and sockets to do 
that.  And there's a limit to 
how many upstream and downstream
connections you can make at any 
given time.  So you can use 
built-in
units.  The soft command gives 
you a list of open files.  And a
watch command lets you watch 
many. 
Frequently.  
You can just watch the output.  
What happens here is if you 
watch this and run a load test, 
you will see that you hit an 
upper limit.  Everything is a 
file in UNIX.  Every port you 
open, every connection you make,
it really can be presented as a 
file in your system if you're 
using a UNIX-based server.  
There's a limit to the number of
file descriptors.  Since there's
a limit for stability reasons, 
this will happen.  You have a 
command, which is the user 
limit, which will ship with very
same 
defaults, right? This is what 
the defaults look like.  
This is a very short list, which
is getting cut off, actually.  
The essential idea is there is a
limit to the file size that you 
can have.  The maximum number of
open files you can have, which 
is a default of 1024.  And the 
hope  open files limit includes 
the number of ports and sockets.
You can increase the limits.  
You should.  You should have 
better limits.  The 1024 are 
very low and don't actually make
sense.  You do that.  You will 
hit that limit at some point.  
So the next idea is that you 
have to reduce the usage and the
number of ports that you're 
opening and reduce the number of
sockets that you're keeping 
open.  So the key idea is to 
optimize your application 
itself.  These are the things 
that we looked at.  And these 
are low-hanging fruit.  You can 
reduce the number of codes by --
request user connections from 
the client site.  This also 
saves time.  You don't have to 
do the connection handshake 
again and again for every 
request.  And it looks very 
simple.  Essentially, whatever 
you're passing to whatever 
network you're making from the 
server, you add a layer and give
it a time-out.  And this allows 
you to reuse connections between
the
load balances on the machines, 
too.  The load balancer itself 
will have a limit on how many 
ports it can open.  Usually 
those machines are not in your 
control, so it's best to 
minimize the usage of those 
resources.  The next concept is 
connection pooling.  
Essentially, connection pooling 
is the concept of reusing 
sockets on your site, the server
side.  You pass a custom agent 
to fetch.  When you're making 
code, you can essentially, the 
fetch command defaults to its 
own agent.  If you don't parse 
this.  It does not have the 
concept of keep alive 
connections.  Here you can say 
you want a connection to be kept
alive, and how many connections 
can be kept open at a time? And
this helps when you are making
fetch calls.  A report is a 
short end end point.  The friend
will assign it in a different 
range and they will have 
different limits.  For limits, 
it's around 32,000 to 61,000. 
The OS will return the next 
available port, which can be a 
counter or from  a pool of
ports.
The TCP protocol, we had a great
call yesterday about finite 
state machines.  This is what it
looks like.  The key idea is you
have important states like 
established time rate and close 
rate.  Those are very important 
rates that your connection can 
reside in.  Essentially, what 
that means is the way -- the 
reason it works this way is that
when you make a TCP 
connection, it's a complex 
connection.  If your server 
closes the connection, the 
server has to wait for a final 
packet that it has been closed. 
So, TCP has a default
time out on both the server and 
the client.  If you do simple 
math based on 30,000. 
You will see that you run out of
veilable
ports.  As soon as you reach 400
unique requestses per second.  
Application server will not be 
able to take more requests.  And
the key idea is to just monitor 
and 
profile everything.  The moment 
the time rate connections and 
close rate connections show up. 
Your CPU might be free to handle
more requests, your operating 
system says I cannot give you 
anymore ports.  So these two 
things help us a lot.  So that 
brings me to the next idea on 
CPU.  We were
talking about ports and sockets,
but what about band 
idth.  The most obvious idea is 
first thing first, make
sure you are running the right 
one in production.  If you 
don't, you get a bunch of 
things.  You get a bunch of 
extra debugging and monitoring 
things which you don't need.  It
slows down your code.  And check
for it in every build that that 
is in fact the case.  So we have
to provide it continuously.  
Node has a built-in profiler.  
You run it with node--prof.  
Let's say you have a sample that
looks like this, and this comes 
from node's own
documentation.  
Essentially just running a hash 
on the password.  And when you 
run a profiler on this, the kind
of output you can expect is 
something like this.  What this 
tells you is on the 
C++line, not JavaScript line.  
It's not your fault that you're 
using so much CPU.  But the idea
is be sure what kind of 
liabilities you use and what 
they do internally.  
They may be blocking your CPU or
main thread.  When you dig 
deeper, you can find things
like this.  Maybe you switch 
this output in the library or 
push this off to a separate 
server or thread, and you can 
get your application server to 
take more requests.  Right? And 
you can do this using a lot of 
other tools.
So this output is not very 
user-friendly.  You can use the 
other tools.  But it is not very
Mac friendly.  A lot of 
developers use Mac, but D trace 
doesn't work well on Mac with 
frame drops.  There's a tool 
called 0X
which generates well on Mac.  
It's very easy to
install.  It will add injections
into the code, and it will give 
you this kind of an output.  
This is a flame chart.  It 
install.  It will add injections
into the code, and shows you the
amount of time on the X axis, 
amount of time on the CPU.
This will be familiar to you.  
It's a vertical mirror of the 
Chrome's flame chart.  It's 
another version of that.  When 
we ran this tool on the load, we
found some interesting facts.  
We found that the string was 
taking almost 60% of the CPU 
time, and that's an atomic 
function that we cannot skip.  
We were rendering heavy pages on
the server with a lot of known
nodes.  There's no way to avoid 
that.  Maybe with streaming and 
fiber, we can do that.  That's 
what we will be trying next.  
The interesting factor is 
serialization and 
deserialization of JSON were 
spending much of our time.  And 
we moved to nginx as a tool.  
These things make a huge 
difference.  Right? 
    So that's that.  And garbage
collection also plays an 
important role.  So you will 
find all of that in these kind 
of flame charts.  And very easy 
to look at the flame charts is 
that a flat top, like a plateau 
on this landscape is a bad 
thing.  If you have a plateau, 
that means that one function is 
monolithically spending that 
much time on the CPU.  Most of 
the sharp peaks are generally 
good.  Right? Good.  
    So
next idea is trying to avoid.  
Maybe if it's a small enough 
server file, cache it, but avoid
reading from the disk.
Try to use async as much as 
possible.  Another thing that we
noticed is we were using 
third-party loading services, 
which on digging deeper, we 
found out that they were 
actually loading in sync.  It 
was a synchronous 
command.  Make sure you know 
that you're not inadvertently 
using something that will cause 
you a lot of disk use.  Monitor 
your graphs and systems closely 
and watch your rates  and what 
the disksare rated for.  
    The next topic I wanted to 
mention is memory.  Essentially,
it's a simple idea.  Memory 
usage should stabilize at a 
given request rate.  You can use
a tool.  Essentially, a small 
library for node, which allows 
you to sort of -- it just raises
events when it detects a memory 
leak.  And it's really useful.  
It's able to tell you that there
is a memory leak, and you need 
to find out if there is a memory
leak.  How you do that is using 
the Chrome time line.  If you 
connect the Chrome process or 
universal JavaScript, then you 
can code in Chrome directly, and
find out by taking heap 
snapshots what is getting in 
your program memory.  Then from 
that you can look at allocation 
time line, so profiles of 
actually figuring out what is 
causing the leak.  Cool.  
So that was the four pillars, 
the four major bottlenecks that 
you can run into.  Now a very 
important factor is that you 
need to have realtime monitoring
for your systems.  What I mean 
by that is that you can have a 
load test going on in a machine.
When you actually run the load, 
make sure you monitor your CPU, 
RAM, disk usage, see what it 
looks like.  
But make sure you leave some CPU
for the OS.  If you run at 90% 
CPU usage, it's usually not a 
good idea.  You need to allow 
the operating system, for node 
to do garbage collection.  And 
node to do its own tasks, and 
allow for traffic bursts, which 
can happen with real traffic.  
Ideally, we have seen if you 
keep 20% CPU, and actually 
programmatically start rejecting
requests when you reach that 
limit, it's a good idea and 
prevents systems from shutting 
down by hitting their own 
limits.  
    So, key take aways from this
would be that you need to load 
profile, fix, and repeat.  Put 
load on your systems, profile it
continuously, fix those issues, 
and just repeat.  And a little 
dev ops goes a long way.  As 
front end devs, a
lot of times we have inhibition 
on monitoring stuff, and not 
understanding how low level 
items work.  What I have seen 
helped us a lot, it's more and 
more important that we 
understand how the back-end 
servers work and what we can do 
to optimize them.  Cool.  So 
that's all from my side.  The 
slides are here.  And that's my 
Twitter handle.  Reach out to me
if you have any 
questions.  
[ Applause ]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thank you so much for that.  
Do you think that any -- 
are there any current node 
features, either being actively 
worked on or in the future that 
would help
with a lot of what you 
discussed? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Definitely.  I think there 
are a lot of features, including
some mentioned yesterday that 
will definitely help us a lot.  
You can think of streaming 
requests and responses.  You 
cannot block your main thread.  
Whatever you can do to avoid 
blocking the main thread, 
because that allows you to take 
a request.  If the request 
cannot reach the node process, 
there is no point in trying to 
handle it.  There are a lot of 
node features coming up that 
will help us. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Awesome.  Thank you so much. 
   &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And so it's come to my 
favorite part of the day, which 
is food.  Lunch is the greatest.
So lunch would be, I think, in 
this floor and also we still 
have swag on the fifth floor.  
So if you want to get your swag 
or backpacks or hats, you can go
upstairs.  Thank you
so much.

    Okay.  That didn't go as

planned.  
or web. 
        Okay.  This one was 
better.  Thank you.  Cool.  
Let's get back to the 
presentation.  So this talk is 
called code, play, and rock n 
roll.  I hope to code some and 
play some guitar, and hopefully 
we'll enjoy the show.  All 
right.  Great.  
So before we start, a
lot of you are familiar with the
scene, but this is what a real 
pedalboard looks like.  These 
are all tiny gadgets that shape 
the sounds that we all know out 
there.  And this is how it can 
look in software in one of the 
tools for products that I've 
done called 
pedals.io.  This is a 
representation of real life 
guitar pedals.  You saw two of 
them in the short demo, and we 
will add more, of course, delay,
reverb, and lots more in the 
coming minutes.  I'm
Armagad, and I come from Berlin.
We are building electric 
scooters like Vespa, but with 
electric batteries.  I'm the 
founder of a software school for
women.  And I like to play a lot
with code. 
I have a lot of open-source 
projects on GitHub that range 
from brain signal processing to 
audio processing to front-end 
libraries and platforms as a 
service and microservices and a 
lot of other stuff.  
    So what is mid audio? This 
is an amazing playground for us,
the other musicians. 
    So The API is basically 
built into all of the major 
browsers.  It givings you 
everything you need to build 
high-quality audio applications 
that are like this, pedalboards.
Or full-fledged digital audio 
stakeses, or game audio in a 3D 
room where you can adjust the 
position of the sound.  And you 
can have specific start times 
and end times for specific 
samples so it matches with your 
animations or characters.  And 
you can do some production 
applications or media production
applications.  Like DJ image 
sync tools.  Anything you are 
used to using on your computers 
or on your phones or iPads or 
tablets, they are available 
through web audio API.  And you 
can build any dream application 
that you have in mind that 
includes audio, as well as art 
installation as well.  You can 
combine it with the input that 
comes from a camera, and you can
basically turn it into sound.  
You can turn the pixels that the
camera captures and portray it 
as sound samples or any kind of 
sound effects.  
If you have ever imagined 
anything about audio, that's 
available through web Audio.  
This is what I had imagined, to 
be able to play guitar effects 
free, everywhere, without the 
need of installation of a 
software.  And basically, I made
it possible with web Audio API. 
    So
a little bit about Web Audio API
and its basic structure.  Web 
Audio API is a network of nodes.
You create some nodes, and they 
are either a source so that they
represent a signal like an MP3 
file, for example, or an 
oscillator, like a keyboard, 
which is a source of sound.  Or 
they are sound processing units,
sound processing nodes.  So 
these can be, as you see here, 
like a delay effect that is like
an echo that repeats the sound. 
Or a gain effect that improves 
or amplifies the sound.  Or 
sound
filters that I will demo in a 
couple of minutes that I can do.
At the end, there's a target, a 
destination, an output, which is
your headphones or your 
speakers, or it can be a 
recording target so that you
can save whatever you created 
with Web Audio to an MP3 file.  
The idea is very simple.  You 
create these nodes, and you set 
some parameters, which is very, 
very simple, extremely simple.  
You don't have to know a lot of 
math.  Actually, you don't even 
have to know math for anything 
except one special
node.  It is there to introduce 
gain distortion effects.  You 
connect them together, starting 
from the source, from the 
guitar, or of course, that's a 
guitar for me. 
But whatever source of input you
want.  Maybe it's
a mic or another audio file.  
And you connect them however you
like to the output.  And 
everything happens in
realtime.  Okay.  
    Okay.  So Web Audio holds a 
lot of components.  Everything 
has to happen within audio 
context.  Anybody familiar with 
canvas API? In order to draw 
something to the screen, you 
have to get ahold of the 
context.  And other contexts are
basically the same.  In order to
do any audio application, you 
need to have an audio
context.  
You can have more than one, 
multiple plugins or
applications.  Then there's the 
context for you to be able to 
record something, again, and a 
lot of processing nodes, 
processing units like 
gain, delay, panner.  Panner is 
used to direct the sound to 
either left or right
channels.  
Convolver is used to introduce 
the 
eco
-- echo effects.  A hole effect.
They are made possible by 
filters.  And a convolver node 
is used there.  You can have an 
analyser node.  You can grab the
signal and look at the frequency
content, look at the power.  And
you can do various effects based
on that.  You can split them 
into multiple channels, multiple
tracks, so that the graph can 
get wider and wider as you want.
It has a lot of nodes.  And 
lately, they also introduced 
some audio worker.  
So it's like a service worker.  
It works in the background in a 
separate thread.  And basically,
it allows you to implement your 
own algorithms and your own 
scripts or functions that will 
run per sample.  But it will run
off-thread, so you won't see the
performance penalty.  So you 
won't be using the main thread 
of the browser.  But it's 
parallel so that you can have 
multiple of them.  It makes the 
browser a very nice competitor 
for digital audio workstations. 
You can get real, 
production-grade audio 
applications right inside
the browser.  Okay.  Here's a 
very small example.  You start 
by creating a context.   You do 
new audio context.  And as I 
said, everything is hosted under
that context.  So, you can 
create a game node, which will 
amplify the incoming signal by 
doing context.create gain.  And 
you can connect it to the 
destination, which is the 
speaker output or whatever you 
like, again.  Here's another 
example to basically load an MP3
file and use it as the source.  
You can create
a buffer source and load the 
buffer that you downloaded from 
the internet and use it 
connected to the gain as the 
input.  This basically gives you
a graph where the source is at 
the beginning.  In the middle 
you have the gain, and in the 
end, you have the destination.  
But this is basically as simple 
as just loading an MP3 file.  
Okay? 
Let's talk about pedalboard.JS. 
It is the first open-source Web 
Audio framework.
I guess I did it in 2012.  Back 
then, Web Audio API wasn't a
thing.  It couldn't capture 
directly from your sound card.  
And could only work with static 
buffers.  But, those days are, 
fortunately, behind us.  And six
years later, it's still one of 
the best interactive libraries 
out there.  Full disclosure, I 
wrote it.  It's GPL licensed.  
It has a very nice 
documentation, both inside the 
source code and as a read me.  
And it has very nice 
abstractions.  If you are into 
building your own pedals, which 
I am, you can build your own 
pedals here very easily and make
it a part of the library.  Or 
play with it however you like.  
    Anybody doing guitar 
electronics, like their own 
pedals? Nobody? Okay. 
Interesting.  It's very fun.  I 
started by doing real electronic
circuits for overdrive pedals, 
and moved on to the digital 
world, because this is a lot 
easier.  So you have pedal 
boxes, pots, meters you can 
twist and turn around, switches 
you can push, and LEDs that can 
blink, and you bring these 
together to make pedals.  This 
is built on top of something
called Google closure library.  
Anybody using that? One person. 
You are my hero.  Anybody who 
has used
it before? Another person.  It's
arguably the best user interface
library out there.  It's by 
Google and it's what Gmail, 
Google docs, and what all the 
other serious Google tools are 
built on.  It's like nothing 
that all the other guys can do 
out there.  But yeah, Google 
closure compiler has invest 
most, which rewrites from 
scratch, doing a lot of 
optimizations, just like a real 
compiler, like a C compiler.  
And it also optimizes for speed,
download speed, and for run time
performance.  So a
pedalboard.JS was built on this 
because it was the best choice 
in 2012.  I guess I want to 
rewrite it now with ES6.  If 
anybody wants to offer a hand, 
that would be appreciated.  It 
uses a MVVM architecture, which 
is kind of out of fashion right 
now in the 
front-end world.  
    So you have a stage.  As the
audio context in pedalboard.JS, 
everything starts with a stage. 
Without a stage, there is no 
musicianns.  Even if you are 
playing in your bedroom, that's 
your stage.  Then you have a 
pedalboard that hosts your 
pedals.  And you have some 
boxes.  Usually they're empty, 
so it's like a class, but you 
can fill them and make them 
guitar 
pedals.  For example, a reverb 
pedal is a box with inner 
circuitry.  LEDs, pots, file 
inputs.  Maybe the most 
important one is the stream 
input, which is the thing you 
use to capture the sound of your
guitar or live instrument or 
also a microphone.  So you can 
do pretty fun effects with your 
voice just in your browser.  
Okay? 
I'm not going to go into the 
details here.  I'm going to show
you some code.  But before that,
I also want to talk about web 
media API.  Anybody, please 
raise your hands if you have 
played with the web media API.  
One, two, three.  
Okay.  This is another fun API. 
You can do anything with it.  
You can grab any DY
-- DJ or musician gear or a drum
pad, or something like this.  So
this is also a media controller.
It's a wireless blue tooth MIDI
controller.  
Basically, you can connect this 
to the browser directly and get 
some messages from that, 
depending on which key you press
or which button you press, you 
get a different message on your 
browser.  You can use it for 
scrolling pages or hiding adds 
or, I don't know, photo 
applications like photo 
Forfilters. me, for example, I'm
really sick of editing tiny 
sliders on my phone when I edit 
photos.  Or in the computer with
a mouse, you have to click 
something to change the 
brightness of an image, for 
example.  But if you have a MIDI
controller that has a knob that 
you can turn, it's a lot simpler
to modify images or sound if you
are a DJ.  
Basically the mixer that you see
before the musicians, they are 
also MIDI controllers.  And they
can be reflected right in the 
browser, and it's super easy to 
get started.  These gears are 
like, they start from $20 or 
something? So you can get 
extremely cheap MIDI gear.  And 
use it as an external input 
device to the browser, because 
with a mouse, you can only do so
much.  But tactile  have ainput 
is really good.  If you pad or a
slider or fader or a knob that 
you can twist to, I don't know, 
to turn on the volume of YouTube
videos or something.  
It's really, really effective.  
And of course, you can also do 
some games
with it.  Here it is.
So this is a game I implemented 
in one of the DJ gears.  The one
on the left is the real DJ pad. 
The right is a browser.  So I 
basically mirrored it in the 
DOM.  So that's a snake game 
that I play with a real DJ 
device.  So you can turn the 
lights on and off through the 
browser.  It's connected over 
blue tooth.  And yeah.  You can 
do a lot of stuff
with it.  What does this look 
like? Ill re it's really simple.
It gives you something that 
inputs and  with it.  What does 
this look
outputs.  You attach an event 
handler.  There you get an event
every time something changes in 
the MIDI device.  Likeoutputs.  
You attach when you press a 
button or turn a knob or 
anything.  You get an event that
is not that significant except 
for the data, which is an area 
of three values or sometimes two
values.  And they are the 
numbers, the channel that the 
signal is coming in.  The node, 
the program change signals, and 
its value.  It's either zero or 
any value up to 127.  It's very 
simple.  And then you do 
whatever you want with it.  And 
of course, as you can imagine, 
what I did
with that is
I connected it to my pedalboard,
thatand I can turn on and off my
pedals in realtime as
I play, because I don't have a 
third hand yet.  So here is the 
pedal.
That is the patch that I was 
using.  First, I actually want 
to show you how the -- yep. 
So, if you see it there, the LED
is blinking.  It's turning off 
and on.  And I can also turn on 
and off the second one.  If I 
long-press this, it will change 
go to the second song so thatthe
patch.  So it will I can play
that one.  I can turn on and off
different pedals.  And the other
one has a very nice pedal called
a wa pedal.  Anybody familiar 
with that? With the wawa pedal? 
Good.  You should learn the wa 
pedal.  Okay.  It's like
this device.  Everything is 
apparently called a is also 
pedal, but this called a pedal. 
You can step on it.  You can 
step on it to change the value. 
And look at the second one.  I 
hope you can see it.  The effect
knob changes as I move my pedal.
Which means, it opens or closes 
the wa pedal depending on the 
position.  Basically I use these
with my library to make some
some code.   see
    Nowlet's
So, is it readable? From the 
back? That's nice.  Thank you.  
So again, it's very, very 
simple.  I included 
pedalboard.JS as a global 
library.  This is a module, some
of the data components are 
available in the global context 
in the window.  So I call 
something called a stage.  It 
has its  own context.  So stage 
creates its own audio context.  
And that is what you use to 
create your audio pedals.  You 
create a pedalboard.  You use 
the stream input to get
the guitar.  And you set the 
board to the stage.  And then 
you have
some pedals. 
first  Thethere. 
Yeah.  one is a noise gate. 
Let's see.  So you have three 
pedals out A noise gate 
basically saves our ears.  When 
you use distortion and 
overdrive, there's a lot of buzz
and hum, and that's not ideal.  
You use a noise gate to block 
those noises, and it has a 
switch that
Youoff. can change it, and it's 
dynamically reflects in you can 
toggle on and
the value.  You can change it 
through 
code.  Or through this pedal.  
Let me try another one.

    Thank you.  This is 
pedalboard.JS, and this is what 
you can do with the browser, 
only a fraction of it.  I 
encourage you to take a look.  
Thank you 
again.  
[ Applause ]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thank you so much.  I hope I 
can try it later.  I play the 
guitar as well.  I want to ask 
you, for
people who want to learn more 
about playing Web Audio online, 
I know there's a ton of 
resources out there to learn 
more about it.  But what would 
you recommend? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Chrome has a lot of 
 That's recommendations 
collected in a list.  So 
yes, it's on my site. 
Web Audio has like 500 different
experiments that you can play 
with, see the source code, and 
enjoy and learn, of course.  So 
that's the perfect place to 
start.  It gives you a lot of 
ideas to build with.  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Awesome.  Thank you so 
much.  
[ Applause ]
so we have a break for about ten
minutes.  Our next talk starts 
at 1:40.  Go grab a drink, and 
come back for more talks.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Hello.  Welcome back.  
How's everybody doing? I have a 
few announcements to make.  
Later today we will have a 
speaker panel, and that's 
between 
Anna Dan, and Martin.  
That's going to be later today. 
And you can submit questions 
through Slido.com, and the event
code is Anna Dan, and Martin.  
That's going to be later today. 
And you can submit questions 
JSConf.  Go submit your 
questions, and we will discuss 
them on stage.  
And so anyways, to our next 
talk.  I feel like our next talk
is very important and definitely
needs to be talked about more 
often in the workplace and 
everywhere else.  It givings us 
-- gives us an overview of key 
statistics in mental health and 
efforts done by the nonprofit 
organization called open 
sourcing mental illness.  
Let's give it up for Nara. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Can you all hear me okay? 
All right.  My name is Nara 
Kasbergen.  I'm here from 
Washington D.C.  I'm actually 
going to save most of my 
introduction for the second part
of the talk.  I first want to 
cover statistics and definitions
related to mental health to make
sure we're all on the same page 
here.  I will go more into my 
own story and why this is so 
important to me.  The bulk of 
the talk is going to be focused 
on things all of us can do in 
our own workplaces and lives.  
Common sense, action-oriented 
things that we can all put into 
action to support mental health 
better.  There's a short section
the end of things we all have in
to do together.  It's more 
difficult and more aspirational,
but still needs to be done.  
    So first, what are we 
talking about? If there's 
anything that I want you to
walk away from here is this 
statistic.  One in five adults 
are walking around with a mental
illness.  It's one of the most 
prevalent chronic health 
conditions, but we really don't 
ever talk about it.  To be 
clear, when I say mental 
illness, I'm talking about any 
one of these.  Some of these you
may have heard of before, some 
of these you may not have.  
There's a phenomenon called 
co-morbidities.  It means when 
you have one of these, it often 
makes you more prone to develop 
another illness.  Depression and
anxiety.  ADHD
and anxiety often go together.  
Two that I wanted to point out 
specifically are autism spectrum
disorders and burn-out.  So 
autism spectrum disorders are 
kind of part of a bigger 
umbrella term of mental 
disorders, but they're often 
accompanied by other things like
learning disabilities and 
sometimes physical health 
issues.  So they often require 
their own kinds of treatments 
and interventions.  So 
organizations that focus on 
activism around mental health 
often focus around some of the 
rest of these or autism spectrum
disorder specifically, because 
they require more specialized 
treatment.  I will not talk to 
much about autism spectrum 
disorders today, because the 
organization I work with is 
focused on others.  What I will 
talk about is still relevant for
autism as well.  And obviously 
we're going to be talking a lot 
about the workplace, so I wanted
to call out the idea of 
burn-out, especially in the 
United States, where I come 
from, the idea of burn-out was 
introduced in the 1970s, there 
was quite a bit of push back.  
Saying it's silly that you can 
get sick from working too much. 
I looked at where are we at in 
2018 and what does
the research say? And most 
psychologists say that burn-out 
is actually depression.  At the 
end of the day when they control
for all kinds of factors, the 
symptoms are essentially the 
same.  It's depression from 
prolonged stress from working so
much.  We don't have to say  
necessarily, butdepression, 
burn-out.  I figured since we 
will be talking about the 
workplace, it's an important 
thing to know about.  
A big problem with mental 
illness is there's often 
preconceived notions about what 
that means.  If I say mental 
illness to a stranger, chances 
are they will think of something
like schizophrenia.  But 
depression is one of the most 
common mental illnesses and 13 
times more prevalent than 
schizophrenia.  There's lots of 
misunderstanding about things 
like the symptoms of depression.
We often associate it with 
feelings of saddens, emptiness, 
loss of pleasure and interest in
normal activities, and 
tiredness.  But there's a whole 
spectrum that can include things
like angry outbursts and 
irritabilityirritability.  
Insomnia or sleeping to much, 
agitation and restlessness.  
When women experience 
depression,
they're more prone to experience
loss of interest in normal 
activities, and men are more 
likely to have theoutbursts.  
Because angry  we don't often 
associate those with depression,
men are more likely to not even 
realize that they're suffering 
from depression.  
    Another problem with 
depression in particular is we 
tend to shame people for feeling
this way.  And a lot of people 
with depression often say that 
they'll hear things like I can't
believe you are feeling sad when
kids in Africa are starving.  
There's a rebuttal that does its
rounds on the internet.  Telling
someone not to be sad because 
others have it worse is like 
telling people that they can't 
be happy because others have it 
better.  
Another really great 
illustration of the stigma
against mental illness is from a
web comic.  It's called helpful 
advice, and a subtitle if 
physical illness were treated 
like mental illness.  It says 
you have to at least make an 
effort.  On the right, you just 
need to change your frame of 
mind, then you'll feel better.  
Have you tried, you know, not 
having the flu? I don't think 
it's healthy that you have to 
take medication every day just 
to feel normal.  Don't you worry
that it's
changing you from who you really
are? It's like you're not even 
trying.  Lying in bed is not 
helping you.  You need to try 
something else.  And all of the 
stigma and shame is a big 
problem.  Even in high income 
countries like Iceland and the 
United States, anywhere from 35 
to 50% of people with mental 
disorders do not receive any 
kind of treatment.  And that's a
problem, because, for example, 
with severe depression, 50% of 
people end up dying by suicide. 
So when the stakes are so high, 
you would think that people 
would speak up.  The reason they
don't is because of fear.  Fear 
of dismissal, fear of being 
taken out of promotion 
consideration, fear of reduced 
hours for hourly workers.  Fear 
of being asked to take unpaid 
medical leave, and just in 
general, a fear of being treated
differently.  And another 
problem in the workplace and 
especially in western countries 
is you have this idea that you 
should leave your personal life 
at home when you come to work.  
But with mental illness, you 
can't just shut off your 
depression for eight hours a 
day, work productively, and come
home and deal with your 
depression again.  We have to do
a better job of accepting people
as their whole selves.  
Now I'll talk a
little about myself and why I 
speak up about this.  And I 
legitimately get asked this 
question a lot, because I am 
software a engineer just like 
all of you.  I'm not a mental 
health professional.  I have 
taken one psychology class in my
whole life.  I also identify as 
mentally healthy.  
There are others who speak up 
about this topic and they
usually do so because they are 
living with mental illness 
themselves.  The reason why
I speak up is because of her.  
She is my best friend.  We met 
while we New York  were both 
living inCity.  She had just 
moved there from Seattle.  She
studied biochem in college.  She
was interested in design and 
technology, and she convinced a 
company to give her a fellowship
where she could learn the tools 
of the job on the job.  So she 
and I hit it off immediately and
became really close, and she was
doing really well at work.  And 
studied biochem in college.  She
was interested in design and 
technology, and she convinced a 
company to give her a fellowship
where she could learn the tools 
of the job on the  after about a
year and a half in New York 
City, she realized that the next
best thing that she could do to
ed a  advance her career is move
to San Francisco and work at a 
start-up.  I was sad to see her 
go, but we kept in touch and 
still talked all the time.  When
she got to San Francisco, her 
imposter syndrome started 
becoming more of a problem, 
coming from a non-traditional 
background in tech.  That was an
issue, because she had been 
living most of her adult life 
with bipolar disorder.  We 
thought she was doing okay.  We 
thought she was doing better, so
it took us all by surprise when 
in September 2016, she took her 
own life.  So all of this is 
still really difficult for me to
talk about. 
If you want to know more about 
this, I wrote
a very long blog post about this
on medium last year.  But after 
all of this happened, and after 
I had a little bit of time to 
process all of this, I realized 
that I 
wanted to turn my grief into 
action.  I started volunteering 
with an organization called open
sourcing mental illness.  He had
been part of the PHP conference 
circuit for a number of years.  
About four or five years ago, he
started speaking up about his
own experiences.  His talk 
resonated with a lot of penal, 
and they decided to form a whole
organization around it, which is
an official nonprofit in the 
United States now called
And so  open sourcing mental 
illness or OSMI.awareness 
campaigns are a really big part 
of what OMSI does.  But we also 
have a research arm.  We put out
a survey every year where we 
basically ask any and all of you
working in the tech industry to 
answer these questions that 
allow us to gauge what the 
attitudes are towards mental 
health in tech.  Every year we 
will change up the questions a 
little bit.  But there's always 
a variation of this one 
question, which shows us we have
a lot of work to do.  It's two 
variations of one question.  Do 
you think discussing a physical 
health issue with your employer 
would have negative 
consequences? And do you think 
discussing a mental health issue
with your employer would have 
negative consequences.  On the 
left, for the physical health 
question, the noes make up 75% 
of all the responses.  But on 
the right for the mental health 
questions, the yeses and maybes 
make up two-thirds of the pie.  
That's a pretty striking 
difference and shows that we 
have a lot of work to do.  
So I've
been involved for almost a year 
and a half now, and my biggest 
contribution in this community 
has been to sit back and listen 
to people like Ed tell their 
stories and try to think about 
what people like me can do.  
There have been times when that 
has been tough.  But there's a 
quote that Ed used in one of his
talks that I thought was really 
powerful and it opened my eyes 
to how I really needed to 
approach this.  I can do so many
awesome things if only my own 
head didn't get in the way.  The
first time I heard this, it 
stopped me in my tracks.  My 
ability to do my job as a 
software engineer rests solely 
in my head.  I don't need 
muscles.  I'm not a construction
worker.  I go to work every day 
and take for granted that my 
brain is going to do everything 
I tell it to do.  But people 
like Ed can't do that.  So I 
started thinking about, you 
know, what if this is how I felt
as I went about my day? How 
would my environment have to 
change in order to accommodate 
this better? And so that kind of
led me down this path of 
thinking more about what can the
rest of
us do? I started characterizing 
the tech industry and think 
about what the unique challenges
andistics character
are.  Many of us have relocated 
for a job.  Most of us work 
remotely at least part of the 
time.  So
many specific things break 
overnight, and there is a heavy 
emphasis on drinking culture.  
So I started thinking about this
in
particular.  My friend, Ni, had 
relocated twice.
One of
her friends mentioned at the 
funeral that she mentioned she 
kind of regretted not going back
to Seattle where her family was.
I was thinking about this a lot 
and thinking it can't be all 
bad.  There have to be 
legitimate reasons why we 
relocate.  So I started 
approaching it from that angle, 
thinking about what are the
pros and cons.  On the  positive
side, it makes it easier to feel
like you're part of the team and
helping towards the mission if 
you're on site with everyone 
else.  It can bring you closer 
to a community of practitioners 
in your field compared to where 
you currently are.  It takes 
someone away from the existing 
support structures that they 
have already Beaumont up, like 
the therapist they are seeing or
the friend you can go to see at 
1:00 in the morning because you 
need a good cry.  Moving is 
generally stressful, and making 
new friends as an adult is 
surprisingly hard.  I started 
thinking about solutions, and I 
promise
I'm going to focus more on 
pragmatic ones, but the first 
one is a bit more aspirational. 
But I strongly believe that as a
community we need to stop saying
the best way to succeed in tech 
is to
relocate to silicon valley.  We 
need to be a lot more accepting 
of alternative choices.  If you 
are a manager, take another look
at hiring practices and see 
whether hiring remote first 
employees is an option.  And 
finally, if that's not an 
option, if someone does have to
relocate to join your company, 
be sure you focus on helping 
introduce that colleague to 
people in the area after hours, 
ways for them to start building 
up the support structures again.
    I mentioned remote work as a
positive, and I think in 
general, it is a positive.  For 
example, it often leads to more 
flexible hours, and that in turn
is good, because it makes it 
easier to attend daytime therapy
appoints.  It turns out that
therapists like to work 9 to 5 
Monday through Friday like all 
the rest of us.  So a lot of 
people that I've
talked to have said that working
from home on the day that you 
see your therapist is so much 
easier because you can duck out 
without everyone knowing that 
you're 
going somewhere else.  It's
often easier to take medication 
and breaks and it's easier than 
being in the office.  
    But there is a sense of
isolation.  I have a couple of 
friends who have started working
from home.  Why have I not been 
doing this my entire life.  I 
love working in my pajamas, this
is great.  But after two 
months, a sense of isolation 
sets in, and they start 
complaining about feeling 
lonely. 
They miss the water cooler 
conversations and connections 
with colleagues.  
And along the same lines, in 
general, working can remotely 
make it harder to build strong 
relationships with your 
co-workers, especially if you're
the only one who is remote.  If 
good you just want to be a
supportive colleague, it can 
make it harder
to
it can also make it challenging 
to maintain a work life balance,
especially tell if arch is doing
okay.  And 
if you are truly working from 
home and your home is your 
office, I have heard people say 
it's difficult to
say it's 5:00, I'm not going to 
respond to work e-mails and 
Slack anymore.  
    Some solutions? Co-working 
spaces are excellent and 
undervalued.  And I think one of
the biggest barriers to people 
trying it out is there is often 
initiation fee or a monthly fee 
that you have to pay.  So a good
solution for this is to have the
company at
the very least pay for the first
month so the person will be more
likely to try it and see if this
is for them.  This not something
that you is have to do every 
day.  
I have heard even if people go 
into a co-working space once a 
week, it's helpful and makes 
them feel less
isolated.  Make sure you 
occasionally fly in remote 
employees or hold offsite 
meetings to make sure everyone 
feels a part of the team and 
they're getting a chance to 
bond.  And there's 
research around remote work 
culture and how to make it 
better.  There's so many 
resources to leverage.  There 
are conferences around this now.
Look at the latest state of the 
art around remote work.  Try 
some things with you team if you
find that you are still 
struggling and see if it works  
Therefor you.  are just so many 
things to try.  
So, the first time that I was 
going give this talk, one of the
things that surprised
me the most was someone came 
back and said what about open 
plan offices? What are you 
planning to say about that? I 
actually had not planned on 
saying anything at all, but I 
figured it's a good khi.  
Question.  I will do research.  
Creative problem solving between
multiple employees, people 
having more organic 
conversations that led to 
solutions.  I used to think 
that's why everyone did it, but 
it's actually easier to 
construct offices that way 
because of things like building 
fire codes.  It can also 
increase a sense of team unity, 
but I really want to emphasize 
the can here.  If there's 
already friction, it can 
increase resentment instead.  On
the negative side, the number 
one complaint is the noise and 
how it reduces productivity.  
From a mental health 
perspective, I think the biggest
concern is the lack of privacy. 
When I talked about remote work 
before, working from home makes 
it easier to duck out in the 
afternoon for your therapy 
appointment, this is the exact 
opposite.  You're working 
closely with everyone, so if you
need to duck out for a therapy 
appointment, everyone's going to
know about it.  People have 
cited an increased sense of 
stress, and there's increased 
peer pressure.  And this is a 
problem for mental health, 
because I think it's -- it 
happens quite often to us as 
developers where sometimes we 
just get stuck.  And we realize 
that the absolute best thing 
that we can do for ourselves is 
to take a break for 20 minutes, 
take a walk around the block, do
something completely different. 
What often happens is you look 
around and everyone else is bent
over their desks and they look 
productive.  What happens in 
that case is you talk yourself 
out of taking that break.  And 
that's actually the worst 
possible thing that you can do 
for yourself in that moment.  
    And finally, open plan 
offices are also highly 
conducive to the spread of 
physical disease like the cold, 
the flu, etc.  
So, again, I'm focusing on 
pragmatic solutions.  I would 
love to come up here and say we 
should not have open plan 
offices, but I think the vast 
majority of us are not in a 
position to make that call.  So 
the next easiest and best thing 
to do is to make sure that 
everyone is allowed to work 
remotely.  Or if they are 
already, maybe increase the 
number of days per week or month
when they can do so.  
Regardless, always encourage 
your employees to work from home
when they're sick.  Maybe try 
setting aside SMAM  small myth 
spaces for quiet work.  I think 
for those of us with big 
offices, one thing that happens 
is there's that one conference 
room that's too small to have a 
productive meeting in.  Maybe 
set that one aside for people to
check out for like an hour if 
they realize they need a bit of 
quiet time in the afternoon 
where they can get some 
productive work done.  
Also, have the company provide 
noise cancelling headphones.  
This is often the easiest 
solution, and it does work 
pretty effectively.  And 
encourage employees to decorate 
their work space.  It may sound 
like they have nothing to do 
with improving offices and 
productivity at all, but 
research actually says the 
opposite.  There was a 2014 
study in Sweden where they 
tested different office 
configurations and they had the 
people who worked in them rate 
how those conditions made them 
feel.  The one that was rated 
the worst among men was the open
plan flex office.  It's an open 
plan office where no one has 
their own desk.  There was a 
2010 study done in the UK where 
they compared people who had 
decorated and personalized their
work spaces, and those who 
decorated were a third more 
productive.  As silly as it 
sounds, these hacks work.  
    And now alcohol at tech 
events.  One or two drinks can 
make it easier for some 
introverts and those with social
anxiety to socialize with their 
peers.  I'm guilty of that as 
well.  If you don't offer 
alcohol, then those who want to 
drink will go to a bar instead 
of staying to mingle.  So 
conferences like this one, 
that's often the reason they 
have alcohol.  They want 
everyone to stay and socialize 
and network.  That's the whole 
point of having conferences like
this.  
But on the negative side, it 
makes non-drinkers feel 
unwelcome in general.  And if 
you're a recovering alcoholic, 
then you're definitely going to 
feel threatened at a kind of 
event where alcohol is flowing
freely.  Alcoholism
is a mental health disorder.  
There are probably more high 
functioning alcoholics in tech 
than we are aware of.  Some of 
the solutions, I personally am 
not saying no one should have 
alcohol at tech events again.  I
think there are steps to try in 
the meantime.  One thing that 
some places have tried are, for 
example, making sure that you 
always offer nice alternatives. 
The fancy sodas that come in the
glass bottles or mocktails to 
make sure that non-drinkers feel
included.  Often the biggest 
insult to them is to get to the 
afterparty and everyone else is 
getting customized cocktails and
they get lukewarm sodas where 
they have to fill their own ice.
Make sure that you're treating 
everyone equally.  Put a limit 
on the number of free drinks 
that you give out.  Use a ticket
or token system.  People usually
do this for budget reasons, but 
it works out well for health 
reasons as well.  You will get 
two drink tickets, and after 
that it turns into a cash bar.  
What that leads to is someone 
will have their two free drinks 
and they will think, do I want 
to take out my wallet to have 
the third drink? And then they 
will realize I have a good buzz 
going, and maybe I don't need 
the third drink, and then 
they're not getting drunk and 
you don't have to deal with 
those health consequences.  
Always, always make sure that 
you have activities other than 
drinking.  There's a pretty big 
overlap between developers and 
people who like playing board 
games.  You would think that 
more tech events would have 
things like a board game night. 
    If you're having a recurring
series of events like a monthly 
meet-up, try alternating dry and
non-dry events.  You don't have 
to drink every single time.  And
add workplace wellness programs 
on substance abuse.  These are 
the kind of things where most of
them would roll our eyes at them
when it happens.  Most of us 
need that periodic reminder that
there are serious consequences 
to drinking too much.  And that 
reinforcement is just very 
helpful.  
    For managers and tech leads 
and senior devs, overall the 
biggest piece of advice is to 
lead by example.  Things like 
not micromanaging, leaving the 
office on time, taking regular 
vacations yourself, not sending 
or answering e-mails at 2:00 
a.m., being receptive to 
feedback, and being a good 
listener.  And really the only 
thing that I would say that is 
unique to mental health is that 
you should try to be more open 
to talking about your own mental
health or maybe something that 
happened in your family.  It 
turns out that really, your 
number one goal should be, for 
your employees or your reports 
to come to you and say look, I'm
struggling with this issue.  I 
might need an accommodation.  
That sort of thing.  But people 
are not going do that if you 
haven't been more vulnerable and
open about things that you 
yourself have struggled with.  
It sounds counter intuitive.  I 
feel like by the time we get to 
the senior level, we should be 
completely invincible, but 
actually being vulnerable is 
probably one of your best asset
assets.  
Some other action items for 
managers? Make sure your 
employees understand benefits 
and what mental health 
treatments are covered.  Revisit
diversity.  And I will talk more
about neurodiversity in a 
minute.  Make sure your 
employees feel valued and 
empowered.  This may sound like 
it has nothing to do with mental
health, but this is the single 
biggest take-away for me is that
I've noticed a trend.  When 
people are saying I feel like my
depression is starting to come 
back.  I feel like my symptoms 
are getting worse, it's often 
accompanied by a change at work.
They got put on a different 
project.  They feel like they're
not getting as many changes to 
give feedback or make changes in
the process.  Management is not 
being transparent about why 
they're doing this, etc., etc.  
So making sure people feel 
valued and are feeling fulfilled
is really important for mental 
wellness as well.  
Get the OSMI 
handbooks.  Two of them deal 
with the Americans with 
disabilities act.  They're 
probably only relevant if you're
in the U.S., but the third talks
about starting a mental wellness
program in the workplace.  And 
finally, consider offering the 
mental health first aid 
training.  Mental health first 
aid is an international program 
started in Australia, and is 
available in all of these 
countries in Europe, the U.S., 
and Canada, and I believe in 
India and Nepal as well.  It's 
either eight or 12 hours, and 
the whole focus is to teach you 
how to respond if you encounter 
somebody having a mental health 
crisis.  I have heard from many 
people that they found it useful
as a sort of empathy training as
well.  So if you're trying to 
find the most effective way to 
really truly get everyone to 
respond to mental health better 
in your company, this is 
probably the best thing that you
can do.  And it can sometimes be
challenging to sometimes attend 
a training.  They are often 
limited in when and where 
they're given.  If you're based 
in Iceland, it's not even one of
the countries on the list.  But 
you can bring in a train tore
give -- trainer to give the 
training on site, which is a 
great way to make sure that all 
of your employees get trained or
everyone on the management team 
gets trained, etc.  
So finally, I'll spend a couple 
of minutes talking about the 
stuff that we all have do 
together where everyone has to 
do their part.  The first big 
thing is making sure that we're 
always supported marginalized 
people in the tech industry.  
Chronic harassesment, bullying, 
and more can lead to depression 
and cause or worsen other mental
illnesses.  People are often 
surprised when I mention eating 
disorders in the context of 
tech.  Even in tech, women are 
still judged by their 
appearance.  In the silicon 
valley start-up culture, I have 
heard a lot of stories about 
women being told that you only 
got this interview because 
you're pretty.  If you're 
already suffering with issues of
body image and eating disorders,
this will just make it worse.  
In general, people from
marginalized groups feel that 
they have to overperform.  And 
so that overperforming leads to 
increased stress and the much 
greater likelihood of burn-out. 
    We also need to fully 
embrace neurodiversity.  It's 
this idea that mental disorders 
are the result of natural 
variations of the human genome. 
They say people with these 
differences do not need to be 
cured.  They need help and 
accommodation instead.  The 
strongest proponents say we 
should stop looking for a cure 
for autism all together.  I 
think that's a little bit 
controversial, and it's probably
worth it to keep looking for a 
cure, but I also recognize that 
even if we do find a cure, it's 
probably only going to help the 
people who aren't born yet.  
Chances are it will not help 
anyone who is living with autism
right now.  There are multiple 
generations of people with 
autism who deserve to live 
healthy, happy, productive 
lives.  Some of our greatest 
inventions are attributed to 
people with atypical neurology. 
Ed has this quote, mental 
illness gives me
superpowers.  
He talks about how his ADHD 
helps him in ways that others 
hadn't thought of before.  There
was an article from last May 
called neurodiversity as a 
competitive advantage where they
found the same thing.  People 
with autism working in companies
like IBM and HP were actually 
incredibly productive, thinking 
of solutions no one had thought 
of, its.  And  the biggest 
barrier was bringing them in.  
They had to change up the 
interview process for these 
people to enter the companies.  
    Some things we can only 
change as a culture, the idea of
working ourselves to death.  The
overemphasis on hard work and 
stigma against things like 
vacation.  And the idea that the
best programmers always code on 
the holidays.  That kind of 
idea.  The need to always be 
available by phone or e-mail.  I
go to Iceland to speak at a 
conference like this, and I feel
pressured to tell everyone how 
to reach me in case of an 
emergency, and that shouldn't be
the case.  The peer pressure 
caused by social media.  A study
found that people suffering from
depression struggle a lot with 
using Facebook, because everyone
posts about the good things that
happen in their lives.  So 
seeing everyone else seemingly 
happy with their weddings and 
babies make them feel worse and 
more down on yourselves.  I 
mentioned this before, the 
belief that you must be in 
silicon valley to succeed.  The 
stigma against talking about our
feelings, and finally the idea 
that engineers don't have 
empathy.  I went to art school, 
so this is new for me.  I was 
talking with a woman who started
her own business and she brought
in a consultant who said you can
never use the word empathy 
around your engineers because 
they all believe you don't have 
it.  Empathy is something we all
have the capacity for.  We just 
have to choose to exercise it.  
There is a quote by the same 
woman that I thought was really 
powerful.  Empathy is the about 
dote to shame.  She mentioned 
this in the context of the shame
and blame culture of tech, but 
true in mental illness as well. 
Shame is the stigma, and so 
empathy is the about dote.  
Hopefully you figured out this 
is in jest.  There is no app for
this.  We can't deploy it to the
cloud.  We can't automate it 
away.  This is something we have
the capacity for, and we have to
choose to exercise it as a 
service to imp.  If  you are 
struggling, I bring you back to 
the quote from Ed's talk.  I 
could do so many things if only 
my head didn't get in the way.  
I have a list of resources in my
slides.  Feel free to ask me if 
you want to know what any of 
these are for. 
Feel free to reach out at any 
time.  If six months are from 
now, you want to talk about 
something, my proverbial door is
always open. 
I do also have OSMI stickers, so
come talk to me if you want one 
of those.  Thank you very 
much. 
[ Applause ]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That was amazing.  I just 
want to say, I relate to so much
of what you said.  I relocated 
most of my life.  I think I 
never lived or went to school 
somewhere for more than five, 
four years or something like 
that? So, I'm always moving.  So
that's really real.  And the 
stuff that you say about someone
saying to you that you only got 
that job because you're pretty 
has been said to me many 
different variations, which is 
not great.  Anyway.  I have a 
lot of questions to ask you, but
we can take a lot of this 
online.  But, one of it is how 
can we openly discuss more 
mental health in our workplaces?
It's really difficult to 
actually get people to talk 
about this stuff.  People are 
always talking about performance
in the office or being more 
productive, and how can we be 
more efficient in this processes
that we do? But we never really 
include mental health on top of 
that. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That's true.  I think one of 
the things that I've noticed 
that helps the most is if it 
starts from the top.  If you're 
a manager and you have dealt 
with depression or anxiety 
before, speak up about that, 
because everyone else at the 
bottom is more likely to speak 
up if they see someone else 
higher up in the organization 
who is open about this.  This is
something that is consciously on
my mind as a senior developer 
now.  I should not try to create
this image of myself as being 
perfect.  I should draw 
attention to the mistakes that I
make and the things I struggle 
with, because that makes it 
easier for everyone else to talk
about it. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thank you so much.  So we're 
going to go for our break.
I think we have a 30, 40 minute 
break, and we will come back 
here around 2:50.  So yeah, I'll
see you
back here. </div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
