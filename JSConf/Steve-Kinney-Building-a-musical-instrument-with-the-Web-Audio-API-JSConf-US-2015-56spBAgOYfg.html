gathered and I'm an instructor at the
turn school of software design out in
Denver Colorado what is that
whoo right that is a 7-month developer
training program where we take people
who don't know how to develop web
applications and we hopefully show them
how to develop web applications over the
course at seven months so if you're
interested mentoring people who are who
want to become developers please come
talk to me if you would like to hire
like six seven twelve developers also
come talk to me after this I've got
cards and all that other fun stuff
other kind of like administrivia is that
we're starting a new BOTS Colorado
meetup on June 3rd so if you are in the
Denver Boulder region come visit and
hang out with us everything you'd see
today lives in a little readme file on
this repo so you can play along if you
start playing with it while I'm talking
this is an audio talk and I'll know all
right
so maybe maybe you wait until lunchtime
but everything is there along with the
slides and everything else so as you've
probably gathered from the title of this
talk either a you're in the wrong room
or B you're here to hear a little bit
about making music with the web browser
and so I have a little secret for you
and I guess I'll just kind of get this
out of the way now is that as it turns
out somebody put a synthesizer into your
web browser it's true so what does that
mean it takes the form of this fun thing
called the Web Audio API which say I'm
just kind of introduced you introduced
us to a little bit and I'm going to go
in a little more detail with and how do
we use this Web Audio API
that's a great question I'm glad that
you asked it it starts in some context
so if you've ever worked with like html5
canvas or anything along those lines
you're familiar with this idea of like a
context it's like the canvas that you're
drawing on in this case it's the audio
graph that you're working with and in
most cases there is one audio context
per page so basically you create one you
spin it up and you start to hook
together your different audio nodes
how do we do that that is a great
question as well basically there is a
built in in the browser called audio
context there's a little bit of vendor
prefix silliness going on with Safari so
in order to support Safari we do this a
little quick trick on line 1 &amp;amp; 2 here
we'll say hey give me your audio context
oh you don't have that or I'll take your
WebKit audio context either way we'll do
a little tomfoolery
to get the right one and then we can
basically accentuate it and now we have
an audio context that we can play around
with the news and what what is involved
in audio context well we need some way
to like get that audio out of our
browser right so we have this thing
called a destination and the metaphor
I'm going to use if you've ever played
guitar it's like your amplifier it's the
thing that you're plugging everything
else into technically speaking it's like
the operating systems audio whatever
right it's an amplifier it's your
computer speakers
it's your earbuds it's whatever we also
need some kind of sound source and we
connect that sound source to our
destination and we can make sound
the other cool thing is that we can put
a whole bunch of stuff in the middle
right like effect pedal so if you're
playing guitar it would be a wah-wah
pedal or delay pedal or a chorus pedal
right we can take other audio nodes take
whatever the input source is do some
processing on it and then send that the
kind of processed version of our audio
to the destination and get to use it as
well so let's start by talking about the
first piece of this we want to get some
sound other browser so we're going to
need to have we need to set up that
audio contacts destination and that is
also pretty easy to do that context that
we created in the last little code
sample it's got a bunch of properties
and methods on it
one of those is destination and that is
a representation of your audio context
destination it is your amplifier it is
what you're gonna plug other stuff into
and where sound is going to come out so
we've got we've got a destination and
now we need some kind of audio source
and we've got a bunch of options we
could load in some kind of sound file
that'd be cool we could take something
from the users microphone and like
analyze it and process it along those
lines or we can generate our own tone
now we're talking about making music
with the browser right so the first two
are kind of off the table we don't want
to take a pre-recorded music and play it
that's been done right it was MIDI files
in the 90s it was on my Geo Cities page
I'm not embarrassed of that at all we
can also we don't also don't want just
like record other sounds and be it
analyze it we want to actually make
sounds so our hero in this story too is
going to be the oscillator which you got
a little bit of an introduction to in
the last talk and an oscillator
basically creates a sound wave and a
sound wave is this kind of like
vibration in the air that your ear make
some sense out of and turns into a given
tone and there's some distance in
between each of the waves and the
amplitude which is how high the peaks
are and how deep the valleys are right
which for the for our purposes say is
basically the volume how do we create an
oscillator again we've got some methods
on that context that we created before
and all we have to do is call create
oscillator and we have created an
oscillator and that's great so now we
have an oscillator and we've got a
destination what we do need to do next
is connect at the two of them we need to
take our keytar in this case and we need
to plug it into our amp in order to get
any sound out of it so we've got a few
more methods now we've got a method on
that oscillator and we can connect it to
the context destination so we're
plugging our keytar into our amp and
we're almost ready to rock and roll
almost because the other thing we need
to do is actually you know like hit some
keys on that keytar in order to play
anything so the other thing we need to
start our oscillator turn it on and have
it begin to create some sounds for us
and so that's pretty easy to do as well
how do we start an oscillator we call
start on it you might be wondering what
is this zero that is when you want it to
start how far in the future you want it
to start in this case we want it to
start right now Firefox and Chrome
totally okay with you omitting this and
Luis just started immediately Safari not
okay with this so we can put in a zero
saying hey I want to start this
oscillator and I want to start it right
now and that's great like you probably
messed up what frequency you want your
if you're like me your blow
your eardrums right now with a super
high-pitched frequency congratulations
now you probably want to stop it
surprise the method is called stop
here's where it gets tricky alright I am
done blowing out my eardrums I want to
adjust the frequency and I want to start
the oscillator again not gonna happen
right here's the kind of gotcha
on that once you stop an oscillator you
cannot restart it game over you have to
get rid of it and get a new one so you
might say to yourself alright yeah I'll
just generate another one no big deal
the other thing you want to make sure
that you do is disconnect that
oscillator that you had so that I can
get garbage collected
if you don't disconnect it the context
destination still is a reference to it
it's still hanging on memory you get a
little out of control and start doing
that too much congratulations you have a
memory leak don't have a memory leak
disconnect your oscillators when you're
done it's the responsible thing to do
alright so now it's gotten garbage
collected we can bring in a new one and
here it is the other we talked about
before is that we can connect stuff in
the middle so you might say I don't want
to keep creating and destroying
oscillators it seems seems reckless I'm
not interested in doing that it's
actually pretty efficient it's not a big
deal but it makes me feel a little dirty
so the other option is to plug in our
sound source into some kind of
intermediary node that will process that
sound and in this case we used a gain
node we can basically turn up and down
the amplitude which for our purposes is
the volume so we can turn the volume
down to zero and yeah the oscillator is
still running but none of that sound is
getting to the destination which means
for all intents and purposes the thing
is stopped that's it and when we're
ready to hear from it again we can turn
the gain up to one which is the kind of
the default setting and all of the sound
will continue to travel through so we
kind of get to like mimic the idea we're
turning oscillator on and off but really
we're just adjusting into a intermediary
gain node instead how do we do that
there should be no surprises here
context has a few other methods for
generating all the other intermediary
nodes that we might need and the
case will create a game note and we can
then hook up our keytar to our game node
so we'll connect the oscillator to the
gain node then we'll hook the game node
up to our destination and now we can
start the oscillator and we can just
adjust the volume to kind of give the
illusion that we're turning it off and
on but in fact we're just simply
adjusting again an intermediary node so
again we we knows what we're talking
about the oscillator oscillators got a
bunch of other properties stewart's what
frequency should what should be the
bandwidth of those waves right how close
together a far apart should they be by
default we get a later that is at 440
but we can adjust it down to 220 we can
adjust it up to like 8,000 don't do that
if you weren't headphones again I don't
know if you there was a malls in the UK
a few years ago would play super
high-pitched tones because as you get
older you can't hear those so like it
would be for the sole purpose of scaring
away teenagers right so there's a use
for this in your practical everyday life
when you want teenagers to go away
create an oscillator at a super high
frequency and turn it on you might also
scare away your dog and cat that could
be a bonus depending on how you feel
about them at that moment so we have a
bunch of different types of waves right
this is basically the shape of the wave
we get a few out of the box by default a
sine wave is this kind of nice curvy
happy wave it sounds pretty pleasant to
the ears a square wave gets the same
from looking like squares a triangle
wave gets the same from looking like
triangles and a sawtooth looks like a
saw alright there's not like a lot of
like heavy like vocabulary here it's
like hey that's what that wave looks
like and you can use any of those if you
want you can also create your own custom
waveforms that are different than those
but those are kind of the default
traditional like synthesizer sound waves
that we've had available since like the
70s and we can basically oscillator has
a property on it where we can change you
to whatever type of wave that we want so
let's actually take a look at this we
look at a little example where we can
kind of create an oscillator
we there we go
I can adjust the gain here
and so this is a sine wave and we could
change the frequency
and you see as the frequency increases
then in that case the look had a pitch
to our ears sounds higher we also I'm
gonna go back down to 220 for everyone's
benefit because I care
and we can try out a square wave
captain at 4:40
so too
and a triangle so the shape of the wave
has different tonal properties to our
ears and we can kind of change one for
the rest of this talk we're gonna be
going with the nice sine wave because
it's probably the most pleasant cool so
at this point we now know how to make
sound and that's super cool and but
sound is necessary but it's not
sufficient for making music right so
it's called the Web Audio API not the
web music API it's going to help us make
some sound but it's on us to turn that
sound
into some music so we're gonna need to
know a few things about music in order
to get this working so we talked a
little about the default frequency of an
oscillator is 440 440 if you've ever
seen like one of those tuning forks that
is a four and it's kind of like the what
we base most of our just general tones
on most Western musical instruments so
we got 440 if we were to double that
frequency to 880 conveniently we would
get a 5 which is an a note but an octave
higher and if we were to have 442 that
220 we had before we would have a but an
octave lower
I don't know if you know this but there
are more notes than just a so we have
these Seussville semitones and it's the
12 like units in between two octaves and
again that's simply a western music
thing it's not like a physics law or
anything but we have decided that these
are the tones of sound reasonably
Pleasant to our ears and some of them
have some basis in like actual physics
if you take a guitar string and put your
finger in the middle and play a harmonic
of the middle of string that is usually
one octave higher if you put it a third
of the way through you'll get a fifth so
on and so forth so you get some of the
basic ones and then we kind of filled in
the gaps so you might say yourself
alright well if I wanted to get the rest
of these notes I'll use math and that
seems really reasonable cuz at first
glance it works right so this is simply
we've got a for it for 14 if we look at
an octave up it's 880 and if we divide
by you know 1 12 steps each way we get
there no big deal sounds like it sounds
great unfortunately it only works in one
key right if you were to start at C you
can see almost immediately
the notes don't match up so if you were
to use this kind of mathematical
approach you could create an instrument
that only sounds good in one key and
that's you know you it's called a
harmonica right you buy a whole bunch of
them and you never learn how to play
them and that's you know kind of how it
works but so the first thing I tried to
do is like alright I'm smart
reasonably I can figure this out
so I'll come up with an algorithm that
I'll like work unfortunately this is
like a problem that humans have been
working on for like thousands of years
and I was not able to figure out on one
Red Bull fueled afternoon however it
occurred to me that you know what I'll
do I'll just steal an approach that
already works like we have figured this
out this is a solved problem right so
that going by units of 112 is equal
temperament the other approach is to use
this thing called just intonation which
is a bunch of ratios that are
compromises between all the keys so no
one is not perfect right and like the
kind of like physical sense of and in
the way of equal temperament but it is
reasonably good in every key but not
perfectly accurate in any of them right
so we can steal something from the piano
so now I just needed a way to get from
piano tones and piano frequencies and
just steal a little cheat sheet from
that and be able to use it and as I was
doing more and more projects doing this
each time just keeping a giant hash
table in a file and like trying to
reference it it was getting obnoxious so
when you have a need and a possible
solution and you have a cute name for a
project you have an open-source library
this is a little library called octavian
and basically what it does is you can
hand it a just a general note and what
it'll do is it'll give you the frequency
it'll also give you all those things
that you might need to use about it like
what key on the piano it is and all it
does is basically reference the lookup
table of like this note on the piano
this would be this frequency the other
fun thing that it does is it lets you
actually do the different intervals
between notes so like a major chord is a
root note it's a major third and a
perfect fifth a minor chord is a root
note it's a minor third and a perfect
fifth so you can kind of like reason
about these notes and get everything you
need along the way all right so now we
can create sound and the other thing we
can do is we can
reason about it in terms of music let's
actually build a musical instrument so
this is a little example instrument
called Audio phonic and let's take a
look Adam I was going ladies gentlemen
and I'm sorry it's going to play us a
song more like a J's synthesizing so as
you can see we can hover over a bunch of
notes and it'll play tones and if we
press the key it'll actually like
activate that tone so we've created a
musical instrument now alright that's
great how exactly did we do that
so the trick here is we basically spun
up a bunch of oscillators and hook them
all up to gain nodes and on different
events will simply turn one of those on
and off so when a key gets pressed that
well will listen for a key down event
when that key down event happens what
we'll do is we'll say alright I have
this like synthesizer object to like get
me an oscillator for c3 and it will go
ahead and look up do I have one in this
let notes hash no if I don't have one
what it'll do is go and put one in there
for me
there we I'm caught up and then return
it out now a real synthesizer usually
has like 3 oscillators that it's
adjusting the frequencies on and turn it
on and off but I've got 16 gigs of ram
and I'm gonna treat myself to like 80
oscillators because I can do that
alright so I'm just gonna keep them all
in hash and if I have one great use it
if I don't have one make it put it in
the table and then use it as well and
you might say like what is this new
oscillator thing it's just a little
obstruction and all it does is like grab
it creates an oscillator in a gain node
it sets some default values on them in
this case the frequency that I wanted an
oscillator for it'll hook them up
together it'll start it return it out to
me and I've got these start and stop
methods that are not actually starting
step methods on the oscillator but on
that gain node so for me I feel like I'm
working with an oscillator but there's
just a few more things happening in the
middle so then we could say alright if
we hit the button that's bound to c3
get me an oscillator for c3 start it and
when they take the thing when they do a
key up event will simply send it off and
we'll stop that oscillator and that's
all we need to do to create a very small
sense of the synthesizer nothing like
saying that in front of 600 people so
that's cool
but that's only like why wouldn't you
just buy a keyboard at that point right
why did you need to do all this about me
is fun totally you can share with your
friends and we'll start using at night
and they're good to come up on stage and
play a song in front of everyone that's
awesome but like why else would we want
to use something like this well the
other really kind of interesting part is
that somebody put a web browser in your
synthesizer right that's not the only
API that's available in in the browser
so the fun comes in when we start mixing
and matching different api's so one
example is we can mix the Web Audio API
with the getusermedia API my favorite
slide coming up this little app called
face theremin are you guys all familiar
with uh what a theremin is it's like
your the thing that's of making the
spooky like 60s like UFO music and
you're like lift your hands over some
things I thought hey it would be really
cool if I could do that with my face so
what we'll do I can't actually see
myself here
Oh
in fairness most of the hard work there
is being done by the head tracking
software so it detects your face and
when you move your face it emits a face
tracking event right which it has a
whole bunch of properties on it I really
only care about two of them right now
you might care about other ones but
height and the x value the X is the only
horizontal where am I in this direction
or that direction and the height is how
close to how far I am
and I'll take those two properties and I
will like do some like simple math to
like make sure that they're reasonable
frequencies and gain amounts and then
I'll take my oscillator my gain value
and I will like adjust them accordingly
and that's really all there is to it I
mean there's also the entire face
tracking library but that's somebody
else's problems and then lastly I will
like bind myself to that event and like
update stuff along those lines okay so
now we're seeing the real power here is
what we can mix and match other API is
what about WebSockets all right so you
might say like cool we can have a
instrument people can play in real time
together there is some latency so you
don't want a bunch of people like moving
their heads together or something like
synchronize head movements or maybe even
playing like keyboard tones because
there's gonna be some latency and the
other part about music that I never had
was rhythm so like that's gonna be an
issue with like the latency thing but we
can kind of address that by using what's
called a step sequencer right a step
sequencer we've got 16 quarter notes
which I have zero indexed because this
is a JavaScript conference and they are
quarter notes and we'll kind of step
through each and every one of those and
then the rows are a bunch of musical
notes in this case I have only chosen c
g c e g and a because it is very
difficult for you to make a melody that
sounds bad with that i mean you could
probably do it I believe in you but it
makes it like when you have multiple
people playing so now what we can do is
anytime somebody activates a square on
the grid we send that over WebSockets to
little like Express socket IO server
that will then take that sequence match
with all the other ones it has and
pushes out to all the other connected
clients and what we'll do then is when
it gets to the client we'll take all the
sequences and we'll for the user
sequence will like make those the bright
yellow for everyone else we'll make them
this pale color will render all the
other sequences below but we'll then
combine them all to one sequence
that'll get played out so be everyone's
music together so let's actually take a
first spin fine now you know what's
coming next alright so here we've got a
sequencer and I happen to like have an
iPad over here to be my other my other
set of ears so I can begin to unmute and
I'll start playing like a bass line this
is so hard I can't see fun to watch me
do it alright so I've got a bass line
going hmm just so you believe me
iPad so I can start playing a melody
here
there's season playing on the iPad
here's the code base line that I put
down in my browser and they're all being
connected by Julie you would have tens
twenties hundreds of people kind of
creating music together around the world
as well and there's a link to this in
the repo that opposed to meeting I'll
have at the end so I totally encourage
you during lunch fire it up and let's
have a J s come song it's only gonna be
four measures long and made it a four
different notes but whatever
alright so that's cool but so far we've
also like been a little bit limited by
what we've been able to do on the screen
so we've kind of had to either like
bounce stuff to the keyboard which is
kind of cool but also kind of difficult
because that's not a musical instrument
and where we've been able to like click
on different things as we know
JavaScript runs on the client it runs on
the server it also runs on hardware
which means we can begin to build our
own musical instruments right I've got a
very small example we're gonna switch to
in a moment but it means you could build
like a Nintendo Power glove there's an
80s reference by the way and then Tendo
power glove where every like pinch of
the fingers started to play a different
note it means you can use all the other
sensors that's on in our duel for
Arduino and like begin to create
Hardware musical instruments programmed
in JavaScript that work with the web Web
Audio API in the browser how so this is
a really clear diagram of what I've got
going on here
and I'll explain this but basically we
got some buttons and we've got a little
potentially ammeter and when ever we hit
one of the buttons that'll send a signal
to Johnny v Johnny v will then has an
express and what's how could i o server
running alongside of it which is
incredibly easy to do by the way and
we'll send that data over a WebSocket to
the browser and the browser will then
update and start playing the right tone
based on the button that we hit so here
we can say all right I'm gonna listen
for pins
two four six and eight they're you know
I'm just gonna keep them in in this
quick little object over here I'm going
to say when the button is down it will
send whatever key that
and whatever button that was and we'll
send that as true when the button is up
we'll send one saying it's false
basically the status of the buttons on
my board I'm sending them out to the
browser and then the potential meter is
going to like as we turn it go through
all the notes between c3 and c5 all
right so let's check out the demo
cool so basically at this point now that
we can build our own hardware that
creates music in the browser with
JavaScript there's very like limitless
possibilities and so the moral the story
is that music is pretty awesome I think
we can all agree on that the web also
pretty awesome music and the web
together are like ice cream and cookie
dough each individually awesome but
exponentially more awesome when put
together and we only kind of scratch the
surface there's a bunch of other really
cool api's there's the gamepad API there
is WebRTC so you could theoretically
create multi-faced theremin there is the
gyroscope accelerometer API and mobile
devices there is the device orientation
API and there's also mixing and matching
more of the different examples that we
already went over right so there's a
bunch of limitless possibilities for you
to create musical instruments that have
never existed before so I kind of want
to encourage you to do that on on the
page that has the links to everything we
if you make something really cool please
send me a pull request and we'll put a
link below and let's like collect all
the really cool musical instruments that
you make in the next days weeks and
months and with that thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
