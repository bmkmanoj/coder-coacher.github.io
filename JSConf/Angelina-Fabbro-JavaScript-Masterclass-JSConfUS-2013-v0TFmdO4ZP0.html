my name is Angelina Favreau I live in
Vancouver British Columbia Canada
sunny Vancouver it's actually not very
sunny um
and I work for a company called steam
clock software and for the last couple
years I've been building mobile
applications for native for PhoneGap
I've used objective-c a lot of
JavaScript we've also done a couple web
apps and I work with some pretty
talented and awesome people there but if
you talked to me yesterday you got a bit
of a spoiler and that's that I'm joining
Mozilla in early June to working on
Firefox OS so that is what I do the web
is actually my first love I've been
making websites since I was really small
my first one was on Angel Fire I wish I
mentioned sometimes and it was about
dolphins and all it was is basically
animated gifs of dolphins so I like to
think I've come a little a little bit
farther since then so a little bit about
me I am NOT a beginner at programming
but I don't I'm not an expert like I
don't consider myself to be an expert at
all and so this talk is actually about
trying to become an expert as someone
who considers themselves an intermediate
developer we have a lot of resources and
a lot of initiatives to get people
started programming and to cater to
beginner programmers and until the last
year or two it was actually really hard
to find articles and tutorial bits for
people who are intermediate developers
who think oh you know I don't know I'm
writing code but how do I make it better
you know and so that's a little bit
about what this talk is about so the
first things first let's get a few
cognitive biases out of the way because
I run into these sorts of ideas whenever
I'm teaching or presenting or when
people come to me and they like sort of
secretly disclose that their feel a bit
insecure about their programming you are
not special none of you know neither is
anybody else so that's ok we're all on
the same page I know your mom told you
this when you were a kid but this is
actually a motivational anti-pattern it
works one of two ways either your mom
tells you they're totally special you've
got all this natural talent with the
violin and then maybe
like you don't practice and then all the
other people who do sort of catch up and
you don't feel so special anymore
or you know you think that maybe if
someone else was told they're special
maybe you're not special and so there's
some like disparity between you and the
special people often the people we think
who are experts we think there's
something very different about them from
from where we are and so what I wanted
to say is that nobody is born with
natural talent there are no natural born
programmers and whenever I say this
people get really really emotional about
this and I mean really emotional
probably because their mom told them
that they were special or probably
because if they are a good programmer
they like to pretend that they're
special and that there's some natural
talent and there's a whole body of
research out there you are all smart
individuals so I will leave it up to you
to to do your own research and take a
look there is an interesting book called
outliers by I think Malcolm Gladwell I
really hope I got that right that
discusses this topic at length now you
are the result of many complicated
interactions some of those things that
can make you seem like a natural usually
have to do with your early childhood
education the one thing that people like
to glom on to really quickly is genetics
and say like oh well you know maybe
there's like a gene for programming or a
gene for logical thinking and I'm pretty
sure that there are probably genes that
we can identify I mean I know there's at
least a few snps identified for
nonverbal intelligence for example but
it's not that simple our understanding
of genetics has come a long way in the
last 10 20 years and really the focus
now is on epigenetics the environmental
pressures that affect gene expression
because even if you have like the
predisposition to you know unfortunately
have cancer you may not necessarily have
cancer if you know if you take care of
yourself if the environmental pressures
aren't there and so it's a little bit
nebulous to say that genetics are
deterministic because they just they
just really aren't also your early
childhood exposure to logical thinking
whether or not you had that early
childhood practice of these logical
skills and the early framing of your
relationship to logical thinking a lot
of people like myself who grew up in a
fairly all semi rural area and didn't
have a lot of positive programmer role
models like who you know we were sort of
pulled that you know if you like mad
and you like programming wolf that's
never going to go anywhere why do you
bother with those computers and some
people you know get framed really early
that like you know math is going to be
too hard for them or program is going to
be too hard for them well I'm here to
tell you today that nobody is a natural
and sorry that's just another Jeff about
people not liking the logic of it they
feel like they're special so your
feelings don't matter here in spite of
popular beliefs there's no one thing
that you're destined to do purpose
doesn't happen to you any more than love
does these things evolve when you commit
yourself fully to something or someone
and make the decision to work through
the muck so I wanted to say that yes I
mean programming and math and logical
thinking can be a hard thing but that
every single person in this audience and
their kids and their friends and anybody
you meet is capable of programming and
there's so much bloody problematic
framing of this topic that it drives me
up the wall
in 2006 Jeff Atwood posted a post I
guess he post he made a post about a
academic study and I put that in quotes
because while it was put out by a
academic institution anybody who's had
any training in you know anybody's gone
and done a little bit of grad school
anybody who's been involved with
cognitive science and the behavioral
sciences and done research design will
read that paper and laugh because the
research design was very poor the sample
size was very small and what this study
was trying to say was for students that
come into our programming courses at our
University we can give them a test and
we can tell you or sorry we can predict
how well they're going to do at the
course and we can then separate
programmers from non programmers but
that's really problematic because the
way people interpreted this is the way
the media offered often interprets
things and that's very sensational and
they started saying like oh we've got a
test now to tell you no natural
programmers from from program you know
from non programmers and I was like well
no all this says that someone can tell
how well someone's going to do based on
how they teach a course about
programming and also only considering
the knowledge and experience they have
with logical thinking up until that
point which you just don't know anything
about maybe somebody you know didn't
have a good relationship with math in
school maybe someone else grew up with
parents who were scientists and they
just loved this stuff and so I really I
really think you should take all that
stuff with a grain of salt because it's
it's often framed and like I say a very
problematic way so yeah so nobody's
special and experts are not born with
any natural talents so that you know
that's out of the way and that's
actually really awesome it's actually
really empowering because that means
that any of you have the capacity to
take from where you are as a programmer
and move towards expertise and move
towards mastery and feel a lot more
confident about the things that you do
in your job or in your side projects so
if you brush if you practice logical
thinking and if you practice programming
a lot and you manage to absorb enough of
the you know vast amount of domain
knowledge is that there you too will
become an expert so that's pretty prep
up pretty awesome so then how do you
know that you're not a beginner so clue
number one I think is that you can use
the fundamentals in any language
so by fundamentals I mean your basic
control structures like loops if-else
statements know how to do like variable
assignments I know how to do some really
basic operations and what the what the
main operators are in a language if you
if you can kind of sit down with a new
language and get out a hello world or
make a very small app without having to
know the nuances of a language or
framework I think that you are a little
bit beyond being a beginner clue number
two you are a comfortable writing code
from scratch when people are beginners
there's definitely a pattern of they
grab like a third party library like
maybe jQuery as an example and they're
like oh wow I can do so much cool stuff
with jQuery but a lot of the time
they'll like put jQuery in and then
they'll just put in a plug-in and then
not touch it I mean that's not really
the same as programming right so I would
say that you know someone who's a
beginner or just beyond being a beginner
is a comfortable writing code from
scratch and not just editing or gluing
together the pieces that they find and
and just to be perfectly clear that is
an important step like just being able
to like get into the code and try
reading it and edit it and play with it
and copy and paste a little bit that's
actually an excellent transitional skill
to becoming a better programmer despite
the fact that a lot of people are really
gained set I think that that's perfectly
fine for beginners so if you're not a
beginner you're probably comfortable at
least writing some code from scratch
whether it's a couple function
things are a whole you know like writing
all your code to make your single page
application work clue number three that
you're not a beginner when you do
something like jQuery you peek inside
because you want to know how it works
you may not necessarily understand all
the things that are in there but you are
getting curious and you want to know
like you know what's what's going on
like how does how does this iterator
work how does you know how does this
selector stuff work and you start
getting in there and even if you don't
necessarily understand all that you're
at least trying to and number four you
may feel like your code is mediocre and
you don't really know what to do about
it
and this is a really interesting one
because people will not talk about this
topic openly at events that I teach and
talk at but they'll come to me
personally later on and they'll tell me
and it's very interesting because
there's no real like trend about like
gender or ethnic background or anything
like that
it's literally like all sorts of people
will be like hey so I mean I I think
you're good at JavaScript they'll say so
I feel really mediocre I feel like
there's all this pressure for me to be
really good really fast because it's a
community of really smart people and I'm
like I feel that I feel you I know them
feels and so if you have that feeling
you're not alone and you know so okay so
those are some ways that you know that
you are not a beginner well how do you
know that you're not an expert right and
if you're not a beginner I mean maybe
maybe you're an expert clue number one
you don't quite rock all the code you
read including comments so maybe you do
get into the jQuery source and maybe
there are some comments but you still
don't really understand what they're
doing with bind and you know that
there's these things called call and
apply and you don't understand why
there's like two versions of what seems
to be doing the same thing and you start
like exposing yourself to some more
higher level concepts this way and so if
you don't quite understand all those
things you read probably probably you're
not quite an expert clue number two is
that you can't explain what you know
some people like to argue with me that
there are plenty of competent developers
that are awesome but you know can't for
the life of them explain their
methodology or their practice or what
their coding to someone else I think
that this is a big problem and even if
you are you know you know further on
other
news of expertise like maybe you do
understand bind and call and apply for
example but you can't explain what you
know to someone in a patient and clear
way
that's a shortcoming and you need to get
better at that because programmers need
to be able to communicate and
disseminate knowledge between one
another and with their teams that they
work with and so clue number three you
aren't confident debugging this one for
me like took a long time like for me to
actually really get into the debugger in
like Chrome and then when I'm working
with Objective C and in Xcode and stuff
like that and to develop like sort of a
mental model of how I could solve
various problems with different
debugging strategies rather than just
doing this you know I throw in some
console logs all over the place
especially you know when I started using
node I was a bit of a late adopter to
node and I started realizing I was like
oh this is why I need callbacks okay I
like he just kind of stopped right there
and then clue number four is you rely on
references too much so it's really
interesting that most of us who are
employed as software engineers or web
developers or whatever your title is if
you're writing code all day probably you
do have a tab open in your browser that
is a language reference or a API
reference of some sort because to
memorize all of the stuff is kind of
crazy and these things are changing
constantly too but I think that you
should be writing a large amount of your
code for example particularly vanilla
javascript in this case without
necessarily needing to refer to a
reference I mean if you need to once in
a while then that's fine but I mean you
should probably aim to write as much
with as little reference as possible and
the reason for this is just that you
will probably accomplish more honestly
you won't be stopping and getting
derailed and you can write code with
confidence when you know and you've
internalized those little bits so if
this describes you if you are not a
beginner and you are not an expert
welcome to the ambiguous zone of
intermediate Ness you are not alone I am
there with you and so from going from
there what does a curriculum for mastery
actually look like and also what makes a
great programmer and let's start with
that second one so it really depends
who's asking and these this is a little
bit of a quote written by a gentleman
named
ed Weissman who's writing I really
really love he is well I know he's
definitely older than I am but he's got
something like 30 or 40 years of
experience maybe more than that in
programming and he's written actually
really interesting ebook that's great
for programmers of all levels but
particularly if you're starting out if
you just google ed Weisman you'll be
able to find it and I read this book and
it just it really it really got to me in
a good way because he answered a lot of
sort of ideological questions about the
field of programming that I'd been
asking myself and questioning like do I
want to I do I want to keep doing this
short answer yes so who is a good
programmer it depends who is asking to a
project manager the programmer who it's
every deadline regardless of quality is
a good programmer to the customer the
programmer who solves the problem the
fastest is a good programmer to the
business owner the programmer who makes
them the most money that's a good
programmer and to the junior programmer
the best mentor is a good programmer and
to another programmer the programmer
that they're most likely to want in to
go to battle with is a good programmer
so what do I need to learn to be an
expert and like how do you how do you
even do that you know what would you do
you want to feel unstuck so I'm going to
give you some suggestions here and a
little bit of ideas for materials so
that you too can transform yourself from
being intermediate into being an expert
so suggestion number one please ask why
obsessively short of existential angst
like all the time I mean I'm just
talking specifically about code right
now but I mean like just in general with
with your life I mean you can ask
yourself like why did I choose eggs
benedict this morning or why did why did
I choose more better example why did I
choose to use jQuery like why why did I
want to do my why did I why did I choose
like Twitter Twitter bootstrap is
because I am uncomfortable in the front
end why did I choose nodejs to do all my
server stuff I mean aside from it's
really cool everybody in this room
probably really likes it but like why
did you make that decision why did you
use express as your as your framework
for your routes and all that so ask why
obsessively to the point where you annoy
yourself it will give you a tremendous
amount of self-awareness about the
choices that you're making when you're
doing development so number two I really
think that you should teach or speak at
an event there's this illusion that if
you're standing up here
that you're an expert I like to think
like I say I'm on my way to being an
expert but I'm definitely not an expert
the only thing you need to come up here
and speak is an idea about something
that you've made and like the previous
presentation where Remy was showing his
experiment that's a perfect example if
you've done something like that you need
to tell people about it and share the
knowledge that you have with others and
what happens when you're you know
teaching or speaking at an event is that
you get to sort of formalize and sort of
make the ideas that you have about what
you've worked on a little bit more
concrete if you can communicate those
effectively you probably know the area
pretty well and when it comes to
teaching I teach at ladies zoning code
and I also do some stuff for Simon
Fraser University and that is super
enlightening because it's a really good
reflection on the kinds of assumptions
you make about your own ability for
example it ladies learning code I get
people asking me questions like well
okay I've sort of worked ahead in the
slides and now I have this piece of code
that I want to reuse should I copy and
paste it and I'm like no you shouldn't
do that you need functions and people
will often add or ask really really
compelling questions that cause you to
realize oh I actually know a lot more
than I thought about programming so I
also suggest working through a suggested
curriculum of books this is from John
Resig website that he's had up a little
while called learning advanced
JavaScript and if you can go through
this this was sort of like a proposed
curriculum for advanced JavaScript which
eventually evolved itself into this book
the secrets of the JavaScript ninja
which I think has a samurai on the front
and this book is really fantastic for me
to read because I keep going through it
oh pardon me I keep going through it and
realizing there's a lot in that book
that is totally rehash for me and I
already know but there's a lot of stuff
in there I don't know so reading a book
like this that has a comprehensive sort
of outline of topics of mastery for
JavaScript will help you reaffirm what
you know and what you don't know and
that's a really good feeling I like to
read through a book and be like yeah I
got that or to discover that like you
had no idea about function memorization
that totally blew my mind for example
experiment recklessly the code doesn't
care this is suggesting number four the
code does not care how old you are who
you are where you came from or anything
like that
nobody needs to see your code till you
push it up to the branch that you need
to push it to or until you need to show
it to someone else for code review so
experiment be be reckless like do silly
things just to see what happens the code
is just code it's inert until you give
it purpose so number five you should
have opinions if you're progressing
towards I guess an expert level of
understanding and knowledge you will
probably naturally start to have
opinions although it's really important
to remember that when you're having
opinions that and you're trying to sort
of cooperate with people that you're
going to run into people that you
disagree with and there's a little song
that I like on the internet about that
and it goes something like this it's
okay to not like things but don't be a
jerk about the things you don't like
so just internalize that please um and I
really like this one by Emily everybody
we're having opinions on things again
don't forget to state yours this fact or
s you don't get to play so just you know
be be reasonable and also accept that
you could be wrong and that being wrong
is actually fantastic because there's an
opportunity for learning there so number
six seek mentorship if you're here
you're probably already in the right
place but also in your workplace one of
the most fantastic things about working
a steam clock software is being able to
turn around to Allen Pike who is one of
the cofounders be like hey so I have
this ridiculous sounding JavaScript idea
and or question and then we just go to
the whiteboard and talk about it with
like no you know weirdness about it like
I know that it's not always easy for
some people in their jobs to do that but
if you can't do that in your job try and
find another job where you can do that
you will become a better programmer so
Justin seven program a lot suggestion
eight stop programming sometimes
you need breaks okay you like to think
you can code 24/7 your brain doesn't
work that way it needs it needs breaks
that's why when you like are trying to
fall asleep or you're in the shower BAM
you'll know how to fix that bug you need
time away from the computer suggestion
nine write JavaScript a lot suggestion
ten write in another language for a
while actually I mean you should
probably be writing mostly in JavaScript
but if you get outside your comfort zone
a little bit and start comparing
JavaScript with other languages you'll
find that there are a lot of little
nuances to JavaScript that maybe you
didn't know and programming another
language exercises the brain much in the
way that learning another
a spoken language would in a sense um
number 11 think like a programmer when
afk people think I'm really weird for
optimizing my route when I go to Ikea
and figuring it like the optimal way to
get through it as fast as possible and
that might be silly to some of you but
that'sthat's great like you should be
doing those sorts of thought exercises
as much as you possibly can because that
exercises the logical part of your brain
which is largely well that's what you
need for programming and suggestion 12
know what good feedback is and reject
all else it turns out that some people
aren't very happy with themselves and
they will take it out on you so
sometimes on the internet someone will
reply to your question or your post and
honestly like if they're not being
constructive and they throw in at the
fit so they say something mean tone is a
bit of a variable one then you know
honestly if you're not getting anything
constructive out of it probably it's a
waste of your time there will be someone
else who can give you constructive
criticism so just know how to
differentiate between good feedback and
troll feedback the last one really
that's a suggestion is to break free of
imposter syndrome it just has so happens
that if you write code you are a
programmer the end relative of your
ability people that come out of the
beginner JavaScript courses that I teach
tell me that they want to be quote a
real programmer one day and I ask them
like okay well are you writing code
yeah no I'm writing code every day okay
great you're a programmer
no no Anjali I want to be a real
programmer and what they're actually
trying to say is that they want to be
good and so hopefully if you are someone
at home that gets to see this video and
maybe you are in this nebulous
intermediate zone you will understand
that yes you are a programmer and your
desire to want to be good is good and
you will get there I promise if you do
some of these things and I want you to
fall in love with your process I want
you to fall in love with the balance
between writing code and taking breaks I
want you to fall in love with the
process of like you know arguing your
point and then taking the opposite
position because this sort of variety is
what's going to help you grow as a
person it's going to expand your
self-awareness and hopefully make you a
better critical thinker about your
programming and so this is the end of my
presentation thank you wonderful humans
for inviting me to share this has been
JavaScript masterclass and I'm actually
in February you can follow me on twitter
