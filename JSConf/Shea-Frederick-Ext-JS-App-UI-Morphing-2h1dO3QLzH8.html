my slides there's no presentations like
just text pulled out the old school
ascii art there so i'm going to be
talking about a little bit about EXT Jas
and I called this presentation you I
morphing just cuz it's like it's not
really anything animated or anything
it's just changing a UI a user interface
after you've already got it done so
we'll bring out my browser I'm gonna
demo
you
so I threw the others this fake you I in
using X cgas this is the this is the
schedule for jazz comp just load it up
in a in for grids so the idea here is
that the you know the customer or
whatever has already like signed off on
this layout so you've built this this
project and you know you've got some
editable fields and all that cool stuff
and you've got like delete features and
add features and stuff like that all
built in the UI so with the exige s you
can change all of that really easily so
that's what I'm were you talking about
if anybody wants to find me I'm on most
everywhere as vinyl Fox and I have the
code for today's presentation on github
as well
and I like bacon there wasn't it I was
kind of disappointed there was no bacon
um I was actually gonna have a plate
full of bacon right up here I just it
just you know we got like quiche or
something ponies um so I I work with the
ex TGS a lot I'm a committer on their
their project and i wrote the learning
EXT JS book that's out right now so my
first example I just called it a that's
the one we just looked at this this it's
pretty standard exg Jess features it's
their grid component their editor good
component a couple other things like
JSON reader and and just really standard
stuff
so what I'm going to do is pretend that
the client came and said you know I just
don't like this layout anymore this for
side by side so let's let's make it into
tabs or something so we'll put all the
grids into their own tab
so the difference between having for
grid side-by-side and for grids in four
separate tabs here's an example of the
diff between that so we're only looking
at you know two lines removed and three
lines added and all of our features
still work you can still edit the fields
you know you can still add all this
stuff still works the same as when the
panels are side by side now that that's
a pretty that's pretty straightforward
one so let's move on to another example
alright so my next example is a
variation of the the first two basically
so it's going to be grid side by side
but they're in tabs as well
this is a pretty typical thing a climb I
do is come to you and say you know yeah
I don't want those in four tabs now I
just want him in two and put them side
by side again everything stays the same
while the editing still works I'll the
adding all that good stuff
so the difference there was just a
little bit more but a lot of it is
really just configurations and actually
a big chunk of it is just tabbing cuz i
tabbed everything Oh properly
oh there you go yeah without the
whitespace see that's a lot less see now
it doesn't lines and your UI is all
change now
okay so now we're going to take this
layout and introduce and editor and
editor on the side so the editor is
activated by double-click this is a
pretty standard EXT forum panel so we
can change text in here it's save and it
updates our grid works with the track be
great great as well so it's all tied
together
you
so the difference between those two is
is pretty pretty minor because we're
surely just there I'm am is green do
that again so the difference there is
pretty minor cuz we're just adding that
editor panel onto the side what did you
use for your a skier it's like it's just
a website where you go and type it in
it's like if you search for ASCII text
it'll be like the third hit or something
alright so next thing we're adding is a
viewer so this is going to be like to
preview the data so now I've got a
single click for my viewer down at the
lower right corner my editor still works
on the double click the layouts been
changed but everything's still tied
together everything still functions
everything's still like hooked up wired
up
so in EXC everything's built in like
components and and mostly for the UI
stuff they're built into what they call
panels like like right here we've got
three panels well roughly the two grids
countess panels too and these things can
be moved all over the page how's it
going so these things can be moved all
over the page and their interaction with
each other stays the same
so we've got you know our delete or edit
all that cool junkie single click you
get the preview and I changed it so that
the edits on the left this looks pretty
awesome in this small resolution but
change it so that the previews on the on
the right there the edits on the left
double click even though we changed our
layout everything's still tied together
everything still works
so each of these components are
basically firing off events to you know
to trigger these actions so they don't
they don't care where they are the
layout just fire off an event you listen
for it it does it
you want to see the diff between those
two it's probably pretty small too
so I think that's enough yeah I mean
we're just moving things from from left
to right so it's only a couple lines of
code to change but the cool thing about
it is that all of our all of our
interactions stays the same
okay so the next one gets a little
better well that is not the right one
hold on
okay so our next one gets a little
better so now our edit our preview is
gone but that's because we've we've
changed how they show up this time
they're in a window instead of in the
main panel so if I single click I get a
window for the view and if I double
click
I get a window for the Edit somewhere oh
wait I haven't done the edit hold on
just doing the view first okay so I'm
just changing how the view works how it
how everything's displayed everything's
still tied together through these events
so these events fire off and we just
decide how to handle them so let's see
what would what letter we r we on room I
know it's been an H
so I set up these these events that
happen in the UI and then these are the
the handlers that are taken that the
result of that event happening
you want to see the diff
see we got okay
so that was between F and G so that was
just oh that was the one where we moved
from the left to the right I think this
is hard to keep track of these letters
well sometime on I but I think I skip
some of the diffs ok so here's the
change that made the preview open in a
window instead of previewing in the
panel on the right side not many lines
and from the user standpoint that's
that's a pretty big change from the end
user what they see
sorry
okay i want to make sure I got the right
one here so it should be a single click
to view double-click to edit not sure
why my double clicks not working now was
working earlier of course so it's good
at the very last one
all right JJ all right
there we go okay so this is a this is a
horrible in this tiny screen but all our
tabs are now windows they still interact
with themselves the same they still
there's still you know they're tied to a
preview so you can go and click on these
different things we get we get the
preview and the double click to edit so
even though everything went from being
like kind of a flat interface where
everything's in panels all shown at once
to a window to interface all the
interactions still happen the same we
can change stuff and save it here and it
updates in the grid
this is really because of these these
events that we've set up these custom
events so what I've done here is set up
just four events on a what EXT calls and
observable so which is just a really
simple component that you can you can
you know fire events through so I've set
up those four events and then down later
on my code set up the handlers for those
those events so you I doesn't care at
all you know what it looks like these
events still fire and and act as they
they normally would so anybody have any
questions about that yeah just kind of
the first year yep yeah she with it so
this is um this is where we started out
with so just for grids side by side
these grids they all have this edit
function in this case you know it's
built right in it's an inline editor the
delete actions all work add all that
kind of stuff so from there the next
step yeah I've also got the source code
up on github if you want to look at it
there's github repo for it
but I mean this is the this is the guts
over right here this is where the
application is all set up like I said
it's using EXT for all the UI work so
we're creating a bunch of exe components
here creating a manager that that you
can relay events through and tying them
all together so for instance here I've
got like my main grid this man good the
is what EXT calls and editor grid which
is right there I set up some basic stuff
for it like how to store the data how to
display the data so like the first thing
in there is is setting up a store that's
where all the data is stored comes in as
JSON and that the store normalizes it to
be used by EXT so the data could come in
as XML or whatever wacky format like CSV
and and excl normalize it so it can be
used anywhere in EXT components
these are some events that I'm kind of
relaying to make my own custom events
like I take the row select tonight I
relay it through my manager and call it
the view schedule item event double
click again relay it through the manager
edit you know the ad relays to an ad
event the next item is the editor which
I think shows up in d
so that's the editor panel this is a
forum panel what actually caused a forum
panel
so this is almost like this is almost
boilerplate code you know it's really
just setting up configurations then I've
got a view panel
so my view panel is activated on the
single click down here and it's just
it's like some fragments of HTML and
uses EXT ex templates to display the
data so actually this is kind of
everything this is a really neat thing
in EXT they have these x templates and
the the HTML this used to render that
little that little section and the the
lower right that actually comes right
out of the document itself it's in this
text area that's in the body and it's
got some you know variables in there
that are replaced when it renders so
that's the gist of it um now if you want
download the code and play with it it's
a it's you know it would be like a good
base if you're starting out to build a
EXT app there give you a good foundation
to kind of build off of um so enjoy uh
yeah yeah you can find me on github is
