&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thank you so much, Sarrah. I

for you. So you mentioned how to
style React components as a 
divisive topic, and you 
evaluated the - you evaluated 
the pros and cons, but what if 
you have to work with someone 
who does not agree with you? How
do you not lose friends that 
way!  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Not everyone's going to be 
your friend, right? At that 
point, you have to agree to 
disagree, but commit, so whether
you agree with that decision, or
the other team member agrees 
with that decision, as long as 
you all commit to making that 
work and moving forward with it,
it's going to be just fine. It's
all going to work. It's the best
way. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Okay, so just, like first 
acknowledge that not everyone 
can be my friend? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yes. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And then commit to my 
decision. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Commit to that decision and 
keep going with it because 
you'lling going around and 
around, refactoring, and it will
be a mess. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thanks a lot, Sarrah. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thank you. [Applause].

[Break].
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Hello. So you know like 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Hello. So you know like 
sometimes when big companies or 
brands say something rely 
ridiculous on social media or 
something and people call it 
this brand is having a PR 
nightmare? So, for example, just
a few weeks ago, CTQ ran out of 
chickens. So 900 of their stores
in Britain were forced to shut 
down. It was as though the KFC
crisis on Twitter.  
What did KFY make a giant pull 
request and the - well, it 
turned out PR nightmare meant 
public relation nightmare, not a
pull request nightmare. 
Otherwise, they should totally 
tune in next to listen to the 
next talk where we have 
Catherine Meade teaching us not 
how to have pull request 
nightmares. Catherine works at 
Sparkbox. She has a strong 
passion for education, she 
expense a lot - she spends her 
free time volunteering and 
teaching with girl development. 
Her other hobbies include 
reading, table top games and cat
jokes! .  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The first letter on this 
repository link here is D. I 
will share is it again. I 
tweeted it.   out. My name is 
I'm a full stack developer. I 
use her/she pronouns. We have 
about 40 people working at 
Sparkbox. I spend most of my 
time working on an enterprise 
level design system you can ask 
me about later. Today, I'm going
to share with you a few tools 
and techniques to make your pull
requests more effective and more
collaborative. Because of time, 
I hope to do a quick summary of 
a few tools, and you can Google 
them later after the
event. Most are not GitHub 
exclusive. I know there is at 
least one GitHub person. 
Hopefully, like you still find 
something even if GitHub is not 
your main technology. I should 
share a bit about context and 
how Supportingbox does code 
reviews.
We store nearly all of our code 
on GitHub. We used shared 
repositories dedicated to 
whatever engagement we are 
working on. Developers have - 
whenever developers have new 
code to add to the project, they
ask another developer for code 
review of the
pull request. I've come up with 
six rules that Sparkbox adheres 
to. I came up with these rules. 
So, I do not represent the 
thoughts and ideas of
my employer. Rule number one is 
no-one merges their own
close. One developer is writing 
emerging piece for a website. 
Last year, we had a client who 
wanted an additional full-time 
developer for the project but 
they would be the only developer
on that project. We offered 
instead two developers at half 
time. Having a reviewer is that
important to us. The second rule
is never push directly to 
master. It is the easiest way to
break everything. Requiring code
review reinforces the quality 
that comes value as the company.
Third rule:  if you're working 
with UI, get a design review. We
have a position called a 
front-end designer. Every 
project we design, this special 
designer will often write for an
end code so they may use some 
CSS but not every company has
designers who knows how to code,
and nor should they. If you're 
working on copy, get a
copy review. This is usually the
project manager or the client 
themselves. We have an 
integrated development process, 
so the clients usually have 
access to the repositories we're
working on. Rule number 5 is 
never, ever push directly to 
master. Again, unless you
messed up. Which, if you did, 
find a Buddy to pair with, which
leads me to rule number of 6, 
these rules are more like 
guidelines. 
If you follow these six rules it
ensures that we follow the basic
Sparkbox creed which is working 
together for a web bit right. If
every piece of code has at least
two people contributing to it, 
we often catch mistakes before 
they happen. All of that is 
context for about what I'm about
to talk about. It may be 
different for you in your 
company; it's just how we like 
to work. I'm not telling you how
you should do code
reviews. Some challenges of 
collaboration are getting a PR 
from a non-coder, or or a PR 
review from someone in a 
different time zone. It's not 
that easy. Working with 
developers who may be only doing
reviews on your project
or working with people who are 
assigned directly to PR review 
and nothing else. So, how do we 
improve these things? So I'm 
going to give you six steps, I 
think. I guess I like the number
6!  Tip number 1:  write good 
stories. Two, ensure good pull 
requests. We have to write good
issues. At Sparkbox,ee use 
Trello to organise engagements, 
usually with something like Scrm
which involves creating stories 
which is a GitHub issue 
representing a bite-sized chunk 
of work. Stories should include 
the requirements of the work, 
and potentially a solution if 
you have one in mind. A story or
issue doesn't need to be overly 
complicated but it should be 
easy to understand. A 
well-written story makes for 
clear requirements when it comes
time to do a PR, and this leads 
you to my very first 
recommendation:  the only one 
GitHub exclusive but I'm sure 
there's one similar on the other
technologies. For reference in 
the photo, this is my co-worker 
Austin who is a project manager 
explaining that this footer is 
not great so maybe we can use 
some of the other colours 
instead. So GitHub issue and 
GitHub issue templates and PR 
templates allow you to add a 
markdown file to the root 
directory to outline the issue 
process. I will share this link 
again in a minute. This is an 
issue template. Here is my 
markdown. It is included 
directly in my project. In 
addition to adding the template 
file to the root of your 
template, you can add a GitHub 
directory. PR templates work in 
the same way but have a 
different file name and they 
come up with you do a PR instead
of an issue. So here is the 
issue template on GitHub. When I
click the new issue button, the 
text field pop lays with the 
contents of the template file 
and the example files are stored
in the repo I linked at the 
begin. I will link it again, I 
think.  If you want to take a
closer look. Talk with your 
project team to decide what you 
should put into a template. Mine
is just an example. It is a very
flat example. A checklist is 
nice. There is that link again. 
I will give you about 30
seconds. Tip number 2 is to get 
the basics right. A good way to 
frustrate your pull request 
reviewer is to send them 
something with absolutely
no context. You could respond in
kind. These are
real PRs. But but a few extra 
minutes to write a thoughtful PR
description can go a long way 
towards easing the work of the 
reviewer. We try to include a 
quick summary of the work being 
done, usually matching your 
commit 
descriptions. Link to any GitHub
issues or stories, especially if
you're using something like 
sudden hub, Giraffe or Agile. A 
link or screen shot of the 
original design work if you're 
working in UI. I love screen 
shots, so they don't have to 
open up zeppelin every time I'm 
looking at something. Step by 
step instructions including how 
to run the lint or how to run 
the tests, how to navigate to 
any new work, how specifically 
your new work is meant to 
function. So here's that PR 
example again. My other 
co-worker, Bryan, he has hit a 
number of these tips. They 
should be written in the context
of the developer reviewing the 
work. For example, a PR to a 
developer who is only doing 
review or QA may look completely
different to the one who wrote 
the build process. All right. 
Next strip:  enhance your pull 
requests about gif. This is my 
favourite gif because the cat 
and coding, my name is Cat and 
I'm a coder, so it's me. I hope 
you like that joke. It's my own 
one!  So what if a gif can be 
more than a quick laugh? They're
awesome for showing functional, 
transitions, hover effects, 
animations, so pretty much any 
visual aspect of your work. We 
are a front-end shop, can you 
tell!  They're good for getting 
a signed review of
an animation for someone running
a site not locally. There is the
link. 
Recordit is a screen casting 
service and gives you a hosting
link. The CMS that the foundry 
is built upon is a big skill to 
set up. It may take a full day, 
especially if it is for a 
designer or project manager who 
is trying to review one or two 
lines of code or content. By 
including a gif, you may give 
the necessary context and allow 
everyone to feel confident in 
what they're approving. This is 
a gif I made of some
functionality. Here's the link 
to record it again. It doesn't 
currently support HTPPS. It 
means as you know, it can't be 
embedded directly into a PR on 
GitHub. It can still be sent as 
a Slack link or as an email or 
whatever. An alternative, I 
recently discovered
gifox. 
Hosting on GitHub gives you the 
full security of your 
repository, so you're not 
violating your security 
policies. It
does cost $5. This 
one is really off. It is 
including in Setapp, and I think
this one only works on Mac but 
there are a lot of different 
tools out there. It is the 
thought that counts. Right. The 
next one is enhancing your pull 
requests with video. An 
important aspect of a 
complicated PR is the ability to
walk someone through your code. 
The current devs are often 
distributed or remote. We work 
in different time zone. 
Sometimes, it's nearly 
impossible to schedule the 30 
minutes to step through your PR.
Here's
the tool. It's GoVideo. 
This used to be called Viewed 
It. They changed it right after 
I wrote my talk, so I had to 
change it!  GoVideo is a Chrome 
extension. Not everyone is a fan
of chrome -- hello,
Mozilla!  
GoVideo let's people score their
screen and voice all at once. We
used a video like this on 
engagement where the main 
reviewer - me - was not 
dedicated to the project 
full-time. Because I was not 
available for stand-ups, I 
didn't have a direct hand in 
building the website, and I 
wasn't familiar with the changes
being reviewed. The dev had to 
change every - GoVideo is my 
favourite way to start a code 
review. Hopefully, it works. I 
keep meaning to rerecord this. 
But people tell me that the 
awkwardness is endearing. So 
just go with
it!  Can you hear that? You 
can't
hear that. Oh.  
There's an audio cable. I should
have told you, huh!  [Laughter].
It is like, yeah. All right.
[Video]:  this is Go Video. It 
records my entire screen plus a 
little me down not corn year. I 
think it's super friendly for 
doing video walk throughs of 
pull requests. Here you can see 
that I'm on a pull request and I
can go into my file changes, I 
can look at the code, I can 
explain this haskell 3M to 
Sparkbox home page. It hopefully
fixes an issue. I hope you like 
it. Please merge it. Obviously, 
I did merge it, because this is 
me. And then, when you are done 
recording your video, you can go
on to a screen. One shows up 
like this. You can see that you 
can change your
title like ... 
you had try it some
time. You can change your 
thumbnail, stroke through 
contents, and, when you're done,
you get a link right here. And 
that link is HTPPS, so you can 
embed it directly into your pull
request, and whoever wants to 
review your code gets a nice 
friendly walk-through, and that 
doesn't matter about time zones 
over anything
like that. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
Good. Thanks. That's really 
encouraging. [Applause].  So 
here's the link again. Depending
on the size of your PR, a 
walk-through video only adds 
about five or ten minutes total 
to our set-up time but it can 
potentially save the 30 to 60 
minutes to explain your PR via 
Slack or email or scheduling a 
Zoom meeting. This is useful in 
pairing developers who have 
different schedules, who are 
remote, or not as familiar on 
the engagement you're working 
on.  Two more tips:  give 
valuable feedback. Skitch is a 
free app from Everynote. It's 
the - evernote. It's loved by 
Sparkbox for everything from 
full-page decoms to quick design
edit to making memes of your 
co-workers. I use it daily. 
Here's an example. It provides 
elegant mark-up tools for boxes,
arrows, highlighting any 
unnecessary changes. You can 
take a screen shot and have
it. 
Shift command 4 on a Mac!  Here 
are some real-world examples. I 
pulled these directly out of
Slack. This is the best joke on 
my slide, and it's not even
mine!  You can Google Skitch. It
works well in the opposite 
direction of Recordit. It's an 
easy way for designers to work 
with developers, make this 
bigger, reduce the spates here, 
delete this link. It provides 
visual feedback for visual 
thinkers. Right. Last one. One 
last way to make your PRs 
friendlier is to be friendly. 
Via GitHub comments, it's no way
to collaborate. We know that 
communication is difficult in 
text which is why we invented 
the emoji. Bryan who wrote the 
awesome PR earlier also wrote an
article about this topic called 
stop giving depressing code 
reviews. The idea is to give as 
much positive code feedback as 
you do correction. It is hard if
you just go through and see the 
negative, and you don't offer 
any positive comments. You can 
do it. So, this is a picture of 
Bryan. He knows I'm including 
it!  And instead of really going
to this topic, I'm going to read
you this quote:
&quot;Giving positive feedback is an 
easy habit to adopt. You're 
already reading through the 
lines of code looking for 
issues. It doesn't take much 
time to throw in a nice or a 
looks great. You see something 
awesome, say it. So the link to 
the full article is there, but a
few positive comments make a 
huge difference&quot; whether you're 
speaking with designers, 
developers, other team 
contributes, clients, which are 
really important. Yes, be nice. 
And that's what I have. 
Hopefully, at least one of these
tools can make the PR experience
more accessible for your entire 
team and not just the 
developers. With a healthy dose 
of empathy, we can improve the 
way our co-workers and us write,
and make better websites. If you
want to hear more about Sparkbox
as the design system I'm 
building, come and find me. I 
have decals up here at the front
desk, and that's it. [Applause].
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I'm going to make everyone on
board to watch this talk!  That 
was really, really good. One 
question:  if you were to make a
large feature and you know it's 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I'm going to make everyone on
board togoing to be big, at what
point do you open up a PR? What 
do you think of work in 
progress? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I love work-in-progress PRs. 
The minute I have a commit, I 
hope a PR so people can see my 
work in progress. We have a 
work-in progress label we throw 
on there. Iive whip comments as 
well. If I that I can a change 
to a large body of work, I'm 
going to write a blog post about
this stuff in the next few 
months. If I make changes to 
what people have reviewed, I 
like to use a web commit and 
squish them down at the end but 
it makes it easy to track with 
changes. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I absolutely agree. I'm also 
a work-in-progress. A round of 
applause for Catherine!  .  I think we're a 
little bit early, so we have a 
good 20-minute break. You can 
the washroom, refreshments, or 
what-not. We will be back here

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Does anyone know who Harry 
Houdini was the?
Who Harry Houdini was? He was a 
Hawk fairan-born American 
magician, noted for his 
sensational escape acts. His 
first attracted - he first 
attracted notice as Harry 
Handcuffed Houdini on a tour of 
Europe where he challenged 
police forces to keep him locked
up. Soon he extended his 
repertoire to include
chains, from skyscrapers, 
straight impacts under quart, is
the traitjakets under water. 
What does that have to do with 
the next talk? Absolutely 
nothing!  
Aside from the fact that it is 
about CSS Houdini, and I do not 
know anything about it, so I'm 
rambling and reading
Wikipedia
article. Our next speaker is 
hailing from New Delhi in India.
Arun Michael Dsouza is currently
working at Pushup on various 
related technology and products.
He's an open-source enthusiast 
and has released several 
utilities and libraries for 
Angular JS, SASS, et cetera. 
Let's hear everyone talk about 
CSS Houdini!  [Applause]. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thank you so much. I hope I'm
audible to everyone? Okay, so, 
let's start. So, yes, about me: 
my name is Arun. I've come all 
the way from New Delhi in India.
I work as a software engineer by
profession. Mostly work with web
technologies, full stack 
JavaScript, exact. I'm an 
open-source enthusiast, released
several projects, and, you
know, other projects including 
node projects, some Angular 
projects, SASS, CSS, and all 
that stuff. 
I'm currently working at an ad 
technical company out of New 
Delhi, helping web publishers 
optimise their revenues through 
advanced testing, as well as 
demand optimisation. If you want
to know more about us, you can 
check out our
website. So, about Houdini. What
is it, and why is it so 
important to talk about? 
Before we understand what 
Houdini is, we need to 
understand the history behind 
it, which led to the creation of
Houdini. Of course, as 
developers, how does that help 
us? I must mention that this is 
going to be a bit of a technical
talk, so we will be seeing a lot
of code here. But before we get,
I want to know how many guys 
have heard about Houdini or 
maybe have experimented with 
Houdini before? Okay. A few 
people. That's great. You guys 
might be wondering why I'm 
talking about CSS in a 
JavaScript conference, right? It
doesn't make any sense. If you 
look at it, Houdini is not just 
about CSS or writing better UI, 
it is more about its connection 
with JavaScript that makes 
extending and developing not 
just CSS but the complete 
experience, and we will get to 
it. First, let's travel back to 
1994 when the W3C was formed. 
More and more people are getting
involved with the World Wide 
Web, and as they did, they 
started bringing in new ideas, 
suggestions and feedback. And 
within a year or two, JavaScript
and CSS were released. The web 
seemed to be growing at an 
extremely rapid pace, and the 
feedback cycle in place, there 
was the need to keep the process
stable. So the W3C was 
performed. Its job s to to 
ensure that the web was built on
open standards. A lot of things 
happened between 1995 to 2007. 
The DOM was introduced. Ajax 
came into play, and made 
possible the development of 
truly asynchronous applications,
and, of course, proper web 2.0. 
Development started awaiting 
their own solutions for common 
problems, you know, in the form 
of small tools and libraries, 
made the famous library by John,
and then in 2010, Sharpe 
introduced the idea of ... 
levels. The whole game was 
shifting and backwards 
compatibility has been a huge 
deal for us, so keeping that in 
mind, developers starting using 
and developing levels. As the 
web grew further, there was sort
of a feeling of dissatisfaction 
or a disconnect between the 
community on how these web 
standard committees were 
creating and prioritising new 
features. So, that's what led to
the creation of the
ostensible web manifesto. It 
aims at creating this feedback -
virtues feedback cycle with 
developers having the ability to
experiment and Polyfill 
standards so they can test 
implementation and gain insight 
out of it. This movement started
by some of the most notable 
members of the community, Alex 
Russell, Bryan Carlisle, and 
many other people.
And for the first couple of 
years, the standard bodies have 
been worked really hard on 
working on projects, providing 
early access to features, 
building transpilers, and in 
general, giving developers the 
freedom to build and to build 
new proposals and 
specifications. And obviously, 
in order to do this, 
environments need to understand 
the - developers need to 
understand the underlying magic 
of the underlying browser 
features, because if you look at
it, most of the web is high 
level, and it's extremely hard 
to Polyfill or test new features
out. And that's why the 
ostensible web manifesto also 
argues that the standard bodies 
should also expose and explain 
the underlying platform 
features, or the low-level 
capabilities of the platform. 
This obviously leads to quicker 
feedback by the community and 
new APIs and features, and 
quicker bug fixes, improvements,
and overall streamlining of the 
standardisation process. Now, 
taking this further, what if we 
were to Polyfill a new script 
feature? Can we do that? Of 
course we can, right. How many 
have been using the latest 
browser features since Year 6 
came out? Gentlemen, exactly. A 
lot of people. That's how 
flexible things have become.
Instead of waiting for browser 
vendors to implement you in 
features, developers can make 
and experiment with the latest 
features. But what if you were 
to Polyfill may be a new CSS 
layout, or maybe a new fill 
type? Can we do that? Well, not 
really, because producers don't 
understand how to extend to CSS.
I mean, we cannot simply define 
a new display, or a new fill 
type because all unknown values 
are discarded by the CSS engine.
That's the main problem. So 
where is the underlying CSS 
magic? It's all here in front of
us. In order to fix this 
disconnect, between the 
extensible web guidelines and 
the ability of CSS itself, W3C 
have formed this sort of a joint
task-force, and this task-force 
is codenamed
Houdini. It's named after one of
the most magicians of all time, 
Mr Harry Houdini. 
The aim is to expose the 
rendering engine internals to 
developers so that they can 
extend it and create better user
experiences. So Houdini will 
help in explaining and exposing 
the magic of layout and styling 
done by the CSS engine, so we 
will be able to hook into the 
processes in the rendering 
pipeline, and be able to do all 
sorts of things - create custom 
layouts, define new paint and 
fill types, whatever. Basically,
an extension of CSS it will be a
JavaScript, which is
amazing. 
So, so Houdini has started 
working on these new drafts 
which include a parser API, a 
layout API, and a few other APIs
that expose the rendering engine
internals. So let's cover them 
one by one. But before we begin,
I should let you guys now that 
many of the things I will be 
sharing are in very early 
stages, so the syntax might 
change. The APS might get 
change, you know? But 
nonetheless, let's set started 
and she what Houdini
has.
First is the ... yeah. First is 
the properties and values of the
API. So, this particular API 
extends the CSS variable spec 
which obviously allows us to 
create custom variables, and it 
extends it and allows us to 
create custom typed properties, 
so like you can define a type in
CSS now, define a type in CSS 
values. This also provides us 
the ability to have like I say a
type. We can have, we can 
specify initial values to the 
CSS variables, and we can define
the behaviour. So all CSS 
variables inherit by default, so
this might be come in handy in 
order to disable this particular
behaviour. So, let's see what 
the API looks
like. So, we have this 
registered property function. 
And we are using it to define a 
new type of property called BG 
colour, and I'm providing a type
here which is of colour. And 
with an initial value of black, 
and the inheritance parameters 
option
which is - so, having a type 
here is something new. Now, we 
are talking about typed CSS 
values. This obviously prevents 
invalid property value 
declarations, and so with a 
particular type defined, we 
always make sure that only the 
value of a required type is used
by the custom property, 
otherwise it throws an error. By
default, syntax which is the 
type that can support any type 
of value, but with the type 
defined, such as in this case, 
where I'm defining the type of 
colour, the initial value option
becomes a requirement, so that's
why I'm providing an initial 
value. So, let's look at a 
complete example. So we use the 
same BG colour of property of 
the type colour with the value 
of black. We're using it to set 
the background colour of the 
think class, using the standard 
functions. It is pretty simple, 
right? Overriding the default 
values is pretty 
straightforward, so in this 
case, the background would be 
coloured back, so you can simply
overriding it by redeclaring 
your custom property. Now the 
property will be - now the 
background will be coloured 
green. I think we noticed that 
all registered properties are 
bound to the root scope, so 
overriding a customs value 
property like this will only 
have its effect on the current 
element scope which is pink. If 
you were to access the BG colour
property, it would still give 
you the
value black. What if a non-value
like this string over here? 
Since we got this property 
registered with the type of 
colour, and we have a default 
value set to it value black. 
What if a  which is black, the 
CSS engine set up, and it 
applies the background colour of
black to the class, so, this 
becomes extremely using in cases
where you would want to resort 
to back values for your custom 
properties, and, of course, this
prevents any inconsistencies in 
your UI which
is great. The syntax string 
supports the following types. We
can have colours, we can have 
numbers, percentages, URLs, 
images, and a few other types. 
We can view the list over here. 
Next up is the time OM, so we've
been talking about typed values 
over here. 
This is what gives the ability 
to give type CSS
values. So the typed CSS object 
model gives us the ability to 
convert value strings, the CSS 
value strings into meaningful 
JavaScript-type presentations, 
so we have a specific API for 
this which we can have typed 
representations using 
JavaScript. So the title, the 
rendering engine, what which 
particular types of values are 
to be manipulated so does not 
involve any sort of extra 
parting of value strings in the 
case of the - parsing, so this 
offers significant performance 
improvement. And it also 
provides us this new class 
called the CSS style value 
class, so it also has a number 
of subclasses. Which can be used
for defining all sorts of type 
values, so we can have length 
values, we can have transform 
values, position, and a few 
other types of
values. It also exposes style 
map, so style map is basically 
an interface which helps in 
setting and getting CSS values. 
So we can use - access the style
map and use the set method if we
want to set a new property value
here, like in this case, I'm 
turning the height property to 
100 pixels. 
And we can use the same - we can
use the &quot;get&quot; method to get the 
height back which is returned as
a subclass, obviously, as a 
style value class, which is a 
simple CSS class. There is this 
open-source type OM available. 
You can play with it if you want
to, get a feeling of how it's 
supposed to work. Again, this is
just a proof-of-concept, so for 
experimentation only. I will get
to the browser support for the
APS. Allows to hook into the 
processes in the pipeline and 
extending those processes to 
apply our own  custom CSS so 
this is where the fun
part is. This is what it looks 
like. We have different 
processes in the CSS engine, and
we have different worklets 
attached to it. Each are at the 
various point in the rendering 
pipeline. You can see that we 
have a separate worklet for the 
paint stage, and a separate 
worklet for the layout 
stage, and so on. They are 
called for any of the process of
the rendering engine, and 
worklets are meant to be threat 
agnostic which meansstage, and 
so on. They are called for any 
of the process of the they're 
not intended to run on a 
particular thread, so the 
rendering engine can choose to 
run them wherever it wants, 
which it can be a separate 
worklet thread. They run in sync
with the rendering engine, but 
they are completely independent 
on the main thread, so that's 
the best
part. So this is how you would 
register a worklet. In this case
where we're hoping in the paint 
part. So this is how you stage, 
and when defining the worklet, 
we give it a name, and a 
JavaScript class. This is where 
all the magic happens inside 
this JavaScript class.
Let's see how this magic 
actually works at the paint 
stage of the rendering pipeline.
So this is what the paint stage 
does. It's responsible for a 
painting background of the 
content, and highlight of the 
box. Based on its size and 
style. So, during this stage, 
the paint API will allow us to 
create custom fills for our 
elements. Inform an image which 
we can use in the background 
image property, something like 
this. So, here we are applying a
custom-filled, using the paint 
function provided by the API. 
The first things first. We need 
to hook into the paint stage of 
the rendering pipeline, so what 
do we need for that? Worklet, 
right? So we define the paint 
worklet. This example is 
actually taken from the Google 
developers' website, so they are
planning to ship the Houdini 
paint API with the Chrome 65 
some day next week is the 
release date. So we can see 
that, we have a paint
worklet, called checkerboard, 
and we use it to paint in div, 
so we attached the checkerboard 
paint to its property. This is 
the 
worklet code. We have the 
registered paint function which 
we are using to paint our div. 
This is like a standard function
used in the paint worklet, so we
get access to these threeworklet
code. We have the registered 
paint function which we are 
using to paint our div.  
arguments in paint function 
which is basically the
context, the geom is the metric 
which returns the height of the 
element, and the properties are 
the style map properties we want
to access inside
our worklet. 
Using this be paint function, we
create the checkerboard with the
three colours defined, which are
red, green, and blue. If you 
have some experience with 
canvas, then this might look 
familiar. Here, we're using the 
context to apply the fill, so 
it's quite
the same. This is what the 
output looks like. It is a 
checkerboard fill made of 
specified colours. I know it is 
very simple example, but it 
still tries to demonstrate how 
easy it is to extend
the paint, paint process in the 
rendering
pipeline, and the paint worklet 
will be called every time and a 
screen resize operation happens,
so, the button is redrawn on 
demand and kept intact. This is 
completely normal because every 
time a fill happens, it is 
calculated on the elements cut 
in size which is generated 
during the layout stage.
Additionally, we can use custom 
properties in our paint worklet.
This is where the properties 
arguments comes in. And the 
properties arguments returns the
style maps, so we use the type 
here to get the custom 
properties from inside the 
worklet. As of now in Chrome, 
these properties are mostly, the
style map is mostly a wraparound
strings which is why you need to
convert it to a string over 
here. Going forward, it will 
change as soon as we have table 
support for type OM. The input 
function is required to fetch 
the required custom properties 
on any other properties that we 
need to use in the
worklet. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Paint can be used anyway, but
these are two simple examples. 
Multiple coloured, backgrounds, 
the material design ripple 
effect, so that what is of 
benefit here is that using a 
paint worklet, this sort of 
effect becomes pretty simple to 
make, so you don't need inject 
extra DOM nodes here in this 
case, and it's pretty simple to 
use it. You can use a full list 
of examples over here. 
Obviously, you can use it to 
Polyfill any of the proposed 
fill types that the browser 
currently does
not support. Next up is the 
layout API. The layout API gives
you see the layout worklet which
we can hook into the rendering 
pipeline to recreate our own 
display types. 
So, first let's understand what 
the layout stage does. So, it is
responsible for generating the 
and positioning fragments from 
the box stream, so a lot was 
there. Let's see what each of 
these mean. The box tree shows 
how the document structure looks
like, and what sort of elements 
are there in the structure, and 
this structure, and this is the 
structure that the API operates 
on, and let's us arrange all the
elements together. And each of 
these elements can have multiple
fragments. As we can see, 
fragments are like the tiniest 
bits in the whole box tree, and 
they're created for each of the 
pseudo elements. In this case, 
we have a fragment for the first
letter pseudo element, the first
line pseudo element, which is 
provided by the black outline. 
Now, the latout API gives us the
ability to create our own 
display types with respect to 
this particular box structure. 
This is what the broader picture
looks
like. We have the parent element
applying the layout on and the 
child elements further 
containing the child fragments. 
So the access to the child 
elements is important here 
because obviously we need to 
arrange the elements and the 
fragments within them, to 
generate our custom layout. So 
let's look at the worklet
now. 
This is what the class looks 
like. So we have a few started 
functions. Properties help 
stretching the property values 
of the current element like you 
saw in the paint worklet, for 
example. Children input 
properties gives the property 
values of the child elements, 
and the child play function 
let's us define how the children
elements are to be displayed, 
whether they are to be inline, 
blockified, whatever. Then we 
have two generator functions. 
The first one is in sizes and 
the second one is
layout. The intrinsic sizes 
function allows us to figure out
what the max or min size of a 
block is. So that we place our 
elements accordingly and don't 
waste any space available 
because they're the specified 
amount of space available for us
to do our layouts within the 
parent. And the layout method 
actually defines how the 
elements are to be arranged by a
custom layout. 
So, we create a constraint space
here which is basically the 
space available for us to do our
layout. And, within the parent, 
and, we position our fragments, 
and it's all the block sizes to 
finish up the arrangement of
the blocks. 
So this example is taken from 
the official blocks.  
The example here talks about 
stacking the elements on top of 
each other which are inside the 
parent. You can't really play 
with it at the moment. It is 
API, none of the browsers have 
got it implemented. But it seems
extremely promising, I mean, 
imagine writing a performant 
layout without any JavaScript 
packs. It's going to be awesome,
right? Now let's talk about the 
an makes worklet. So animation 
worklet allows us to create 
highly performant scroll or 
input-based animations - you 
know, things like sticky 
headers, parallax effect, and 
all that. All of this is done 
off the main thread. Because 
we're using a worklet here, this
offers us significant
performance. No janky scroll 
effect, I guess. Animations 
running inside the worklet also 
exposes the animation interface 
from the web animations API 
which means the worklet data can
be accessed on the main thread 
using any of the animation's 
APIs before now, let's look at 
an example of a
scroll-based
header. This is the structure of
the document. We have a header 
element, and an avatar element. 
So, these elements based on the 
scroll position, so I just 
scroll down the element that 
will animate and get fixed to 
the top, and the header element 
will lose its transparency. So 
it also includes a worklet 
module inclusion call. As you 
can see here, this is a promise,
and inside the promise we attach
the key frame effects, so these 
key frame effects are provided 
by the animations API, and we 
attach these to each of the 
elements that we want to 
animate. In this case, we are 
passing an area of effects 
attached with each element,
so we want to the avatar element
to scale down and the header 
element to loose its
transparency. -- to lose its 
transparency. Each of these 
effects are available in our 
worklet. We also create a new 
scroll timeline on the scrolling
container which is the parent 
container, which listens for the
scroll events, and it has an end
and start offset. So this is the
worklet class. It contains our 
constructor where we define our 
easing function. Then Geneva an 
animate process.the animate -- 
then we have an animate process.
This gives the current scroll 
position in document. And it 
also gives us this group of 
effects which are to be applied 
on the specified elements. So we
said the scroll position on the 
- which is the current time, and
the scroll timeline, and we 
adjust the time of the effects 
passed to us that gives us the 
ability to control the timeline 
of our key frames.
So this is how it would look. 
You can see that, as we scroll, 
the targeted elements are being 
animated as expected. The best 
part is all of this happens off 
our main thread. This can 
provide us some really high 
performance benefits. Especially
things with that are parallax 
effects. This is a demo created 
by Sirma, so that team put 
together a small Polyfill for 
the animation worklet, and this 
Polyfill is being used by an 
example listed on their 
repository. You can view the 
entire example
over there. There are are two 
more elements left which are 
fuzzy at the moment. Even the 
specs don't have too much 
information about them to cover.
One is the parser API and the 
other is the foreign metrics API
but we will still look into it, 
and see where each of these APIs
can potentially
offer us. So the first one is 
the parser API. As the name 
suggests it will allow us to 
parse CSS rules, or CSS rules 
typed into interpretations. So 
string-based based rules 
representations, and it will 
also have utilities to parse 
entire style sheets, rule sets, 
and all
those things. It's still like in
the early stages, so I can't say
much about it. The last one is 
the font metrics API, so this 
will provide basic font metrics,
or the font intended for our 
information. 
So, the two methods specified in
the spec, so there is this thing
called measure element method 
which basically takes in an 
element, and returns a font 
metrics object, and we have a 
measured text method which takes
in a DOM string and a style map 
and returns a fonts metric 
object which basically is 
supposed to store information 
regarding the width, height, the
boundary box baseline, and all 
of that of the element. So this 
will allow us to measure our 
text actual elements and the 
orientation, and allow us to do 
some really cool things like 
creating some interesting 
effects, maybe. 
So this was more of a brief 
introduction to the Houdini 
APIs. The main question is can 
we use Houdini today? And most 
of you might have guessed it:  
the answer is no. But it's 
coming soon. So this is what the
current situation looks like. 
The Chrome team is definitely 
push it hard to ship the new 
APIs. You can experiment with 
the properties and values API 
and the typed OM which is 
available behind the experiments
web features flag, so you can go
to Chrome flags, and turn the 
flag on. As far as I know, I 
think it is available in stable 
chrome as well. Again, behind 
the same flag. A fully 
functional paint API like I said
is to be released with Chrome 
65, some time around next week. 
So that is a good sign. Clearly,
no signals to implement the font
metrics API or the parser API by
any of the vendors. Few other 
browsers also seem to be 
catching up - well, kind of - so
we might see some of the API 
being implemented in a few of 
the browsers. Not really sure 
about the timeline, but be sure 
to check
out 
ishoudiniready.com.
With that being said, Houdini 
will cover us capabilities to 
extend rendering engines and 
come up with really amazing 
tools and patterns that will 
facilitate the development of 
truly rich web experiences. And 
I'm really looking forward to 
it. That's it from this side. 
Thank you. [Applause]. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thank you so much, everybody,
for giving us a glimpse into the
CSS future. And that was a  very
informative and you covered 
everything. I wrote down three 
questions, and you can answer 
them as you go, so I got 
nothing, I'm sorry. Sorry to 
disappoint!  However, I do have 
good news. It's food
time. We're pretty on time, so 
we have a full hour for food. 
And you know how yesterday, I 
said that the swag was only 
yesterday, the as on Zo-on swag.
It is still upstairs, the same 
place as yesterday. Today, from 
12 to 3
PM. See you back at

were - that you wanted to have. 
So we did this servo, and we 
developed a lot of things
on it.
At the same time, we wanted to 
solve several other problems, so
Firefox had a stability problem 
we noticed over the last few 
years, it had a lot of crashes, 
and we were wondering why. It 
has the old theme, so like the 
robots that were just looking 
old, by just having an old 
theme, when the UI in OSes have 
been proved, it feels slow, and 
there is there were a lot of 
cases where, in fact, the user 
interface was freezing - it's 
called UI young. Finally, we 
wanted to have the new
algorithm. So we
launched a project called 
Quantum, at the beginning of 
last year, and we decided we 
wanted to make a equal leap -- a
quantum leap in 
performance.Quantum leap -- a 
quantum leap in performance. I 
want first to thank my colleague
Lynn Clark who has drawn this 
amazing drawing, I'm unable to 
make any drawings that looks 
readable by anybody, so she's 
doing a lot of these drawings. 
She's writing blog posts, 
explaining how browsers are 
working. There will be a link 
later that allows you to have 
more information. So the first 
things that we have decided to 
do is to change our style 
engine. So the style 
engineengine, as I said, takes 
the different CSS
properties, look at the 
selectors, at the specification,
and, in fact, for each of the 
boxes, define, okay, this 
property with this value applies
to this one. For example, the 
background colour of the text 
colour, the font, and so on. 
This is something that has to be
done to each and every box, so 
this is at first sight something
that can be used easily with the
parallelisation.
So we tried it in Rust, on 
Stylo. Basically, we had several
processes, several threads, that
makes part of the tree and makes
the calculation, and of course, 
it's not that easy because first
you don't have one thread or one
process per element on the page 
because there are sometimes 
several thousand of them, so you
have to give chunk of the pages 
to each of the processes, so 
that means that some of these 
processes are just either at 
some point because there is 
nothing happening, finishing 
work while others may be 
extremely busy. So there is a 
big complex algorithm here that 
allows a different thread, 
different processes still to 
work from the other when they
are idle. With this, we created 
and we validated that the new 
way of doing styling in the 
browser is, in fact, much, much 
more efficient. But that was 
only the first step, because 
this is in servo, in the 
experimental browser. We needed 
to sort out the detail and to 
integrate this into the real 
browser. And integrating a new 
style engine in a browser, it's 
a little bit like doing heart 
surgery, but with a person that 
is still conscious. You want 
your browser to continue to 
work, you don't want suddenly to
have no new release for one 
year, two years, while you put 
all the wires together. So we 
took the styles of Quantum with 
the parallelism, the rule, and 
the cache from - the
style-sharing cache from Chrome.
Sometimes, it - a lot of nodes 
have the same ancestors and the 
same values, so it works pretty 
well, and, in fact, it wasn't 
working that well any more 
because lately, with all the 
pseudo classes and so on, it 
became more complex, and there 
are less of these elements that 
are - that were cached. So we 
modified the style-sharing cache
in order for it to work again. 
And then we just transplanted 
Stilo into the browser, and this
happened last November in 
Firefox 57 and we got for this 
part a very, very large 
improvement in speed. So Stylo 
is the first transfer from 
servo. It's not the stirs part 
of Rust inside the browser and 
solving a problem called 
embarrassingly parallel prop. By
definition, style engine is 
doing something that can be 
massively parallelised. Of 
course, when the page is simple,
you see little improvement. When
the page is very complex, you 
see a lot of
improvement. The browser has 
another challenge:  
each time you click somewhere on
the browser, there is an event 
handler going on firing and 
executing some code. You want to
be sure if you want to have 60 
frames per second or 120 frames 
per second that all that is 
happening on the main thread, 
and especially these handlers 
happening, is no more than 16 
milliseconds or eight 
milliseconds, or 120 frames per 
second. That means that you have
to have go out of the main 
thread as soon as possible 
because while you're on the main
thread, you cannot harm the next
event, so the next event, when 
you're scrolling a page W3C, or 
when you are clicking and so on.
Initially, browser had 
everything in the main thread, 
and little by little over the 
years, they start to take things
out, so first of them is a video
they are encoding happening now 
most of the time on the graphic 
card itself. There was a plug-in
also at this stage, kind of as a
worker and several others. What 
is quite interesting is we have 
another piece of computer power 
on the browser that is
a GPU.
The GPU is designed for games, 
is designed for the operating 
system when you have a lot of 
calculations to do on a lot of 
data. The same operation on a 
very large amount of data. And 
it's very, very efficient for 
this kind of thing. It is very 
efficient for gaming. On the 
browser, we have this kind of 
operation. One of them is a 
compositing, the last bit of the
calculation where you have all 
the layers, and you have to 
define which ones are visible 
enough. It's the same operation 
a lot of the time on a lot of 
data. We decided in 2016, we do 
offload the composition to the 
GPU, and we did it. At the same 
time, a little bit later, in 
fact, we noticed that the 
crashes just increased. We had a
lot of crashes. In fact, it 
wasn't the browser itself that 
was buggy, it was the drivers 
that were buggy, so the crashes 
were mostly happening on 
windows, and, for example, Mac 
has had very few crashes because
there are far less types of 
drivers and graphic cards. So we
decided last year to solve the 
crashes by having the
GPU, the graphic drivers loading
a different process, so the 
process crash, the browser 
detected the crash, it 
restarted, and then it works 
without using the GPU for this 
part. So you don't have all the 
speed improvement of the GPU but
you don't have the crashes, 
either. That's a way we had to 
mitigate the bugs in graphics 
drivers. So the come positioner 
was the first part - the 
compositor was the part that 
went to the GPU. The painting is
to take a texture and apply it 
to a surface, colour ra - we 
want to do the same. This is a 
project called web-runner - not 
yet finished, it's in process. 
This is the ultimate goal. I 
don't know when it will be 
finished. If you ask manage, 
they say soon, and the 
developers say a couple of 
years. It is somewhere in 
between! 
don't send it to the GPU, we can
remove it from the main thread 
so we have what we call off-main
thread painting. This has been 
done in Firefox 58 which went 
out in January, so basically we 
create a set of instructions 
that is policed, that is 
assigned to the layers, and then
we send it to another process 
that is ratarized which is the 
actual painting operation, and 
uses its own process on the GPU.
That way, as soon as the
ratarization is not on the main 
thread. We remove the 
bottleneck. It is not as perfect
as having everything on the GPU,
but it's no more the problem. So
this landed in Firefox 58, and 
there is an improvement coming 
the next version in two weeks 
where we discovered that we 
don't need to recalculate it
each time.  It's simple. We have
Heweristic in place so we don't 
have to calculate the whole of 
the display list each
time. We have mostly seen 
replacement of the PCs, the 
browser. In fact, if you want to
have browsers that are as 
efficient that feel quick, 
responsive, you need to consider
it as a system as a whole 
because, yes, you can have a 
very efficient-style engine but 
maybe the bottleneck is 
somewhere else. So we changed a 
way to do development, and to 
prioritise the development in 
Mozilla by having the triage, 
privatise, and we applied this, 
and we still apply this to fight
freeze in the UI. There is a 
collection of 30 block pass 
variation that is explain the 
changes that happen all over the
place. It's going in a lot of 
details, and he coins the name 
&quot;death by a million cuts&quot;. We 
found bugs where we had to fix 
ten bugs, and suddenly, we get 
back a lot of them. Each of the 
bugs was shaving one millisecond
here or there, but no
significant difference, but 
together, they were giving a lot
of differences. One of the 
things that we change is the way
we were doing. It is not 
specific to Firefox at all and 
it has been pioneered by Apple, 
and it is called 
checkerboarding. When you scroll
on your screen with a mouse or 
with the finger, you never want 
to scroll to stop. But 
sometimes, it goes too quick, 
and you don't have the time to 
calculate what you present to 
the screen, so you present a 
default value and people, 
instead of being confused, 
scroll less quickly. The data 
appears, the images appear, and,
initially, it was a 
checkerboard, which is why it is
called checkerboarding. The 
overall speed is not better, but
the feeling is completely
different. Another big things 
we've changed is IPC. It say 
known for a long time that, when
you communicate with a disk, it 
takes a lot of time, and you 
don't want to do this on the 
hard - main thread. It is the 
same when you communicate with 
another process, especially if 
it is a synchronous 
communication, you don't want to
do this on the main thread. We 
filed synchronous communication 
and we wanted to have as much 
synchronous communication. This 
is where we did a lot of - there
were two people working for six 
months on the
cookies. Because cookies were 
needed a lot of synchronous 
communication. They wrote the 
cookies mechanism in Firefox, 
and, in fact, it was 25 per cent
of our blocking on interprocess 
communication, and, on big 
websites, when it was fixed, 
like Facebook is making several 
- writing several times per 
second to the cookies store, in 
this website, like Twitter, or 
Facebook, we were able to win in
the order of the second in the 
time we made to display the 
page. There were other offenders
like plugins but they're gone 
today. Or the traditional 
extension on Firefox and - often
does that, so we had to decide 
to stop having
that.  
There are plenty other things 
that we have done. For example, 
we have changed some algorithm. 
They are still efficient but 
they were already efficient, 
but, in fact, sometimes they 
were not making good use of the 
cache, so we keep an algorithm 
with the same complexity, but 
that works better with the 
cache, for example, and 
suddenly, you have an 
improvement of your performance 
on complex pages that are the 
same complexity of the 
algorithm. Also, the garbage 
collection, the parts that take 
back the memory has been 
changed. Instead of having to do
a complete sweep, or we can now 
do an incremental sweep, so we 
take a bit of the memory, and we
start because we only have a few
milliseconds, and we continue 
later, so that means the memory 
grows a little bit but when the 
browser is idle, it goes back to
normal. At the same time, we 
notice that memories
that is used towards the end 
very quickly and so on is the 
one that is usually released 
very quickly, and what you have 
done, I don't know, two hours 
before, usually, you will keep 
it until you cross the browser. 
So we also have changed, these 
kinds of things. 
The last thing is we tried to 
remove all timers in the 
interface. Timers are really,
really bad. At first sign, first
look, it looks very nice because
you deal with the execution 
later, but, in fact, you don't 
control when the execution will 
happen, and when the timer will 
file. Not only will it fire on 
the main thread, but maybe it is
a moment that is important for 
something else. You have no 
control. In fact, the web 
platform in this can be used on 
the website. We have redressed 
idle callbacks saying fire this 
or do this when the main thread 
is free. We also did things like
throttling background tabs, so, 
if it is in the back, it is less
important, but if there is 
mutesic playing in the back, you
don't want it
stop, so we are defensive here, 
and we progress with 
experimentation. Finally, we 
designed our user interface. 
So the feeling of the user 
interface is something
really important. The look has 
to look modern. It doesn't 
change the indeed but the 
perception of the speed. Every 
animation is happening on the 
GPU, through the CSS. We had in 
the previous interface animation
done in JavaScript, and they 
were causing a good deal of the 
- so that's really important 
that animation, not in 
JavaScript on the main thread. 
We changed a bit the structure 
of the user interface so it's 
quicker for the user to find 
elements. It is not quicker in 
speed proper but it is quicker 
for the user. And with all these
things together, we have now a 
new engine. And it looks still a
nice robot but it looks much 
more modern. And it's not 
finished. In fact, Quantum was 
released in November but already
the next two versions of the 
browser had more improvements, 
so web renderer is coming at 
some point. We have other ideas 
to improve things, and, in 
general, the browser is still 
evolving. It is not the end. 
It's a new beginning because it 
is the first time we have now 
this power of having a massive 
parliamentism on a browser. I 
want to thank you for listening.
Also, you can help by installing
Firefox, by reporting problems, 
especially when your application
is slower that Firefox than 
another browser. 
This interests us because it is 
difficult to have real live 
data. Each time we do a commit, 
there are 2,000 hours of tests 
going on on a farm of computers.
But it is tests.@not real-life 
things. If you file a big and 
say you can give help by 
reproducing it, an engineer will
be very happy. Spread the word. 
We want as many people to use as
many browsers as possible - 
Firefox if possible too - 
because competition is good, 
because that's the way we 
improve speed, and Firefox is 
the way to stay in form. Thank 
you. [Applause].  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thank you very much. That was
very interesting. I have so many
questions. Shall we start with 
the easy one? How are you? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I'm fine!  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, you mentioned the 
composition being offloaded to 
the GPU but the benefit is not 
universal because the windows 
machines seem to crash more 
because there are more different
drivers. You also mentioned 
composition being - painting 
wanting to be moved to the GPU 
as well. Will it also suffer 
from the same? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yes. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Can I then derive from that 
and say Firefox Quantum runs 
better on Mac than a windows 
machine? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; No, it's a bit more complex. 
Mac is an ecosystem which is 
easier because there are fewer 
drivers, but the hope and the 
reality is drivers are getting 
better and better because we 
file drugs to the driver 
vendors. Yes, all machines, 
especially for paint will never 
have web render working, but 
little by little, this problem 
will go away. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thank you. [Applause]. 
So I didn't have the list of 
speakers for the panel - I do 
have now:  
dress dress dress, Sean Larkin, 
Anna Henningsen, and Dan Abramov
at the panel later. If you have 
questions that you want answers 
to, please go to
slido.com with the event code 
JSCONF and ask a question. We 
will be back in 
eight minutes.

So you can see a new house

So you can see a new house 
already before it is actually 
being built. Or you can make a 
really cool small games on your 
browser, on your website 
integrated it with all
the
native, environment things that 
you have, and you can make them 
work with each other which is
really cool. You can also use it
to enhance your info graphics, 
or to make your data more 
readable with enhancing it with 
the third dimension, so you can 
also use animation time and the 
third dimension to show 
something you would like to do 
with your data. I think it is 
pretty interesting, and you 
should definitely think about 
how to use it. Most developers 
that would like to start with 
especially web VR have been 
coming to me and asking me how 
do I get started with 3D? Why is
it so hard to get started for 
these people? This is what I 
would like to talk to you about 
today. I would really love that 
you come out of this talk and 
you have this little tool box 
with things you have heard 
before, and you feel more 
motivated to start trying it, 
because at first, you will be 
overwhelmed by all the new
terminologies you're going to 
encounter. Not only do you have 
now things to learn, but you're 
also going to be a movie screen 
designer; you're going to be a 
narrator; you're going to have 
to learn to do UX in 3D, you're 
going to learn about 3D 
modelling, how to light a scene 
properly, et cetera, et cetera. 
That's a lot of things to
learn.
I would like to talk to you 
first about the physics of life.
So, here you see - the physics 
of light. This is a simple 
scene. We have this apartment. 
We see a computer standing on 
the desk. We have a chair, we 
have a window, and, outside, we 
have the sun which is primarily 
the source of light which makes 
us see everything. But how does 
it actually
work? Every light source is 
emitting electromagnetic rays. 
As soon as these rays are hid 
hitting an object, they're going
to interact with that object. 
Either the object is absorbing 
all the light - in that case, a 
lot of energy is being produced 
- or parts of the ray of the sun
are going to be bouncing after 
and reflecting a different 
surfaces until that light energy
is
used up. I already said that the
electromagnetic waves consist of
different frequencies, so that 
means different frequencies are 
different colours. If one 
frequency is absorbed, the other
two frequencies are going to hit
our eye, the retina of our eye, 
therefore creating this colour 
in our eyes, and we can
see it. 
Different materials react very 
differently, which I'm going to 
talk about the differences 
afterwards. But there are three 
major things, as I said already:
absorption, reflection, and 
transmission of light. We can 
see this here a little bit more 
graphically. Imagine you have a 
perfect mirror which it is not 
possible, even if you polish 
your surface very well, you're 
never going to have it, but 
theoretically, a perfect mirror 
will reflect all the light rays 
uniformly. This we call specular
reflection. Then we have diffuse
material like cloth, wood, and 
other things, that are not so 
much reflective, so it's going 
to take the rays and bounce them
back in a very chaotic
way. And you have propagated 
light, so, if you have glass or 
water, the light is not only 
going to reflect, it's also 
going to transmit through the
solid. It creates these really 
cool effects. This is not 
everything that defines in the 
material, but as we can see in 
this illustration, these three 
components make a lot of our 
real-life materials, and it's 
never just one component
that is there in one material. 
For example, if you imagine you 
have a wooden floor, that is not
polished, the rays of light are 
going to bounce back 
chaotically. If you put a polish
or finish on, it will be shiny 
from specific angles. That is 
what I really want you to think 
about when you get started with 
3D because that's what a lot of 
people get wrong or don't think 
about because, why would you? 
How do we now translate this 
into computer graphics? I would 
like to go a few centuries back 
when the first cameras were 
appearing called pinhole 
cameras. You have a 
light-sensitive film on the back
of a box with a little hole 
inside. Only runway of light per
angle is allowed to pass through
that hole. It reads then the 
colour on that spot of
the film.
- it creates then the colour of 
that spot on the film. We're 
also using this technique in the
render technique called 
raytracing, and that's what I'm 
going to talk about. However, if
you imagine again the sun, it's 
not only shooting one ray at a 
time, it's like a really big 
energy source shooting down all 
these billions and billions of 
rays at the same time. Most of 
these rays are never going to 
hit our eye. They're never going
to hit our camera or whatever 
specific spot we want to look 
at. So what computer graphics 
are doing is they use a 
technique called backwards 
raytracing, so we are tracing 
the rays, but instead of going 
from the light source, we are 
going from our camera through 
the pixel that we want to trace,
and we shoot the ray into the 
scene, and we look at the first 
object that we are going to hit,
the closest one. From there, we 
want to see if this one object 
is in shadow. Or if it is
in light. So, if the object is 
actually lit, we're going to use
the colour of the material that 
is defined at that space. in 
light. So, if the object is  
Basically multiplying it, 
simplify that, multiplying it 
with the colour of the light, 
the intensity of the light. If 
the object is in shadow, we're 
just going to use black for now 
as for shadow. This is very 
simplified. Now, I also talked 
about these other things that 
are called like
transmission, and reflection, so
how are we handling this in 
raytracing? 
Imagine we want to see if we 
have a transparent material, 
like glass, we would like to see
what can we see through that 
glass, and what is reflected on 
the surface of that glass? So, 
on the impact point, we have to 
calculate the different rays 
that we are going to trace. One 
of those rays is going to be 
reflection ray, and one of them 
is going to be the refraction 
ray. It's going to be, yeah, not
very nice the names are so 
close!  And from there, from 
these rays, we're going to do 
another check if they are 
hitting the next object, so, if 
the reflection ray is hitting 
this red sphere, it's going to 
be red at that point, but the 
refraction rays hitting the 
green sphere, so we have to 
calculate together if we want to
have the pixel there red or 
green. From the impact point of 
the secondary rays, we are going
to trace towards the sun, and 
see if these points are in light
or
not. I want you to have a moment
to look at
this.
Did everybody get it? 
[Laughter]. 
Can you come here and explain it
to me? Because this is how I 
feel about my own code after two
weeks of not looking at
it!  
What you're looking at is the 
basic implementation of a 
raytracing engine that can do 
reflection and refraction with 
geometry primitives of spheres, 
and I think - and this is a 
common challenge among people 
who do computer graphics, is how
to make the most compact 
raytracing engine that can be 
fit on a business card. So this 
actually compiles, and I think 
that's pretty ghoul. Let's take 
it apart a little bit. What we 
want to do is define our 
geometry primitives. And for 
now, we're going to talk about 
the sphere. The sphere is one of
the most easy shapes to 
calculate at intersection. For 
that, we need a centre, a 
radius, and we want to have 
material, because as I explained
before, that's the most 
interesting part. And we're 
going to make another algorithm 
that will calculate our 
intersection from that. If we 
are successful, we're going to 
return both points that are 
intersecting with the sphere 
because usually, you will have 
two of them, so the distance to 
the closest one, and the 
distance to the furthest
away one. We are going to define
the geometries. Our light source
will also be spheres but just 
with a different material that 
actually emit light and for that
we can test afterwards. We are 
going to have a buffer for our 
canvas, and we're going to 
traverse through each pixel.  
And we're going to trace for 
each pixel one ray which is what
we did before, right?  In the 
trace function, we want to see 
again, this is the primary ray 
that we talked about before, and
we want to see which is the 
closest objects. We're going to 
test the ray against every 
object. And as a result, we get 
the nearest one back. If we 
don't have one, we can return 
the background colour because 
there's nothing there. And there
will never be something there. 
That's the really cool thing 
about raytracing. You actually 
test against the
whole scene. If there is an 
object there, and it's a 
transparent or a reflective 
material, we are going to have 
to shoot the second race for 
each of those, and we do this 
recursively until we are 
satisfied, and usually, you 
don't want to do this endless by
because it is going to take 
forever. So we're going to 
decide how often you want to do 
this recursion, and, at the end 
of that, you will test it 
against the light and see if 
these points are in shadow or 
not. Then you're going
to use the algorithm to see how 
you should calculate the light 
together. I'm not going to 
explain that right now, but it 
is very interesting look at. If 
it doesn't fall into this, that 
means we are hitting a light 
source, or a diffuse material 
that is not going to reflect on 
the different points so we can 
break the recursion there. I did
not make another slide for this 
because I think it is clear. 
This is the result we are
getting. I think it is very 
interesting to see, from this 
rather simple algorithm, we 
already get really cool effects.
Like, we can really see the 
spheres which are close to each 
other, reflecting each other. We
can see shall quotes, and we can
also -- we can see shadows, and 
what is behind thedows, and we 
can also -- we can see shadows, 
and what is behind the camera.. 
this is not something that you 
see in games, for example, or in
different render engines. And 
why is that? We're going to get 
to that later on. So, this was 
really easy, I think. But now we
want to really go realistic 
because we said before there is 
not one ray per pixel; usually, 
the sun shoots so many rays that
make up one pixel of your image.
There are so many things that 
come together, we want to have 
soft shadows. We want to use 
multiple light sources. How are 
we going to compute these 
together? How are we going to 
decide on what is more weighted,
which pixel should be what? And 
we really want to have this 
physical correctness which means
that we have to basically bounce
the ray for ever until it hits 
the light source by itself. 
Right now, we're just making a 
short cut because we just test 
if it will be hitting the right 
or not, if there is something in
between
or not. This is going to use a 
lot of computational power. 
Raytracing is an old technique. 
1984 was the first conference 
that was taking this as a topic,
and since then, we are still not
there where we have real time 
raytraced engines that are 
working. It has a lot to do with
this that you cannot make short 
cuts to make it look good. You 
have to have a certain amount of
samples, unless you're going - 
otherwise you're going to have a
really noisy
scenery. 
So we have a lot of new light 
sources in the room that are 
also casting rays. I would like 
to just very
briefly interviews 
to you rastarization technique. 
This is the most common real 
time technique being used. It is
just as fundamental, this 
technique. It has been around 
almost the same time because 
when raytracing was introduced, 
the computational power 
notifications good or strong 
enough. It would have taken them
forever to render one frame of 
an animated movie, for example.
So, what is interesting
about
rasteriziation, it is trying to 
find out which object is in the 
shadow, or what is the colour of
it.
Raytracing is going from the eye
to the camera into the scene, 
rasteriziation is going from the
objects from the scenery on to 
the screen, due to perspective 
projection. So we take all the 
numbers and all our points, and 
all our vertices and everything 
and we project it on to the 
screen. It is currently using 
triangles, which is also a 
rendering primitive. The cool 
thing about triangles is that 
you can't sub divide it any 
more. You can't make more areas 
out of it, and the area is 
always planar, so we never have 
a perspective warp or something,
which makes it really cool to 
them project and test.
What we do with the triangles 
mapped on to the screen base, 
we're
rasterizing each pixel and map 
its C value and measure how far 
away it is from the camera, and 
if we we have transparency, then
we have to consider the C buffer
because that's how we're going 
to put it together, which also 
tells us that the C buffer, so a
transparent object is basically 
just a look-through with a 
different alpha value which does
not have this refraction rates 
that are warped around in
this scene. Here in this image, 
you can see two basic 
implementations:  one basic 
images of rasterization, and the
implementation of raytracing. 
You can already see the 
difference, I think. While 
rasterization has come a really 
long way, if you have played any
3D games recently, or if you're 
working with VR, you're going to
know it is not going to look 
like thedifference, I think. 
While rasterization has come a 
really long way, if you have 
played any image up there, so 
there is a lot of simulations of
real physics happening in 
rasterization but generally, the
implementation is also a lot of 
work to do to simulate these 
physics. But they are doing a 
pretty good job. The only 
probably is still transparency, 
I think. So, just a quick 
overview of the two:  raytracing
is mostly physically correct if 
you put a rot of efforts in it. 
It has nice side details that 
you don't have to think about, 
you get the soft shadows, the 
interreflections, you get the 
caustics, but it is 
computationally heavy, so we're 
going to use a lot of 
computation time to render 
frames, and, if we ever want to 
do this real time, we're going 
either have of to break it down,
or we have to make
cuts. 
Rasterization is super fast. It 
is really only one 
transformation from your 
co-ordinates to your screen-base
co-ordinates. Your GPU and your 
computer is designed to do 
rasterization, not raytracing. 
Pixar and most of the rendering 
people I know, they're still 
rendering raytracing with CPUs 
because it doesn't matter to 
them if they're three times 
faster or not. What matters is 
that they have to change their 
tools, and they have to change 
their engines to be supportive 
of GPUs. For just a little
benefit. So the physics that are
not really correct, you have 
like approximation of what you 
can do. And you
have quality loss due to that. 
This is kind of the point where 
I hope you are all, &quot;Oh, God, 
how should I even get started? 
It seems very complicated.&quot; I 
would like to introduce you a 
frame tool kit, and A Frame of 
is a web tool kit where you can 
Alf get started with making your
own 3D scenes. 
If you're a fan of HTML, you're 
going to be really happy!  
Because this is what it going to
look like. You can define the 
HTML tags. You define the sky, 
you can put sources in if you 
want to use a sky texture. If 
you prefer to use a sky colour, 
you can put the colour. Then you
have this geometry primitives, 
you have usually boxes, spheres,
cubes, whatever. Planes are also
very common, and you can also 
define the lights. And that's 
where we come back to the 
beginning, because, with this 
component, you're going to make 
or break your scene. If your 
lighting is
good, you can really achieve a 
lot by just having three or 
four, or five different objects 
in the game. And the best part 
of A Frame is that it comes with
web VR integration, so you don't
have to do anything. You can 
lean back, you can import your 
live controls, or every major 
headset is supported. Also 
mostly every major headset 
controller is. So this is what 
that example would 
look like. But that did not look
very good. I mean, the 
background does, but the 
foreground ...!  So, it's still 
the big question in the room is 
how do I get my 3D models? That 
is where also we come in. For
example, this is going to be in 
the head of your HTML. You learn
the external components called A
Frame components and I think the
open-source community is really 
doing an amazing job here 
because you have all these 
really cool components like A 
Frame, orbit controls, people 
building environment presets for
you so you can import them and 
say I would like to use this 
pre-set. Afterwards, you can 
always use animation of each 
attribute to change your scene 
the way you want, and if you 
don't like HTML, you can do that
with JavaScript. So you can just
edit your HTML attributes 
programmatically to make them 
animate. And this is how you're 
going to use the A Frame 
components that are made by 
external parties, for example, 
you can load the 3D IO furniture
of your choice, you can position
it because position attributes 
are generallily used for each 
object, and you can have your 
camera, rotating around that 
object, and you had this really 
nice background that you love so
much. And you just want to lay
in that bed with that VR 
headset. This is I think really 
dev tool, and you should 
definitely try it out because 
there are so many, many things 
that people are doing with this.
I would like to share with you a
few tips and tricks. This would 
be a talk on its own, but this 
is what I've been asked most of 
the time. Again, how do I
get my content? Should I start 
to learn Blender? That's a 
pretty frustrating tool to 
learn. I've worked a lot with 
Blender, but it is pretty 
powerful. However, you don't 
have to do that because some 
people, like my co-worker, 
Thomas, is writing an inspector 
plug-in for A Team, which has a 
3D inspector to try out your 
values that you can then import 
into your HTML file.
You can use this inspector 
plug-in to get models from 
example Google Blogs. Try it 
out, scale the models and have 
fun with
it. Lighting is going to make or
break your scene. I think it 
really makes a big difference. 
If you're interested in this, I 
have high motivations to write 
blog posts about this topic. And
then for the end is content 
optimisation. We are people that
work mostly with the web, and 
with different devices.
So if you start working with 3D 
for a project, think about what 
is your target group. If you 
want to use 3D on different 
devices at the same time, keep 
in mind you might want to design
it differently for whatever you 
want to do. If you want to do a 
fast-paced game, then you have 
maybe to not be so detailed; but
if you want to do product, like 
you want to do a scene of your 
product which you try to sell, 
you might want to be more 
detailed on that. So, you should
be thinking about loading your 
assets progressively. That means
you could have your textures in 
different sizes or different 
formats depending on what your 
device is capable of doing. And 
you should design for level of 
detail. If there's an object 
near scene that you are only 
going to see two pixels, don't 
make it have a million polygons,
please!  And these are all the 
lessons that we have for free 
from game development. Also, one
other lesson that we are 
actually doing, or that I was 
working on is we do use 
raytracing for calculating light
simulation, for static scenery, 
so the parts of our scenes that 
are static, we use a raytracing 
engine to calculate in the cloud
what is our realistic light, and
then we put it back into the 
rasterization with the real time
stuff. This is a really cool 
workaround. So two takeaways and
then I'm done. Models, 
materials, and light do matter, 
and this one is mostly for 
myself:  I love raytracing, it's
really cool, but are we ever 
going to have it real
time? And we are having cool 
demos on this, but it is still a
question in a is unanswered. 
Thank you very much for 
listening. If there are any
questions, please ask my any 
time. And this is to 
get you started. Amazing 
resources for any computer 
graphics pioneers that would 
like to get started, and really 
to try the engine out for 
themselves. A Frame is the tool 
that I've been showing you if 
you want to play around, and 3D 
IO is what we've been working 
with to provide the models.  
Thanks.  [Applause].  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thank you, Madlaina. It's 
break time. We have 38 minutes 
from now. Everyone has to leave 
here because we're taking down 
that wall. And switching back to
one main hall. So, come back at 
2.50 PM, please.

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; In [Inaudible]. JSCONF.
Solet's talk [inaudible]. Your  
question
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And we are Martin. Martin is 
a mapper, reducer. I just want  
to say this, creator of JSFuck, 
and co-founder of Union Labs, 
and he used to argue  JSCons. 
Martin!  [Applause].  
MARTIN: Is it working? Yes, it's
working. Okay, perfect. Thanks 
for the intro. We're going to 
start quickly with our - this is
about Daedalus. You saw it in 
the description, it's a bit 
scriptic, but you will see a 
pattern here during the talk, 
because we're going to focus on 
some parts of the Greek 
mythology, and we have to have 
the Maze as the labyrinth for 
the topic. Let's
get started, and let's reveal 
the topic. The topic today will 
be creative coding in different 
ways. I talked to many people 
already, and they have different
ideas. I try to cover many 
aspects of creative coding now 
during this talk. The first one 
I'm going to show is quite odd, 
it's - quite old. It's five 
years old. It is things I show 
at JSConf in Berlin five years 
ago. It is some script that is 
1024 characters long, an HTML 
page, and, once you run this in 
a browser, you will see a 
spinning globe inside of that 
page. So, that's something that 
we call a quine, a computer 
programme that outputs its that 
is modifying itself. You can see
this going on. Yes. Another 
thing is this competition just 
ended for 2018, the tenth time 
the JS competition took place 
which is a competition where 
people can do something in 1K of
JavaScript with no external 
resources. I just want to show 
one example because I think it 
is a good fit here, by Johnny 
Jikanga, new on the scene, and 
he created an animation showing 
the northern lights. I picked 
this because we are all waiting 
for this. At least you saw it 
virtually here.
Virtual reality. But I'm really 
hoping to see it the next days. 
It's really cool. You can see 
some strange patterns going on. 
I'm not going to go into the 
detail because we don't have 
much time. They closed the 
competition, and you're able to 
see the demo and see what is 
going on in the background. Yes.
The second topic I want to talk 
about is code golf. Code golf is
a mix of art, sport, and 
programming. Because, you know, 
from the term &quot;golf&quot;, you try to
hit the ball into a hole with 
the at least amount of strokes. 
What you have here is you have a
problem that you try to solve in
the least amount of characters. 
So you're trying to shorten it 
as much as possible. A good 
example here
is this makes Pacman, an old 
game, and like the theme we came
up with was we would like to 
create this Pacman game but with
the least amount of characters 
that we have, and one thing that
you usually start with is reduce
the graphics, so, instead of 
this nice little Pacman icon, we
have an X and a dot. It's like 
you're able to distinguish - you
can see the - 
the dots are the things that 
you're going to collect. The 0 
is the ghost and the X is the 
Pacman.  You can move around,
collect all the dots. It is as 
minimalistic, and the source 
code is only 348bytes long. 
collect all the dots. It is as 
This was maybe two or three 
years ago. It's not using some 
year 6 things, so it could be 
even shorter. Another thing is 
instead of doing something small
with the result, we pick only a 
subset of characters and do 
something big, and it's another 
project I'm famous for,
JSFuck,.js Beep here on the 
stage!  What you can do is you 
can have a web page where you 
can enter your JavaScript, and 
it will output code that you can
check and execute wherever you 
like. It
only takes brackets, braces, 
plus and ampersand as the 
output. And this will be the - 
so quite long, but quite 
interesting to read. I have to 
show this because it's like a 
fundamental principle that we 
are going to see in the next 
example how this works behind 
the scene. So what we are doing 
here is, if we have not an MD 
array, it will be converted into
naughts. If we don't have an MD 
array, we have two, and if we 
have the same, we get the string
falls and the - the stringfalls 
and the string - string false 
true - we can pick several 
cashing degrees out of this 
word. Zero would be a plus in 
the empty area, and we can pick 
out the character T. We've got 
the character R, the character U
and the character E. If we then 
take different words with 
different characters and combine
them, then we can join them 
again, and we can then create 
new words out of this - for 
example, &quot;alert&quot;. That's 
something I call playing 
scrabble with the JavaScript, so
you have basic types, like 
undefined true, objects, also he
undefined, as I mentioned, and 
you can combine these characters
to new
words. One word that is super 
important here is the 
constructor. So we can get the 
constructor as a string. And, if
you then take this constructor 
and place it next to an empty 
array and call constructor 
constructor and then parsing 
something, it is interesting 
because first place will be 
empty area constructor which is 
basically the function, and, if 
you have a function, and then 
take the constructor, then we 
have the function constructor 
which lets us pass the code like
which is basically eval. So you 
can combine this, and like 
execute code without writing it.
Another example that recently 
came up is similar to JSFuck, 
uses the same mechanics, it is 
symmetric - symmetric to 
JavaScript.  The a simple 
example. But, every column that 
you see is symmetric. If you do 
just reroutes here, and the see 
the first row is the words, the 
second row is the character 
index, and the third row is to 
add these characters. Yes, so 
you get this alert again. That's
it for the first part. Was there
something? No. Oh.  Yes, here it
is. As you might have read in 
the description of my talk, I 
used the Daedalus writing and 
the Latin alphabet and the Greek
version. The next part of my 
talk was on different writing 
systems that we have. For 
example, Greek, we have 
Cyrillic, Arabic, Korean, we 
have Hebrew, and then Japanese, 
and the last one. Who knows the
last one? It is A - I created a 
website that is able to convert 
your input last one? It is into 
Arabish JavaScript, and you can 
type not only different symbols,
you could write this as 
Icelandic characters, or runes 
with your axe, you can hammer 
them in, so you get an output 
like this which looks - but it 
is auto -- 
Aurebesh. You can choose 
different symbols, alpha bets, 
then did will all do what you 
want. For example, quite 
interesting to do this, because 
it uses this writing system, the
first ones, once you have this 
on the iPhone or a Mac it will 
crash. While preparing my 
presentation, I had this 
somewhere in the file system, 
and I took some time to get it 
back because I had to install 
some software to not display
it.
This is JavaScript for some 
machines. I like this personally
because it used German words, 
like ja nein,
scnit - this is Aurebesh, you 
might see this in a Star Wars 
movie. You can play around with 
that and make it more graphical,
like only using underscores, 
only using the upper half of the
vertical repeat marker, the 
representation to write 
variables, and to sign them with
other variables. How does it 
work? This is the simple example
where I used the Latin alphabet,
and you see, they are quite 
distributed over code, and, in 
the end, it's the same principle
as I showed you with the JSFuck 
code, so we have strings and 
single characters out of this, 
and then you combine them to get
the constructor, key word, and 
then you also have a way to get 
an alert in there and execute 
that. This is an odd one where 
we use Hebrew. Once you have 
Hebrew words in the code, it's 
funny because browser might 
switch depending on your browser
the writing direction. This code
is not read from right to left 
but from right to left, which is
super interesting in
a way. Next step. We've seen 
these variables and this, some 
interesting ways 
of hiding code. I think it is 
the hangul until if a bet which 
is used in the Korean alphabet. 
They have a filler character. 
This filler character doesn't 
take up any space, and it's 
invisible. But you can still use
this as a variable name in 
JavaScript. So what you have in 
the end is code that looks like 
this, or actually, it is this. 
And it's an odd version, I 
shortened it a bit, so this is 
alert one, and I call it the 
invisible alert. It has some 
character but you can't read 
what's going on here.  Is yes. 
You can do creative things with 
that. When you see triple plus 
signs, there's something where 
it simply adds characters 
together before you can have 
something which looks like a fat
arrow, with the assignment of an
arrow function, or you can put 
backslash backslash into your 
code. It looks like a regular 
comment but it is a regular 
expression. So what I did is I 
combined these two aspects and 
have something that looks like a
comma in
the beginning, and something, a 
bit of ping, empty string in the
centre of the code, you will see
what is going on, and, if I 
reformat this, I put this
into a script, this is the 
source code of an HTML page, and
if I execute, it will show you 
the void in an animated way.
The missing link is here how to 
buy invisible code. This is 
quite easy to do, so you can use
fillers or something from the 
first ASC IoT page that still 
takes up space, but on a second 
ASC IoT page, there
are -- ASC IoT page
 you can wrap them in a string 
and you can have a small snippet
that will - so this is the code 
we're going to use.
We are going to replace every 
third and sixth characters and 
join them
together with the backslash.
To give an example. These are 
some control characters. We get 
this percentage sign in front. 
Numbers. We strip them away, and
then we combine every third and 
sixth characters, and escape 
them, and once we have that, we 
have the other one.. 
Thank you, thank you. It's just 
the beginning!  [Laughter].
Let's go back to the Greek 
mythology. I showed this 
labyrinth - I'm not sure you 
know the different between a 
maze and a labyrinth? The has 
many ways and the - the Maze has
many ways and the labyrinth. The
half man and half bull is eating
boys and girls that enter into 
the labyrinth. What I like here 
is that it has two aspects, it 
is man and also the bull, and 
there is something similar in 
programming which is called 
polyglots, which is a computer 
programme that is written in 
different languages at the same 
time, and depending on the 
compiler, it will execute 
something different.
I thought can we build jpeg, 
HTML and CSS at the same time? I
created this page called 
Inception, and this is when you 
look at it, you have this image 
in
there. We need to go deeper, and
you can see some characters. 
What it does is basically, it's 
like one page with four 
different types in it.
It's hard to explain. I'm trying
my best now. So, what happens is
that the browser opens the
file, and we will run it as an 
HTML page. This HTML page has 
the script with the source to a 
hash. That will force it to load
it to the JavaScript. This 
JavaScript will write a link tag
also pointing to hash and 
interpret it as CSS, and this 
CSS file then has a background 
URL which is empty which also 
takes the same page again, and 
renders this in the browser. 
Okay. Maybe a bit more in the 
detail. We have the HTML which 
is - whenever we open the 
document for the first type, the
content type is an indicator 
what to do with that, so it's an
HTML file. We simply have 
something going on, but the most
important thing is we have to 
attack our own tag called 
inception. And another thing 
where we have a script tag with 
the chart set to lesson one 
which points to the same 
picture. This is now loading the
JavaScript, and you see the 
first variable here is a bit 
strange. It's a bit like - it is
an object with the property 
inception that is with the value
of
TT, and yes, the next line is 
something strange because it 
will multiply inception with an 
object that has a property that 
calls the function URL. So, you 
might see the problem here 
because JavaScript will fail if 
it is not valid, and, in this 
case, it would not be valid 
because it doesn't know the URL 
function, and it doesn't have 
inception as a variable. What we
do later is we see inception and
function URL, and this will 
hoist the thing to the top, so 
it's valid. And then, we have 
some comments that will hide 
code that we don't need but make
sure that it is valid. The most 
important thing here is that 
we're going to write a link tag 
pointing to the same page to 
load the style sheet. So this is
the style sheet now. The same 
page again. The first one is a 
strange selector. So it tries to
find a tag with this strange 
name, and then it has this other
equals sign.
It not defined but it's valid 
syntax. It will want to know 
what is going on here. 
The third line here, this is 
something that is not valid in 
CSS and what is happening in CSS
is that once the browser or once
the browser has found something 
that it is not valid, it will 
break and not execute or follow 
on, so it will only focus on the
second line here which is that 
every tag inside of our 
inception tag will have the 
background URL with the same 
page. Yes. And this now loads 
the same page again. The jpeg.
The most important thing here at
the beginning, and then the 
image data, and everything that 
you see in the green, the
yellow part is metadata that 
will simply be ignored in the 
display. If we look at the hex 
editor, it looks like this, but 
you can zoom in to see what is 
going on, FFE8 FFE1 is the eider
that says that is a jpeg. The 
follow two bytes, they define 
the helpful header side, so they
- the hex header size saying we 
take up the bites to do the -- 
take up the bytes to do the 
thing we want to do. If we look 
at the hex presentation and, for
example, convert it to ACSII, we
can see that this is looking 
similar.SCII, we can see that 
this is looking similar. This is
out of the defined range. As you
remember before, we forced the 
look at 1
one ISO589/1 encoding, and this 
will turn our first hex codes 
into something that is a valid 
JavaScript area, but yep. That's
it. So this is the page that you
will see in the end, and I call 
this Inception. [Applause]. 
Daedalus. Maybe I have to 
explain a bit more, so this is a
odd picture about Daedalus. 
Daedalus, he was the inventor of
the first labyrinth on the 
island Crete, and he was - I'm 
not sure if you know the story, 
son Icaru is who flew too close 
to the son and fell into the 
see. It is a tragic story. But 
what I want to take here is 
later, the one who got into the 
labyrinth and tried to hill the 
Taurus. If you studied computer 
signs, you might have come 
across the project. But what I 
wanted to do is to draw a 
labyrinth, or tool, a maze in 
this case, because it has many 
ways and JavaScript. This is the
lay-out I've chosen, and instead
of walls, I had code. This code 
is also valid. You can copy it, 
and it will output a bigger
maze. To take some
steps further, I first tried to 
minimise it. This is now the 
whole programme that you need to
generate this maze. It's only 
133 bytes and it was originally 
created by EDC65. I don't know 
his real name, unfortunately, 
but I was able to get it down so
we can play around with that. 
During my studies, I came across
a
project called
Tasors where he is known as the 
father of the information 
theory, and he always created 
crazy machines. 
And one example, some people say
the first example of machine 
learning that he created was the
so-called Theseus project and it
had two different phases - the 
training phase and the testing 
phase. It was
all working mechanically in 
1952. He could set up a maze. 
There was a mouse in there, and 
the mouse tried to find
the Maze. So this is the 
exploration strategy, so you 
see, it's bumping against the 
wall, it's moving back, and 
tried to find this. There's the 
second thing. Once it hit the 
goal, wherever you place the 
mouse, it will go straight to 
the goal without bumping against
walls. And what is interesting 
here is the algorithm behind 
because it fits on a sheet of 
paper, and, so sum this up, the 
exploration strategy, it reads 
the direction where it come in. 
It will rotate by 90 degrees, 
move the mouse, and go back if 
there was a wall and do it 
again. It will always try to 
return by 90 degrees, and then 
try to move again. Yes, it is 
the exploration strategy, and 
this has been proved that we 
always find the goal. Once it 
has the goal, it switches to 
something called the goal 
strategy, and it's the same 
thing but without the rotation 
part, and it won't hit any wall.
So it reaches the direction 
where it enters, or last level 
the cell, and it moves the 
mouse, so it will go directly to
do both. And to put this in a 
code, it's only 256 bytes. The 
first part is to create the 
Maze, the second part is to 
solve this maze, and this part 
is only to render the Maze, and 
to see what the output looks 
like, it will draw a maze with 
hashes and the Os. They are the 
way out. It will create a maze 
and also solve
the Maze. An animation to show 
you what is going on. This is 
the representation used in the 
background. This is the more 
visible representation where you
can see the arrows around, and 
always turn them by 90 degrees 
until it finds
the goal. Five minutes left. So 
this talk was all about creating
the different aspects about 
creative coding, how people can 
squeeze code, how they do
visual stuff, and one thing that
is important here and super 
interesting in our language that
we use in JavaScript is the 
community behind, because
everything that you see, you can
look to the source code to see 
what is going on. In the 1980s, 
there was this scene where they 
were trying to hide their 
source, not show how they did 
it, and this switched in the 
JavaScript community, because 
everything was visible, and that
is also a nice slack channel if 
you want to get involved into 
this. Once you have there, you 
have a form to sign up. It was 
established by 
Maxime Auxillere. There are 
discussions coming on. People 
are discussing how to improve 
stuff, and it's super 
interesting. I want to use the 
last two minutes, two and a half
minutes, to show you more
demos.
Another website is popping up, 
and what you can do here is you 
can, similar to JS Bin, so you 
type in some code, and the 
update will be instant once you 
type, and you have exactly 140 
characters to do something. And 
what they also do, they provide 
you with some short cuts. For 
Xenos, you have the capital S, 
you have the access to the 
canvas with a C. There's also 
some savings. You have 140 
characters left to do whatever 
you like. So it's good play 
around. It lists the examples, 
if you can vote on this, and you
can see, for example, a game of 
life. 140 characters. You can 
see a 3D fish swimming in the 
pool. That was something I was 
working on, so we tried to find 
the shortest way to render ocean
waves in only 66 bytes,
and we have wave casting that 
fits on a business card!  . 
We have this crazy tuna going 
on. 
The roller coaster, and really 
crazy example stuff. It is We 
have this crazy tuna going on.  
like code pam, you can discover 
them.
Once you've found something that
is interesting, for example, 
this piece where it will draw 
the ball, so, it is basically a 
bit map
encoder, it draws the ball. You 
can use this to create your own 
forks out of this. I create 
something different here, so I 
had a
spinning globe made
using some formula, and another 
one come up with the spinning 
sphere, and we tried to reduce 
this until we only had 77 bytes,
and I said let's combine this 
one with the bitmap rendering 
which took some time, but, in 
the end, Matthew Henri came up 
with the spinning world in 140 
bytes. He managed to create a 
bitmap that looks like the world
map on a spinning sphere. This 
was not the end, so I tried to 
do something different with 
that, and the in the
end, Chun came up with the 
coloured version of that. It has
some glitches. The one I started
was about 500bytes that you saw 
in the beginning, and this is 
only 140 bytes. You learn a lot 
when you cross these examples 
and read the comments about 
that. 
That's it. Check out Twitter, 
and I also would say it's now 
your turn to be creative. Some 
people ask why is it helpful not
only to learn more about the 
language, so you discover new 
ways of doing things, it also 
helps you to organise codes 
because, in the first place, you
don't compress it, you have to 
lay out the code really nice to 
keep track of it, and one thing 
that is also, you have to focus 
on the problem, and you have to 
break down the problem, and 
really focus on the minimal 
aspect in there, and this is 
something that I always take out
of this, and I want to give this
away to you and say, okay, try 
this out. So, thank you, thanks 
for listening..  
Other examples are my website. I
will tweet about the 
presentation in a minute, and, 
if you download this, examples 
are clickable. It will be 
redirected to the original URL. 
No, it won't break your Mac!  
I'm a good guy. This isn't about
bad security, it is about 
creative fun. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That was amazing. Thank you 
so much. I'm supposed to come up
with questions that I'm so 
mind-blown, I can't think of 
any. I've got one:  if you can 
have dinner with any character 
from Greek mythology, who would 
you pick? 
MARTIN: It's a good question.
Actually, I would have dinner 
with Pathi. He is the nephew of
the Dedelus, but he had a 
nephew, and he taught, he taught
him all the things that he knew,
and then he saw that Padix was 
even better than him, so he was 
the one who created the circle, 
the compass, and the crazy other
things, so Daedelus tried to 
kill him, and he turned into a 
bird, but he was like really 
good. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You must be fun at parties!  
MARTIN: Yeah!  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thanks so much for a great 
talk and lessons in mythology.

higher-level story about webpack
4 meant for our universities, 
meant for us, and so the first 
thing with smaller buildings and
faster buildings. The second was
modernisation. Finally, probably
one of the most important, what 
I mean, all of these are really 
important, and not mutually 
exclusive, which is developer
experience. And if I talk about 
smaller and faster buildings, 
and we try and break it down, 
you can kind of categorise it 
here. So like to have a smaller 
build, you're going to need to 
do more analysis on the
code. 
You're going to have to process 
more of the module graph, and 
for faster buildings, you're 
going to have to do less work 
and reuse existing work that's 
already been done. So these are 
kind of conflicting, but for 
faster buildings, we - builds, 
we rearchitected what a chunk 
is. It's the in-memory version 
of the thing you secreted. We 
added additional features like 
JS. We're going to be using it 
in parallel and caching it out 
of the box. We also modernised a
lot of the pieces that we had in
just old ES5 objects syntax, and
we used to moving maps
and sets.
Significantly, one of the most 
important is the migration of 
our plug-in system. We wrote it 
completely from the ground
up. 
Now, we have what are called 
hooks which are monomorphic 
code, and we lazy-compiled them.
I want to take a moment to 
explain what does this even 
mean? Who here is familiar with
monomorphism or Polly
morp - 
this may look available to prior
to rewriting it. If you see 
here, this method is what 
certain classes in webpack will 
call and plugins are listening 
to this event, and what is 
parsing is an arbitrary event 
stream. It is like an event 
emitter if you've ever used it 
before. The problem is that this
is Polly morphic. It can be any 
amount of arguments. There's no 
way for the JavaScript engines 
to optimise this.
Why don't we get clever and have
single arguments for all of 
them. You can have an infinite 
amount of different event names 
and  Why don't we get clever and
have single argument types that 
you can parse in, so it's 
unmaintainable and not really a 
great contributor experience, so
it's, like, how could we solve 
this where we are creating 
monomorphism functionings - mono
morphic functions but they're 
unique, and we don't have a 
billion of them we don't have to
maintain? We use the technique 
to lazily compile based on what 
is listening to these events. I 
know I'm going a little deep 
here, but it might make more 
sense in a moment. You can see 
at the bottom, we are literally 
just composing a bunch of 
strings that our JavaScript 
compiled to these hooks, and 
then we evaluate it. So a really
great resource if you're 
interested in this, and I will 
try not to butcher the name, 
Egerov wrote a great explain 
article that you can go to and 
take a look at it to understand 
how this Acomb accomplishes 
monomorphic code. You may - you 
may not need Rust and - it turns
out, that looks pretty familiar.
The code that he show cased. 
Look, he's doing the same thing.
So the point is that we can read
this monomorphic code but we're 
doing it evaluatatively or 
lazily compiling it. Please to 
not do it on normal projects. 
There are some parts of webpack 
that execute 19 plumb times on 
large code basis, so everything 
is in the hot path for us. So 
just as Benedict Moyer says, 
don't, please don't do this. 
Please don't do this. So, like, 
what did this
represent to us? 
On most webpack builds, we saw 
it get 98 per cent faster. 98 
per cent of the build time was 
reduced just by people upgrading
to webpack four. 98. [Applause].
And you will be, &quot;John, you're 
lying - Sean, you're lying, 
stop!&quot; It turns out we had 
people reporting reporting six 
hours of webpack 3, nine hours 
and stopped it at 6 on this run.
And so we were like, we have - 
yes, and after the showcasing 
this in the webpack 4 alpha, we 
found 17 minutes - 17 minutes - 
from mine hours. There's the 
URL. You can go to it. I'm not 
lying. And just to make sure, so
that people are, &quot;You're still 
lying,&quot; once we had gotten to 
our release candidacy, I decided
to play a little game to see 
could we get people to upgrade 
to the beta so we can catch 
early bugs, warning signs, 
things like that? Two, it's like
this speed boost, is this for 
real? Yes, I shot this out, and 
like we were seeing 75 per cent.
In some cases, we were seeing 90
per cent, 80 per cent. So it's 
the real
deal. Build speed, to sum it up,
we were able to accomplish that 
first piece in what our goals 
were. Then we still had smaller 
builds. Now we had to do 
something basically opposite to 
what trying to get a faster 
build will do for you. So the 
first thing that we tried to 
implement, and we were able to 
do so, is JSON tree-shaking. If 
you ever used JSON with webpack,
you will notice that, in version
3, it would bundle all the 
pieces you import into it. We 
found out that JSON is just a 
stricter set of what JavaScript 
is, and so we could treat it 
like an atmospheric module, and 
only the pieces that are now use
will actually get - will stay in
your code. In this case, you can
just see, we're pulling in and 
importing one property, and that
is all that compiles when we 
minify
the code. We also have a future.
I will explain the problem 
first. So, according to module 
specification, or the Harmony 
module spec, when you have 
multiple exports inside of a 
file, every single one of them 
has to be evaluated and executed
to ensure that they are not 
creating side effects against 
each other. So what does that 
mean? Well, if low dash is 
exporting from a file 
essentially 1,000 exports, each 
one of them has to be included 
into your
bundle. You can see that here in
this tiny
example. 
We created this trick. We had to
tell the compiler some way there
are no side effects here, you 
can go ahead and ignore those 
properties. So that is what we 
did. We created the side effects
property which now we're asking 
library authors to include in 
their package JSONs because what
webpack will do in production 
mode is it will look for the 
presence of this report, and it 
will simply prune it out. And, 
in fact, it actually makes 
buildings faster when we're in 
the beta stage that we found our
production builds were faster 
than the development mode build 
because of this feature, because
what you're doing is ignoring 
tracing those parts of the - so,
in this case, we thought 
something like in webpack 3, 
200kb of minimised code turned 
actually to 1kb.
So, really all you need to do, 
it's so easy, all you have to do
is just tree-shake, minimise, 
and then package authors had the
side side effect. No!  That's 
ridiculous. You should not have 
to do any of that. That kind of 
gets into what developer 
experience is about. All you 
should have to do is freaking 
run webpack. So out of the box 
now in webpack 4, we default to 
a production mode. All of those 
things you saw in that bullet 
point, they just happened. So 
developer experience to us meant
we need to lower the barrier to 
entry to people who are trying 
these tools for the first time. 
Not everybody understands the 
rigorous and obnoxious history 
of JavaScript modules where they
started and where they are now. 
We also need to have better 
defaults, and thanks to 
libraries like Parcel, we can 
coin something like zero config 
JS. For us, zero config doesn't 
mean doing whatever you want and
shoving it into one package and 
hope in the future you don't use
breaks and cause the major 
breaking change, it means being 
able to actually extend a base 
scenario to your users, so you 
can bring your own zero config 
JS. This is the line that we 
wanted to cross. So, you know, 
by default, you don't need a 
webpack configure to use webpack
4. Every property has been 
defaulted. And what the future -.  What I'm trying to 
say shall not everyone will end 
up ripping up their webpack 
because the power of webpack is 
deeply rooted in how extensible 
we are.
Instead, why don't we extend 
this idea? We created this 
feature called mode. It's a 
property on the config or a flag
that you can pass on the CLI, 
and we default to production, 
like I said. What it represents 
for development is you want to 
have tooling for the browser. 
You're going to want to have 
really fast incremental 
compilation, and you're going to
have better error messages that 
don't take up an entire console.
And then for production, we are 
optimising for size. We are 
optimising for the right kind of
source code, and we are opt 
missing for file paths that are 
understandable but don't leek, 
you know, information - don't 
leak the information to people 
using your website. It also 
means getting rid of things that
really used to cause us 
problems. Webpack 4, it's gone. 
We've replaced it with an API 
that does much of this out of 
the box by default. But on top 
of that, we have properties that
give you more control than 
common chunks did. Then finally,
build speed was something we 
took so seriously, that we 
wanted to be able to profile and
analyse really deeply any 
long-running build. And so, we 
worked with Sam Siconi from 
Google who helped us implement a
special profiler that allows you
to see every plugin and how long
it takes, right inside of the 
DevTools timeline viewer online. 
You. It allows us to say pop in 
a plug-in and send us the event 
in the JSON file. It is really 
useful for those who You. It 
allows us to are creating 
plugins themselves, and trying 
to
analyse interactions. That kind 
of leaves us to the 
modernisation and the 
architecture. Is to so, one of 
the most important things that 
held us back in webpack 3 is 
that we treat everything as a 
JavaScript
module. But we also were 
championed with being able to 
implement web assembly as a 
first-class citizen, giving us 
the opportunity to remove all of
these everything is.js hacks, or
- everything is JS hacks or 
allowed us to WASM and a method 
actual type and enable JSON, and
we are now working on HTML and 
CSS module types. We had to 
remove from our module factories
what we call them all the code 
generation systems that were 
specific to JavaScript, and we 
isolated it. And so now, with 
web assembly as a first-class 
module type, you have code like 
this. This is a newer library 
called Walt. It is a
subset of TypeScript. It allows 
you to write a JavaScript-like 
syntax, as you see at
the top, is it and all you have 
to do is import it like a 
JavaScript module into your 
code. You have used web assembly
without doing anything else at 
your fingertips. .  This is probably 
one of the most exciting things 
to me is that you want to use A 
Frame or you want to use these 
things. Now, what these library 
authors can do is instantly 
compile a web assembly module, 
and, if it's available in the 
package, webpack will consume 
that instead of the JavaScript. 
So you get the 10x speed-up 
instantly at your fingertips. So
the other pieces were dropping 
Node 4, so that is no longer 
supported for webpack and Node 6
is our minimum version. But this
allowed us to convert the rest 
of the code base to using ES6 
features. It allowed our code to
be more readable. Easier to 
change. Using syntax that people
understand and contributors 
actually want to leverage. And 
now, you know, by using this new
code, V8 has a great test bench 
for optimising paths that aren't

I'm going to ask something of 
you. Everyone in this room, I 
would appreciate it if you would
take your phones out and hold 
them in your hands. You can do
turned
it!  Pass your phone to the 
person
on your right. Look at that 
phone, feel it, recognise
it, but you almost can't do 
that, right? Because you're on 
your right. Look at that phone, 
feel it, so distracted thinking 
about your phone in someone 
else's hands. 
Oh, it's awful!  It's just 
awful!  And the thing that I 
want to bring up here is that 
the reason that we feel this way
is that our phones are now an 
extension of ourselves. These 
phones become who we are, and 
our connection to that data. 
Pete Spark makes this point when
he talks about designing for 
human computer interaction, 
which we will talk a little bit 
about today when he talks about 
our relationship with 
technology, but we're going to 
talk about it with a different 
stint. We're not going to talk 
about the device itself but how 
we relate to the peck logical 
advances. You can pass the 
phones back now!  There are a 
lot of different takes about 
living our lives increasingly 
online, and, if you're in this 
room, chances are, as we adopt 
things digitally, you got 
excited. We were thinking about 
all the things that we could 
build or make, and carriosity 
for how we can represent 
ourselves online.. We have geocities which
is like a bastion of internet 
explosion. I can't make 
something this good. 
Nobody can. That's just it. We 
reached the pinnacle right at 
the beginning. Then MySpace. 
Everyone was friends with Tom, 
and in putting this talk 
together, I revisited mine which
was a time capsule to terrible 
bangs, weird old art pictures, 
and weird pictures of me in a 
bathroom. I don't know. It was a
phase. Some people might not 
have started developing with 
dragon ball Z but they started 
because they wanted to be elite 
hackers so good at programming 
that their fingers were 
literally on fire. Whatever our 
interests were, the internet 
allowed us to explore and share 
our lives and express ourselves 
in creative, bizarre, 
interesting, and unique ways 
that only a collectivity of 
humans could imagine. But the 
only constant is change. Soon, 
we had so many ways of being 
represented online, and so many 
people were online, that we 
needed to automate these tasks. 
We need something that could 
analyse, build, manage, and sort
for us. And, as things become 
more complicated, what we 
realise is all of our lives 
become summations of these 
digital models. We become pieces
of someone else's algorithms 
which means we could be 
summarised in a single way. So, 
people are starting to use 
search engines rather than 
libraries or teachers to make 
sense of the world we're 
inhabiting. These inaccuracy 
started to be reflected in what 
we learn and believe in. They 
become our societies and our 
education. Tech can be super 
magical in this way, right? It's
such a cool thing that we can 
all be here together for the 
same reason in Iceland. But just
like any other software we 
write, the more magic it 
contains, the more it can
fail. 
I'm Sarah Drasner, and I work or
Microsoft. Today's talk is 
called Live and Machine Learn. . 
In this talk, we will explore 
the paradigm shift that 
machine-learning brings and do 
that through how machine 
learning works. We don't have a 
tonne of time to go into it, but
we're going to talk about 
challenges to democracy through 
machine-learning. We are also 
going to talk about 
machine-learning for good. 
Machine-learning does a lot of 
cool things, and we're going to 
talk about those too. We're 
going to talk about some of the 
practical tech that we all know,
so not necessarily 
machine-learning but how we can 
make a difference with some of 
the things that we know today. 
Let's talk on a high level about
what machine-learning is and 
kick it off by the quote from 
the fellow who coined the term: 
machine learning gives computers
the ability to learn without 
being explicitly proceeding. We 
are programmers, we're familiar 
with if-then statement. What if 
the conditions for these 
statements become complex? I 
mean really complex? If you're 
building a programme to 
understand that this is a pug, 
and this is a kitten, you don't 
necessarily want to programme an
if statement for every single 
pixel here, or the possibility 
for every pixel for every single
pug photo. That's not how our 
brains work, right? How do you 
programme it? You want to teach 
it a certain puliness. You want 
your model to learn the essence 
of the pug. So, in truth, there 
are a few ways of doing this. 
Sometimes, like the example 
above, we can tag a set of data 
and your model will use this 
supervised data set to 
distinguish between these 
classes and this will help it 
learn better. This is called 
supervised machine learning. But
there are other times where we 
don't really know the answer, so
if I asked a computer what those
pugs would look like if bred 
together with Stegosauruses, 
that's not really a thing!  So, 
there's nothing we can check 
against. That's when we will use
an unsupervised process. But 
let's dive into supervised 
process because it's the east to
explain in the time we have, and
it's also pretty common. Within 
supervised machine learning, 
there are thousands of 
algorithms that you could use, 
and among those convolutional 
neuronetworks are probably the 
most popular, but genetic is the
easiest to understand, so we're 
going to use that to kind of 
discuss things on a
high level today. Let's explore 
a simple toy model. In order to 
make a pug kitten-sorter, we 
build an algorithm that builds 
algorithms. It will build many 
of these and they will do their 
best to sort these, and do their
best sorting. At first, they 
will be bad at it. They will be 
terrible. But, we have another 
function that will check this, 
and they will check it against 
that tagged data, and, for every
kitten and pug scenario, so the 
ones that get it wrong, they are
thrown away, and the ones that 
get it right, circle back to the
builder, and then the builder 
starts using those to create new
builders. Now, this might seem 
hackie and imperfect, and that's
because it is. If we did this 
once, twice, or three times, it 
would fail, but we do it 
thousands of times. We don't do 
it for a small amount of 
conditions, either. We build up 
all of the gradients that make 
up an eye, and then we match it 
up against all of the other ice 
that we know of, and then we 
match that against the 
likelihood of snouts. Our own 
classification system,
genus et cetera is composed of 
this set of rules. The part I 
want you to remember is this 
moving forward.
The point where we check, you 
can see how that is a very 
important part of this. We have 
to check if we want to get the 
data right. We must do so, and 
keep on checking. Another really
important part here is if I only
gave these pug pictures that it 
was fed on, that would be 
correct, right? These are all 
pugs, but what might happen is 
that it might fail when it's 
trying to find our one true pug.
So the type of data that we 
train on is really vital to 
whether or not we have an 
accurate model. Okay. So let's 
explore some ways that 
machine-learning has failed but 
I'm going to call this section 
the road to hell is paved with 
good intentions. None of what 
I'm showing this here today is 
made with the idea of corrupting
society. Quite the opposite. All
of these are really 
well-intentioned examples. But 
their failure is good for us to 
explore so that we don't fail in
the future. So let's say you 
need to patrol a city but you 
don't have enough patrol units 
completely to cover this city. 
So it might make sense to figure
out where all the crime is 
happening. And just have some 
patrol units that focus on the 
areas of most activity. But the 
problem is, not all crime is 
equal. To get enough data, you 
have to include nuisance crimes 
in which no-one is hurt like 
homelessness or pan-handling 
with the violent crimes like 
rape and murder but they don't 
tend to be clustered in this 
way. It takes a lot more data to
build an area which is why the 
nuisance data is included. 
Another issue that those 
nuisance data areas tend to be 
the poor areas. What ends up 
happening is you get more patrol
areas in the poor areas, and 
then we have more data on those 
patrol areas, and we get into 
this weird feedback loop where 
we're just patrolling those and 
then the rapes and murders that 
happen in the affluent areas 
start not to be reported. This 
is what the software does in the
United States, and it's an 
example of sample bias, in
machine learning. We found once 
you're a criminal, you're likely
to become a criminal again. A 
lot of people keep re-offending.
They found the reason people do 
this is that they find it hard 
to fit back into society once 
they're in jail. Another thing 
is that employment becomes more 
difficult because you have to 
disclose that you were once in 
jail on your employment forms, 
and then people are less likely 
to employ you. But here's an 
important part. Employment tends
to be the number-one indicator 
of whether you're going to end 
up back in prison. Even the 
analysis of who ends up in the 
system uses machine-learning, 
so, when most defendants are 
booked in jail, they respond to 
a questionnaire fed into a 
system that defines the risk 
level for used in the length of 
their sentencing. Whether you're
in for a short amount of time or
a long amount of time. An 
evaluation of more than 10,000 
of these people found that the 
risk scores showed a startling 
difference. Black defendants had
scores pretty evenly matched 
across the board - one meaning 
no, and then you have a very 
long sentence, whereas the white
risk assessments look quite 
different:  many are assessed at
1, steadily decreasing to very 
few at 10. You might say what if
that is just valid data? Except 
upon analysis, it is not really.
The studies showed that blacks 
were twice as likely to be 
labelled higher risk and not 
re-offend, while their white 
counterparts labelled not as 
risky. If we look at this in 
human terms, we see James
Ravelil - Ravelli had a 
aggravated assault, drug 
tasking, and he subsequently did
re-offend. Robert canon had one 
petty theft. There are more too.
Lu go. O, low risk at one. 
Mallory Williams, medium risk at
6. Lugo had three DUYs, Williams
had two misdemeanours and never 
offended again. This is just a 
couple of them. There's a lot. 
These kind of algorithms don't 
just affect black people, 
either. A construction worker 
who sold a piece of equipment 
and sold it for parts low on 
cash, since then, he's been 
going to church and volunteering
but says his risk score doesn't 
indicate any of the ways he is 
bettering himself as a person 
and therefore not a good 
indicator of whether or not he's
going to offend again. What 
makes Compus fail as a 
machine-learning algorithm? One 
is that it has no transparency. 
You make the algorithm, and then
they are sending it out. 
Basically be the people who are 
using it don't know how it 
works. Another thing is, because
of this, because of that 
relationship, it doesn't adapt 
over time. Remember, we talked 
about how important that step of
adapting is. And related to 
these things, people use it 
without any question. Another 
question that might be asked at 
this time is whether this is a 
good place for machine-learning 
algorithms. Machine-learning 
algorithms are super powerful 
and really wonderful but 
sometimes, this should be in the
hands of a judge. Here's the 
main thing about 
machine-learning algorithms:  we
try to be predictive of the 
future but machine-learning 
algorithms can really only 
evaluate the past. So, Brennan, 
one of the co-creators of this 
technology didn't build the 
technology with the idea of the 
use for sentencing. That's the 
strange thing about some of this
tech. Once you put it in the 
world, adoption can be beyond 
us. Anyone who maintains an 
open-source project will say 
that sometimes you put something
out in the world, and the way 
people use it is totally 
different than the way you 
intended or the way you had 
foreseen. This is why it is 
critical for these types of 
technologies to be transparent 
in order not to be abused. They 
can't be magical. People will 
say algorithms can't be biased. 
But algorithms are written by 
people. So this doesn't always 
happen to criminals, it happens 
to us too. Machine-learning is 
now incorporated into a lot of 
the tools that we use every day,
and a lot of our internet 
experience is built off 
machine-learning algorithms. 
Axiom had an average 1,500 data 
points, including the entire 
adult population of the United 
States. That was in 2012. And 
that is just
one company. So, using a Chrome 
extension called What Facebook 
Thinks you Like, I could find 
some of the ways the system has 
tagged me. If you follow me on 
Twitter, you know some of these 
things like software developer, 
and the cloud computing, like 
dogs, like wine to strange, and 
like kind of falls, so, mermaid,
I don't know, trench coats, I've
never read a James Paterson 
book, and it got my
political proclivities wrong. 
Facebook use these types of tags
to drive directed ads. 
You can see that you can use 
these ads to target on different
demographics, including race. 
And a couple of years ago, 
people could show you different 
houses that you could buy 
depending on these demographics,
depending on race. This is 
illegal under the Software 
Housing Act of 1968 but here's
the thing:  once that was 
pointed out to Facebook, they 
fixed it. This is a major theme 
here. It is not to make software
that never fails - that's 
impossible. Every 
machine-learning algorithm can 
have a failure, but once it does
fail, you have to course-correct
and change things. And another 
problem with this that you might
have already thought about is 
that you don't tell Facebook 
their race. They are targeting 
based on ethnic affinity which 
is used by the same algorithm 
that thinks I'm into mermaids. 
So I'm not coming down on 
Facebook in particular. This is 
a problem with all 
machine-learning algorithms used
by every company. So the issue 
with this, and what you might 
have guessed, is that everything
you're seeing is filtered, and 
that filtration system can be 
fallible at best, and illegal at
worst. It might not mean houses,
it can also mean that the things
and the studies that you're 
seeing, and educational material
that you are seeing is based on 
what you already believe, which 
like that patrolling system that
we saw earlier was 
self-reinforcing. I've 
personally seen this. At one 
point I worked for a company 
that was starting to use machine
learning. They proposed an idea 
to surface content based on 
Demme graphics. I had happened 
to read up on that issue, Mabel 
that it wasn't legal, and - 
mainly that it wasn't legal. 
They brought it up to people 
saying this could introduce 
bias. Here's an important part. 
I was just a regular engineer on
that project. I wasn't a data 
scientist, and I wasn't a PM. I 
wasn't the person shaping that 
project. I was just carrying 
things out. Without raising my 
hand, we might have shipped that
feature to some really bad 
consequences. It's not that 
digitising the world is 
inherently bad but the more 
technology becomes embedded in 
all aspect of life, it matters 
whether the technology is 
biased, alienating or harmful. 
These tales are dark but 
machine-learning offers us a lot
of amazing benefits as well, as 
my brilliant co-worker said:  it
is like the risk we take every 
time we get into cars or 
aeroplanes. They've completely 
transformed every aspect of 
life, and made things possible 
that wouldn't be possible 
before. They're inherently 
dangerous, and they can be 
seriously misused. Think about 
it. I wouldn't be on this stage 
if it wasn't for aeroplanes, and
some of you wouldn't be here in 
the same room. That's amazing. 
But people have used aeroplanes 
as weapons so we have a certain 
respect for it. Now that I've 
bummed everyone out, let's 
explore some of the wonderful 
applications for 
machine-learning and what we can
do with it. As I mentioned, I 
worked for Microsoft, and we 
have a thing called cognitive 
services. It is a specific API 
called the emotion API. It 
allows us to analyse things like
pictures and videos and see what
emotion it detects from what the
computer sees. It can be used to
make things like this which I 
built in 3.js which has no 
practical application except 
entertaining my four-year-old
stepdaughter. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; [Video] wow!  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Cute. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yes, there's stuff up there,
huh? Okay. Pretty magical, to 
tell you the truth. What if we 
put this to a more useful use. I
was mentoring a blind woman and 
she mentioned to me she left out
of conversations on Twitter 
because the photos didn't have
alt text. I used another 
cognitive services offering, the
computer vision API which will 
not only analyse a photo but 
also its content like words. To 
show how this works, we will 
dive briefly into some of the 
code. We will get the image from
the user. I'm using view of js 
here. You can see here we are 
using Acxios for a six call and 
use the cognitive services to 
analyse that image. We will do 
so in a couple of different 
ways. One to see what the image 
contains, and one to check for 
text within the image, and then 
we will dynamically add the alt 
text to the image. I'm building 
a chrome extension is to that 
blind people can use it on any 
website. This application of 
machine-learning can help bring 
more people into the 
conversation conversation, and 
broaden our reach. It is not 
perfect but headed in a really 
good direction, where all of a 
sudden, people who are left out 
of the story can now be part of 
it, and that is the amazing 
thing, that, by being inclusive,
you're meeting business goals. 
It doesn't mean you're excluding
people in the centre, it means 
that you're reaching a larger 
audience. There are all sorts of
ways that other people can use 
machine learning in medicine 
too. So one of these is Sophia 
Genetics is diagnosing diseases 
through DNA analysis. Another 
one dear to my heart is that it 
is a social cure for cancer 
patients, patients enter 
diagnosis and treatment so they 
can be analysed. Doctors can't 
just report every single patient
that they have, and they can't 
read every single study, either,
so if you have all of these 
people reporting what treatments
they used, whether or not they 
are surviving well, then all of 
a sudden this machine-learning 
can pick up all of that data, 
and we can become much smarter 
in finding cures
for cancer. 
Health map algorithms spotted an
Ebola outbreak nine days before 
it happened. Nine days is an 
incredible amount of lead time 
for an outbreak. Outbreaks grow 
exponentially. By Mark-learning 
we reduced the number of those 
affected from here to here. 
That's amazing. You might be 
saying to yourself this is all 
well and good, but I'm not a 
data scientist, and I don't work
with machine-learning. But 
that's okay. This subject about 
how technology can shape our 
lives is really broad. It 
doesn't necessarily have to be 
machine-learning. Let's talk 
about some of the things that we
as web developers can do now 
today with what we already know.
We work every day on building 
applications for so many 
different use cases, so what if 
we take some of the more generic
tools that we have and put them 
to tasks where we can maybe help
save lives? So, there's a fire 
house near where I live, and 
they have some sufficiently 
complex systems to make sure 
that everything is online and 
functioning. I went out to their
station, and I asked them a few 
questions about how everything 
works, and to see if there was 
anything that I could do that I 
might help. Here's what I 
learned:  when the truck goes 
out, it has to communicate with 
a dispatcher, which will help 
facilitate if they need more 
water, supplies, or back-up, and
the app is really simple kind of
purposefully so because they 
want everyone to be able to use 
it quickly at a glance, and 
there are not that many things 
that they might need. What they 
created was really perfect. But 
I asked a few questions 
including what happens if they 
are all of a sudden offline? 
What if they can't -- 
communicate. Right now, they're 
hosed - get it, firemen!  
Terrible!  Okay, here is our 
opportunity. What I created was 
a simplified version of their 
app preserving the basic layout 
but made use of service workers 
and background to alert them 
when they're offline, to cue the
messages, and, back up, to back 
up, even if the browser tab is 
closed. Here's what the 
application looks like. If we 
click on water, it registers - 
the sync is registered but if we
go off Wi-Fi, it will tell them 
they're offline, and I could 
even close out that browser tab,
go back, and then we can turn 
the Wi-Fi back on. And then the 
sync is registered and what we 
requested before is then sent 
out. So the enquires thing -- 
and the request is sent out. 
We're going to do that with 
massive greater.online and 
register a service worker when a
request is made. You can't just 
add it was a method in your app.
It has to be in a different 
JavaScript file. This is 
important if you want to 
integrate it. One thing about 
this is that you're kind of 
throwing it over the wall. It is
almost like communicating with 
the server, so you're throwing 
things at it, and it is throwing
things back. We're going to pass
in the type of event that was 
triggered so we can submit or 
cue what the user requested. We 
will do some error-handling. 
After we've activated and 
installed the service worker, we
will strip out the type from the
event tag and process a fetch 
when it gets to connectivity. In
that function, we will fetch the
URL which is a placeholder 
server in this case and check if
the response has happened. Once 
it has, we will send a message 
back to the client with 
post-message, so we will send 
the response and the type of 
resource that was requested. And
after that, we can alert the 
user when it is finally
sent. 
But the most important part of 
the demo isn't the service 
workers. It is where we started.
I went to the fire house, and I 
asked them questions. And there 
are a lot of times where I 
wasn't sure if I could help 
them. By asking questions about 
what happened in any kind of use
case and any kind of scenario, I
finally found something that 
they could use to help for. We 
have to ask questions. We have 
to ask questions in the 
beginning, like the firehouse 
demo. We have to ask questions 
like when it is
deployed for criminal spots. We 
have to keep evaluating the 
systems and where they're going 
and make purposeful decisions to
help people and course-correct 
when we don't. I feel a lot of 
tech that asks questions how to 
make our lives more comfortable,
which I appreciate, I make apps 
on the weekend, this is a 
cocktail finder I built that 
just finds me cocktails, okay? 
But it seems to me that a 
disproportionate amount of 
projects focus inward rather 
than outward, focused on serving
people with money instead of 
asking people if they need help.
There are a lot of opportunity 
out there to help, and you might
already have the skills to do 
so. It just takes a little bit 
of imagination and exploration, 
and it really pay off. What I 
want you to think about going 
forward is this:  that I truly 
believe that you have some of 
the brightest minds of our 
generation. As you move forward 
building applications for the 
web, you're building the pillars
and blocks that our society 
rests on. You're crafting the 
shape of our digital life. This 
could mean building new 
features, advocating for 
accessibility, and this could be
as simple as raising your hand 
when something isn't right. It 
is not just your job to create 
these things and do as you're 
told, it is your job to ask are 
we building things correctly, 
building the right things, and 
are we building them well for 
all of the digital lives that 
we've touched? Thank you.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thank you very much. I 
learned so much. I know the 
majority of the time when we are
working on some tool, or, I 
mean, products, tools, whatever,
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thank you very much. I 
learned so much. we can't really
tell whether it is leaning 
towards the more evil side of 
things sometimes. Like what what
are the questions we can ask 
ourselves and our team-mates to 
kind of, you know, be able to 
know, like, whether what we are 
doing is ethical? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yes, I mean, just asking the 
question is the first step. For 
a lot of these things, what I 
mentioned before is not saying, 
like, you're going to build 
software the first time that 
never fails, it's never going to
happen, but revaluating the 
systems that you're building 
them or asking the questions, 
even if the answer is no, it's 
probably fine but just asking 
those questions upfront about 
where things are going. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thank you so much. That was 
our last talk! 
[Cheering and Applause]. Oh, my 
God. I can't believe it's almost
over. I found my suit. I think 
they saw that Sean - they saw 
that Sean told me I could tweet 
him, and he would help me, and 
so I guess they, like, I can 
help her, you know, make faster 
applications. 
I'm like cool. I'm good!  So. 
Yes. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That makes total sense. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Anyway, so we have our panel 
coming up, and we're going to be
talking up here on stage, and 
answering some of your questions
that you asked, some of the 
panellists. It is still up 
online, so, if you go to 
slido.com and then enter jsconf 
as the event code. You can still
ask questions and vote on 
questions that you care about 
that we
can ask. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. Great. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I think we're going to take a
quick break to set up. Five 
minutes. We can get people up 
here on the stage.  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Don't stray too far. Come 
back in five minutes! .

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You know.  don't really I
you [Laughter].  Sorry, pass if

want.  want. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; [Inaudible]. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Sounds like you're doing 
David AllenGTD in the next 
actual item. That's something I 
just subscribed to, or 
proscribed to. Like, when you 
have something you need to 
accomplish, just write down the 
next actionable thing that you 
can do, and you constantly 
Whittall away at it until you've
completed something. And the 
list when I'm at home, and the 
list when I'm in my email, like 
the list when I'm on Twitter 
doing DMs. But then also, I 
would say, like, there's another
part of that GTD method which is
like do defer or delegate. If 
it's not your top priority, I 
mean, if you can do it in less 
than two minutes, just do it. If
you can't, defer it to when it 
is appropriate, and if, like, 
whether people like to hear it 
if it is not worth their time, 
then delegate to somebody else 
who is more suited for it. 
Otherwise, like ask people for 
help. So people like ask how do 
you do things all the time. I'm 
usually drowning in people and 
calling up for help. We really 
rely on other people around us 
in the community to help us get 
things done for webpack. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I don't feel like I have a 
great answer to this question. 
Like I have something that is 
like, trying to understand 
things, like those things that 
like together, really nicely. 
And just like I care a lot about
what I do. I mean, that sounds 
very, very generic, but it is 
true, and like that's why I 
can't keep doing - I can keep 
doing node for such a long time.
I've never worked on a project 
for more than a year or 
anything, and it's like -

next question was specifically 
for Anna but could be for 
everyone as well. Anna, what is 
a good entry-level way to get 
involvedprivate. The with the 
Node project. It seems everyone 
here is active with the 
different open-source project, 
so I think generally, what's a 
good entry-level way to get 
involved with an 
open-source project? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You can have my
mic. It's like - 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It is like, for Node 
specifically, there's this 
awesome website, it's called 
nodetodo.org. I'm so glad he is 
around Node, and he maintains a 
list of good first contributions
for
Node. And yeah, if you're 
interested doing that, that's a 
really good starting point. You 
can also like try to talk to me 
and I will find something for 
you. And yes, you might want to 
like, if you have something that
you're especially interesting in
in Node, that might be a good 
thing to do, just message me, 
otherwise go to nodetodo.org. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I should say figure out what 
drives you and what gets you out
of bed every day if you want to 
contribute to something? Take 
that skill and apply it to the 
project if it is applicable. 
Most times, it is going to be. 
When I started contributing to 
webpack or even joined the core 
team, I had one commit to the 
project, and that's it. And I 
had zero following on Twitter, 
so all I would do is go on 
Twitter, and search webpack. And
I responded to every single
tweet. That's it. Like I 
literally did that, because, at 
the time, I had worked in 
technical support, and I worked 
with people, and so it is an 
easy way for me to provide value
that's totally in my wheel-house
before speaking, doing 
documentation, before any of it.
Usually, like when people ask me
this question, I usually end up 
losing them to a different 
project like Babel or React 
because they're like I like 
working on V-dom instead. I 
always say understand what you 
love to work on. That to me is 
what open source is about, that 
you are working on things that 
really drive you, and then 
making the world better because 
everybody else depends
on it. 
Then also to quote Dan Abramov 
on Twitter, another advice is 
like code seems intimidating, 
just start at the most familiar 
place, and then branch out. I 
think that is like pseudo 
quoting!  Start somewhere where 
you can understand and read and 
go further. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I still don't understand like
50 per cent of code in
React!  I would say that, like, 
since I work in the Reacted 
team, I should say something 
about React, and I would say 
that maybe React itself is not 
the most easily accessible 
project to contribute to because
there is like, it is even hard 
for us to contribute to it just 
because it is so, like, large 
and complex in terms of what it 
needs to do and how you need to 
think about all those features 
behaving well together. And 
we're trying to improve the 
documentation but it is pretty 
hard. But I think there is an 
ecosystem, and like the way I 
think one of the first 
contributions that I did before 
I was on the React teem, I - 
team, I was working on a
project like a web app, and I 
needed routing, and I saw this 
project called React Router but 
the problem was it didn't 
support, so when it switched 
between different pages, I think
it would always crawl to the top
- 
scroll to the top, but I had an 
interface where I had tabs 
inside my app and I didn't want 
them switching tabs to scroll to
the top. I sent
a VR to implement this 
behaviour, and they've since 
removed that code and made it 
work differently. I think it is 
important as you don't have to 
come to the open source with the
mind set of where can I start 
contributing? 
You can build your own stuff 
that you need for your app but 
have this mind set that this 
application code, it's not 
something that is packaged and 
given to you, and you can't 
tweak it. It is just code 
reading by other people. It has 
hacks, it is not super fast, 
maybe didn't spend optimising 
it. It might lack important 
features, and, if you come with 
this mind set of this code could
as well have been written by me,
then you can see, here's how I 
can improve it. Here is the 
thing that I need for my app. 
Just try to add it,
and it is often very small 
things that are valuable. Maybe 
that helps. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I think there are really good
ideas in here. There's a couple 
of small things like a lot of 
GitHub repos have helped wanted,
good first-issue labels. You can
definitely explore those. There 
are other ways to contribute 
too, like speakers need people 
to practise with, if you know 
somebody else that is giving a 
first-time talk, or you can help
mentor them in that way, or you 
can mentor people doing peer 
programming. It doesn't 
necessarily have to be your 
first commit or something like 
that. If you're interesting in 
doing first commit, I think 
reading through the issues and 
getting a sense of where things 
are most valuable, reading 
before committing is really 
helpful because then you kind of
can see like what is going on in
whole project, what people are 
most focusing on, what people 
are having a hard time with. 
Taking some information in 
before adding things, and I 
guess the last thing I would say
is don't have your first commit 
be huge. Like, it is really hard
to get a commit in that is 
gigantic because maybe you have 
a piece of it that is great and 
some other part, they can't use 
it, and you've got to have a 
million comments back and forth 
on your PR. The first time you 
commit something, maybe pick a 
small thing that you can work 
on, more likely to get it. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I also just realised that 
another very helpful - Sarah put
it, you don't have to make 
commits your first contribution.
I think what a lot of projects 
really need, and that includes 
React, is just somebody helping 
people out and the issues. For 
example, I - so, when I started 
working with JavaScript, I have 
a file, so the first things that
I try to do was just, I was 
reading questions that people 
would post, and I tried to 
answer them, even though I don't
really know the things, so I 
would research that question for
them, and try to figure it out, 
and, if I have after solution, I
would post it. That really 
helped my learning. I think you 
can do the same with any 
projects you care about. You can
go to the section, see someone 
posted the bug, try to reproduce
it, debug, maybe suggest you use
this thing wrong, or maybe 
there's an actual bug and you 
could add more details from 
somebody somebody from the team 
to help fix that bug. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; One more weird anecdote story
off of that which is really 
cool. There is a guy that works 
with me who is like LinusBorg on
GitHub, and he actually isn't a 
programmer for everyday life, he
does a completely different job,
and he's got a hobby of 
contributing to open source, and
he's on the core team. The way 
he started was he went through, 
and he read a bunch of view 
code, and then started answering
forum questions, and he did that
for a really long time until we 
were like, &quot;Why aren't you on 
the core team?&quot;  He's built 
libraries and things like that, 
but I think that's such a great 
example and hopefully he's on 
the stage telling the story, 
because I think that's such a 
cool thing that you can kind of 
start off answering questions 
and then eventually know the 
system so well that you're a 
core contributor. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; A lot of really good ideas 
there. I hope to see more people
after this conference, go home -
not tonight, because a party 
tonight. Go home, and make at 
least one contribution to one 
open-source project. That would 
be great. I think we should wrap
it up. Yeah. Any last words
of advice? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; If I'm allowed to criticise 
GitHub a little bit, I think it 
would be great - so one of the 
people contributions to 
open-source is selfish, which is
fine. If people want to show off
as contributors and have that in
their profile, but as far as I 
know, even if you spend two 
years responding to issues and 
helping people, you still don't 
show up as a contributor on that
project, so if GitHub could 
change that, that would be 
really great. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Also, if GitHub, if you're 
listening!  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We have at least two GitHub 
employees here!  I would really 
love a pay-to-support
button. 
For webpack and things - I do 
support webpack and other 
projects but I would love to buy
someone a coffee or do something
really quick to help support 
people, so, that would be really
awesome. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; There are egg balls on their 
product it'll. She wrote a paper
about open-source funding, and 
that's how she ended up at 
GitHub. She's on their product 
team now. That could be a thing 
in the future. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Are you listening Nadia? Yes.
Final remarks. I would say - I 
said it in my talk, and, like, 
I'm trying to destroy the idea 
of JavaScript fatigue. I know we
have everyday jobs and we need 
to get them done, but it's 
really important that we 
understand and embrace change, 
especially with JavaScript. This
language changes so much. And 
so, we do it at Microsoft, it is
part of our growth mind set. 
Understanding and adapting to 
different changes makes you more
dynamic as a programmer, or just
a human being in general. We're 
not saying you have to use the 
latest technologies but embrace 
what they are, and take five 
minutes out of your day to 
understand what they are, what 
they do, and what they 
accomplish. Look at the 
patterns, and how they can be 
used in the things that you do
every day. That way, your 
everyday work doesn't feel 
frustrated. Embracing the 
JavaScript Renaissance is fun, 
but struggling with JavaScript 
fatigue, nobody wants to do 
that. I think that it is really 
important that you change the 
mind set. If I were to ask 
anything of you all, it's to 
consider trying it. If it 
doesn't work, tell me I'm wrong 
on Twitter and show me this 
screen capture. Yeah. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So I think I have two notes. 
One is something I talked about 
at this conference was, if you 
think that some software product
could do something better, that 
you're using like Node, or 
webpack or anything, and you 
find a way to work around that, 
that's cool, but maybe file an 
issue. Because, like, if you're 
running into that problem like 
100 other people will at least, 
and you have a chance to make 
their lives easier. Take that, 
and the other thing is it's like
a lot of these questions that 
were kind of like how to be 
successful in open scores. Or at
least some of them were, and one
of the things that helps me a 
lot is doing completely 
different stuff, like that has 
nothing to do with coding at 
all. Like, your brain needs that
- you can't work without that. 
It's take a lot of time to do 
different stuff. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Awesome, thank you so much to
Dan, Sarah,
Sean, and Anna. And thank you so
everyone on
this panel. That was a great 
discussion. I'm sure we could 
have heard more questions and 
answers. I've learned a lot from
all of
you combined. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Don't cry. Stop it!  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And also, thank you to the 
organisers. I think we should 
wrap up and get to the closing, 
and, yes. Thank you. Thank
you so much. [Applause]. 
still We  closing don't leave 
have the
remarks. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We've come to the end of our 
two-day event. It's been super, 
wonderful. Who enjoyed the
whole thing?
[Cheering and Applause]. 
I just want to take my time to 
thank all the organisers for 
doing all of this. They've 
worked so hard. They behind the 
scenes. Everything is running so
smoothly up here, but like 
sometimes, they're dealing with 
so much stuff, I just want to 
thank them and give them a round
of applause because they've been
so amazing. [Applause]. 
So, yeah, we've come to the end.
And it's, I mean, really sad. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Sad face. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But we're not going to let 
this get
to us. We are here for jokes. 
Those who can't see, it says 
roses are red, violets are blue,
unexpected line, unexpected 
basket on line
32. 
And to those who can see it, 
yes, I programme in Java, I've 
been stuck at this enterprise 
job for the last five years, I'm
slowly deteriorating, this isn't
a meme, it is a legitimate call
for help!  It's cut off. But 
there's another one. Anyway, 
we've really enjoyed this, and 
what do you think of it? 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It's been wonderful. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Best time ever. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I feel like we feel like John
Snow on that one. It was really 
fun who made that photobooth. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The helmets were way too big 
for my head. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It was heavy. It didn't fit 
my head as well. Iceland is so 
great but I decided to change my
name. I want it more Icelandic 
sounding. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So my dad's name is
Orlando. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So I think I'm technically 
Orlando's daughter, so that is 
my name now!  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Is it even approved by the 
naming committee? I think they 
have strict rules. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The website of the list of 
approved names by the Icelandic 
naming committee. I picked the 
ones that were closely, very 
similar to my name. So I think 
that's how is works out. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I don't know if you realised 
that people here are very tall, 
and we're
not tall. I'm 1 centimetres 58 
on a good day depending on 
humidity. I don't know, I don't 
think we will be accepted as 
Icelandic. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I think that's part of their 
citizenship test:  how tall are 
you? Are you at least 170. No, 
I'm not!  So, I
just want to post our Twitter 
again, because I want to be 
Twitter famous like Dan but also
keep in touch with everyone, 
because I enjoyed my 
interactions with everyone so 
far, and I have had really good 
conversations with a lot of you.
It's been really great. Follow 
me and Vanessa on Twitter, and 
follow these conversations and 
talking about JavaScript, and 
you can also follow my memes. I 
post a lot of really, I mean, 
dumb shit sometimes. So let's 
talk about the party tonight. 
We're going to Bazaar.
There are buses scheduled from 
5.45 to 11 from the Marina and 
here, so get ready to party. I 
heard that there is a karaoke, 
so I bet, like, 20 bucks 
someone's going to sing, &quot;Don't 
stop believing&quot;.
Someone's going to do that. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; For sure. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Mr Bright Side, Wonder Wall. 
All of
that!  I want to promote again 
how Canadian we are!  So
sorry!  
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Saturday. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We do have a trip on Saturday
which is great because we get to
see Iceland. We're driving down 
to the south coast, it will be 
from 10. Is that six now? I 
don't know how to read time. And
it is cut off over here. Yes, 
there's more info on the 
website. So check it out. And, 
apparently, there's been some 
cancellations, so there will be 
a waiting list opening it up at 
the website. So, you can sign up
for that if you don't already 
have a ticket, and then we're 
also going to the Blue Lagoon 
for a farewell brunch, and this 
is information. I'm really 
excited. It's been on my bucket 
list for the longest time. Yes, 
that's us. I'm glad that most 
people use the nose ring and 
arrest ring to tell me and 
Vanessa apart. Nose ring 
Florida, ear
Rick, Vanessa. It works out. 
Thanks very much to everyone. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You all have been a wonderful
audience, and so a round of 
applause for all of you. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And I'm going to call on the 
organisers to come up on stage 
because I think they want to say
something as well. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We really appreciate you 
flying in to be the Masters of 
the Ceremony. A big thank you to
you both. Give them a round of 
applause for an awesome 
something as well. 
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We really appreciate you 
flying in to be the Masters of 
job. 
[Cheering and Applause]. Yes, 
the party tonight. It is not 
over yet. It is just like a sore
moment, tears are starting to 
flow out. But we still have two 
more days, and one night, so we 
are technically halfway through,
depending on how you look at it.
But, yes, we will have all of 
the info on the website. Contact
us on Slack. We want to end like
we end everything at JSConf with
a big family photo. I want to 
get all the organisers to the 
stage to echo what they said 
without tooting my own horn. 
Epic job by these people. 
Really. Give them a round of 
applause. [Applause]. 
And, yes, with that being said, 
I want to invite all of you to 
the stage. 
We will have to move some of the
tables a bit And, yes, away. We 
are probably 250 or 300 people 
still in the audience, so it's 
going to take an effort to put 
this all on the stage. The photo
will be epic. So, thank you all 
for coming. Join us on the 
stage, and enjoy
the rest of JSConf Iceland!
