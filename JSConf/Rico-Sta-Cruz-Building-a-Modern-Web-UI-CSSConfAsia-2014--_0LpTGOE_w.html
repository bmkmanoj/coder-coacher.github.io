today by the way guys didn't know hello
and 2014 is actually what I think a very
good year to be doing web development
and me like what are you guys here
probably well probably all of you guys
pretty much do things in a browser and
and I think as a web developer I'm just
gonna share with you guys I kind of feel
like our profession is a little taken
for granted around here and there's this
pretty good studio that's pretty
well-known t-handle X and this is their
tagline it says if a data screen we will
design for it and it's it's a very bold
claim to make and it's actually probably
what every one of you guys do here day
to day imagine that if it has a screen
we will build her it will design for it
and that is what we do what I do and
what you guys do every day and I think
that's a brilliant thing and all of that
is like what happened after like decades
of history of web development so at some
point in the past you know what
development wasn't really much no one
really thought of it so much you know it
is pretty much content with things that
look like this but of course history
happened and at some point people got
together and said like hey let's
standardize this thing called HTML and
stop fighting over what should be
standards and let's just men date this
is what should be going on moving
forward and this was something that was
pretty hard to do over at that time if
you can understand if you guys are
familiar with these kinds of things and
that happened just last millennium 97
and fast forward many many years a
couple of things happen until the
invention of something called I believe
it's called a smartphone yeah so that's
the smartphone yeah so okay might say
I'm a little unfair calling that the
smartphone because
Rhodri smartphones before that but the
reality is after that came out
everything else just kind of looked like
that anyway so might as well anyway a
couple of couple of more years going
along we have so many ideas you have so
many technologies coming forward xml
five CSS and eventually we came into
this whole idea of like hey maybe we can
design for any screen in the world which
is the same things that we've been using
the whole time then turns out the
technology to do that has been around
for way too long and we do queries have
been you know it's been an existing
before anyone ever thought of responsive
design this is an article from OS depart
and that was just 2010 and we decrees
were already existing way back then so
that sort of thing just happened around
2010 and a couple of other things just
came up and we have so many things that
we could do on a browser on your
computer on your phone we can get
someone from one point of the country to
another and tell them the exact
directions right on your browser and we
could play videos we've made text
editors I think there's like to at least
two out of note is probably even more
than that text editors IDEs made in just
a browser we've made games in a browser
but I think after all these developments
over the years there's just this one
perennial problem that nobody has ever
really solved elegantly in the realm of
browsing and in the realm of web
development i think that is vertical
centering
so that's it I'm Rico Santa Cruz you
might know me around some open source
project as our stock ruse and this is me
talking about how to use flex bucks to
save your sanity all right okay going
back to a vertical centering so I went
to the internet like everyone does every
day looking for answers and it came
across this and it's been asked five
years ago and just like so many answers
was 14 answers on this one and they had
to lock the thread because people kept
responding and I don't know at some
point I'm sure everyone has thought of
like how do you do vertical centering
and when I was like you to CSS I mean
when this whole CSS positioning thing
was just really taking off I thought it
was really easy you know I thought it
was just like this so that's my purse
attempt and probably everyone else is
too right and this is for those who
haven't done that this is what it looks
like so obviously that's not really
going to work so you go back and see
like what did you do wrong maybe there's
something you've missed maybe center or
not middle and you go like oh I know
maybe you should use it to container and
after that this is what it looks like
and you go back and still don't really
know maybe it's both and maybe it'll
work and this is again what it looks
like so it's not really the solution so
I went on the internet very recently and
looked like how do people solve this so
if you guys want to do that right now go
ahead but I've done the research for you
I'm just going to show you okay if it's
just one line you do a line height trick
where you set the same line height for
the same height if it's a fixed type you
can do like a position absolute top 50%
the negative margin you can do something
like a table cell you can do fixed
margin-top you can do pretty much I
don't know and there's like 1000
d'oeuvres and ran out of space in the
slide so there's so many ways to do it
anyway moving forward there's this thing
called flexbox
not sure if you guys write a bit I'm
sure you guys have but I'm sure not
everyone has really used it because you
know everyone's kind of averse to using
it anyway it's really really simple
really simple actually there are very
long articles I was very intimidated
about it but it turns out it's all
really broken damages to basic things
you just set something on the container
it set something on the on the item's
something called display flex and flex
something so it's very perfect for
things like 44 basically app you eyes
and you know these kinds of things that
can tend to pop up every now and then
like sidebars and menus and stuff like
that and there's a little quick yeah to
dispel a couple of duties flex luck is
actually pretty well supported right now
so these is these are the browsers that
support the new version of flexbox
there's actually two versions of flux
flux the old one in the new one is it
the one would support for the new ones
if you notice these are very recent
browsers and if you go back to the ones
that support the old syntax and it's
even actually way back with its Firefox
to I don't even remember that an Android
Eclair right and that's pretty much 2006
so we've actually had browsers that
support flex bucks for a while now the
only stickler here is ie 10 so it's it's
not really good if you're targeting IE
but if you're making something that
targets mobile and iPads iPhones that's
pretty good because you're probably not
really caring about that so much anyway
and if you use flex bucks for things
like these these are pretty much what is
really made for you just really set like
a display flex on the container and you
set something called length and the
items and that's pretty much what all
you need to do and there's just three
magic numbers and they mean these things
basically so all you really need to do
is display flex on a container and the
item
something called flex property and it
just is really as three magic numbers
and it looks into MIT it's actually
pretty simple grow is usually like 0 or
1 if it's what it means it's flexible if
it's zero it's not you can actually use
other numbers but more on that later and
shrink is what if it's too small mi is a
browser allowed to shrink it more than
the bases so basis is like the wares
based out of you know what's default
with sort of and it's actually pretty
flexible not all three are required
sometimes usually just specify one or
two so you guys can check out i'm
posting a link later so if you want
teach you to this out there so you can
just define which once you really need
and in the real world probably look like
this so if you do something like a fixed
type a while ago it looks like 00 and
whatever the height is and if you want
an extendable it's just really auto
which is the same as 11 auto and it's
pretty much I don't know I climbed to
stop asad right now because it really
most of the things you need to know but
anyway let's go on so if you want to
space it out something like this like
evenly you can actually put margins
around around each item and they would
be honored by flex fog that's just going
to work like how you usually would
expect if you know like you probably use
margin zero auto at some point and that
thing just kind of works for vertical as
well and if we go back to the problem of
vertical centering it's you're not going
to believe that this works but it does
so that's just really it and it gets
critically centered perfect lovely so
that's pretty much how you do a vertical
centering you just do a margin on the
item or the other way is you can also
modify the container instead of the item
to have more control this is a property
called justified content
there's actually more possible values
for this but the ones you're probably
going to be using most is space around
which means even at the spacing
vertically and there's pretty much two
of them justify content is like vertical
and a line items is horizontal and that
would also get you a vertical center and
if you notice this when you're styling a
container set up there instead of the
box instead of the item he's sawing a
parent instead and that would be enough
to get you to a vertical centering just
like that and the fantasy thing about
this is it's actually right now it kind
of looks like how you would expect
tables to work or something but the
really interesting thing to happen is
what if you combine that with me to
query so what could how could you make
something that would work as well on a
desktop and a tablet and a phone and the
thing is since these are all just really
CSS properties and you could just
restyle them anytime you need to say put
a media query for a tablet and just want
to change the Flex direction from column
which is to make things vertical to row
you just just really one little property
right there and that's really perfect
for things like you know when you're
switching from tablet to mobile and
another thing is you could even reorder
things without changing the dump order
so you just go for that icon just went
from right to left and you just really
have to change order this still CSS
property called order and you can just
set an order for any one of those
property for any one of those elements
and you can just reorder them depending
on your media query so if you put all
these things together and you just put a
little media career right here and
basically it says that whenever you're
on ode we're on a phone you're going to
make it vertical and you're going to
reorder the app icon so in rate and
practice this is what it's probably
going to look like
and that's it you were able to make a
menu with very very little modifications
to your CSS and if anyone wants to
follow along this this example is
actually posted over at github and I'll
/url later on and basically this entire
thing is built out of flexbox just
really every just like all the macro
layout is all made out of flex box and a
fantastic thing is it's you can also
nest your flex boxes so you can have
like three elements for your main
columns their main pains and that's just
your regular flex box kind of properties
so this one is not twenty percent eighty
percent of the other put like min and
Max with just to make sure it doesn't
collapse too far and that's pretty much
it you're going to have like perfect
columns on a desktop but please by the
way right if anyone wants to follow
along I tweeted the link you can just
check out my Twitter and like is over
there and and so this is what it looks
like play-doh okay yeah
so basically just do the same kinds of
things wherein you take the take this
kinds of flexbox kind of properties and
put little media elements and just
change the orientation from horizontal
to vertical and you just get a really
nice responsive almost effortlessly so
again it's just really all nested flex
buff so this is how it probably would
look like on your typical app where you
have like a horizontal kind of setup and
it would plan it out to a vertical one
whence you shrink your browser and as
you notice like you could just hide one
of the paint's whenever you are in a
bowl ball just displaying on or
something and that would be fine and
just nest flex flops within 2 flex bucks
so even if things inside the listing is
a flex bucks in a flex bucks so the men
you saw that a while ago though and that
the listing is actually pretty simple
just like that and the pastor will
probably do something like this in like
position absolute position fixed with
like top left bottom right and fix
pixels but now at least there's
something more flexible and and the
thing is you can the wonderful thing
here is if you want to add like say a
search bar or something just right under
it it's pretty easy just insert another
dom element it but like another flex
thing over there and that's it you could
you can pretty much change your way up
anytime you want and if you notice this
actually it turns out to be something
that could actually work and here it is
would like I don't know like 40
additional lines of JavaScript so you
make it kind of do its thing and that's
it we actually we're able to make a pure
CSS approach to this whole responsive
deal and there's no fancy JavaScript to
like what happens when you size it down
you need to hide this and that there's
pretty much that and all that was able
to be accomplished with flexbox by the
way right here here is the Twitter and
you could just check out the link over
there if you want to look at the source
so
trying to say is right now what comes to
you I layout problems it's pretty much
solid when it comes to something that
would be on mobile and it's something
that really makes you lets you iterate
things really really fast because if you
really want to rearrange things or just
want to add and subtract and add you
panels new layouts you just really have
to just add another element and flex
block will take care of trying to lay
that out for you and if you try to go to
like you know different websites out
there a couple of them can be sold that
flexbox really so you're a couple of
there's a lot of seasons of properties
you can also use reflects box it like
say for example align self flex and is
something you would probably use a set
of float right which while it goes
pretty much said that floats are evil so
flexible is another way to get around it
and you go to like content area it's
pretty much the same kind of deal and
you can even use a shorter flexbox
syntax just flex five and flex three so
basically if you just specify the growth
parameter it's kind of trying to figure
out which ones bigger and which one
smaller and you know based on each one's
relative growth parameter and ya say
this one too could be salt it's pretty
much everything is just really a grid
everything is just a something that can
be solved with nested layouts and
fantastic thing is if you if you're able
to do it if you could implement like a
layout like slack over something like
this it can be responsive down to tablet
so imagine like you could just say hide
the sidebar or no go to your other side
bars to make sure that it could also
work in a tablet so most of them for the
most part it's something that is pretty
much solved right now and if you go to
can I use com the only thing that really
is slowing down to adoption of flex
bucks right now is ie because the
minimum thing the minimum version that
really supports flex bucks for real as I
eat
ie11 so but as far as like the mobile
mobile adaptation even some of the older
iPhones older androids are able to
support it so it's something that it's
actually pretty usable when it comes to
mobiles so and if you're going to do
something like mobile UI I suggest you
give it a try and that's it for me so
that's me Rico and that was the lunch on
flex bucks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
