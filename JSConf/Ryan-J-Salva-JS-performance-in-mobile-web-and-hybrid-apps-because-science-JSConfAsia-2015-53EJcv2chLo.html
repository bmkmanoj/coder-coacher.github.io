product manager on the visual studio
team i'm also a JavaScript developer of
about 15 years and a committer to the
Apache Cordova project today I'm going
to take the next 30 minutes or so to
talk to you a little bit about
performance and a lot of the lessons
that I talked about today will apply to
Cordova but they apply equally well to
the mobile web and so really this is
just going to be a tour of a bunch of
science that we've conducted and I mean
that like science with a capital s
really important science to better
understand how exactly perf works for
mobile applications when they're using
web technologies sound like a good time
yeah sounds like a good time awesome
alright sweet so hey if along this you
learn anything that you didn't know
before use the hashtag perf matters on
Twitter and share it with your friends
because science is everyone's awesome
thing to learn all right so like I said
before the lessons we learned today are
going to apply equally well between
hybrid applications and mobile web and
just a kind of level set I want to make
sure that everyone understands when I
talk about hybrid applications what I'm
really talking about here so this is the
primary technology is Cordoba most
people know what Cordova is or phonegap
yeah yeah yar okay good excellent so the
basic idea behind it is that Cordova its
core is a web application that sits
inside of a webview instead of a native
application and as a web application all
of the HTML the CSS and the JavaScript
are packaged locally but they kind of
talk back to native api's whether it be
the camera API or the address book or
the accelerometer through these
asynchronous calls that bridge the
webview and talk back to native code the
brilliant thing about this is that it
kind of gives you like a browser on
steroids you get access to all these
native API is that you wouldn't have
access to otherwise
and you get support for offline by
virtue of the fact that all of that HTML
CSS and JavaScript have been packaged
locally so that's the basic architecture
and we're going to kind of use that to
explore like there's this perception
there's this general kind of ickiness
this feeling that web applications and
hybrid applications when compared to
native applications don't quite stand up
they don't really cut the butter as it
were and so in the next 30 minutes we're
going to try and dispel some of those
myths using science all right to
understand performance you first need to
understand what it actually means to be
fast and responsive so here's what I
want you guys to do here's how I want
you to think about it I got a nice
little graph here and there's lots of
different flavors and versions of this
graph that you might have seen online I
think I stole this one from the Nielsen
Norman group and they probably created
this back in nineteen ninety five or
something like that but I've actually
expanded it to put some real millisecond
measurements on this so in the far
left-hand side that's 17 milliseconds
everything that's under fluid that's
really not about user interaction with
your app but that's about the way that
your app moves that's about animations
being fluid transitions kind of silky
smooth flowing through right and if you
do the math that 17 milliseconds
actually calculates out to be 60 frames
per second that's what that's about
getting that magical 60 frames per
second just to the right of that
instantaneous okay this is when you're
actually got your finger on the mobile
device you're dragging it around and the
object actually sticks to your finger so
this is really important to make sure
that like you actually feel like you're
in control of the application beyond
that actions which are fast these are
maybe like navigation events going from
one particular page to the next loading
a new view beyond that everything to the
right buddy if if you've got something
that takes that long to react you better
be throwing up a spinner or something
like that to let people know that work
is being done in the background for this
talk for the next 20-30 minutes or so
we care about is everything on that
right hand side that far right-hand side
what we care about actually for you guys
wait that's left that's your left okay
far left-hand side from your left hand
side we care about fluid and
instantaneous because frankly everything
on the right hand side of that there's
no question that JavaScript CSS HTML are
capable of delivering that kind of
performance right so what is the
methodology behind our science so we
took a look at a bunch of different
applications and we and we kind of
looked at different approaches that
developers took to building out those
applications and we also took a look at
some of the major makers of the popular
UX frameworks that are out there so I'm
thinking of people here like ionic or
onsen or kendo and not the MV star
frameworks not the angular's of the
world of a reacts of the rules but the
people they're making UX controls
because those are the things that end up
driving user interaction and we said you
know what is there any difference
between the way that average Joe
developer is building things today
versus the way that these people who are
creating the best of breed UX frameworks
are actually thinking about performance
and where there are differences between
the two what are the differences that
are contributing to poor performance
does that make sense yeah and so from
that we identified six issues by the way
the all of the tests that we performed
here because you need to control for
devices here we used three kind of you
know recent but not too recent devices
because we wanted to find devices that
we're out there being used by our
mothers and our fathers and our sisters
and people that are not just spending
all of their time in the tech world
investing in the next greatest thing
right so they're slightly older devices
so here the six different areas where we
found that there were discrepancies
between the way that the common
developer might go about building an
application and the kind of the best of
the back
cux developers so webview tax document
object model images animation garbage
collection and UI controls these are the
areas where we found differences now
because I'm a sneaky guy I'm only going
to tell you about four of those today
really that's my way of tempting all of
you to come up and talk to me afterwards
so that you can find out the hidden
secrets behind animation and UI controls
we'll start by talking about these four
though sound good alright so the webview
tax now this first part this is really
specific to Cordova this is the one
piece of the talk that is only going to
apply to hybrid applications now as I
said before a Cordova application has
the web application running inside of a
webview that's hosted inside of a native
control and because it kind of operates
inside of that web view there's a tax
that you got to pay so here's what we
did first we said you know what let's
take a baseline let's measure the memory
footprint of a native application and
the native java for android objective-c
for iOS c-sharp for windows and send
Silverlight for Windows Phone right we
said okay if you were just to create a
hello world using the native language
what would the memory footprint being
and we said you know what I bet that
since a webview is essentially just a
browser that the memory footprint of a
Cordova app would probably be the native
application plus the memory footprint of
the browser and that would probably give
you the memory footprint of a Cordova
app and it could kind of give us an idea
of what the taxes that we pay there so
we did a measurement of the browser on
each of the devices so that's the memory
footprint of about blank and a web
browser on an android phone and iOS
phone and windows device then we
measured the Cordova application now
there's some interesting things going on
here clearly androids got something
going on here there's like a World Trade
Center tower going up there
says the Cordova application has got
giant memory consumption problems on the
iOS side well a plus B does not equal C
they're actually the memory footprint is
about the same as the browser windows
store glory be I don't even know how
this is possible but the memory
footprint is lower than the native app
in lower than the browser and then
Windows Phone okay it's kind of about
the same now all right so I want you all
to remember that giant Tower that's
there next to Android that's going to
come up later in some interesting ways
but just remember big memory footprint
on Android so here's the thing it's
lovely to talk about memory but we're
here to talk about performance today and
memory is not something you can see
where you can see it has an effect is on
startup time so here's what we did took
a slow-motion camera in this case I
actually just use my iPhone 6 it has a
nice little slow motion camera in it and
filmed actually starting up an
application so hopefully you can see
this on the left hand side you can see
us using a nice little touch pin to
click on the hello world app on the
right hand side you can start to see a
little bit of ghosting where the
applications starting to launch we
measured the number of frames in between
the touch moment and the launch moment
because it was filmed at 240 frames per
second that meant that each frame
accounted for four milliseconds and we
could figure out how long it took to
actually launch the application ah now
remember how I ask you to remember that
giant kind of increase on the Android
side of things look how tall or how long
it took for those android cordova apps
to start up so the memory and the
startup time have a strong correlation
here on the iOS side okay this tall
pillar right here that's the native app
starting up I want to put a little
caveat next to that that's why I put a
little asterisk up at the top we
actually just use the default hello
world iOS app that came out of Xcode the
way that that app is
figured out of the box it has a 500
millisecond delay that is configurable
and so I believe that that number there
is actually a bit of a false
representation of what the actual native
implementation would would kind of cause
if we had adjusted that configuration
setting iOS is iOS warm is pretty good
when does phone cold is pretty good in
Windows Phone warm is pretty good these
cold vs warm so let me kind of give a
little bit of insight to the methodology
there cold means that we shut the phone
completely down then started it up and
then immediately started the application
warm means that we shut the phone down
turn it back on started the application
shut the application down and then open
the application up again because each of
the devices makes some some sort of
memory optimizations for the cold horses
warm scenario we wanted to make sure
that we controlled for that depending
upon the actual usage so big takeaway
here memory consumption high correlation
with slower performance we're going to
see that theme repeat again and again
over the course the next 20 minutes so
take away Android tends to be slower and
it tends to be slower because we think
because of memory consumption all right
there's one more place that in a Cordova
application you're actually paying a tax
and that's in that xhr request that
asynchronous call that needs to go from
the webview to the native code and back
again so imagine for a moment that you
are sending a request for geolocation
data or for accelerometer data your web
your JavaScript needs to make the
request it asynchronous a synchronous ly
crosses the webview talks to the native
code then the native code needs to send
that response back with an x y and z
coordinate right so here's what we did
we created a Cordova plugin whose only
job in this big wide world was just to
receive data and to send that data back
it didn't perform any processing on the
data whatsoever it just was there to
measure the impact on data size as it
crossed over that web view bridge and
what we see here is a nice linear line
look at this so for iOS Android and
Windows Phone using C sharp as the data
increases along the x-axis the time also
increases along the y-axis in a linear
fashion note however crossing the very
bottom of that line there's a kind of a
yellow line there that's windows phone
using javascript because windows devices
are able to run JavaScript as a native
language like you don't there's no
compilation that happens there there's
no webview to cross and so the time to
kind of interact with the plug-in is
zero no matter how large the data set
gets what I want to call your attention
to here though is that this 500k
actually this is a more than 500 k this
is 5000 k in order for you to transfer
that over the webview is a period of
less than was at 300 milliseconds or so
it's a very very small amount of time
and so even if you were transferring a
large amount of data for example an
image taken from a camera it's going to
happen in a practically non noticeable
period of time if you're transferring
smaller bits of data for example
accelerometer or geolocation data it's
going to be two three four milliseconds
very very tiny so what that tells us
that is that javascript in terms of
being able to deliver high performance
is able to really deliver right you know
there's no waiting around for it okay
that's it for the cordova specific stuff
now let's actually get into the kind of
the stuff that's applicable to both
cordova and to mobile web so i don't
need to tell you guys too much about
what the dom is you all know let's see a
dumb or rather an example here and a bit
about how this is going to work just to
make sure that we had
enough time to show all the experiments
what I did is I did a screen recording
of me conducting these experiments when
I actually conduct them in the lab I'm
performing these experiments thousands
and thousands and thousands of times to
make sure that we get a good median and
a good baseline for each of them each
one of these is exemplary of those
thousands of runs okay so in this one
I'm going to conduct an experiment where
I'm performing dom manipulation first
using a simple dom and then using a
complex dome when what i mean by that a
simple Dom has fewer elements and no
nesting the complex Dom has very deep
nesting hundreds of nodes deep in
multiple elements for this I'm actually
running them on a nexus 9 that Nexus 9
this is the case with all the
experiments that Nexus 9 is just being
screencast to my to my desktop via a fun
little application called mobizen all of
the experiments I'm going to show using
Android but the results tend to be
similar for iOS and windows okay all
right for this I'm just going to bring
up the chrome dev tools and the first
one that I'm gonna do is I'm going to
trigger manipulations of the simple DOM
and you can see here I'm just outputting
to the console the amount of time
required to perform each one of the
manipulations I've moved on to the
complex Dom using a pin child then
complex Dom modifications using inner
HTML and then finally complex Dom
modifications using documentfragment
right so everyone pretty much knows
those methods appendchild enter HTML
what I want to call your attention to is
the amount of time that it required to
perform a simple dom manipulation versus
a complex Dom manipulation that's point
zero two six milliseconds compared to
point zero five four milliseconds now I
know I know I know point zero two six
milliseconds is just not that much time
right it's
it's nanoseconds right but those will
add up over time as your Dom gets more
and more complex and we're actually
going to see that happen here in just a
minute so now we know surprise I mean
like this is almost common sense simple
Dom manipulations require less Tom time
than complex ones but that can lead to
some interesting choices about how you
write your code now like this is almost
unintelligent but you're going to make
some different decisions when you
optimize for performance versus
optimizing for code maintainability or
code legibility and this particular case
I've reduced the number of elements by
thirty percent and by reducing the
number of elements as that multiplies
out over the broad scope of an
application that conservation of
elements is going to help me
tremendously so in this case it is
functionally equivalent but thirty
percent fewer actual Dom elements take
away reduce your element count alright
so let's talk about another little
idiosyncrasy of Dom manipulation and
many of you may be familiar with this
kind of technique before layout
thrashing is basically when you set a
CSS property at the same time as on the
opposite side you're reading the CSS
property so let's see how this actually
works here right so I got another video
and in this particular one you'll see
that on the left-hand side I am setting
my style to on the right-hand side of
the equal sign and read a command so I'm
just looping through again and again and
again setting to a read in the second
case and this one I'm looping through
I'm reading all of the values first and
then I have a separate loop to set right
now that seems like a relatively small
change and again from a legibility or
code maintainability perspective it
almost seems like the first is better
so what i'm doing here is first i'm
going to perform an action where it lets
you know that one i am using the
thrashing so i'm actually the very first
one i read to my set and in the second
one i do the two for loops now look at
the comparison here with thrashing that
took nearly four seconds without
thrashing it took only 56 milliseconds
right that's a Eightfold improvement
something like that just by changing the
order by which we set and read so real
quick here just to reinforce it bad
don't read it and set it in the same
line good read it first set it later
batch your layout operations all the
read at once all the set at once okay
let's talk about fast list scrolling so
this is essentially when you've got
thousands of elements on a page and you
need to be able to scroll through them
quickly in an infinite scroll think here
of something like I don't know Facebook
right where you're just kind of
scrolling forever and ever and ever or
Twitter or whatever your favorite social
media network is so in this particular
one in the first one I am going to use
just those I think it's I think actually
is a thousand elements and I'm just
going to scroll through them without any
kind of optimizations whatsoever it's
just Dom elements on the page iterating
down in the second case I'm going to use
virtualization virtualization is a
technique where we essentially simplify
the dom by removing elements that are
before and after the visible screen so
that there are less elements on the page
and remember back before we had our
lesson about when there were fewer
elements on the page when we have a
simple Dom it's the the the actual
browser is faster when we have a complex
dumb the browser tends to be slower this
is that same lesson multiplied out in a
way that you can actually see it in a
way that the user would see it so
here we are we're actually launching it
up the in this particular case I've just
got a little image of some fruit and
you'll see I'm kind as I scroll through
here it almost looks like the screen is
disappearing it's just going blank
that's not like a quirk of the video
that's because the elements the the
browser itself isn't able to keep up
with the paint and so they just
disappear as I quickly quickly quickly
move back and forth in it right and
sometimes they disappear for seconds at
a time so in this next one I'm actually
going to launch it again and this time
I'm going to use a virtualization so I'm
only keeping in memory elements that are
one or two maybe three screens before or
after the visible screen right in this
particular case I'm think what i was
using here was when j/s is my
virtualization engine when jess happens
to have really good list scrolling but
there are lots of other frameworks that
provide virtualization for it all right
let's get it up here one of the other
things that I want you to notice here is
one of the other tricks of
virtualization is that as the as the
browser gets to a place where it no
longer has those elements in memory what
it will start to do you see those gray
gray boxes essentially what it's doing
is putting in dummy elements so that you
feel like the the application is able to
keep up with it think here I'll use
facebook again as an example when you
first load facebook on your mobile phone
it's got a couple of placeholder kind of
posts in there same idea this is really
all about improving the perception of
performance and when we measure this out
we actually measured the memory of these
guys the virtualized list less than a
hundred megabytes of memory for that
particular application at runtime the
non virtualized list over was that
nearly three hundred and fifty megabytes
and again we see a strong correlation
between the memory consumption and the
actual performance itself and so anytime
that you find yourself in a position
where you're trying to measure for
performance and trying to optimize for
performance measuring frames per second
great
you should do that but as a proxy it can
sometimes be helpful to also look at
your memory consumption as well all
right take away use virtualization when
you can lots of frameworks do it my
advice don't try to do this yourself
writing virtualization is hard it's
super hard just use another framework
okay images so here's a funny one this
is like completely this this blows my
mind when I see this one it's it's
totally weird so I didn't know how long
have CSS Graydon's gradients been around
this is like can anyone remember 2008 I
don't know something like that CSS
gradients are super super helpful they
allow us to be a little bit more
responsive in our design it we don't
have to cut like a one by one wing a
pixel tile to kind of grade across but
just like before when we were looking at
how we might reduce our overall element
count there are different decisions that
you might make when you're optimizing
for performance versus when you're
maintaining for or when you're writing
for code maintainability so in this
particular case I've got two objects the
first object just uses a regular old CSS
gradient the second object uses a PNG
file to create my gradient all right
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
animate these guys and when I animate
these guys want to use the chrome dev
tools to measure frames per second and I
hope that many of you are familiar with
the chrome devtools performance
optimization tools if you're not the
quick rule here is that tall bars up
there are bad low bars are good right so
in the first case where you see all
those giant green skyscrapers that's
what I'm animating the CSS gradient on
the right hand side when I'm animating
the image all those low bars that's when
I'm animating the bitmapped ping like
what the what's up with that like
seriously what's up with that so here's
what I think is actually happening right
and I like here I actually you know need
to call my friends over google and
verify the
but here's what I think is happening
when you animate that CSS gradient every
time it moves a frame over it needs to
redraw the gradient each time when it's
animating the bitmap or the ping in this
particular case that already exists it
doesn't need to redraw it every time and
so you get better animation when you're
moving the already in memory image
compared to what's essentially creating
an image for each for each frame of the
CSS and so if there's a kind of a a bad
version of this again like can't believe
I'm putting this up there bad CSS
gradients but somehow that is the case
when you're optimizing for performance
versus blow your mind good why in the
world is this but it once again when
you're optimizing for performance you're
going to make different decisions than
you would otherwise all right so use
images 0 garbage collection everybody
loves the garbage collector he takes all
of our dirty memory away so garbage
collectors have been around for you know
since browsers were around and and
generally they're pretty efficient but
when you're dealing with a mobile
application and I would say that this is
particularly poignant for hybrid
applications where the app itself is
going to be a single page application
that rarely shuts down memory management
becomes really really important and that
garbage collector it does run
automatically but you can get yourself
into a bad spot where it's um it's it's
unable to do its job so here's what
we're going to do I want to kind of show
this in action and in this particular
one hit play here what I'm going to do
is I'm going to create a bunch of
elements and I'm going to attach event
handlers to those elements just in the
loops you see there add event listener
and then I'm just going to destroy them
by saying enter HTML equals to blank
what that means is that as I destroy
those my event handler is still sticking
around in memory and the garbage
collector has a really tough time
getting back to it
what I'm going to do here is I'm going
to start running this guy and once again
in our friend chrome devtools I want you
to notice once I start running it
there's going to be a ramp that blue
ramp that starts to get bigger and
bigger and bigger bigger again that is
death that is death for your application
over time as memory just balloons out of
scale now granted Here I am creating
thousands and thousands and thousands
over again right um and you might think
to yourself well and my web application
I'm never going to be creating these
thousands of elements again and again
and again but but you actually you are
especially if you've got a single page
application that guy could stay open for
a long time you may never shut it down
for months and as the memory grows and
those event handlers stick around behind
you're basically just signing up for a
browser crash at some point so bad here
eventlistener still hanging around even
after we destroyed our element good be
responsible boys and girls destroy your
event handlers right remove event event
listener right there then responsibly
remove your child all right now while
we're on the subject of event listeners
let's talk about how we can actually not
just irresponsibly create and destroy
them but also how we can minimize the
total number of them now I don't know
about you guys but I often like I go out
I do a query selector all or a dollar
sign dollar sign I go get a big
collection of elements at loop through
them and as I loop through them I just
add in an event handler teach one on
click event handler on click event
handler and what that ends up doing is
that ends up creating a rubber stamp
duplicate of every function again and
again and again and again and and that
multiplicity that that giant collection
of event handlers are once again just
consuming more memory and so what I want
you to encourage you to do here is
rather than create an event listener or
event handler for each element instead
think about using a single event handler
for all of your objects within a node
tree let me let me kind of explain what
I mean here a little bit so 1 2 3 4 and
5 those little elements down at the
bottom they've all got a common ancestor
in this case the dude right so that dude
through the magic of event bubbling
receives all the same events that one
two three four and five receive so what
I want to encourage you to do is think
about how you can use event handlers or
event listeners on the dude to respond
to events that occur on its children so
here's what we're going to do we're
actually show this in action so I'm
going to have a couple of different
scenarios here in scenario 1 i'm going
to have one event handler for each
element in scenario 2 i'm going to use
event bubbling and then attach a
essentially a switch case to my event
handler to say what did you click on oh
you clicked on ancestor or rather child
a then do this and then in case 3 i'm
going to have that same kind of
one-to-one relationship between event
listeners and objects but this time i'm
going to use a common function for all
of them so here's what I've done I've
just executed the first of those
scenarios that is one event handler per
element and I've taken a little snapshot
of memory now I'm executing scenario two
this is the one with event bubbling
where we use a switch case on the top
level element to identify the actual
element that it was clicked upon and
then okay we're taking that snapshot now
and now snapshot three where we actually
have an event listener for every element
but it all points to this
same common event handler the same
common function what i want to point to
in this we're going to kind of drag it
around here i want you to take a look at
the retained sighs that's that far
column right there so look at that 257 k
or eight percent of the total memory is
dedicated to the dom okay snapshot to
this is the one where we use the
one-to-one relationship oh man that was
468 k and then snapshot one this is the
one oh that's that that's the bad one
right that's 12 11 event handler per
object and here we can see I'm actually
going to open it up and you'll be able
to see one event handler per object
there there it is that native function
right there that's one per object and
then in snapshots one and three those
are the ones where I've got a common
event handler for each element right
through that I realize let's hear I'll
rewind it a bit so you can see it mmm
there we are the 257 there right it is
about half of the retained memory size
when I use either a common event handler
for each event listener or I do the
handler on the parent element when this
this it's helpful if you see a quick
little code example here right so for
this one bad I'm just doing a loop I'm
attaching a single an event handler to
each object and each of those event
handlers is essentially a clone of the
one before it whereas good i'm attaching
an event listener to the parent and in
this case i just use an if statement i
could be a little bit more sophisticated
use a switch statement to figure out
which child i clicked on again that
resulted in about half of the retained
memory size a win not only for memory
but also for your performance so take
advantage of event bubbling
pay attention to memory leaks okay
memory leaks so this is kind of a
variation of what we saw earlier with
the event that we left kind of hanging
on right where we created a lot of
elements destroy them and left an event
handler sticking around so in this
particular one what I'm going to do
excuse me what I'm going to do is I'm
going to cycle through and create a
bunch of elements and then for those
elements I'm going to keep each one of
the elements scope to the private
function right and this first time
around because it's scoped to the
private function those functions and
those objects will will will be
destroyed when the function itself is
destroyed and so here we're going to
launch it up there we go here it comes
little heap snapshot there all right and
so as I'm navigating from page to page
what it's essentially doing is creating
those objects destroying those objects
creating those objects destroying those
objects right and as it does so because
the objects are created as part of the
private function the objects are
destroyed with a lifetime of the
function itself and so here what I want
you to see look it's a nice clean Dom
here there are no unpair until div
elements those are all white white is
good you like white all right now what
I'm going to do is I'm going to switch
it up a little bit this time just by
removing the VAR declaration from within
the function scope I'm immediately
putting each one of the div elements
into the global scope because they are
in the global scope they are not
destroyed when you destroy the function
as well and so those will end up hanging
around as unpair intended on fragments
sticking around in my application so
here we go we're going to do the
navigation again I'm going to fast
forward just a little bit there we go
navigate back and forth once again
creating destroying each of the
functions but this time because all of
my elements are being created in the
global scope when I create and destroy
my functions my objects are still
sticking around my Dom objects are still
sticking around all right let the
snapshot do its computational powers and
when we expose this look at all of that
read each one of those objects that's
marked as kind of with a pinkish red
background these are objects that are
just polluting your Dom taking up space
taking up memory and dragging you down
right so a good kind of check for
yourself is run your application for a
little while go back into chrome
devtools see if you can find into these
objects that are red and try and find
out where those get created how you can
destroy them because over time they're
just going to increase your overall
memory footprint and ultimately drag
down your performance as well so bad in
this particular case we've got the
element created in the global scope
outside of the function good we're
actually creating the element within the
scope of the function and so it gets
destroyed with the function destroy all
your unused objects so we're getting to
the end of it I beg beg of you if you
remember anything about this talk anyone
can build slow apps you can you can that
guy has I know he has back there you can
do it to anyone can build slow apps but
you don't have to like go into it
thinking about performance first before
it drags you down in the end thank you
so much once again ryan j salva come
talk to me afterwards I'd love to talk
to about animation and UI controls and
all the experiments that I didn't get to
share with you today thank you so much
Cohen
thank you next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
