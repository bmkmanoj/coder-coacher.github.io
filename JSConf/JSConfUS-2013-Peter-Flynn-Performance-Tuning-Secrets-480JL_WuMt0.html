about javascript performance tuning
secrets so this is not so much about how
to structure your code in a way that it
runs quickly it's more about the tools
and techniques that you can use to begin
to evaluate and investigate performance
issues and so I'm assuming that you're
sort of familiar already with the basic
stuff and the dev tools like the
timeline panel and the profiler this is
going more into sort of more exotic
crazy stuff that you might not be as
familiar with some of it's a little
hacky some what's a little bit tricky
and all that to get working but if
you're really in a tough bind with
performance and you're just desperate
for one little clue one little scrap of
information that might lead you to an
improvement in a fix these are good
tools to have in your tool kit so
because this talk is pretty short I'm
going to fly over a lot of different
material I'm going to try to post up
some links to further reading on this
github repo along with the slides
there's nothing there yet but hopefully
by this weekend there will be so me real
quick I started doing a professional web
development back when Firefox was in 10
beta back when web kits JavaScript
engine sucks so badly that you couldn't
do anything with it things that really
come a long way since then these days i
work at adobe on the brackets team
brackets is an open source code editor
that we're building for web developers
it's also written in javascript and it's
a pretty pretty serious app the brackets
UI is about a hundred thousand lines of
JavaScript code that's over ten
megabytes of JS files so it's a very
performance intensive app and that's
kind of where I'm coming from on all
this stuff so first of all why is this
even a complicated problem I mean it
seems like sort of naively you could
just do something like this right you
you record a start time you do some
stuff you record an end time you know
how how long it took right and we're
using these higher resolution
performance measuring api's or in modern
browsers you get sub millisecond
accuracy it's really cool but I think
there's basically two big problems with
this the first is that you know a lot of
times your javascript is running in the
browser and when you're running in the
browser there's a lot of other stuff
that happens after this code is done
like that or that or that that so if
what you actually care about is how long
it takes before the user gets feedback
visually on screen the browser native
rendering stuff is actually very
important and that's all
from the bottleneck these days because
javascript is so darn fast that the
browser native side can actually be the
bigger performance issue so that's one
issue but then of course also you know
lots of people run JavaScript like on on
the server or in helicopters or other
crazy stuff and regardless of where
you're running I think the second issue
comes into play and that is that Java
scripts not actually what's running on a
cpu right there's this this mystery
black boxes javascript vm it does a
bunch of magic and makes your code run
and that's actually what's running on
the cpu and for performance sensitive
code what goes on that black box can be
really important getting deeper insights
into there is valuable so i'll talk
about those two topics in turn first
kind of like getting entangled with
browser native rendering stuff and then
second the interaction between
javascript and the vm it's running in
i'll go through a number of topics in
each of these their range roughly in
ascending order of craziness so we'll go
down the left column first and i'm going
on the right column and and then it'll
have a little bit of miscellaneous stuff
at the end of wrap-up so first of all
who hasn't seen the timeline panel and
is willing to admit it in front of
everybody here anyone no one brave
enough okay but as good and so hopefully
everybody knows about this frames view
which is I think the the most powerful
visualization you can get in there for
things like animation performance
scrolling performance anything that's
really rendering oriented okay so
hopefully everyone's familiar with that
but here are some things you might not
know about the timeline panel first of
all you can actually add your own custom
annotation to this panel so if you do
consult a time stamp you actually get
these tick marks that show up both in
the overview of the whole timeline
capture and also in the individual
zoomed in view you can also use slightly
different code console that time and
time end to actually insert your own
little bars in the view so you can
basically begin to layer on semantic
annotations that are specific to your
code so it makes it data much easier to
parse you're no longer looking at this
really generic we sort of blind view
that the browser gives you what's going
on you can now actually begin looking at
this in terms of what it means in your
in your app which is pretty pretty cool
stuff but one thing that's always
bothered me about the timeline panel is
that it is very manually driven workflow
right like you load your page you have
to click around in it you record some
data you scrub through it
line it's not really conducive to things
like continuous integration where you
might want to be you know checking for
performance regressions automatically on
every check-in things like that but it
actually turns out there is a way to do
that so this may not be widely known but
the timeline panel in fact everything in
the developer tools in chrome and WebKit
is built on top of an open API that's
just in JSON format and exposes the
socket connection so anyone can connect
to that remote debugging API in fact in
the brackets editor we use that API for
things like live development and google
has actually built a testing framework
on top of this called the telemetry
framework it's basically a collection of
Python scripts and and templates for
test cases that let you do automated
performance testing using the same data
feed that the timeline panel gives you
except in an automated way it actually
includes some some pretty powerful UI
automation capabilities so you can do
things like simulating clicks and
scrolling scrolling is a particularly
tricky one to simulate normally from
JavaScript so actually what they do here
is that there's a there's a special API
that is turned off in chrome normally
that when the telemetry framework runs
chrome it passes a flag that enables a
special API just for simulating
scrolling accurately to get really good
performance data there so it's really
cool stuff and briefly the way it works
is you you write it up a JSON file that
has like a list of URLs and a list of
actions in the URLs and what you want to
test in them you know you can scroll
different parts of the document click on
different Dom nodes that sort of thing
you need to get the chrome source code
you don't need to compile it but you get
the scripts out of there and then you
run you run these scripts you pass it
your JSON file and and then it actually
spits out a JSON file with performance
data so simple as that if you're looking
for an example of how to use this I
think a great place to look is the
topcoat project which if anyone was at
CSS confit would have seen a little bit
about that there it's an open source CSS
framework basically and they're very
very concerned with performance
rendering performance of load
performance all that so they're doing
automated testing using this telemetry
framework you can see a great example of
how to use it there and they've also
built a spin-off project which is the
topcoat server project it's basically a
node server that you can use to upload
your performance results to it will
track the results over time and it
presents a really nice web view
visualizing
how your performance is varying over
time so that's a really great project
you can make use of when you're using
these ap is also there's some other cool
stuff in the devtools the FPS meter
continues repainting these are really
invaluable for assessing rendering
performance I'm not going to go into
detail on them here though there's a lot
of great stuff you can read up on the
googles about this definitely very
useful if you don't know about it
similarly there's a mode where you can
see repaint rectangles overlaid on the
page and there's a mode where you can
see compositing layers annotated with
borders and grids on the page gives you
really really great deep insight into
what's going on with browser painting on
the one hand and browser compositing on
the other hand but again this is pretty
well-documented stuff so I'm not going
to go into too much detail on it right
here the question actually then I'm
going to talk about is what if it is
what if this isn't enough what if you
need even more deeper insight into
what's going on with rendering and
compositing in the browser how many
people have seen this for you before
phew how many people like to know how to
read it all right cool it's going to do
a whole joke or someone have their hand
up I was gonna be like put your hand
down if you work with Google that's
cheating but I guess no one hears from
google so well so I'll give you a quick
tour of this well resolution okay this
is a lot like what you see in the
timeline panel except it's broken down
in a very low level by thread and so the
first thing to know is it it's capturing
everything that's going on in the
browser including all tabs you have
opens you want to close every other tab
to get extraneous data out of here and
then you want to use the task manager to
actually identify which which which
process I do you care about for your tab
there's always going to be a few extra
ones in here I happen to know that for
this run that I already captured the
thread that I care about is 6260 so I'm
just going to go close all this extra
stuff here that I don't care about and
I'll just leave a couple the GPU one is
useful to see also so there are
basically two threads involved in
rendering on any given browser tab
there's the compositor thread and the
render thread which is actually where
the bulk of the work usually happens
that's where v eight runs your
JavaScript that's where layout
and that's where repainting happens but
this doesn't really look like much yet
if you look at this is actually a really
big time scale it's like a like three
second capture so it's just a big mash
of stuff we want to be able to zoom in
and the quickest way to do that is to
hold down alt and use the mouse wheel
and you can begin zooming in and start
seeing this break down into individual
basically frame per frame units to
navigate further you pretend you're
playing quake and you use the a and the
D key to pan horizontally and you can
use W and s to zoom in and out so it's
like a video game it's a little crazy to
navigate and as we zoom in more we can
start seeing these individual frame by
frame units and if you look they're
broken down roughly in 16 and change
millisecond intervals so that's this is
one frame right here and there's this
characteristic you shape to it so
rendering a given frame starts on the
compositor thread and the bulk of the
work usually happens in the render
thread and then it basically wraps up on
the compositor threat against when you
see one of these use shapes that's
generally a single frame from start to
finish so the way that you actually read
the data in here is this is basically a
stack trace on the native side so these
are different methods that are running
in in chrome there's run task calls
begin frame on main thread which calls
animate on the one hand which calls into
v8 that's requestanimationframe calls
layout after that it calls update layers
etc so the width of the bars how long it
took so you can begin to get a really
good sense here of what's the self time
versus the total time for a given method
call broken down in a really low level
the colors don't actually mean anything
in particular that was pretty confusing
to me at first they're just randomly
assigned but the same method
consistently gets the same color
everywhere that it appears so it makes
it much easier to sort of skim through
repeated results more easily you'll also
see those a GPU thread down here which
is sometimes in sync with what's going
on in your particular tabs compositor
and render threads but not always
because it's actually shared across the
whole browser and so it's usually
running at the same frame rate but
sometimes out of phase which is one of
the reasons that measuring rendering
latency is a lot trickier than
rendering frequency or framerate an X on
the GPU thread this is view is going to
be enhanced in a future version of
Chrome as they do some rendering
refactoring it's going to add more and
more tools to begin visualizing what's
going on with GPU textures and
individual repaint steps even so it's
it's pretty powerful this is sort of a
complement to the timeline panel though
it's not a replacement for it in fact
there are some cases where the timeline
panel gives you more information than
what you see here for example if you
hover over a repaint in the timelines
it'll show you overlaid on the page the
bounds of the repaint you can't get that
from chrome tracing and same thing with
layout you can see the stack trace that
caused the way out to happen you don't
get that from here either but what you
do get is this really really in-depth
thread by thread breakdown of what's
going on in the GPU thread versus the
compositor thread and you can begin to
see where bottlenecks are actually
happening at a more fine-grained level
so back before all these tools though
you know measuring rendering performance
in JavaScript was like comically bad if
you remember Lee er slide there's all
that stuff that happens outside of
JavaScript there's always native stuff
so if you try to measure from JavaScript
you get ridiculous results like this
where it's like off by 2x or 3x it's
just completely ridiculous useless data
and back before things like the FPS
meter in the timeline panel were well
established this is the kind of terrible
data you got and so this leads us to our
last and craziest hack in the Dom
rendering column back in the day like
say 2011 before there was an FPS meter
available what could you do to get these
orange bars to get the actual accurate
data when javascript is so far off the
mark and we developed a number of people
actually are not the only ones we
developed a really ridiculous idea that
looks like this that's not a regular SLR
camera that's a camera that shoots video
it's 600 frames per second and of course
if you give engineers a toy like this
inevitably we're going to shoot some
video that looks like this before we get
any real work done to a guy breathing
fire obviously but eventually we decided
we should probably try to be productive
and we eventually decided to shoot video
that looks more like this this is me
hitting a key as fast as I can slow down
20 times and you can see those are
noticeable delay between my fingers
striking the key and the character
appearing on the screen so you can get
extremely extremely
information about things like rendering
latency using this kind of technique
obviously this is a last resort it's
really time consuming to do this so you
should prefer to use the timeline panel
the frame per second meter
requestanimationframe based timing these
more modern things that are available
but there are a few cases I think where
this is still useful things like latency
for example again are trickier to
measure the frames per second meter
tells you frequency but not latency
another thing that's really powerful
about it though is it actually lets you
measure the performance of apps where
you don't have access to the code so I
think we're very used to in the
JavaScript world you can bring up any
web page and pull up developer tools on
it start poking around in the code but
let's say you're building like a mobile
website or code Cordova based mobile app
and you want to compare your performance
against a native phone app that's your
competitor you don't have access to the
native code you can't instrument it so
technique like this would actually let
you measure the performance of the
native app and compare that against your
web based app so in cases like that
world oh this is crazy as a last resort
it can still come in handy alright so
we're done talking about the rendering
column let's switch over and talk about
things that go on inside of v8 now and I
think that probably everybody knows
about the profiler panel at least a
little bit in v8 or sorry in the
developer tools but actually I think
that for memory profiling the timeline
panel is a great first place to start
there are four things that this gives
you that are really really handy the
first is you get this if you switch to
the memory view you get this overview
across the whole timeline capture of
memory usage over time so you can start
to see patterns like memory leaks right
increasing constantly you can see
excessive object turn if you're getting
a GC sort of sawtooth too frequently you
also get this count at the bottom which
is counting the number of Dom related
objects specifically which is one of the
more dangerous sources of memory leaks
because of how much native browser stuff
is prevented from getting freed by
holding onto Dom objects then you can
also see individual GC events
highlighted as individual tick marks
here so you can actually quantify how
much time your javascript is frozen from
being executed by a GC going on and then
lastly for any individual yellow bar in
the timeline that's showing JavaScript
execution recent versions of chrome
actually show you the size of the number
of objects that were generated during
the execution of that JavaScript so you
can again start to get a sense of
much object turn is going on at a pretty
fine grand level and then of course
moving into the more standard memory
profiling view hopefully everybody knows
you can you can take a memory snapshot
and begin delving into it something that
might be a little less widely known
though is that you can actually take
multiple snapshots and dip them in this
view so this is really really useful for
looking at memory leaks you can
basically take one snapshot do an
operation that you expect to be memory
neutral like open and close something
and then take a second snapshot and get
a diff and all the unju seed objects
hanging around between those two
snapshots are red flags are potential
sources of memory leaks so let's talk
about CPU profiling which is of course
the other sort of JavaScript performance
oriented sign of the profiling world
this is getting a little more exotic
there's something that just landed in
the Chrome Canary recently called the
flame chart view so if you capture a CPU
profile you can get this really cool
visualization of the data and what's
nice about this is that unlike the
normal CPU profile view which buckets
all of the entire profiling run into one
data capture this actually shows you how
the hotspots vary over time so there's
two different panels here basically and
it's a little tricky to sort them out
but basically the top panel here is an
overview of the entire profile capturing
run and the spikes here are basically
showing your JavaScript activity so the
y-axis is you know increased CPU usage
essentially and then you can zoom in on
a particular part of that like the
highlighted area here and you'll see
along the bottom you get this zoomed in
view and this actually the y axis means
something different though his rig gets
confusing the y-axis here is just is
just a stack call stack basically so
it's a lot like the chrome tracing view
where it's a call stack it's just
actually flipped upside down in this
case but same difference so the the
x-axis here represents time so the wider
the bar the more time spent just like
the chrome tracing view so the x axis
here roughly maps to the y axis up in
this other chart that's a little
confusing the other thing that's
potentially confusing about this is the
color scheme combined with the name
flame chart makes it sound kind of like
a heat map like red is bad and green and
blue or good that's actually not true at
all the colors here are just like chrome
tracing where they're essentially
randomly chosen colors that the same
method gets the same color everywhere it
appears just to make it easier to read
but the colors don't have any particular
meaning other than that so if you want
to start getting more sort of honing in
on very specific you know parts of your
code base to target for performance
profiling there are two really cool ways
that you can do that the first is you
can use console top profile and profile
end to actually automatically kick off
profiling sessions to get recorded in
the dev tools and show up with your own
label you can actually have more than
one of these running at once they can be
overlapping they don't have to be
strictly nested so it's a really great
way to begin you know hunting down on
specific parts of your code without
having to click the begin and end button
manually right at the right times and
then also you can use console time and
time n to add custom annotations that
show up in the chrome tracing view so
there you can actually begin to see your
own method calls your own time brackets
basically precisely lined up with what's
going on in the browser native side of
things in this really really rich rich
threaded view of what's going on so
again you know like the custom
annotations in the timeline panel these
are really cool ways to begin adding
your own annotations to a data set that
normally is kind of blind to what your
code means and is this very generic view
and here you can begin to make it much
more specific to your own profiling
needs your own goals and targets all
right let's say none of that stuff is
crazy enough let's dial up the craziness
meter a little bit further here if that
stuff isn't giving enough information it
turns out that v8's profiler actually
produces a lot more info than what the
devtools show and there are a few kind
of crazy hacky ways that you can get at
some of that richer info the setup for
this is a little bit involved that's why
this is on the high end of the crazy
spectrum so I will go through that
detail but i'll post up those steps
later but basically what you do is once
you get that setup you close all
insensitive chrome that you have open
that includes canary and stable if you
happen to have both open thanks to a
John mcCutchan at Google for helping me
to figure that one out is very confusing
clothes every chrome process you can get
your hands on and when they're all
closed you go to the command line and
you launch Chrome at these special flags
they basically get fed through to v8 and
tells v8 to generate a log file then you
dig out that log file and you run this
plot timer events script on it which is
part of the v8
and it generates a ping file it'll chug
for a little while and spit out this
pink file next to the log and it looks
like this looks a little bit like the
chrome tracing view but rather than
being concerned with browser rendering
performance this is all about what's
going on on the v8 side of things and
you can get really really fine grained
detail here like for example GC
compactor and GC scavenger you can
actually see when GC activity is going
on when garbage collection is going on
is it garbage collecting from the young
space or the old space is it basically
is it garbage collecting objects that
were recently created and didn't leave
very long or is it getting rid of
objects that hung around a long time and
then all of a sudden all about freedom
wants that can be a very very
interesting insight to have into what's
going on and with GC performance
problems another thing that's really
cool in this view is this bar that runs
along the middle here which tells you
the kind of code being executed and what
that means is whether v8 is currently
running optimized code or unoptimized
code which can be very a very important
problem if your code that's performance
sensitive isn't getting optimized fully
by v8 that can be a problem when it can
be sort of a mystery to and the way you
tell it by the my screen is optimized
read full code they call it is
unoptimized this particular trace is not
such a good example it's mostly neither
it's mostly not bottleneck by JavaScript
at all but in things that are bottled
liking on JavaScript you'll see a lot of
either red or green hopefully green but
maybe red and so to begin looking at it
the first thing you need to do is
actually zoom in on this data because if
you look at this it's capturing it's
really hard to see the numbers but it's
basically 14 seconds is the only thing
this capture on it's the entire time
that chrome was up and running you don't
get any control over how long it runs
the capture to the whole time it's it's
up and running so to zoom in on this you
can pass some arguments so that the plot
timer events function and you can
basically begin zooming in so you can
see not sort of starting to break down
if these frame units again and you can
zoom in even on a single frame and start
to get really really detailed
information you know down to the
millisecond basically about what's going
on inside of v8 at every little time
slice this is still kind of a crappy
iterative process like you have to like
run the script and then relook at the
paint file and run the script again and
all that I did come up with an
interesting hack for it navigating this
data more
actively it's a little tricky it
requires pulling a chunk of code out of
the plot timer event script that you run
and basically getting it to save its
intermediate file before generating the
ping it turns out that the intermediate
file that it uses to generate the ping
is just a text format file that contains
a bunch of drawing commands and if you
cross out the first line if you delete
that first line from the file you can
then open this in an interactive
visualizer so new plot is the thing it
uses you can you can get interactive
visualizers onto this new platform at
data and i'll show you a quick example
of that here's where the control scheme
from chrome tracing the video game style
thing starts to sound less crazy because
I find this even more bizarre the way
that you navigate this is you you
control mouse wheel to zoom in which
seems pretty reasonable and this is
actually quite powerful because it's
because this is a data plotting software
package you notice it smart enough to
keep the axis labels in view even as you
zoomed in which is pretty cool but the
way that you scroll horizontally is you
see I have to refer to notes as how
crazy this is you have to you hold down
shift and you use the mouse wheel to
scroll horizontally and then just scroll
vertically you hold down alt and use the
mouse wheel makes tons of sense right
it's such an intuitive way of navigating
data but it is nonetheless a much faster
iteration than having to repeatedly look
at the milliseconds and then rerun the
script and open and ping file again and
you know rinse and repeat so this is
kind of a cool way to visualize the data
of course because this is just a text
format I think it would be really
awesome if someone wrote like a
JavaScript and d3 based visualization of
this or something like that I'll
definitely buy a case of beer for anyone
who I can sort that out or for that
matter anyone who checks it into the
devtools hopefully one of those two
things will happen to happen soon so
once you've actually zoomed in enough
and been able to identify some data
there and let's say you can actually see
that some things aren't getting
optimized when you want them to be
optimized first you don't know what code
that actually is you just you can see a
red barn you want to know what functions
they are so one way to get more info on
that is to run that same log file
through a slightly different command it
spits out a text file that looks like
this at first glance this looks a lot
like the data you get out of the regular
devtools profiler panel it's just kind
of a you know top-down heavy heavy to
light you know list of functions but it
has this extra little annotation
the asterisk is telling you that those
functions are running optimized in the
vm the lack of an asterisk tells you
that the function is running unopposed
and that is probably the red bar you're
looking at if you're seeing a lot of red
in your code it's going to be the heavy
function that's not optimized so now you
know which function the next question is
why is it not running optimized because
that can be a total mystery you could
make random changes and see if it fixes
things but if you're really desperate
you'd like to get some kind of clue as
to what's up and why it didn't get
optimized and that's where the third v8
logging truck comes in you run chrome is
slightly different flags in it it
actually barks out a bunch of stuff to
the console so you redirect it to a text
file and when you search that text file
you start seeing things like this and
you can actually see names of some of
your own functions in there and it'll
actually give you the reason in sort of
shorthand it'll give you the reason why
that function was ineligible for being
optimized or maybe in some cases why it
was optimized and then later on kicked
back and D optimized because it violated
some assumption that v8 was making about
its control flow this stuff is again
this is like on the extreme end of the
crazy scale because of not only the
complicated setup but also the data file
that you get here is pretty hard to
parse through the reasons that it lists
are often pretty vague and from what
I've seen it seems to not always list
all of the functions that you expect it
to list so sometimes it may be missing
information so it's pretty hard to parse
through if you don't know the v8 source
code which I certainly don't but
hopefully a lot of this data is going to
begin bubbling up you know into views
like chrome tracing and even the
devtools proper be you know as this
stuff coming out of v8 gets richer and
more stable and there's just so much
need for this to be exposed at a higher
level so i think we'll start seeing more
of this in the near future in actual you
I oriented tools so with all that said
sometimes you should ignore everything I
talked about and in fact everything
anyone says about JavaScript performance
because some things that sometimes there
are reasons to not focus on javascript
performance at all but the focus on
other things so reason number one I'll
give you three what I think are three
good reasons to not be always focus on
JavaScript performance number one is
that sometimes network i/o performance
is a much much bigger issue page load
time is often one of the number one
complaints about slowness that users
have and that often has very little to
do with JavaScript
has to do with network performance and
minimization things like that and there
are a couple really cool browser API to
let you get an info about page load
timing like this one that's information
that is is really hard to gather either
on your server or using regular
JavaScript without the help of this
browser API because you don't have
insight into the whole flow from the
time the user clicks a link to the time
that this stuff renders on screen the
browser knows that whole timeline and
they can save the data and give it to
you you can also get data broken down by
individual resources so you can use
these api's to get at the loading time
of individual image files individual
script files all that stuff the working
group that oh sorry there's one thing is
going to say about this is that
perceived performance is often more
important than actual performance so
when you're talking to a server and the
server might be slow doing that in a way
that's asynchronous and doesn't block
any part of your pages you I is is a
huge huge win if you look at the way
that you know things like Google Docs or
Trello or gmail do sames asynchronously
in the background of that blocking stuff
it makes it feel a lot faster even
though it could take several seconds for
the server to actually respond quick
aside the w3c working group that
produced those resource timing API is
that I showed you on this slide here
they're also beginning work now on a
number of AP is for rendering
performance for measuring that stuff
programmatically so they're beginning to
basically standardized things like the
scrolling simulation api that i
mentioned earlier with the chrome
telemetry stuff so i think we'll see a
lot of cool stuff out of this working
group in the future this is also the
group that produce requestanimationframe
so we've gotten a lot of good things out
of them already i think reason number
two is that maybe your code is good
enough already i think that sometimes
there's a tendency in some parts of
JavaScript community to sort of jump the
gun about performance for example if
someone might see code like this and say
oh geez you can't do that look at this
you're entering a function closure every
iteration of loop and I mean look what
James perf calm says about this it's way
faster to just use a regular for loop
and while there's some truth to that if
you look at the time scale on these
things sometimes you're talking about
the difference between 12 mini 12
million iterations per second and 80
million iterations per second and if the
context of your code is for example
creating a menu you know that that
difference makes no difference right if
you're only it going to iterate
couple hundred even a couple thousand
times that's that difference is just
totally water under the bridge so you
know it's not a best practice to make
your code harder to read or harder to
maintain just for speculative
performance gains the best practice is
to identify specific bottlenecks that
your users actually care about and make
fixes for those in a targeted way lastly
reason number three engineering time is
a finite resource and you should spend
time on what's most important so here
are some things that might be more
important than working on performance a
pretty good list right but sometimes
performance really does matter and when
that is the most important thing to work
on I hope that the tools i showed you
will make your life easier when you get
desperate with performance stuff thanks
