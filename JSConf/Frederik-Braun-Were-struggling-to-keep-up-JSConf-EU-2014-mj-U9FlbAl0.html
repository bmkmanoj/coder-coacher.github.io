As you see it is called,
we are struggling to keep up.
Something brief about me.
My name is Frederik. I work for Mozilla in
Berlin. I have an email address and so on
if you are interested.
Why am I here? I want to make the web more
secure. I hope by educating about security.
As it reads in the Mozilla manifesto number
5. Individuals security and privacy on the
internet are fundamental and must not be optional.
What will I talk about? An introduction. Then
past, present and future of security features
in the browser. For you as developers.
First of all the web and the browser.
I work for Mozilla. Everybody says and keeps
on saying in meetings. The web is the platform.
It is true. The web is not going away. And
it is becoming more and more featurish.
I don't know if you recall Html 4, hypertext,
linking to text. That's not what is the web
today.
The web is experienced through rich applications
like Gmail, Twitter, Facebook. There is a
graph how it developed.
I don't need you to read it. The high level
picture you should get is, it has developed
and evolved a lot.
So for example, Html 5. Which contains stuff
like canvas, full screen, Xml requests. And
all these things that you need for rich applications
on the web.
That of course lives us with the topic Xss.
It is what the buffer overflow was in the
1990's. Every application or service application
was vulnerable to buffer overflow.
But since 2007, the most common vulnerability
in applications seems overall vulnerabilities
are Xss applications.
Not for a reason. Because the most popular
applications are web applications.
It doesn't leave us with something small.
It is also in your phone. On your tv. And
maybe on the plane if you came here.
And given all these applications platforms.
And extensions. Xss is more than these alert
box, but some way to control all these devices.
Hopefully not on a plane though.
I do know it can make your phone ring. There
are phones that make it do.
I want to talk about authentication, authorisation,
frames.
Http was stateless. You issue a request to
a server and you get a response and you may
do that again and get another response. The
server doesn't know and care who you are.
And will not remember you are the same person
as previously.
This was solved with cookies. As you hopefully
all know.
The server generates an ID. And keeps track
what you are doing.
One of the problems here is, everything is
sent in the clear. Of plain text. If you use
public wifi in a coffeeshop for example, it
exposes al the authentication data. And even
more.
And bankstatements. As we know, Https is the
solution. Some say it is example. I have a
website with Https. There are certificates
for free.
Also Google will rank you higher if you use
Https.
It is in. When you type in the domain, it
will go to Http. And that is even more or
less undetected. The user is not supposed
to know if there is a lock or green lock or
something different.
Also Https doesn't give full guarantee. You
may have ads or widgets.
Not everything is protected. We'll come back
to this. I want to introduce you to something
that is the same origin policy.
In 1996, when Javascript was invented and
Frames, the idea was to have something in
the web and include as a component in the
webpage.
Reusing existing code, which is good. It was
realised it is a bad idea if you are able
to include something and read everything within
it.
Imagine go to a webpage that reads the bankstatements.
It was forbidden.
We shouldn't allow that from other origins.
So you have to be on the same origin. What
is an origin? It is more than just the domain.
It is the scheme and the host and the port
of a Url.
And we take that as a criterium to compare
to things. The frame. Just to make it clear,
I want to walk through examples. I want it
to be interactive. Knod or shake your head.
Example.Com. And there is another Url in the
table. I hope it is big enough.
Is it the same origin? A lot are nodding.
It is the same.
What about this one? Everybody shaking.
Https is not Http. Http is using a different
port than https.
What about this one? About:blank.
The domain is not blank. What is the port?
What are we doing? What do you think?
Some people shake their head. A lot of people
are not doing anything.
It is mostly allowed. If you open a popup
you have done access granted. By reading things.
Everything in there is basically, has been
written by you or an empty page.
It is not going to contain bank statements.
What about the next one?
I see thumbs down there. I have been tricking
you. Internet Explorer doesn't care about
the port.
If you change document.Domain, all browners
will stop looking at ports.
So, to summarize the same origin policy, it
is not as strict as we think.
It is a bit weird. It behaves differently.
You wouldn't do it to about:blank.
There is not just 1 same origin policy. There
are multiple scenarios. The policy says, port,
domain, scheme.
And there are also so many bypasses.
Out of the same policy. And then there is
a hack that is meant to bypass the same origin
policy. Which I don't recommend you to use.
If you want to learn more, I can suggest one
of these talks. From 2012. The other one is
from me. I had to write a very long thesis
about the same origin policy. Presented in
Hamburg 2013.
We'll come back to the topic of frames.
But let's go on to the present.
I want to talk about Https and frames. It
was opt in. There is Http strict transport
security.
It was invinted in 1994. And this year is
from 2012.
We have realised it is a bad idea to have
Https.
There is a way to enforce, the browser will
always use https.
It works like this. You do start off with
http. And the client sends a request. Server
responds. Hopefully forwarding to https. And
once it is established, strict transport security.
It comes with a time to live. Cash this for
an amount of time. When it has not elapsed,
continue using https. That's neat. The browser
will always use https.
What about this one? Plaintext again. A network
that is stripping off the forward.
There are a lot of tools that are easy to
use that are doing that. They setup a proxy.
And the user isn't using it.
There is a proload list. Firefox and Chrome
share the list and synchronise.
This contains the bit here, let's cache this.
The browser will always use https, without
requiring the first header. This list we have
in the browsers. They are opt in.
So to fill this list, security engineer Adam
Langly working at Google went around security
conferences and said, people, do you want
to be on the list? It is better than what
you have now.
Send me an email.
And you know, this method to maintain the
list is failed. Nobody 
sent an email. It is sad.
I hope, the mails coming in have increased.
Now there is a google form you can do it automated.
If you are using web applications and providing
them to somebody. And you are using https,
consider using script transport security header.
Or get into the preload list.
Now I'm come back to it. The threat model
here is being framed. What we had before.
An innocent user goes to a website and the
website is evil. It does include an iframe.
He is clicking around things. You may have
hoard about this. This is click jacking. A
non transparent thing on top. He thinks he
is clicking a game. He is clicking on the
website and liking stuff.
And there are much more evil things. When
they frame your website.
Here is the funny thing from when the user
is using IE.
It is forcing the browser into a rendering
mode. And potentially legacy vulnerabilities.
Whenever there is somebody going in the website
with this. IE will say, this is an old website.
I will use IE 7, which is about 7 years.
And of course, this is inherited to the frames.
If somebody goes to a website framing your
website. Your website will behave differently.
Which is bad potentially. It will look bad.
And there is more we can do with frames.
I don't know if you have Xss filters and know
how they work. It is built into the browser,
can help an attacker. How do they work?
The filter is looking at the request and response.
If there is something smuggled into the webpage.
The filter will say, the script has been in
the response. I'm sure this is an attack.
It is not passed as script.
The user is secure. What if there was static
Html or Javascript in the page. But it doesn't
have value. Making up a fake. And sending
it to the server. The server doesn't work
with it. It ignores it.
The browser will think, this is the same,
I'm going to remove it. What if it is a security?
You don't want your website to be framed.
Key is to send a header that sends: Deny.
If you do need it. Allow from this or same
origin. You know what same origin means.
It is a security problem we had for 12 years.
It was implemented in 2008. It was only published
last year.
There is much more. A person could do to your
website and the users.
If you allow it to be displayed in a frame.
I wrote a long p paper. There will be links
on the slides. If you are interested, I recommend
you look into that.
I want to jump into the future of browser
security.
I have to talk about frames again. Cross site
scripting. And I want to talk about content
delivery. Which are so useful.
How do we include untrusted content?
The threat is, we have to show something,
a user upload or from third party, what we
can't control, but we are going to show it.
Or general things. The man in the middle,
could mess with it.
And we all know that cross site scripting
can redirect.
To explain how to do it. I'll introduce you
to Not so much authority.
Access to the frames that are necessary.
In system security theory, we talk about the
principle of least authority.
Only access to the resources that it needs,
nothing more. The least possible resources.
But least authority in a browser is weird.
It has been proven that Html 5, without Javascript...
I wouldn't say. To solve this. There is a
feature, iframe Sandbox. This attribute makes
it safe by default.
It forbids scripts, disallows forwarding of
the outer window. No forms. No plugins. And
no matter what the origin of the content of
the frame to the outer window.
It is a unique and different origin. No matter
what they are in real life. If you want to
mess with Sandbox and you need scripts, you
can make it weaker. I'm not going through
the keywords. It is straight forward.
Let's go on to Xss and fixing it.
Who knows about Csp? Who is using Csp?
Yes.
That's the problem.
Nobody is.
There are great introductions how to make
it work for your web application without having
to rewrite. There are 2 really good talks.
If you are interested. First one is last year,
Mike West. It was referenced by Tim. Previously
before me.
It explains it in a very long way. A colleague
Mark Goodwin went to Sheffield a few months
ago.
And tried to focus on not how it works, but
how to make it work for you. How to make sure
your web application is more secure without
having to rewrite. A few developer tools as
well.
I just want to say, look into the talks. It
is good.
It doesn't make sense for me to repeat.
As I said, I do want to talk about content
delivery.
You include a script from something that is
not under your control. It is highly convenient.
There is something that is most likely in
the browser cache. Other people are using
the same content delivery network. The website
is nice and faster.
But what if someone changes the file? It means,
they can execute script and change everything.
It doesn't mean just for this webpage, but
all in the same origin.
So, the plan is, the idea for the future is
to lock it down with sub resource integrity.
It is yet to be a W3C application.
This is how it looks like.
It doesn't look pretty. What you do is, your
computer hash. If the file changes, you don't
load it.
Problem might be, the whole web application
doesn't work.
It doesn't look much more pretty. But there
is some source. The fast bit. To be in the
cache.
It is tried to load by the browser and the
browser does all the checks. Loads the script.
And checks if it matches. It is not going
to break. It is going to use the source from
your domain, which is probably not in the
cache.
But the website keeps on working.
As I said, feedback is appreciated. We can
talk about it later.
There is much more into it. I don't want go
through the details. This may be an option
for you.
Now I am going to conclude. And say the browser
can help the web application.
There are more improvements on the horizon.
I might want to call it chaotic. There were
basic security checks. Provide encryption.
There are cookies, that works. And then the
web as a platform, rich application platform,
was adopted between 1995 and now, everyone
is using a website for something.
Maybe we shouldn't put the patches on top
and try to think about it when we develop
new things. If you are concerned about your
website, that's a nice dashboard. Gives an
overview of the security features.
If your website looks red, don't feel too
bad.
Thank you for listening. If you have questions,
I will be at the Mozilla hacklounge after
this talk. I don't think there will be time
for questions. Thanks for listening.
