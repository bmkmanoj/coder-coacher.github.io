and before I dive into my talk I have a
quick question for everyone here in the
audience can you please raise your hand
if you've ever organized a meet-up hack
day a node copter a conference anything
that brought developers together alright
cool so maybe maybe one-third to
one-fourth of the people here fantastic
so the title of my talk is a human a
community of people not projects and I
have two very modest goals for this talk
for those of you who didn't raise your
hand I'm hoping that this talk
encourages some of you to get a little
bit more involved in the developer
community where you live or at the very
least just talk to people who are and
find out why they do what they do for
those of you who did raise your hand I'd
like to share a few things that I've
learned about making community
involvement a more sustainable
proposition especially for those of you
who have families and full-time jobs
because it can be really difficult to
balance these things but first a little
bit of caught me to provide some context
for why I'm giving this talk so my name
is Carter and I'm a developer evangelist
for a company called twilio twilio
provides a service for developers that
makes it really easy to programmatically
send and receive text messages and make
and receive voice and voice over IP
phone calls i joined twilio about two
and a half years ago this is actually a
photo of me shortly after I joined the
company people tell me that I've grown
up a lot since then all right so this is
not me this is actually a photo of my
daughter Catherine interestingly enough
was actually taken at a J's comp us in
2012 I was really lucky I was able to
bring Catherine down to this conference
and kind of shore around and show her a
little bit of what her father does for a
living I've been married for just over
five years my wife Kerry and I have two
daughters so you met Catherine and
that's that's a little Emily right there
on the bottom left and the four of us
live in Seattle Washington so we're not
from Seattle
I'm from Washington DC carries from
upstate New York but we moved out to
seattle because i got a job at Microsoft
and I worked at Microsoft for a few
years the last two of which actually
worked on the Internet Explorer team and
Seattle is the home or it was the
location of the first-ever Cascadia j/s
so cascaded jess is a conference that i
founded in 2012 and it's a javascript
conference for for developers in the
Pacific Northwest now you might be
asking yourself how I got into
organizing a conference and in my case
the answer is relatively straightforward
so when i joined twilio in january of
2012 i had never been a developer
evangelist before i really only had a
rough idea of what the job entailed and
shortly after i joined the company it
was explained to me that a big component
of my job was going to be supporting my
local developer community and frankly
that seemed like a really open-ended
thing which meant that it was absolutely
terrifying but also really really
exciting so I had to figure out for me
what it meant to support the Seattle
developer community and I've been a
JavaScript developer since the late 90s
so for me I decided to spend a lot more
time Seattle j/s so Seattle Jas is
Seattle's largest javascript meetup it's
been around for a long time and I just
started going I started talking to
people they're getting to know the
community I started helping out with
organization and during my say like
January to June I kept having the same
conversation with people people were
really frustrated that every time they
wanted to go to a good JavaScript
conference that they get on a plane and
they'd fly to Scottsdale or Amelia
Island or Berlin or Lisbon it just
seemed really weird that there was
nothing like that in the Seattle area
and I and I totally agreed and I talked
to some some community organizers down
in portland and up in vancouver bc and
there was the sentiment that there that
we really wanted something for us so
that's where Cascadia jeaious came from
it was heavily inspired by jay is calm
jayus conf EU l xjs
node calm all of the conference's that
you think of as being the best of what a
developer conference can be and we put
on this event in November of 2012 and it
was just it was a huge success you know
we pulled together just over 200 amazing
people for two days of fun and it was
just one of the most rewarding
experiences I had ever had and the feed
the feedback was very very positive and
people liked lots of different things
you know they like the coffee and they
liked the food but the reoccurring theme
over and over again was that people were
so delighted to meet other people and
not just within the city that they lived
in but um people in Seattle were so
happy to meet other interesting and
amazing people down in Portland Ore up
in Vancouver and I felt that we had
really succeeded in connecting
developers up and down the Pacific
Northwest so I left so the conference
ended and I was on this real high cloud
and I don't know about you but uh you
know I had a fever right I had a fever
and the only prescription was going to
be more events right more conferences
more more opportunities to create
experiences for my fellow developers and
that's all I could think about I started
to think ahead to 2013 and sure enough
2013 was a really really busy year for
me and it was awesome I started off on
in February I launched an event called
Sports hack day so this was a hackathon
but for people who wanted to build
sports related applications and
technologies and I'm a huge sports fan I
don't know how many of you were sports
fans but uh it was just really great to
connect with other people in the area
that loves sports as much as I did and
we held this event during super bowl
weekend and it was awesome so two days
of hacking and then we watched the Super
Bowl ordered a bunch of pizza head beer
is a great time in april i launched a
community resource called seattle hacks
com and this is essentially an online
calendar of events for developers and it
was powered by github pages in Jekyll so
anybody who wanted to contribute could
just fork the repo smita pull requests
and boom they could contribute to this
online resource for developers in
Seattle
of course there was going to be another
Cascadia das right except this time it
was going to be in vancouver british
columbia which was a logistical
challenge for me because I live in
Seattle and I live in America so I had
to think about like how i was going to
organize a conference in another country
but hey why stop at a two-day conference
when you could just put on a whole
week's worth of events so that's what I
did I worked with a bunch of organizers
in Vancouver and we organized Vancouver
dev week a lot like jazz fest right just
a curated series of great events for
developers and to kind of cap off a very
busy 2013 me and my friend Ryan opened a
co-working space for developers in
Seattle we wanted to take everything
that you all that people love about
meetups and love about conferences we
wanted to create a space where people
could have where developers could have
that experience every single day so this
was a really busy year and I was very
proud of everything that I had worked on
and I was honestly feeling really great
and I couldn't wait for 2014 I thought
2013 kicked ass I can't wait to see what
2014 is going to look like and i will i
will show you i will show you what the
first four months of 2014 looked like
yeah yeah grumpy cat right is very mad
and I'm this caught me completely off
guard right I thought I had figured
everything out and I could not
understand why I was having such a rough
first few months the first sign that
something was wrong was that there was
no follow-up to sports hack day people
were emailing me they're like hey Carter
it's February's coming up when sports
hack day and the answer was it wasn't
going to happen it wasn't going to
happen because I was too busy and I
couldn't even imagine like who else
could run it so I just sort of decided
that there wouldn't be another sports
hack day and that was the first sign
that something was kind of wrong but it
wasn't just sports hack day it just
seemed like I was dropping the ball a
lot I was dropping the ball with the
co-working space I was dropping the ball
at work
um and this is just very it was very
unlike me but at the time in the middle
of it I really didn't have a lot of
insight into like why this was happening
it just felt like man like things are
really tough and challenging right now
and I don't know why and things came to
a head in April so I started working
with a remarkable person named Traci
Hines so people who live in Portland
know who Tracy is she's one of the she
come on she doesn't live here anymore
but she used to be one of the most
active organizers in portland and i
started working with her on the next
Cascadia Jas and things started out
great until they weren't and by the time
April world around me and Tracy were not
working well together we weren't
communicating well and she was
incredibly frustrated with me and I was
just frustrated in general I couldn't
understand why things that had gone so
easy in 2013 we're going so hard so
poorly in 2014 so right around this time
I'm flying home from a conference and
I'm in a funk and I just want to read a
book and this is one of my favorite
authors I'm a highly recommend Chuck
Klosterman he's amazing he's funny he
writes about pop culture and music and
sports he's a former columnist for spin
magazine he does write in for the New
York Times Magazine he's great and I
just wanted to get my mind off of all
this stuff so I wanted to read one of
his books and I'm on amazon.com and I
find this book that he wrote called
killing yourself to live the title is
very misleading it's basically about
Chuck going on this road trip across the
US and it looked awesome so I start
reading the reviews and there's this one
review that where there was an excerpt
from the book and it really really
caught my eye and I want to read you the
excerpt so art and love are the same
thing they're the process of seeing
yourself and things that are not you and
I'm not kidding like at that moment on
that plane reading that quote this is
what happened to me
and honestly the people who are sitting
next to me on the plane probably thought
I was having a seizure or something and
I know many of you in the audience are
like I don't get it like that's let's so
let's go back and revisit this right
let's just look at art let's say that
art is the process of seeing yourself
and things that are not you that's very
reasonable to me right if I'm an artist
you know if I'm carving a sculpture or
writing a book or creating a painting
maybe part of what is driving me as an
artist is to see myself manifested in
these inanimate objects that are not me
you know maybe that's a part of the
creative process and that really
resonated with me and it resonated with
me specifically in reference to all
these things that I had worked on and I
started to think back to the first
Cascadia j/s and it really started to
examine what were the things that I
cared about what were the things that I
spent time doing what captured all of my
energy and my focus and it was stuff
like this so for those of you who love
coffee that's that's pour-over coffee
that's one of the finest ways that you
can enjoy really really good coffee and
I spent weeks scouring Seattle looking
for the best pour-over coffee for
Cascadia jas and it didn't stop there
right you know I was meticulous about
you know what vendor to use for the
hoodies and like you know what food
trucks to get for the lunch and you know
and this was true of all these things
that I had worked on and look you might
be thinking like hey like so what you
know since when is it news that people
work on things that they're passionate
about or that reflect their values like
you're exactly right this is not news
but was what was news to me was that I
was completely focused on all of those
things and all of those details and I
had completely just forgotten about all
the people that I worked with to make
these things happen there's not a single
thing that I worked on that would have
happened without all of the people on
this monitor plus many more people that
I couldn't list and when I really
examined how thoughtful i was about
these people how much time that I
and getting to know them did I even
understand why they were helping did I
understand what they were passionate
about the answer in many cases was no
and I felt very ashamed when I realized
this because I think unwittingly I had
treated many of these people as a means
to an end and that's just a terrible
thing to do and it's very unlike me and
so I absorbed this and you know I just
decided that like wow that'll never ever
happen again and and I I put it into
practice so in August we were you know
the next Cascadia jess was going to
happen and I really focused on the
people running the conference right
Tracy and Ben and Blaine and all these
wonderful people that were putting on
this conference I just focused on like
what i could do what could I do to help
them put on the best conference that
they could put on and I think because of
that I had the best experience that I
had ever had at a Cascadia j/s it was
remarkably rewarding to just see what
Tracy and her team could do and to sort
of participate solely for the purpose of
removing obstacles from their path like
that was really really rewarding for me
but beyond being rewarding for me it was
also just the best Cascadia j/s ever by
all objective measures and I think that
that's the case because I took a step
back and I let someone else execute
their vision and they took the
conference to a place that I didn't know
it could go and it was really rewarding
to see that happen so following the
conference i I just I really I really
was you know I really wanted to sit down
and think about everything that had
happened and I also reached out to a
bunch of other people who organize
conferences and hackathons and just
other events in the developer community
and I talk to people like Chris Williams
and Alex Sexton and I'm very grateful
for them taking the time to talk to me
because I wanted to understand like low
because this just
you know this is just a meeting or you
know are other people running into sort
of similar issues who are sort of who
are involved in the community and it
turned out that there were a lot of
common issues that were that were kind
of pervasive throughout the developer
community so so whether you know you're
you're thinking about getting involved
in the community and I certainly hope
that you do because it's I think it's
one of the most rewarding experiences
you can have or you're just neck deep in
it right now I'd like to share a few
things I learned about being a little
bit healthier and a little bit happier
doing this kind of stuff number one you
need to watch for signs that you're
doing too much and I've got a couple
suggestions on this one your work or
your family's start to suffer right so
every day you've got so many hours and
you've got time with your family time
doing your job and then maybe you've got
some time left over to work on your
community obligations when that
community stuff starts to creep out it
is necessarily going to impact like
either your family or your work or both
so just really kind of keep your keep
your eye unlike how things are going at
home or at work you can't remember the
last time you said no I'm I am guilty of
this to this day I'm terrible at saying
no but I'm trying to get better when
people reach out to me and there's they
want some help my instinct is to say yes
I will help you because it makes me feel
really good but you have to learn how to
say no and saying no isn't shutting
somebody down the odds are that when
someone asks you for help you're not the
best you're not the person that could
actually help them the most the odds are
that there's someone else out there who
can help them much more than you can and
if you're really involved in the
community and you know presumably you
have an idea of who that might be so
when these requests come in don't think
of no is shutting people down just try
to think of who could help them more and
lastly this is just a giant red flag if
you work on something that you care
about you can't readily identify who
could take it over if you had to step
away then you're doing too much
and you're putting what you care at what
you care about at risk so you know if
you if you can't think of who should
take over that's a huge red flag I'm it
means that you're not you're not really
sharing enough with the people that
you're working with number two how to
identify and find awesome people I wish
that I could tell you that I have a
foolproof blueprint for doing this I
don't but I have a couple suggestions
that I think or that have been really
helpful for me one really actively pay
attention to the amazing things that are
going on all around you and this sounds
obvious but for me it wasn't because I
was heads down working on my stuff and I
had blinders on and I was very myopic
and you need to take the blinders off
and look around because people are doing
awesome things I basically met Tracy for
the first meaningful time when I went
down to Portland because she was running
node bot stay in portland and i met her
and i saw firsthand what an amazing
organizer she was and that never would
have happened had it not taking the time
to just take the organizer hat off and
just go enjoy something in the community
also don't be afraid to ask for help a
lot of people think that this is a sign
of failure and it really isn't if you
want asking for help there's nothing
more than raising your hand and saying
hey I'm really passionate about
something and I'd love to work with
somebody on this that's all that is two
things to keep in mind though you must
be explicit about what you want help
with to say that you know you just need
help with your meetup is not helpful to
say that you need help say that you want
to record the talks at your meet up and
post them online is incredibly helpful
and you need to be public about this
right don't just talk to a few people
you know put it out there and as public
a manner because the truth is like you
might not know a videographer um there
might not be a videographers directly
connected to you or someone that you
know but if you just put it out there
publicly you'll discover people that you
didn't know and they'll want to help you
and then lastly and I'm really still
working on this um take the time to get
to know people to get to know these
people
like as people like understand what they
care about what they're passionate about
this is I know that if I had done a
better job of this I never would have
accidentally treated people as a means
to an end but I didn't I was really busy
and I didn't prioritize getting to know
the people that I was working with and I
think that's a huge mistake and then
really this is the third thing and this
is sort of the real crux of my talk and
this is just a frame of mind right stop
thinking like I'm working on a project
and start thinking like you're working
with people I'm starting to do this for
the next cascade ajs I'm trying to be
much less focused on where it's going to
be who's going to talk all of those
details and I'm trying to be much more
focused on Who am I going to work with
on this remarkable event and then the
details will come later but in order to
do this I think you need to do a few
things one you need to learn how to let
go I guess what no one here has a kid
under six if you have children under the
age of six you know who that is and you
know why this is funny or annoying but
no you really do have to learn how to
let go it if you if you can't figure out
how to let go of these precious little
things that you've created you'll never
succeed in really sharing them with
people number two you need to get
incredibly serious about documentation
and communication and I don't care what
tools you use Tracy used github and IRC
almost exclusively for Cascadia j/s the
tools don't matter but you have to get
everything out of your head and into a
place where you can work asynchronously
with people this is just incredibly
important in terms of sharing and then
the last thing and this is really funny
so I work for a platform company and we
like to say a twilio that twilio is
incredibly uninteresting in a vacuum
like no one cares what school is what
developers build on top of the platform
um and I think other people who work at
platform companies will you know will
sort of agree with that and it's weird I
had to relearn this in the context of
community like I had to relearn like it
wasn't about what I did by myself like
it was what it was what I could help
other people do like I had to really
redefine what success looked like for me
and I'm glad I did because honestly you
know my involvement in the developer
community has been some of the most has
provided me with some of the most
rewarding experiences that I've ever had
in my life and I'm very grateful that I
ended up in this place so if you're
thinking about getting involved and I
really hope you are or if you're already
very very involved just just remember
these three things one don't try to do
everything yourself to find people who
share your passion and three focus on
what you can help them accomplish and
lastly for anyone here who might
consider doing this for a living please
come find me in the hallway track I'd
love to talk about evangelism love to
talk about to Leo and that is it for me
thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
