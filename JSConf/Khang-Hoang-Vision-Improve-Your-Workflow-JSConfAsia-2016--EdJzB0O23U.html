so I'm calm I'm from Vietnam little bit
about me I am full time react native
software engineer for a company named
employment hero which is HR platform
from Australia before that I make iOS
app and build a server by nodejs so I'm
here today to share with you guys about
tools that curry working on to serve my
daily problem when I do the coding
please notice that I mentioned I will
mention a lot about react react native
Redux but if you from different
backgrounds like angular ember or view
you still take benefit from this talk so
get it like a stock form my tools that I
used in my current workflow so this is
tools that I use daily because I react
native developer so I new chrome dev
tools to debug a new live load as well
as react DEP tune and we Redux their
tuned to time travel and the react hot
daughter you know that tool doesn't
exist in vacuum they exist you solve the
problem
and when I say tools I mean the tools
that help us to improve our productivity
and keep our sanity thing like when we
change UI the page will immediately
update to reflect the changes or we can
easily spin point on the bug stuff like
that there's more tools like run and
webpack crucify grown-up chairs
s-sarah but is that there are a task
runner and a build tool and they are not
the topic so they get started back at a
time when I work on my first website it
was a single page application that we
completely on jQuery and the whole page
with a check at the point 2010 people
thought I crazy because no one did that
except for some big guy like Facebook
Google but I did it anyway and my first
experience when I try to debug is
something like this and you this alert a
lot when I try to debugging like to
understand what is a synchronous thing
come by and if I look but you know it's
work right we tried to I try to to file
the bug and it's work but it's not good
it's not good and then I knew about
chrome dev tools and it really makes my
life easier so this is the chrome dev
tools you can do a lot of do a lot of
stuff on this you can set the
breakpoints check the corn-stack debug
with a minimum minimize code by using
the source map beside that is has many
features like network performance
timeline and let you know about the
information of your page how I get
render JavaScript and see there's
performance and of course is expecting
demand star tinker matter over time but
this was a problem that whenever I
change the code and it's repressed fi to
reverse the page which for me is very
tedious thing and then I find out the
the app named live reload it's claimed
to be a spring the developer to
wonderland a happy land where the
browser turned it a refresh button so
whenever you change your file is we Auto
refresh your web page and if you change
the image URL or just as you test it
just update immediately without fully
refresh your whole page and for your
information react native have the world
you look live reload as a viewing
feature and I'd use it every day so next
let's talk about we have DEP tool so
this is real depth in chrome attention
you can see that you can do a lot of
stuff with it you can see the hierarchy
of your apps you can treat it props the
stage as well as the event listener of
your component and if you if you Redux
you may not need but you know if you if
you use it there's a tool called without
step tool which allow you do a lot of
thing list it can lock your action in
many form and you can see what action
you just be patch with what payload and
which part of your redux star change may
on that action there's a feature called
time travel which is a very cool one
that allow you to go backward something
like undo like for example you have a
login form and you want and when you
click the login button the response from
the server it turns so fast then you
cannot see the loading indicator and
what if you just want to do a UI changes
for that loading indicator so just you
time travel then you can
go back backward so any point of time
from the past I will I will show you
later if I have enough of time and then
we have a library cone react hot reload
you can see on the screen is a how can
how I can enable it on react native so
what it does is that is leverage the web
pack hot mattoon do loads to allow you
to treat your components without losing
the state of your apps for example if
you are working on the payment screen
and when you change is code I mean the
payment screen code
the app will update immediately and you
you still at the same screen but with
the newest code and you don't lose any
stay of your app and anything that you
input in the form still be there and for
me it's a big win because I don't need
to do a whole process like login pick up
the products and then go to the cart and
then checkout fielding the building
information to get on the payment screen
but they're more so let's say you are
feel developer or angular or ember there
are tools that help you to make your
life easier like future a step tool and
inspector angular every circle chair
step tune and a lot more each platform
and framework this has their own dev
tools which have developer is list to
figure out what is the problem and and
how to fix it so the next question is
and we there yet so I mean when I say
that I mean are we happy with our our
our current workflow is there anything
that we can improve on it so the thing
about my wolf
again so it stuck with the mock-up like
designer give you a screen and then
based on that screen I can make react
component react native components based
on that mock-up and then I will
implement some business logic and then I
turn on my hot reload so that whenever I
change the UI called the business logic
the app will change accordingly without
losing state yeah and then when the bug
comes we just you chrome dev tools to to
figure out how we can fix it and it's
the pretty neat right but it's not this
is one thing that we can control is data
from external services for example
respond for an API call like when we
when you do a to-do app break you want
to send a request to the server and then
get a respond back and then render
whatever the server sent back to you but
you do not have the power to to decide
what is a response that you want to
forget and yeah there's a there's a what
around solution such a we can huh coat
the the data or we just need a more
server but those require code changes
and when you find yourself and ups with
you sitting back and forth between the
mouse server and the real API but how
can we so how can we simulate the very 8
places like when the user login five
time we want to show our error message
from the server but do we want to just
login five time to just see the error
message no I don't so I create
a tools actually is a chrome attention I
named it reason here's what it looked
like is there the gift I will play it
right now but what you are seeing is you
can see that is the chrome dev tool and
the reason appear is a panel beside of
the source map and the console and on
the left hand side very dummy
Lucky's login page which allow you to
enter your name and is it is this in the
database is will redirect you to the
dashboard if not and just display the
arrow the first time I will try with the
real API so it returned you and
authorized and then I turn on the mark
then when I click login there's a button
the green one I can click on that and
change the response to whatever I want
so why reason why I make this chrome
attention so with reason you don't need
to have code anything and you can easily
to simulate the complex cases like
imagine that you need you have the form
and the first time the users submit that
form the server will return you repair
time our error message after five second
but the second time it will succeed
how can you simulate that with your
current will flow I think there's no way
except you like change your code I have
caught it but with the vision you can
just type out whatever you want so it
will help you to simulate the responses
the only limitation is your immediate
imagination as
in the future we can have the feature
like those cases we can name it is
scenario and when we find out there's a
scenario that we haven't handled yet we
can just export it I spawned a scenario
form the reason and then send it back to
other developer in your team or your
p.m. and say hey I think there's a case
that we didn't handle it properly and
vision work cross-platform even with the
react native okay so it's time for life
demo okay okay here we are
okay
can you see it right so this is the
example that I get from the Redux
response story so it's a very simple one
just just put the latest news with the
keyword right here
forum reddit so I will try to present
again okay okay I just proved with you
that is actually fetch form radius
server and now what I gonna do is that I
will try to modify the response from the
server okay how I can do that
I will turn it on and then I will click
the refresh okay
so now you see that the whole page is in
the loading state and there's a green
button that his name is released the
request with the ID of the request and
then you just keep whatever respond that
you want
okay here at copy I will pass the
contents after respond sorry it's uh
there's something wrong with the
response stories doesn't highlight and
all the time
okay that's why I think it doesn't work
because I miss some No okay so this one
like this okay this one so sorry about
this
I just happened because I just copy and
paste it but basically what it does is
that when whenever I click return the
mock object is will respond the data
that I just enter instead of going to
the greatest server and and fetch that
how can we fix it can we have one minute
that I could lie to fix it it's very
cool and I really want to show with you
I are gonna do is I just checked the
scene tag because it's a JSON so if it's
not in the correct format as we crash
the app okay a lot of okay so it's
there's a lot of you know it should be
like instead of being like this is to be
like double collect this and because of
the editor so we cannot change
Oh actually we can yeah
okay so I will save this one for if you
have if you want to see it just comes to
me after this talk and we will I will
show you about this demo because I
pretty sure that when I click return
it's not gonna work so you have to
option whether you want to return the
mock object or you can forward it
forwards mean that it will fetch the
real API instead of return your mouth
later you have time for for me to fix it
yeah I think a minute we have I kind of
computers now about the result okay I
will try to do a fast way I can I just
want to bring out hello jazz conference
give me one minute it's not that I just
give up
okay so I will go to just one double
click on that okay
copy this vodka we crazy okay we trying
to modify this a little bit
just hold on okay here okay
praise to the tender hearts 10 second I
almost there okay got it
so then we turn on the mark again and we
do the refresh and there's but done here
I'll pass pass
yep it's as I did this mean that is
correct
wish me luck
not okay but I will show you later I
promise okay that bags do you can check
the code at this link so it's a Hong
Kong Stuart vision and with that I will
eyes thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
