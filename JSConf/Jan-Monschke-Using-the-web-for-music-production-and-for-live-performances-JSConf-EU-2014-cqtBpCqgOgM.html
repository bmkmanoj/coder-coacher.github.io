using the web for music production and
live performance and as you already said
I'm Yan I'm the death toll on Twitter
and that might be important later I'm a
front-end developer from Berlin I'm not
I don't have a music background but I'm
very passionate for music I keep saying
that but actually it's wrong
in 2004 I had this band well we had this
website and we didn't have songs but we
were geeks and we know how to make
websites and we want to have an awesome
website we had like an awesome table
layout going on here and we had the best
name the hybrid monkeys apparently we
didn't know what PNG alpha was if you
look at the colors here well so that's
that's my music of backgrounds not
really fancy but audio on the web also
has like a dark history if you look for
example at BG sound who here knows the
background sound yeah we've all been
there done that
like you could use it for MIDI and the
background of your page Wow then you had
the possibility to do like to use flash
or Java to to replay songs on your
website but it's not it doesn't really
feel nice because it's not the web
technology like so just Java on flash
and then finally we had the audio Tech
and all was amazing because we could
stream audio we could analyze audio and
everything was good until the point
where we wanted to do more than just
listening to music because we also want
to like create filters create music and
so people from Mozilla came up with the
audio data API which was which allowed
you to create music but
not really nice way than the spec had
some flaws so Chris Rogers from Google
came up with the Web Audio API and
that's where we are right now it's an
awesome API and when I looked at this it
kind of looked like the history of
layout hang on the web as well because
in the beginning we had frames which is
like background sound nobody uses it
anymore I hope and then we advanced to
table layout to object embed so we know
table layout works so this object but
it's not really the nicest thing to use
so then we advanced to float layouts so
everything was nice but you still have
to use some hex like clear fixes and
then we had the audio data if you and
read flexbox version 1 which we then
dropped and we had flexbox so that's the
history of audio on the web and so there
Web Audio API basically gives you a
low-level access to all things audio you
can create sounds from scratch you can
manipulate sounds with filters you can
time sounds precisely you don't have to
use set timeout or any of that it's very
precise and tons of other cool stuff
that I will not mention like spatial
audio like you have like for 3d games if
you need like an audio source coming
from that direction with that intensity
it's right there then you can just use
it so there are many demos with Web
Audio API but I kind of wanted to make
like a real software with the Web Audio
API and I was still in uni and so I had
a nice professor and she let me come up
with a nice title for thesis it's
building a collaborative music
production environment using emerging
web standards which basically means what
I wanted to do was to create a music
production software that runs in your
browser and it says collaborative so
because I wanted to make it
collaborative because we're on the web
so we could use web technology to make
like bands interact if they work
remotely and the first thing I did was
because I was in academia as to analyze
things first
I had to look at the audio editors are
there like because they've years of
development best practices and they have
common interface patterns I wanted to
get like a minimum feature set because I
had six month of time and I needed to
find like what do I need to do to make
people use it and so I looked at for
example GarageBand you have like you
have the controls over here you have
like tracks you have previews of the of
the songs looks kind of easy to use and
then if you look at Ableton which is a
more professional software you can see
the same pattern here you have like some
controls over here you have the tracks
also here and some previews and the same
image is in all the others as well like
in reason so analyzing audio editors you
have a timeline left right you have
previews and depending on content
they're different if you have drums it's
not a waveform or if you have like a
recording it's a waveform you have
tracks as rows and what you need is a
way to record stuff and you need to be
able to import stuff so that's two of
the basic features also you need like a
drum machine so people can come up with
awesome songs and you need a synthesizer
for nice melodies so that's what I
needed to do and this is how it looks
like in the end so you can see the
pattern here you have like the controls
you have the tracks
you have the previews this is a
synthesizer this is a drum track but as
I said before that's one more thing
because all the other editors were
missing collaboration and this editor
has collaboration built in and this is
what I want to demo now okay know before
I want to talk about why do we need this
why do we need collaboration it's
awesome for remote band brainstorming
imagine your like and a band with a guy
from London and Berlin and you could
just jam and you wanna have Auto safe an
auto backup which is a big problem as
well with this one problem it's
certainly not offline the syncing and
I'm sorry team hoodie
well offline first so demo time let's
show this so I will just go into the
editor really quickly open this one open
the communication panel oh hey guys so I
want to introduce you to my brother my
brother Haney Oates
say hi I hope you can hear me do
something perfect yeah
needs us right now in my hometown in the
west of Germany and then you will my
flatmate from Berlin hey well how are
you doing
say something oh yeah you can't say we
do something so beautiful so normally
you could see my face here I don't know
what it's not working but are you guys
ready to jam on something you can't hear
the voices because they have their
instruments plugged in and you will only
hear the instruments so whatever they
say yeah go for it guys go for it
awesome we see you later
so because I want to show you how that
Jam this might take some time I want to
show you the editor and I want to show
you that it's really working so I have
the editor here I have a synthesizer
track I have a drum track and I have an
audio track so synthesizer if a double
click here I can edit the synthesizer
notes I can make them longer whatever
you have a lot of settings for the
synthesizer here like you can synthesize
those made up of oscillators that create
the sound and you can define the types
of oscillators you have a lot of
settings here and I would try to play
something it's not really awesome but
just so we have an idea of how this
sounds like
so yes some filters that change the
sound and yes like a an oscillator which
is not playing and you know at the
moment
so this is the built-in synthesizer and
then we have the the drum machine if you
double click here you can edit the drum
machine here and you can see the
previews updating here and here and you
can just I don't know let's let's just
play the drums this is the interface is
timed with set timeout and set interval
and I was it I'm sorry but the sound is
time - in the Web Audio API because if
you have a drama that is timed with the
set timeout your band is gonna go
nowhere because it will be all the time
it would be like 10 milliseconds off and
then it adds up to the end and then just
be horrible so you can do that in the
editor for example and you can have like
different patterns like this one that's
cool and you can also just play audio or
you can record stuff this is what I'm
going now
this is done with getusermedia so I need
to allow the microphone input perfect
it's working so you can see that's the
signal coming and I guess I will just
gonna say hello J's corn then I can
upload the recording I have it then here
in the file browser I would drag it in
and I can arrange it a bit and then I
can just so the play button I soloed
this one because it doesn't really work
together the played button will then
trigger the global playback and it might
sound something like hello
okay but this is not showing the
collaboration feature so the color
collaboration works like this so I have
another instance here open here and I
can just add a new track the layout is
kind of broken now and I edit it here
and it's immediately is he over here and
I can edit here and it will show up here
so it's like Hello J's conf and then
it's there everything I do is synced in
real time using the different
differential synchronization algorithm
if you want to know more about it just
ping me afterwards
it's kind of complicated and so
everything was sync all the time and so
that is what my friends are like my my
flatmate and my brother are doing right
now and we can just go back and check
how far they are I hope something that
it works well no let me just talk to
them so my brother's gone
so it's not working oh we can't hear him
yeah oh he's gone as well well let's see
let's see if they've recorded something
oh that's cool
so we obviously we agreed on a song that
they're gonna make and I would just now
do what they would have oh no
something's happening some things I
wanna okay okay so this is we're now
editing this stuff faster we'll perfect
that's easy
so this will be the guitar I guess
because I know I'll turn it up a bit and
then it will turn the drums down a bit
and then move it a bit hear it see that
works so maybe you remember the song
awesome awesome
they just made that
let's say bye
it kind of worked awesome awesome
see you later you you you have a beer
for free at the party Oh my brother's
coming back too late perfect okay so
that worked very well so that was the
end result of my thesis and I think you
can already kind of use it but I also
want to talk about live music
performance and how can you do live
music performance in the Web Audio API
you can for example use your instrument
like a guitar plug it in use the API for
amplification and for effects we've seen
that yesterday is your memo did it in
the introduction on top of that young
footage did the life he life coded the
background track was with his to life
coder but I want to focus on using MIDI
devices to control your applications so
too for example control my editor and I
want to introduce you to the band The
Glitch Mob which is one of my most
favourite bands everything that you see
right there is they are an electronic
panic tronic music band and they do
songs only with MIDI devices even the
drums that you can see right now is MIDI
and it kind of sounds like this
so you can hear like you have some drum
parts you're some vocals that are being
invoked by a sampler and I thought I
want to do that as well
so this setup looks like this you have
the three guys they have their drums and
they talk MIDI to your software so the
problem is neither do I have three
people capable of doing that including
me nor do I have the MIDI instruments
and nor do I have the software well
turns out you can do that on your own as
well so this is one of my most favorite
DJ's from Japan his name is broken haze
he is demoing something on his iPad and
you can see it's only him performing and
that inspired me a lot it sounds
something like this
and he's doing that alone on stage with
drums and his iPads and it's just
amazing so I thought if he can do that
alone maybe I can do that and what I
needed for that is the web MIDI API
which is reinvent again if we talk about
MIDI it's not shitty MIDI background
stuff it's the protocol for digital
instruments that send data to your
application but the media I hear isn't
an early stage you have to set flags and
I think it only works in Chrome right
now Firefox people but the awesome thing
is Oh No
you've seen nothing the awesome thing is
the web MIDI API is developed in Japan
and if you know the Japanese culture
they're kind of freaky and I love that
so they really love the web media appear
and they do tons of with it and
they even came up with a mascot it's
called media P it has two MIDI outputs
here and it has keys here and it's all
over the world with in the web that's
not enough so they made an animation
high media P oh yeah well so enough
about that so I thought I need to use
this and so let's talk about jazz live
performances last year I did a live
performance at recheck Jess I was using
the game controller API and that was
kind of cool as well and then if you've
been to this year's reject Jess you
might have seen the like the world from
me of the semicolons if not you have to
check out the video later they were
using or I'm part of a band we were
using the Web Audio API as well and
obviously you've seen the introduction
yesterday and that was all done in Web
Audio and it was amazing and I hope that
you are ready for another demo that I
will do right now and I need to plug in
my iPad just bear with me
bitte oh and need to put this on
yeah
as companies ah here we go so I hope
this works
enjoy this I hope I'm not being sued
afterwards
that was basically it but wait
well yeah yeah so sorry sorry
so thanks if you want to check out the
semicolons go to the slides if you want
to check out my brother's band check
check out the link in the slides and
please check out the glitch mop and
broken eyes they inspired me a lot to do
this thank you
