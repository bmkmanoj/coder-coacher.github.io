want to learn how to make a nap my
name's Nick and I'm gonna teach you
everything you need to get started
alright let's go ahead and continue our
Swift learning here in this lecture
we're gonna be learning about strings
and intz now to kick this off I'm going
to tell you something that will blow
your mind
variables and constants can hold more
than just numbers they can also hold
text so let me go ahead and show you
what this looks like so let's go ahead
and delete what we have let's make a new
variable that's gonna hold some text for
us so if I say var and I want to make a
variable that holds the weather for
example I can save our weather is equal
to and if I want it to be equal to
system text I just go ahead and type it
like sunny but you'll notice when I do
this I get an error from X code and
that's because any time you're going to
be using text you have to put double
quotes around the text that you want so
here we're saying VAR weather is equal
to double quotes sunny you could put a
whole sentence inside of here if you
want like I could say it is sunny
outside just like that
you could put numbers inside of here
like I could say the temp is 68 degrees
or you know whatever want any sort of
text that you want you can put it inside
of here so all I'm trying to show you
here is that variables and constants can
hold text and because this is a variable
if you want to change the weather I'm
gonna go back to in a simple example
here where I just say you know this is
sunny if I want to update the weather to
say this is now you know things have
changed and now it's cloudy I can
totally do that I just got to make sure
I have the double quotes around that and
that is completely valid and just like
before if I try and change this to a
constant it's gonna say Brant
you can't update weather any more
because it's a constant once you've said
weather is equal to sunny you cannot
change it but I like to be able to
change things so I'm gonna change this
back to a variable okay
so now you know that variables can hold
numbers and they can also hold text now
I'm going to tell you about strings and
intz they're base
just fancy names for what you've learned
so a string is a piece of text in a int
is a whole number that's really all it
is these are just kind of the
programming terms that you've got to be
able to know in order to work with Swift
so when I say var whether is equal to in
quotation sunny I've created a variable
named whether that is a string variable
because string means text that means
it's holds you know a string it holds
text if I come down here to keep in sort
of this weather mode that we're in if I
create a variable called temp to hold
the temperature I can say temp is equal
to 68 so now the temperature this
variable called temperature is equal to
68 degrees so what I've created here is
a int variable so remember an int just
means that is a whole number and so int
is short for integer but everybody sort
of refers to an it as an int so that's
what that's all about and these are
called types because they're a specific
type of a variable right so a string
variable a int variable there's other
types like there's a double variable
there is a boolean variable you're going
to learn about all these different kinds
but for now I just want you to know
these two these are the most common ones
that you're gonna see inside of your
code now something that's important to
notice is that once you've created a
variable to be one specific type you
can't change it later on so for example
if I try and say you know what I want
weather to be equal to a string here so
I say weather is equal to 68 for example
Xcode is gonna yell at me it's you know
oh I created a variable let you know I
should be able to change this over time
well no you can't change it from a
string to an int that's a big no-no in
the swift world you have to you know if
it's gonna be a string you can update it
to be a different string if you want to
- you know now say it's like cloudy or
something like that but you can't change
it to a number and same goes the other
way so if I create my temperature which
is equal to like 68 or should I say 98
degrees shout out to the boy band you
know I can't now say something like
temperature is equal to sunny or
something like that
because we're gonna have an issue it's
like hey you said this was going to be
an int variable you can't
change it to a string variable okay
so there you've got it this is I mean
basically what you learned in this
lecture is that you can put text inside
of variables in constants if you'd like
to you also learned the technical names
that anytime you use text that is a
string and any times you use a whole
number that is a int so the challenge
that I have for you is I want you to
make two different variables so I want
you to create one variable that is a
string and one variable that is an int
you can choose what the name of those
are gonna be totally up to you whatever
it is but go ahead and create a string
variable in an int variable so pause the
video and go do that okay so if you hit
play again I assume when you went and
did the little challenge here you should
have made a string variable in an int
variable and let me show you what I
would have done here so I'm gonna create
a string variable that's gonna hold my
favorite food so I'm gonna save our food
is equal to and I'm gonna say my
favorite food is probably pizza there's
lots of different types of pizza it's
always a classic with me I love pizza
now I let's go ahead and make a int
variable what's something I could hold a
number of how about mmm my height I'll
do my height for example so I'm gonna
save our height and you know I'm like 6
feet tall a little bit above that so I'm
gonna save our height is equal to 6 okay
so there you know you can see I created
a string variable and an int variable
kind of silly examples here but now you
know about it
one thing that I do want to point out
here for example I said this was my
favorite food with variable names and
constant names they all have to be one
continuous line of text so for example I
can't say for example if I wanted to do
favorite food I can't say favorite food
like this there can't be a space in
between these two names but I could just
say you know for example here favorite
food is equal to pizza that's a totally
valid name in Swift so I just kind of
wanted to point that out if you're ever
going to use a variable name that's
gonna have more than one word typically
you leave the first one lowercase than
anything after that you capitalize the
first
the next word that's not you don't have
to follow that so religiously but I just
wanted you to know about it okay so we
just you know learned one more step here
a swift you might be saying this isn't
too exciting Nick like you know I'm just
learning these little it's in pieces but
I promise things are gonna get cooking
real quick here we have a few more
things to learn and then we're gonna
apply this to an Xcode project keep
coming with me you're learning Swift hey
thanks for watching what are you going
to make leave a comment below and let me
know and if you want to learn even more
I have a full 16 our iOS course that I
created just for beginners where I'll
show you how to make a ton of different
apps including a snapchat clone a
Pokemon go clone and the talk boy it's
usually 200 bucks but if you use the
link below you'll get a YouTube
