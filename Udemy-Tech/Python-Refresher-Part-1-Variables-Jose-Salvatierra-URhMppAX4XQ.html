really great to have you I'm really
excited to go through this quick Python
refresher with you in this video and in
the next we're going to look at
variables and methods so let's start
with the most basic Python building
block the variable in order to begin the
first thing I'm going to do is create a
new file here in anthem and then I'm
going to save it
inside the folder and I'm going to save
it as variables methods dot py now the
dot py is important because it's going
to mean that atom we know this is a
Python file and then it can also make
suggestions and give us some syntax
colors and things like that
now that we've got our file let's begin
the most basic building block of Python
is the variable then a variable is just
a box essentially a box that we can
stick a name on and then we can refer
back to it from anywhere else in the
file for example we can create a box and
call it a and then make it equal to say
5 what we're doing here is just creating
a box with a name a and putting the
value 5 into it we can do other boxes
like B and we can even give it longer
names like my variable is 56
notice that the variable names can
contain letters such as ABC they can
contain underscores and they can also
contain numbers like decimal numbers for
example my tenth variable
now I don't really like using numbers in
variable names because they're not very
descriptive it's just an amount
essentially so I don't tend to use
numbers and variables but nevertheless
you can do that you can not however put
the number at the start you cannot have
a number of the start of your variable
name that's not allowed in Python but
you can have it at the end you can have
it in the middle and so on and also you
cannot do things like using ampersands
in variable names or indeed any other
symbol those things are not allowed in
Python but apart from that you can have
any variable name you want it can be as
long as you want or as short as you want
obviously it has to be at least one
character long
now these four variables here are
numbers but we can also use things like
strings so I'm going to create another
variable called string variable and I'm
going to make it equal to hello in this
case notice that the word hello is just
a set of characters it's just a set of
letters in this case h-e-l-l-o
Python does not know that this is a word
it only knows that this is five
characters but it knows that the first
character is an H and so on so it's
important to remember that python is not
intelligent it does not know whether
things are words phrases and so on
as well as strings with double quotes we
can also do single quote strings
like so so these two are obviously
different because one is hello and the
other one is strings can have single
quotes but there is no difference
between using double quotes and using
single quotes so you can use them in
distinctively although I'd suggest they
you stick to one in particular that you
like more if you prefer single quotes
the new single quotes throughout your
entire program if you prefer double
quotes use double quotes throughout your
entire program
finally as an introduction to the next
video we can also do things like print
these things out so we can print my
variable
and what this will do is it will just
output the value of my variable to the
console so if we go to a console and
navigate to the folder where you've got
your RAM your code your file and then
run it using the command we already know
Python and then variables underscore
methods dot py that's the name of my
file then we'll see that 56 comes out
because that's the value of my variable
notice that declaring variables and
giving them a value does not cause
anything to be printed out to the
console only when we actually print do
things come out of course we can also
print
our string variables and then the via
printed out without the quotation marks
just the content gets printed out
now the print method is as I said a
method and a method is just an action it
does something whereas defining a
variable creates a piece of data it
creates this box and it gives you this
value the print command is a method and
it does something so what it does in
this case is it accepts a variable it
accepts a value and then it prints it
out to the console it puts it out in a
console for the user to see but methods
are not limited to putting things out in
the console they can do many other
things like adding things to a database
displaying a website and many many many
more things that's on the side you can
also print values directly like hello
world or indeed print one two three so
what the print method really is looking
at it's not at whether this is a
variable or not but at the value that
that variable has so in this case when
we print my variable really what we're
doing is print hello when we print
string variable so when we pull my
variable really were doing is print 56
and when we print string variable what
we're doing is we're printing hello so
then we can also print a string directly
it doesn't have to be in a variable we
can also print a number directly it
doesn't have to be in a variable
okay so that's it for variables in the
next video let's look at methods I'll
see you there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
