online and the wordpress for beginners
course today I want to share a video
with you that goes over my favorite
WordPress plugins things that you should
use on your own website plugins that you
should use on your own website and all
of them are free so I'm gonna pass it
over to Phil of the past from another
video to give you my favorite plugins so
the first one that I recommend is a
security plug-in called word fence
security if you don't have a security
plug-in you really need to especially as
you start to grow you don't want your
site to get hacked and with word fence
security it does a ton of stuff
including preventers preventing hackers
from accessing your site blocking out
people who are trying to log into your
website and don't know the passwords it
checks all of your site files to make
sure there's no malicious files
including when you update plugins and
things like that so it's a very crucial
plugin to have there's other ones out
there security is another one that I've
heard is highly recommended but I've had
a lot of success with wordfence and I
really love it and it's pretty easy to
use the second one is Yoast SEO so for
one thing you want your website to be
found by search engines so there's
something called an XML sitemap which
basically tells search engines that
here's your site and here's what it is
and when you and it helps your website
appear in search engines like Google or
Bing Yoast goes a step further and it
actually helps you write SEO friendly
content so when you're writing a blog
article or a creating a page it actually
helps you create more friendly SEO
friendly text and images and titles and
headers and all of that kind of stuff so
it's a really great plugin for that if
you want to speed up your kept your
website WP super cache is a great
plug-in caching your website is really
important or smart especially if you're
using images and you have a very dynamic
website what this plug-in basically does
is it turns
those dynamic animations or different
things that happen on your website page
and it basically creates an HTML version
which is a easier to load version which
most people in the world are going to
see so it makes it a lot faster for them
so that's the third plugin that I would
recommend a COS met is an anti-spam
plug-in for both commenting and contact
forms this plug-in blocks so much spam
that would end up in my inbox or on my
comments on my pages so I really highly
recommend a kismet it's basically
pre-installed for most WordPress users
and highly highly recommended the next
one is speaking of contact forms the
fast secure contact form if you're
looking for a very simple kind of
bare-bones contact form that does great
at blocking spam fast secure contact
form is a good one it's got the Google
reCAPTCHA which you know make sure that
people who are commenting or submitting
information on your contact form are
humans and not spam bots so if you just
need a quick contact page this is a
great one to use all these have to do
you can see kind of with security and
making sure that your website runs as
good as it can and my sixth plug-in that
I want to recommend is backup wordpress
there's different backup plugins that
are free and paid but this is a great
free one if you want to get started you
can schedule out the back up so that it
basically automatically backs up your
website every week every day every month
whenever or however often you want it
this is super important if for some
reason your website does get hacked it
does go down you want to make sure that
you can get it back up and running so
that's super important backup WordPress
is the plugin that I recommend now these
are some more fun ones for the last few
number seven is Gumroad if you're
looking to sell digital products or even
physical products online with your
website Gumroad
is a great easy one to use this actually
works in conjunction with Gumroad
dot-com where you actually host your
digital products or you actually sell
your products but you can use the
Gumroad plugin for WordPress to put nice
overlays and Buy Now buttons on your
website so check out Gumroad com you can
get started for free they take care of
all the payment processing you can even
do subscriptions or recurring payments
or plans or one-time fees for any of
your products or services with Gumroad
pretty link lite is a very love this
plugin I use it all the time for my
YouTube videos when you click on a link
down in the description you usually it's
a pretty link it's basically a link
shortening plug-in or a link redirection
plug-in where you can actually take a
long blog link or any page of yours and
shorten it to something nice easy and
memorable easier to copy and paste to
click on or easy to actually remember
and type in and the other cool thing
about it is that you can track the
people clicking on it so I can see how
many people are actually clicking on
this link and say I want to change where
this link is redirected in the future I
can do that I can edit the pretty link
and this is really good because say for
example I am setting a lot of people to
a specific landing page from YouTube or
from social media and then I want to
change that landing page to something
else I can do that with pretty link just
by changing the redirect so that's a
really good one to have
email marketing if you're new to online
business and you've been researching
this you probably know email marketing
and building your list is so so
important the plug-in and the tool that
I use is convertkit I upgraded from
mailpoet which is a free wordpress
plugin I actually highly recommend
mailpoet if you want to get started
because you can start for free you can
start accepting email addresses start
sending out emails start sending
automated email sequences really easy to
use it's built right within WordPress so
you don't have to jump around to
different platforms but if you do want
to do more things like tagging and
sequencing and different types of
automated funnels convertkit is a great
way to go and
linked to convert kit down below if
you're interested in its my affiliate
link if you want to sign up but I know
extra cost to you you can get started
it's built by bloggers for bloggers
basically for anyone trying to do online
business in the modern world so creating
an email list is so important with your
WordPress website and with convertkit it
makes it super easy next we've got
Google Analytics dashboard is just a way
for you to actually view your stats on
WordPress so you don't have to log in to
Google Analytics to see all of your
latest stats it's just a great way to
keep track of how your website is doing
and if it's growing or not and then
lastly sumo me has some free tools that
you can use to get started on WordPress
it's the plug-in if you search for sumo
me you should find it it's called free
tools to grow your email list social
sharing and analytics by sumo and the
few things that it comes for free are
really great you can do some welcome
mats you can do a hello bar or a top bar

pay for some of the features but to get
started there's some cool stuff you can
