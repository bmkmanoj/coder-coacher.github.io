question number two from the Salesforce
administrator certification exam guide
and this question reads that universal
containers needs to track the
manufacturer and model for specific car
companies how can the system
administrator ensure that the selected
manufacturer provides the values
available for the model so an actual
exam it'll always tell you how many
answers to select and likewise in this
sample question number two and they tell
you that there's one correct answer so
the options are either a create the
manufacturer field as a dependent pick
list and the model as a controlling pick
list B would be to create a lookup field
from the manufacturer object to the
model object C would be to create the
manufacturer field as a controlling pick
list and the model as a dependent pick
list and then finally D is create a
multi-select picklist field that
includes both manufacturers and models
and so on as always you want to approach
these questions through the process of
elimination and figure out which of
these are obviously wrong and that'll
help make your job easier as a test
taker in order to know which ones are
potentially correct so let's look at
this then and we see the first option is
to create dependent and controlling
picklist values and then we also notice
that C deals with that as well whereas B
and D have more to do with
object-oriented approaches and so B for
example has to create a lookup field
from the manufacturer object to the
model objects the idea here is you'd
introduce two custom objects you need to
have a lookup from one to the other and
then finally create a multi-select
picklist field that includes both
manufacturers and models that really
doesn't make sense to me how you would
do that I mean you could do a
multi-select pick list you could have
like all the manufacturers and models of
our autos but that would be a really
unwieldy multi-select pick list and
there would be no way to control like if
I were to select Ford for example as the
manufacturer there's no way to really
control the user selecting only Ford
specific models I guess we could do a
validation rule but that is not part of
this answer so D is really kind of out
of the scope of this question
good approach and then as well with B
you can create a lookout field from the
manufacturer object to the model object
if you did two separate objects for this
but then you would need some sort of I
guess lookup filter to filter out models
that only belong to this manufacturer
you may require maybe even some apex in
order to limit those selections and so
this is not really a good option either
really what we want to do in controlling
what selections are available so that
you can ensure that the selected
manufacturer provides the values
available for the model that's where
you're getting into dependent pick lists
and controlling pick lists so the
options are either a or C and they've
really invert these the options are to
make manufacture field as the dependent
pick list and the model as the
controlling filled or make manufacturer
the controlling field and the model as
the dependent field so we're wanting to
have the selection be the manufacturer
and then based on that selection it
provides the different models so we want
manufacturer to be the controlling field
or them controlling picklists field and
the model is the dependent field so the
answer is C create the manufacturer
field as a controlling picklist
and the model as a dependent pick list</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
