to make use of HTML forms with JSP
and we'll actually cover the following
topics I'll first start off with a
review of HTML forms then I'll show you
how to build an HTML form next we'll
learn how to read the form data with JSP
all right a lot of good stuff we've all
used HTML forms before if you've gone
any web site we have the log in with the
user ID and password
that information was entered via an HTML
form also if you've gone the any travel
site and booked an airline trip or a
hotel reservation again all of that data
was entered through in HTML form
all right so what we're gonna do here is
we're gonna learn how to build an HTML
form to read student information we're
gonna prompt the student for their first
name and last name they'll enter it into
a text field and then once they enter
that data they'll hit the submit button
once they hit submit that data will be
sent over to a JSP page for processing
so we'll have a JSP page or read the
form data for the first name and a last
name and we'll send back a confirmation
page to the browser and I'll show you
how to put all of this together we'll
start with the form first and then we'll
move into the actual JSP development all
right let's get started
so here's the coding here for the HTML
form so again we want to have an HTML
form for the first name and last name
along with the submit button
so when you build an HTML form yourself
with the form tag and then you specify
the action you're basically telling the
system where to send the form data so
we're telling the system here send the
form data to student response dot JSP
next we set up our text fields for first
name and last name so for text field we
have input type equals text we give name
equals first name
and that names very important we'll need
that name on the server-side we do a
similar thing here for last name input
type equals text name equals last name
and then finally for a submit button
we set up an input type so we say input
type equals submit and then we give the
value of submit so the value portion
here is really just the label that
you'll see on the submit button
but once they hit the submit button then
that data will actually be sent over to
the appropriate JSP page for processing
so now here's the coding here for
reading the form data so whenever we
read the form data with the JSP it's
very important that we need to know the
names of those HTML form fields so I
have these HTML form fields here on this
slide just for reference so at the
bottom in the JSP file we simply want to
say the student is confirmed and we want
to display the students first name and
last name so we read the form data by
saying request dot getparameter and we
give that form fill name first name
and then to read the last name I do a
similar thing request dot getparameter
last name and we place all that inside
of a JSP expression with the angle
bracket percent with the equal symbol
and that will allow us to read the form
data in JSP
next here's an alternate syntax for
reading the form data so you can make
use of this dollar sign curly brace and
you can say per am dot form field name
so a simpler way of writing is pages the
student is confirmed and then we simply
say dollar sign curly brace per am dot
first-name and a similar thing here
dollar sign curly brace param dot last
name so this is really just a shortcut
method it's only used for displaying
form data so it's really just a
shorthand simpler way of writing the
code but if you needed to read the farm
data and like maybe a as scriptlet or
something then you'd have to resort back
to using the request I get parameter but
as much as possible I'll try and make
use of the shortcut method in our
confirmation pages
all right so this wraps up this portion
of the video I'm in the following video
I'll actually do a code demo and I'll
take you to eclipse and I will actually
write the code in Eclipse so I'll see
you in the next video
