the ultimate AWS solutions architect
associate course and in the set of
videos i'm talking about the most
intriguing announcements at reinvent
2017 the AWS conference and number three
on the list is machine learning
now amazon has been a heavy user of
machine learning for a number of years
in its core operations so in the
e-commerce side of the house it's used
machine learning for a lot of different
kinds of activities so customer gender
identification
taking someone's name and figuring out
which gender they are and that helps
them then sort of understand what kind
of products the person is likely to be
interested in what kinds of
recommendations make it so forth very
important because you'd prefer not to
force someone to identify themselves if
you don't have to because that reduces
the work the person has to do to engage
with ad is ecommerce well that was one
thing fraud detection it's a really big
deal if you're doing an out selling
products you don't want to be selling
products or taking orders from people
who are engaged in fraud who you know
aren't gonna pay or I'm gonna steal good
or whatever might be so fraud detection
is very important and looking at
patterns of things like where was this
order made from is the order location
the shipping location different from the
ordering location what kind of credit
card is being used what time of day
maybe
all kinds of different things product
fraud detection very heavy use of
machine learning freedom yes and then
product recommendation this is the
classic people like you ordered this but
isn't just as much as you know someone
else who lives in a particular state
who's the same age it might be people
have ordered these kinds of other goods
would be interested in this and you
might be interested cuz you order these
soon all kinds of goods so machine
learning very effective
well that's on the e-commerce site but
really on the 8 of your side Eden has
had machine learning offerings but they
kind of lagged behind the leaders Google
and Microsoft invested very heavily in
this space and have very capable machine
learning offerings and Davis had some
machinery offerings and they weren't bad
it just wasn't as broad a portfolio or
offered as much functionality as these
other well reinvent really changed that
there was a heavy of society learning at
reinvent they really got behind it and
announced a bunch of different things in
it and now I want to talk about those
things because I consider this to me one
of the most important sets of
announcements that Avis made a tree
inventor let's take a look at them
deep lens well deep lens is a isn't as a
device it's a it's a thing and it has a
display and it also has a camera but it
has the capability of actually running
processing on board the device so it has
a processor that can run machine
learning models and this device has the
ability to import models so the models
would be created somewhere else trained
against data to define how the models
operate but you can import it install it
onto the device and then execute deep
learning as perhaps it's the device
camera see certain kinds of objects or
it displays kinds of certain kinds
things it can execute this machine
learning code these models and then it
can integrate the output with Ada via
services so based on what happens based
on maybe image object identification it
might trigger a particular kind of
service or do some kind of functionality
or store something a certain way so deep
blinds is very intriguing offering it's
in preview now you can't really get
these very very easily but you know
they'll be building lots more of them
and this will be interesting to see how
this plays out so basically deep
learning integrated into objects
recognition video is a way to identify
objects or people or things whatever it
might be
video now recognition is already existed
for images it could analyze an image and
say oh there's that is likely a dog or
that's likely to be a banana whatever
might be but recognition video can do
the same thing for video it can take a
video in and then look for things like a
person or a place
text certain kinds of scenes or
activities like somebody throwing a ball
a lot of capabilities in this with
recognition video and video is much more
complex doing this than static images
recognition video is another
announcement translate real-time
language translation via machine
learning so one person can talk and
speak German into into translate and it
can be translated in a real-time way to
Spanish or English this is like a Star
Trek tricorder Territory and ADA misses
rolled out translate comprehend is a way
to look at text and analyze it and
identify topics or phrases may be
sentiment is this an angry set of text
or is this a happy set of texts or
whatever might be and then assess this
sediment as I said you just sort of is
this text reflecting happiness or
sadness or grief or whatever it might be
comprehends very interesting capability
as saying goes though but wait there's
more sage maker is a pretty interesting
thing machine learning is very powerful
it's it's just exploded but it's not
easy to do it's you have to know a lot
you have to sort of fiddle with a lot of
things sage maker is an effort to make
simplify that make it much easier so
it's a managed service right we're
getting this theme about managed
services letting AWS do the heavy
lifting so you can focus on the
functionality that you want and it will
sage maker will help you build train and
operate machine learning models the
whole thing in machine learning is to
come up with a model
that basically then executes against
what you want so it might be I want to
analyze images and see if there's
particular kinds of objects in there
well sage maker helps you create that
model it will make it simplify it so you
can sort of say I set it up and say I
want to apply this kind of a model and I
want to look for these kind of objects
or even help create models and then it
will take this subsequent model and
deploy it into managed ec2 clusters so
you don't have to worry about do I have
enough servers driving a you know
keep pressing capably no you just deploy
the model and eight of those figures on
how to do it all via Sage maker and then
last but not least is transcribe
which is kind of analogous to translate
but this is translation of audio to
formatted text in multiple languages so
not only can it listen to the text
listen to the audio it can create text
but it will punctuate it correctly and
it will so display it so that it can be
more easily comprehended and it could do
that in multiple languages transcribe is
pretty cool stuff again this is sort of
tricorder territory so the number three
most intriguing product announcement at
AWS reinvent machine learning they
really double down on it they brought
out a lot of stuff in my view they came
to parity with Google and Microsoft and
they're still at it they're still
working hard on it we'll see more
machine learning announcements coming
out of a TBS in the near future
