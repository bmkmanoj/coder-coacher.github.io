little math I'm just gonna take all this
out and and I'm just gonna create some
new values here B colon equals you know
400 and then I could start to do some
math right like if I wanted to I could
do a plus B and I could format that and
I could run it and I'll give me four
hundred forty two so notice how the
computer like evaluated this so this is
an expression right it's an expression A
plus B so that expression and that's a
new word you're learning right that
expression you know is like it's just
one little part of a statement and the
statement is usually usually an entire
line of code one thing to happen and one
thing to execute and often has or can
have multiple expressions right so you
know here I've got a plus B and so that
all gets figured out if I wanted to I
could put those in parentheses and I can
make sure that that happens first and
then multiply that by four and so this
expressional will we'll evaluate and
then this expression will evaluate and
then this entire statement will execute
boom right so did all that math and if I
wanted to I could do that all up here C
is colon equal to and I could take all
of that and I could bring that up there
and put it there and I could draw up see
right there and all I'm doing is first
this expression this expression will
evaluate and then once that expression
is evaluated it'll multiply it by four
and then I'll assign it to C and so when
I do all that right it gives me the same
thing and I just print out the value of
C and if I wanted to I could come down
here and I could put in some quotes and
I could do you know a plus B and the
quotes are just text is equal to C now
is equal to and then right here if I
wanted to I could just do a plus
Plus be right so let's format that and
run that see is declared not used let's
get it out of there so you have to use
your variables if you declare them so
now I'm gonna run it so 42 plus 400 is
equal to 442 so we have a printed out
the value and then print out the text
plus sign and then be printed out the
value 400 and then print it out the text
equal sign and then print it out a plus
B and a plus B gave us 4 42 right there
so that's doing a little bit of math and
if we wanted to we could switch from
doing math and if you want to well I
guess you get to retype this code it's
gonna say here's the URL but easy enough
to read retype if we wanted to we could
you know make that a string and this is
a new program so we talked about once a
can only store a value of type int well
how are you doing now a is storing a
string because it's a new program if I'd
done it like this right a is now equal
to this and now let me put make that a
string all right format
run like it's gonna be like ah that's
not gonna work let's just print out a
format run cannot use 400 type and s
type string right but when it's just
like that that's fine so so we saw how
we used you know multiple things print
out here and we've already seen this one
but I just want to show it again hello
Todd
format it and run it and then we printed
that out so that's how we declare
variables the short declaration operator
will and use variables well the short
declaration operator will only work
inside of a function I can't take it and
put it out here and and then do that
that's not gonna run right you can't use
it's a non declaration statement outside
function body you could only use the
short declaration variable inside of a
function body and it also the scope of a
meaning where do I have access to this
variable a where value is stored is from
where the variable is declared to the
end so I couldn't like in some languages
like that have hoisting I couldn't do
this right because a doesn't exist yet
up here you'd see that line is read so
the scope of a is
right from where it's declared to the
end of that function and you can only
use short declaration operator inside of
the function all right so that's just a
little bit more working with variables
and if you need to use a variable
outside of a function I'll show you how
to do that in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
