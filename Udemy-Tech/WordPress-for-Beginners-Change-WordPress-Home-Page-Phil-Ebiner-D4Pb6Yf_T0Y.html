video I'm going to give you a free
preview of a lesson from my wordpress
for beginners course on udemy calm in
this lesson I'll show you how to create
a static homepage for your WordPress
website probably the first thing you
want to do is to create your homepage or
set what your homepage should be right
now and whenever you start a new
WordPress site the home page of your
site is actually the blog article page
where a list of all of your recent posts
appears when you install WordPress what
happens is a sample blog article and a
sample page are added to your site
automatically so this post right here
when you go to your website is actually
just a sample post that they created
will want to delete that and write our
own content later this is also the home
page of your website so to create a
separate standalone page we're going to
create a new page and call it home so go
from your dashboard to pages add new
under title just type in home this
doesn't really matter for this page
because what happens when you type in
the title of a page is this permalink
appears this is the link to get to this
page now right now the link says a
banner designs dot-com forward slash
home we don't want people have to type
in abner calm designs slash home to get
to the home page but don't worry we're
going to set the homepage of the site a
banner designs com to go directly to
this page so you see this is the page
editor and we're going to be designing a
page in the next lesson but right now I
just want to show you that in the main
part of this editor you have a text
editor with different text options up
here this is where you're going to be
designing your page on the right side
you have different options for
publishing such as publishing now you
can save a draft of your page you can
also preview it and then down below here
are options for making your page out of
a certain template
and some themes come with multiple
templates for example a theme might come
with a contact page template or a
portfolio page template we'll talk about
all these things in a future lesson but
first right now let's just publish this
page once you publish a page you can
view it by clicking the view page button
up here or clicking the permalink right
here I'm going to control click to open
it up in a new tab and now this is what
this page looks like so now this isn't
our home page if I go to Evan or designs
comm what happens is I go back to that
page where the blog articles were so to
set that as my home page what I'm going
to do is go under settings and then
reading here you see that your front
page displays option is your latest
posts I want to make it a static page so
if I set the static page front page to
home then what happens is I have to set
the post page to another page so what we
should do is under pages select add new
and I'm going to ctrl click that again
or command-click if you're on a Mac and
then type in blog or articles or posts
and rename this page to whatever you
want your post page to be and select
publish that page isn't going to show up
here on the post page until we say save
pages and then now that we've refreshed
this page it sees all the published
pages so I can now select our post page
to be the blog or you don't need a post
page if you're not going to be adding
posts to your website and click Save now
if we go back to our site and we go to
Evan or designs comm and refresh we're
at the home page now and if we click on
this icon right here which is our site
title which we'll be changing in the
next lesson we go to the home page which
is that home page that we set up to get
to the blog article you could go to Evan
our designs comm slash blog or what
we'll do in a future lesson is add a
menu that has links directly to this
page so that's how you add a new page
and that's also how you set your
homepage to a separate static page
thanks for watching and in the next
lessons we'll be changing the site title
and also editing
the page to make it look really awesome
