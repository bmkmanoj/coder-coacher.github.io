instructor for the ultimate AWS
certified solutions associate course and
in this video what I'd like to talk
about is what does an ATM US Solutions
Architect do I mean it seems like kind
of an obvious question but I want to
share with you what kinds of things that
Solutions Architect do because that's
what this course will prepare you to do
or be and when you pass certification
you'll be ready to take on a role like
this so let's talk about what an ATS
Solutions Architect does well let me
bring this up this is based on a core
question core as a place where people
post questions and then other people
give answers well I did a search through
court to find out what the most common
questions were about AWS and one of them
was what does a native Solutions
Architect do there were thousands tens
of thousands of views on this question a
lot of people interested in it and there
were some pretty good answers this video
is going to give you mine based on my
experience working with AWS and working
with lots of database solutions
architects and being in aqueous
solutions architect so the Solutions
Architect is a kind of an interesting
challenging role it's not purely
technical it's not solely business it's
kind of a combination you have to
balance functionality the requirements
business needs you have to sort of be
like the conductor of an orchestra help
creating and defining a technical
solution that balances business needs
specific functionality that the
application needs how it is implemented
to make sure that it brings the kinds of
characteristics that are needed like
resilience or elasticity it's a it's a
really interesting kind of a job it can
be quite challenging because you're
balancing all these things but it can
also be very satisfying it's part of
that when you're working with AWS is
given that balance of all those things
you've created you have to do
sign which are the right solutions which
are the right ATS services for to help
create that that art that architecture
that you're putting together and here on
the right hand side is an example of one
of the kinds of things that you might
put together if you are sluices
architect it's a diagram that outlines
all the different services you'll notice
that there's VPC which is a virtual
private cloud it's got an elastic load
balancer and
route 53 at the top those are services
that AWS offers the right hand side
there's cloud front that's an s3 bucket
down below an s3 is a object storage and
then snapshots which are sort of so
speed pictures of a image or a
particular object at a point in time or
and so forth you've got elastic load
balancing that's in the middle which is
spreading traffic across the resources
you've got application servers which are
typically gonna be ec2 instances you've
got web servers servers which are also
easy to instances well there's a lot of
stuff there that's what a solution
architect does takes all those
requirements takes the needs for what
kinds of resilience or security whatever
it might be and then chooses and selects
what are the right services database
offers to help enable that according to
the needs that are defined the kinds of
things that you have to think about or
incorporate are what I call meta needs
meaning they're not specific
functionality it's not like what we need
to be able to allow so we need to input
their user number no it's the sorts of
things you have to think about to help
bring that application together like
security how do i implement security how
do I protect the resources in the
application resilience what do I do to
protect this application to make sure it
can continue to operate even if
something fails even if something
doesn't work properly how can I make
sure the application is still continues
to be up and running
that's a meta need scalability how do I
design this application a sluiced
architect how do I design this so that
if a lot of demand comes to it a lot of
load a lot of users come into
it can scale to meet those that and
doesn't just start slowing down or worse
just crash from the deload I don't make
sure this is all delivered at the right
cost point how do I make sure we don't
waste money when it operates how do i
how do I ensure that we're doing it
efficiently cost is another thing
solutions architects have to think about
monitoring and management well it's
great that you put it up and it's great
that it's running it's even great that
it scales but how do you keep track of
it how do you follow what's going on how
do you help identify when a problem
occurs where it occurred modern
management very important you have to
bring that into these the application
design as well and then organization
standards you might have particular
standards and these might be regulatory
laws they might be the way you operate
things the way you organize applications
you have to keep all those things in
mind in your solution architecture
there's a lot of things that go into
being a sluice Arctic design the
application architecture are we gonna
use web servers are we going to use a
queue meaning something that basically
connects different resources what are we
gonna do that's their responsibility as
a Solutions Architect to bring all of
that together and there's often soft
skills as well and the course doesn't
really focus on the soft skills but as a
Solutions Architect you also have to
have these kinds of soft skills as well
you have to generate awareness so you
know this diagram on the right hand side
you've probably defined what was gonna
be in the application but it was
probably also used as a kind of a
shareable document or a talking document
of talking points so you could convince
people of what was in the application
why it need to be designed this way what
they needed to do to fit to contribute
to it you have to be able to obtain
buy-in you know you have to get as I
said convince people so you have to make
make something select the right kinds of
services bring in the right kind of
functionality and then communicate that
people get them committed to it as well
so generating bio and then you're gonna
basically do a lot of consulting during
the development and deployment people
will be looking to you and saying well
we've we're doing it we think we're
doing it correctly
are we or we've run into this snag how
should we address it so you've got to be
able to work with them on that base as
well well that's what an 80s Solutions
Architect does I mean it's a really
fascinating job it's really challenging
really interesting it brings together
all these kinds of things and you'll
build the skills in this course to
become an ATS Solutions Architect
I hope you'll take the course I hope you
can see how passionate I am about it how
passionate I am about this role I hope
you'll take the course and learn the
skills and become a navy a Solutions
Architect
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
