alright so now we are going to implement
our artificial intelligence from scratch
we're going to curl it line by line and
in this first cut section we are going
to import the libraries but before we
start with this first code section I
would like to explain the connection
between the AI and our MATLAB py file
that is why are we implementing this for
the map what is the purpose of our AI
and where will we be using it so it's
actually very simple we are only making
our AI to select the right action at
each time so okay we import the d
queuing class from our AI file so we
will be making this D queuing class in
this file but then we import it only to
select the right action to play at each
time and we select this action exactly
at this line action equals brain update
last reward last signal last signal will
be the input of the neural network
you know it's composed of the three
signals of the sensors plus the
orientation and - orientation so that's
the input but then the output is the
action to play and that's only what
we'll be taking from our a I felt that
we're about to make so keep that in mind
it's very simple we first import the D
queuing class from the AI then we create
the object brain from the D queuing
class which takes as input the encoded
vectors for the states of five
dimensions the three signals plus
orientation test - orientation - three
actions go left go straight or go right
and then this gamma parameter that's the
only parameters of the D queuing class
that we will be making and then once we
create that object we select in the game
class the action to play at each time
and that depends on the last reward and
the last signal which is the input and
that's all that's the only purpose of
making this AI that's in order to have a
real artificial intelligence playing the
right actions at each time the right
move instead of having random actions
like we observed in the
tutorial all right so let's do this
let's implement our artificial
intelligence and as we said we're gonna
start by importing all the libraries
that we'll be using to implement it so
that way we will have all the tools we
need all right so let's start with the
first one the first one is the
inevitable the numpy library the non
filer berry I always recommend to import
it it's the library which allows us to
play and work with the arrays and this
nd here is just a shortcut more
convenient when we want to use numpy
alright then second library is random so
this is just because we will be taking
some random samples from the different
batches when implementing experience
replay so we have to import this renton
library as well then we will import os
that will be just useful when we want to
load the model because you know once the
model is ready we will implement some
code to save the model and then another
code to load the model that's when we
want to you know save the brain and load
the brain whenever you want to shut down
your computer and reuse the brain that
was trained before for some new
experiment so that's important then we
are going to import the torch library
essential that's because we will be
implementing our neural network with by
torch which I recommend much more than
the other ones for artificial
intelligence because it can handle
dynamic graphs so there we go with torch
then from torch we are going to import
torch dot and n the N n module is the
most essential one that's the module
that contains all the tools to implement
some neural networks and of course there
will be a deep neural network that will
take as inputs the three signals of the
three sensors plus orientation and minus
orientation and will return as output
the action to play well actually it will
return the Q values of the different
actions and using a soft max we will
return the action to play only one the
most relevant one to accomplish the cars
goal so torch dot n n most essential one
then
we're gonna give a shortcut to the
functional package from here we go the
functional package from the NN module so
this functional package contains the
different functions that we use when
implementing a neural network so
typically the last function we will be
using the uber loss because that
improves convergence and the uber loss
is contained in this functional sub
module from the NN module and since all
this is pretty long we're gonna give it
a shortcut and we're gonna call it f
simply then only three modules to import
left so the next one is another central
one which is up Tim and we take it from
still the torch library and then up Tim
there we go and let's just call it up
Tim
instead of torch up Tim so that's of
course for the optimizer we will be
importing some optimizers to perform
stochastic gradient descent so we will
definitely need it and then we need to
import autograph and that's only to take
the variable class from autograph so the
purpose of it is a little bit technical
basically we need to import the variable
class to make some conversion from
tensors which are like more advanced
arrays to a variable that contains a
gradient so it's like we don't want to
have only a tensor by itself we want to
put the tensor into a variable that will
also contain a gradient and to do this
we need to use the variable class to
convert this tensor into a variable
containing the tensor and the gradient
so that's a little bit technical but
that's what we have to do when working
with by torch and we do this thanks to
the variable class but before getting to
variable class we need to import torch
thoughts out of grad and let's give a
shortcut as well on a brad and then from
torch dot autograph we import variable
there we go and now we have all the
libraries that we'll be using to
implement our AI so we won't bother
import
any other library we have all the tools
we need and now we are ready to create
the architecture of the neural network
so that's exactly what we'll do in the
next tutorial and until then enjoy AI</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
