discuss another Python basic object
which is a dictionary dictionaries are
unordered mappings for storing objects
previously we saw how we could use a
Python list to store objects in an
ordered sequence such as storing
integers or strings in order
dictionaries however use a key value
pairing instead this key value pair
allows users to quickly grab objects
without needing to know an index
location dictionaries as far as their
syntax use curly braces and colons to
signify the keys and their associated
values so you'll have a set of curly
braces at the very outside and then you
have key : and then the value that goes
with it
here we're showing strings as the values
but you can also have dictionaries
numbers lists as the values themselves
and then we separate each key value pair
with a comma now you may be asking
yourself when do I choose a list and
when do I choose a dictionary well to
put it simply dictionaries are have
objects being retrieved by their key
name that is if you want to grab value
number one then you just pass in the key
that's associated with that value that
may seem really convenient but the issue
here is that the way the key value
mapping works is dictionaries remain
unordered and you can actually sort them
if you wanted to be able to sort maybe
you want to reverse or organize your
actual objects then you would need to
use a list because objects there are
retrieved by their index location and
because they're a list that means you
can have an order sequence that can be
indexed sliced or sorted so it's
basically a trade-off here dictionaries
allow you to retrieve by a key name
however you can't really sort them lists
allow you to retrieve by location and
then the added benefit is that you can
index slice or sort the list let's
explore these concepts further in a
Jupiter notebook
let's start off by creating a dictionary
will name it variable D we have our
curly braces and then we create a key
we'll have key one just as a string and
then a value will say value 1 then comma
for another key value pair so key - and
then value - then if I want to retrieve
values I can just use their associated
key so I can pass in key one to return
value 2 or if I wanted value 2 then I
can just pass in key - and grab value 2
if I want ever want to add a new key
item or key value pair all I have to do
is call my dictionary variable create
some new key and then set that equal to
whatever item I want to pass in so I'll
just pass in a new string here called
new item and then if I check out my
dictionary have key one value one key -
value two new key new item now I want to
make it really clear here dictionaries
are unordered and this may not be clear
at first with smaller dictionaries
because it seems like you're just adding
in new key item pairs in order so let's
show an example to really prove to you
that dictionaries are unordered mappings
when you add in new key item pairs
you're not guaranteed to know the
location of them which is why indexing
x' or slicing is really invalid for
dictionaries that concept doesn't really
make sense for key value pairs because
we're not going to know their actual
order I'm going to create a new
dictionary here where I have key a and
its value is the number one PZ and its
value is the number two so if I take a
look at my dictionary a is two one and
then Z is the two I'm going to create a
new key called new and then set it to
the value 0 and now if I look at my
dictionary when it reports it back it's
not reporting it back in the order that
I added the keys in it's just reporting
back the actual key value mappings a1
new 0 and Z 2 so hopefully this makes it
pretty clear to you that the dictionary
is an unordered mapping and you are
losing the ability to store
or call of indexing if you need that
ability you'll need to use a list I
should also mention that dictionaries
are very flexible in the data types they
can hold so to prove that to you I'm
going to make a larger dictionary here
we'll have the first key just be k1 and
keys are just always strings and then
the values can be quite flexible so we
can see here at 10 is that value will
have key 2 will give it stringy
a string is another value and then let's
create another key k3 and we can even
have the list here 1 2 3 and then we can
even have a dictionary inside of a
dictionary so we can say K 4 is equal to
another dictionary inside matched with
the number 100 and now I can see kind of
a complex dictionary so let's take a
look at what all the keys are holding so
k1 is holding the number 10 k2 is
holding a string called string e k3 is
holding a list 1 2 3 and K 4 is holding
well which we just call K 4 is holding
another dictionary and I can actually
stack a key value call so if I wanted to
grab the number 100 I could type in
inside here and grab the number 100 keep
in mind that you will get an error if
you ask for a key that is not present in
the dictionary for instance if we ask
for oops
which we know is definitely not a key in
this dictionary you'll get back key
error and hopefully this error is pretty
obvious it's just saying key error it
can't find that key inside your
dictionary let's show you a more
realistic example of when you would use
a dictionary as you may already know
every United States President has a
Secret Service code name that's assigned
to them so we're going to create a code
names dictionary and we'll have curly
braces here Obama's code name was
renegade and you can check out the
notebook that's associated this lecture
for the source on this and then Bush's
code name was trailblazer whoops
Regan's code name was rawhide and then
Ford's code name was passkey and notice
here I can actually type this out over
multiple lines because it's all being
contained within these curly braces
remember that you're going to need these
commas here to separate out the key
value pairs so now that we run this
let's imagine that I quickly wanted to
know what the code name was for
President Ford well then we would just
pass in code names passing the Ford key
and I would quickly get back his code
name so here's a pretty good example of
why would you use a dictionary basically
anytime you want to quickly store
information where key value pairs make
sense maybe you want the populations of
countries so you say USA its population
in millions is about 323 million
population of Germany is about 83
million and we can say population of
India is like 1.3 billion so we'll say
one thousand three hundred twenty four
million and then if you quickly wanted
to know well what's the population in
millions of the United States you can
just use a dictionary to quickly
retrieve that information this sort of
data structure makes a lot more sense
than using a list which essentially just
the ordered sequence finally I want to
discuss some key methods that are
available to you off a dictionary and
that is if we look at this dictionary
population actually let's look at the
code names dictionary if I look at the
code name dictionary and I want to know
all the keys in that dictionary
I can run keys and get back Obama Bush
Reagan Ford if I wanted to get all the
values of the dictionary then I get back
the actual values notice here it's not
telling me what keys are associated what
values if I wanted that connection what
I could do is say code names and then
call items and that gives you back this
object where in what's called a tuple or
tupple the actual matchings Obama
renegade Bush Trailblazer etc so great
work so far we're actually almost done
of your basics boot camp you just need
to learn about sets working with files
and you'll be ready for your first field
reading this exam I'll see you at the
next lesson</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
