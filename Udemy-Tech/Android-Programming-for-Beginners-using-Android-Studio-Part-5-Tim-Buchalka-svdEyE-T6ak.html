view now that's set to rap underscore
content for both the width and the
height
so that's vertically in horizontally
constrained to be centered in both
directions and we obviously did that in
previous videos now we also got water
connect turned off and you can see that
by the line that's sort of striking
through the magnet I couldn't help
hearing their designers top designers
button bar so what I'm going to do is
drag a button to the top left of the
screen slightly in from both edges so
come up here making sure that button is
selected drag that over and I'm just
going to move it over so we've got like
a bit of a margin there and we've got
those two little pointers to the top and
the left release the button and you can
see we never got our button in the top
left hand corner and we do get some
warnings and we can see that the
warnings popping up here the view is not
constrained but what we're going to do
is constrain it so we're going to
constrain it to the top in to the left
so I'm going to click on the button then
the weight to the little toolbar tip
appears and then just drag that over to
the left and a constraint to the left
like so and then add another one here to
the top as well so if you're going to
have button and you can see that clearly
and probably better in the on the
blueprint screen that it's constrained
to the top and to the left now there's
still two warnings oh we just open those
up and have a look so the first warning
is related to the hard-coded text on the
button and the second one is relating to
or is a lack of a Content description on
the image now the content description is
used by screen reading software to
describe images for people who can't see
the screen and who rely on an audio
description of what's going on now we
can't ignore that warning for now but I
would fix these and it's a good idea to
consider accessibility issues generally
when developing apps but I would still
get warnings about string resources
which is this other error and that we
haven't really got into discussing those
yet so I'm now going to change the left
constraint on the image so that it's no
longer constrained to the edge of the
screen but to the right head edge of the
button instead so come back
and click on the blueprint mode so you
can see we've got our constraint now on
the image view pointing or constrained
to the F left edge of the screen so what
we need to do is hover over here to the
constraint and if I click at once you'll
notice that till we've now got a red
flashing circle around the constraint
and the top of the toolbar tip appears
to say click to delete let's constraint
so I click again to delete it you can
see the constraint was removed and then
the image because it no longer has a
constraint to the left edge of the
screen has been pushed to the right-hand
side automatically the next way I'm
going to do is then constrain it and
move up to the right side of the button
like so and you can see what happened
automatically when I did that so now the
left-hand edge of the image view is
there constrained by the right-hand edge
of the button so the image view can
occupy all the space to the left up to
the bottoms right edge so we've now got
the image centered in the space from the
button to the right hand edge of the
layout now because we're using wrap
underscore content the image view is a
hundred by 100 but we want to play with
the unit so I'm going to change it to
fixed by clicking on the inner lines
again so making sure that the image view
is clicked
I'm going to click on the inner lines
and change those so we can enter a fixed
size you can come both so you can see
how the layout width and layout height
were changed to 100 DP automatically by
Android studio by the design and when I
did that but what I want to do is to
show you problems you can run into using
pixel measurements instead of using
these DPS or device-independent pixels
so we're going to change both of these
DP sizes from a hundred DPS they
currently are to 200 px which is an
abbreviation for pixels so if we come in
here we type shape type in 200px
and 200px so i've never-- - 5 that for
our image now the image at this point is
still centered where it should be and it
actually looks fine on the screen but
let's see what it looks like on other
devices so what I'm going to do is
choose a different device using the
drop-down button on the designers button
bar
we're going to start by choosing the
nexus one so the way to do that is to
come over here to click on the devices
and you can see we've got a video for
Nexus 4 which we created in an earlier
video in this course but it come down
here and choose Nexus One you can see
that we are able to see that it still
works and everything still generally
looks ok but - you may have noticed that
the image is bigger than it was relative
to the size of this screen the screen
real estate we've got near the overall
size of the screen but this gets worse
if we use one of the Android wear
devices so if we come back up here and
choose another device this time the
Android to wear round chin device which
has got a significantly smaller amount
of space click on that and you can see
that things have gone from bad to
hideous now the image now over is now
overlapping the button and it's expense
it's also extending beyond the right
hand edge of the screen so to get around
this and to make images display you know
reasonably well on all devices Android
uses a concept of density independent
pixels or DP now one DP is equal to one
pixel at a resolution of 160 pixels per
inch but scales to use more or less
pixels as the pixel density of the
screen changes so if we go back to our
original device select that one again we
come back here took out the image view
selected if we change this back to a
hundred DP as originally was and do the
same for the height as well so I'm back
on what they should have been before
that's about the same as the 200px
setting anyway so everything is
obviously looking foreign but it was
previously in this mode as well for
thing go back and look at now Android
one device our Nexus One I should say
click on that may have noticed now the
image is about the same size relative to
the button than it was before but if we
go back down and choose the Android wear
device same device Android wear round
chin device you'll see now that we've
got a much better result
so everything still looks ok now these
are pretty extreme
differences we've gone from a seven six
eight by twelve eighty Nexus to a 320 by
two ninety watch but using this cool
concept of density independent pixels
these DPS instead of using pixels has
allowed the screen to still look okay
and to remain usable now of course
you'll eventually run into the physical
limitations of a small screen if you
have more in your layout that will fit
and if I choose the two eighty by two
eighty watch things just physically
won't fit so in other words using DPS
can really only achieve so much it's not
a miracle worker so if you were creating
an app to run on a wearable device then
you'd probably design the layouts using
one an Android studio incidentally does
fully support wearables but we're not
going to be covering that in this course
but using the watch made it really
obvious how DP is to be preferred using
pixels when sizing images and other
widgets and interestingly enough the
layout designer actually makes it very
difficult to use pixel units when
demonstrating px so you may have noticed
that I was very careful not to click on
the widget in either the design or the
blueprint but notice what happens what I
do is so if I switch back to our regular
device and it will resize the image back
making sure it's selected still to 200
pixels 200 pixels on the both the width
and height then change back to the 280
by 280 watch and as I showed earlier it
physically doesn't fit too well but
watch what happens when I click on the
image views if I click on that now watch
over in the properties section did you
see how that changed automatically to DP
so we've now going to layout width and
height of 133 DP so the Android layout
designer automatically converted the
pixel settings we had 2 DP units by 133
DP so I'm not sure what that behavior
will remain when the final version of
Android studio 2.2 is released or if
it's just a bug in this preview version
but you should certainly be aware of
this if you do decide against all of all
the advice we're giving you to use
and if you can't think of a good reason
for using pixels rather than DP then
please do let us know because we frankly
have been unable to think of a situation
where they would be preferred so before
we continue on let's just go back to our
normal view and we're going to change
this back to a hundred DP again for both
because that's the actual size of the
image so I want to actually show you a
similar device independent way of
specifying the text size so when I click
on the button to select it which we
haven't done previously firstly notice
how the properties pane window on the
right changed and we've now got
properties that are appropriate for the
button instead of the image view that we
were really only looked at up until this
part of the course so what I can do with
that opened I can come down here and I
can make sure text appearance is open
and your system that might be closed so
you just click on this to open it and we
can come down here to text size here you
can notice that it says 14 SP not DP so
SP stands for a scale independent pixel
so the concept here is the same but 2 SP
also considers the users preferred text
size so what I'm going to do to show you
an example is change text size to 48 px
for pixels and you can see when I did
that the text size in the button got
larger and although it's a bit large
it'll still display ok here but if we go
back to our watch though you should find
that things will go horribly wrong go
back to our 280 by 280 obviously that
doesn't fit and even in our other watch
mode 320 the original box mode it's
still physically doesn't fit there 48
pixels on the original screen was 24 SP
so what I'm going to do is change the
size here to 24 SP coming over to here
and text size changes up to 24 SP and
notice when I did that it still looks
like a deal on the watch and if we go
back to the Nexus clearly it works ok in
there who can choose the other watch and
obviously in this case we can physically
not fit the button and the image which
is why we
then overlap but on the other device the
321 90 we were able to get a reasonably
good approximation so in other words the
setting using this scale independent
pixels for text size is doing a similar
job
- what deeply does for image views and
widgets and generally says I think I
want to show you now that gives a good
overview of DP and SP and it's one of
the Android official Android sites links
so go to developer.android.com and you
can see the full link showing on the
screen there good thing to read this to
find out a little bit more about
supporting different densities the
bottom line here though is to use
density independent pixels when sizing
graphical elements that's widgets and
the scale independent pixels when sizing
text so that's it I'm going to finish
this video here now in the next video
we're gonna start with a bit of a
challenge and I get you to see if you
can actually make a change to our where
screen to move our image route and view
around to use a bit more space so let's
look at doing that in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
