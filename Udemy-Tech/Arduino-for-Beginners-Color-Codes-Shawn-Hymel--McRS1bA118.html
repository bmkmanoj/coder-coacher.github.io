than one resistor it can become hard to
tell them apart
luckily the larger through-hole
resistors have color bands that tell you
their resistance you just need to learn
how to read the code first determine how
many color bands are on your resistor
you will most often find resistors with
four bands but ones with three five and
six bands exist because four band
resistors are the most popular I'll show
you how to read those you then need to
figure out which band is the first band
on most resistors there will be a
slightly larger gap between the last and
second-to-last band with the first band
on the left
find the number that corresponds to the
color from the chart on this resistor
the first band is yellow so the first
number is four then repeat the process
for the second band violet is the color
for number seven so write that down as
the second digit the second to last band
is the multiplier and it tells you how
many zeros to add after your number
orange corresponds to the number three
so we add three zeros that gives us
forty seven times 1,000
which is forty seven thousand ohms or
47k ohms the final band is the tolerance
gold the most common tolerance band
you'll see on inexpensive resistors
means five percent this is the tolerance
of the resistance that the manufacturer
guarantees so 47k ohms with a five
percent tolerance means that the
resistor can actually be anywhere
between forty-four thousand six hundred
fifty ohms and forty-nine thousand three
hundred fifty ohms if we were to measure
it if you do run across a five band
resistor reading it is very similar the
only difference is that you have three
digits instead of two before the
multiplier in this example green is five
Brown is one and black is zero that
makes 510 before we add two zeros which
we got from the red band this means this
is a 50 1k
resistor the last band tells us that the
tolerance is 1% as you start to
accumulate a nice collection of
resistors it can be handy to memorize
the code so that you don't need to look
at a chart every time several mnemonics
exist to help you memorize the code but
my favorite is big beautiful roses
occupy your garden but violets grow wild
the first letter in each of these words
corresponds to the first letter of the
color you'll just have to remember that
black comes before brown in the list
also gold and silver aren't in the
mnemonic since you rarely need them to
read the base value however it's useful
to note that you may see them as a
multiplier band in which case you
actually divide the resistors value by
10 or 100 there are also many
calculators available on the internet
just search for resistor band calculator
digi-key for example has one where you
can select the colors of the bands and
it'll give you the resistors value let's
read a real resistors value for practice
here we see orange orange red gold
starting with zero for big big beautiful
roses occupy occupy as orange which is
three orange again so three three big
beautiful roses for red that's two which
is our multiplier band so we add two
zeros to 33 to get 3,300 with a gold
tolerance band that gives us 3.3 kilo
ohms plus or minus 5% knowing how to
read resistor codes can be very handy
when building or dismantling circuits
if you're having trouble memorizing the
code don't worry online calculators and
charts can help thanks for watching if
you'd like to learn more check out my
Arduino fundamentals course on udemy in
it I'll show you the basics of C and C++
programming how to build circuits and
how to make things like robots and
internet connected sensors if you use
the coupon in the description you'll get
a YouTube exclusive discount for the
class see you there
