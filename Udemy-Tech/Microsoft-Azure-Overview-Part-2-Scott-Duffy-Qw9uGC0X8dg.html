high-level overview in this video we're
gonna talk about some of those concepts
of Microsoft Azure and cloud computing
in general so Lewis Carroll in his book
Alice in Wonderland said begin at the
beginning and go on till you come to the
end then stop and no truer words have
ever been spoken right so this in this
video we're gonna begin at the beginning
and we're gonna talk about Microsoft
Azure at a high level so to me Microsoft
Azure has three core services that when
you're designing a solution for yourself
for your client your solution are likely
are going to contain one two or all
three of these into your solution
those are virtual machines app services
and storage now obviously Microsoft has
weekly said last video more than a
hundred core services or services that
it supports and even thousands of
marketplace virtual machines that you
can rent so obviously you can create a
solution that does not include these but
but these are basic this is the basic
building blocks of your solution so
virtual machines maybe you've heard this
term or maybe you haven't it's just a
machine that you can have access to and
control you can have either a Windows
version of Windows or a version of Linux
and basically it's a machine that you
can connect to using a remote desktop
for Windows or remote desktop or SSH for
Linux it looks and acts like a real
server so once you've logged into it you
can do many of those commands that
you're used to doing configure many of
those admin panel settings etc those
machines are can be created onto virtual
networks and ranged in availability sets
and can be placed behind low bouncers
and you have firewalls and you can have
security groups and since it is a
machine you can install whatever suffer
you wish so let's see you
a machine that's running in your local
environment in actual virtual machine
and you want to get that running into
the cloud in some cases it's as simple
as backing up your verse your virtual
machine that's running on your local
network and then uploading the VHD and
getting that spun up within the cloud
okay
it does take five to ten minutes to
create a virtual machine it depends on
how powerful the machine is as well so
some very single core machines or very
small amount of memory machines take a
lot longer to startup and for all the
startup processes just like a real
machine if you have a really
underpowered machine it could take some
time for Windows to spin up app services
now this can be a bit difficult to grasp
if you're not familiar with it but you
can think of it as a place where you can
deploy code okay so if you're a PHP
developer and you don't care about
Windows or Linux and you don't care
about installing PHP and maintaining the
versions and you just want to give
Microsoft your PHP code upload it in a
particular fashion and have it run then
app services is managed code hosting so
within App Services there's things
called web apps mobile apps API apps and
most recently Microsoft introduced
containerized web apps you can choose
between Windows and Linux Linux is a
very new option so if you do have
particular Linux workflow workloads you
can run them in web apps now so for
instance there is a wordpress for web
apps right as an example it's a fully
managed server and you do cannot already
pee into it you cannot SSH into it you
can't FTP into it to upload files so
there is a file upload capability
through FTP but you do not have
otherwise access to that server in an
administrative capacity there are only
certain languages that are supported so
there's not every language Under the Sun
you have dotnet languages net and donek
or Java Ruby nodejs PHP and Python now
let's say you have a C++ app that gets
compiled into an exe binary not dotnet
just good old-fashioned C++ no you
cannot upload a native binary code into
a web app it has to run within these
environments now you get lots of
benefits for doing this you get scaling
benefits you get continuous integration
continuous delivery deployments lots it
has their integrations with Visual
Studio so that you can just hit the
publish button and you click that
destination on the publishing and have
your app automatically deployed
deployment slots are really cool thing
in terms of being able to deploy into a
staging environment and then when you're
ready flip a switch and have it go to
production etc the third leg of that
stool is the azure storage account so
you can create a storage account up to
500 terabytes and then you can have
multiple storage accounts
you pay for consumption obviously so if
you're only using a small amount of
space you're gonna charge very little if
you use up to 500 terabytes
you can be charged quite a bit there's
the thing called blobs blob stands for
binary large object some friends of mine
who are not in technology found that to
be the funniest word but basically it is
a it's a file that's a binary object I'm
gonna have queues tables which are a
couple of different types of data
elements within storage account and even
a files which can be mounted like a net
user e-mount service
it supports the SMB format and think of
a storage Microsoft has care of
replication and so when you create your
storage account you can have it locally
replicated you can have a zone
replication or global replication and
things like that there's also such a
thing as archive storage so this is a
relatively new thing where you can have
storage that you don't expect to need to
access immediately and so if it's a you
know old backup or something you want to
store it you can store it in cold
storage of course there are when we're
dealing with modern applications we're
talking about databases and we're
talking about data services Microsoft
has a sequel database a cloud version a
software-as-a-service sequel database
cosmos DB relatively new type of
globally scaled database and this is
where you've got data that the data
itself is replicated around the world
you can do certain types of segmentation
sharding there's the azure backup
service and recovery services you have
my set my sequel databases Postgres
equal and even big things such as data
warehouses lots of different services
data lakes and things like that micro
services now this is a relatively new
paradigm within development but this the
concept of this is you develop extremely
small pieces of code that are sometimes
stateless sometimes not stateless but
they run they can perform a particular
task and they end and so you can connect
these with event hubs with queues
there's various ways logic apps have a
way of navigating micro services from
one to another but basically the concept
of breaking up these large applications
making them into lots of tiny
applications and those are a lot easier
to scale and a lot more efficient use of
computing power so you don't have to
need you don't need 20 versions of your
web app and 20 versions of your app
service layer and 20 versions of yours
your secondary app services layer you
can have them all share servers and
scale as needed
also networking so when you're dealing
with technology you're not only dealing
with servers but you're dealing with
routers you're dealing with virtual
networks load balancers traffic manager
which is a globally a way of balancing
your load country scale you know
continent scale application gateways
another type of load balancer and even
VPNs and so I realized that we've had
just a very high-level overview of a lot
of these things but as we get into the
various sections of the course we're
gonna dive deeper like I said at the
beginning it's not just what you know
virtual machines and virtual networks
there are machine learning and media
services and cognitive which is a really
cool artificial intelligence you know
facial recognition and translation and
transcription internet-of-things
types of services as well so Microsoft
is a lot of the one of the interesting
things about cloud technologies is that
these cloud vendor providers like Amazon
or like Microsoft are providing api's
that are really really cool that you can
integrate into your applications you
know you can have artificial
intelligence facial recognition in your
application using a particular cognitive
service and so there's lots of this out
there now these tests don't cover all of
it okay so as we get into this course
you will only be talking about stuff
that's on the test but I wanted to start
off with this high level overview of
what a cloud platform is all the various
things that offers and now as we get
into the requirements of the exam we can
start looking at these one by one if you
have any questions or comments please
leave them in the QA section thank you
