you network program ability using Python
and gns3
might take on the learning programming
or any other technology is to just do it
try it make mistakes pick yourself up
and try again don't try and do it
perfectly on the first run create some
code and then iterate or improve and
refine your code as you go along
genus three makes this process very easy
in a previous video I configured the
rudder you're using a Python script this
is what our Python script looks like we
programmatically configured the loopback
addresses and OSPF on the Cisco IOS avi
Rada now let's configure the switch the
rudder was given this IP address through
DHCP what I'll do is configure the
switch manually
on the SVI so IP address question mark
we have to specify the IP address here
so we'll use 72 so hostname switch 1 we
need to configure login details so I'll
set an enable password of Cisco I'll set
up a username of David with a password
of Cisco and on the vty lines I'm gonna
use the command log in local and
transport input all
so let's manually test that telnet works
a telnet to the IP address of the switch
log in with a username of David password
of Cisco enable put password in we can
log in so we've proven that telnet works
on the switch on the switch at the
moment show VLAN brief shows us that
only the default of VLANs are configured
now previously we configured this Python
script what I'm going to do now is copy
this Python script to a another script
called Python switch one script 1 as I
said in the previous video we are not
trying to do everything perfectly here
we are trying to get started and we'll
iterate and improve as we go along so
let's use a nano to edit to that script
in this case the IP address of the
switch is 192 168 1 22 72 we'll be
prompted for a username and our password
we're going to tell it to that host we
are looking for a username and password
prompt so let's confirm that that's what
we're gonna see you're prompted for a
username so that's correct
we're prompted for a password so that's
correct so the script will correctly
look for and then enter those values
we're going to send the enable command
to the switch enter a password of Cisco
then type con 40 and we'll configure a
VLAN of two now you can as always refine
this and improve it but I'm going to
type exit and then create a VLAN 3 and
then exit and let's get rid of all of
this
so let's ctrl K that control you paste
it back ctrl K control you control you
now you could if you preferred just do
this copy that and paste it in
so this create VLANs two three four five
six control X save the configuration now
again before I run the script notice we
only have the default of VLANs
configured and what I'll do now is type
Python Python s1 script one user name is
David password is Cisco this is what was
configured on the switch we can see in
the output of the switch that it was
configured via telnet show VLAN notice
the VLANs have been added to the VLAN
database via LAN two three four five and
six have been added it was as simple as
that to use Python to configure a
network switch now what we could do here
is an example is set a description it's
a Python VLAN two as an example control
X save the script run it again and
hopefully what we should see in the
output here show VLAN what's nice about
the output of this script is we see that
there's a problem I used the wrong
command
so first manually test come on is not
supported so manually test and then
automate so let's do that again the
description is actually the name command
save that run the script again
I didn't configure that manually it was
configured by the scripts to show VLAN
notice the name has changed so let's do
that for the other VLANs control K
control you control you control you
control you control you now this is one
of the reasons why you want to use
variables and loops because it saves a
lot of time doing this manually but
we'll leave that for a different script
so Python Python s one script one user
name is david positive cisco we see what
was configured and if we touched a VLAN
we can see the configuration on the
switch this is the script that we
created again it's not perfect you can
optimize the script you can improve it
there's a lot of things that you can do
to make it better but this demonstrates
how you can quickly start programming
networks using Python with gns3 I hope
you enjoyed the video if it was of
benefit to you please like it and please
subscribe to my youtube channel I wish
you all the very best
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
