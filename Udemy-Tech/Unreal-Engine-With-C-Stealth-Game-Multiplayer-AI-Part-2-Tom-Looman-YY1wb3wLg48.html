our first class for this project and
that's going to be the objective and
that's gonna be an item in the world
that when we walk over it's gonna be
picked up by deployer and then we have
to carry it somewhere so let's just
start by creating a new C++ class and
we'll drive this from actor so that
means any object it can be placed or
spawned in the world as you can
you know reads from the description
right there so we click Next and we call
this fps of GX objective actor and then
the public and private so basically by
default header files will go into the
public and then CPP files will go in the
private folder ok we're using the same
prefix as with the rest of the class
that we already have and we'll use the
same folder structure and then we create
the class
let's reload and that's yep we have to
stop debugging it's all fine okay then
we're back in Visual Studio and we open
up the FPS objective actor now you can
immediately see three functions first
one is actually the constructor that
gets called whenever the object gets
constructed and so in this case we
during the constructor we say yes this
actor can tick now that means that this
function gets called every single frame
one very nice function to use is to
begin play now this gets triggered
whenever the game starts or when the
actor gets spawned with this in the CPP
file I can alt o to go into the header
file this is basically where we specify
what kind of functions are available and
what kind of variables are available and
then in the CPP file like although again
this is where we do the actual work this
is where we write the actual code I'm
just going to f5 and compile this and
then we can already see our class be
available in the game alright so then
when it's all compiled we're back in the
editor and I'm gonna just jump into B
bluefin blueprints folder you can show
that show and hide that way by clicking
here and then we're gonna right-click
create a new blueprint class and now
instead of deriving from any of these
but his classes I'm going to click all
classes and search for objective now you
can see there we are
as FBS objective actor so we select that
and now we're just gonna call this BP
objective cool now we can open it up by
double clicking just drag it here and
now we have a blueprint that's based off
our own class now we could you know be
doing all of the logic here in the event
graph but we're going to be trying to do
most of the logic in C++ because you
know that's kind of the point of this
project one thing I would like to do
already is just find a place for our one
T player to pick up the objective and
for now I'm just gonna use here so I'm
just gonna drag and drop it in now if we
were to play
there's nothing to see here yeah we have
because we have no virtual
representation so if I press f8 you know
there's you really can't see it but we
can select it see we can select it and
see it does exist well there's no visual
representation yet so we need next
lecture we're going to be adding some
components to this actor to give it some
visual representation in the world and
so we can start by slowly adding some
some logic to this actor</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
