absolute beginners I'm going to show you
the five main windows that are the most
important for you to understand at the
start turns a learning unity if you
don't have unity already then jump over
to unity 3d comm click get unity can see
at the moment its unity twenty seventeen
point three that's available if you're
watching this in the future
then maybe it's unity 2018 or 2019 or
maybe twenty forty nine that's available
for you now the five main windows and
I'm going to talk about this video are
the hierarchy hierarchy window here the
project window which is where your
assets are the scene window the game
window and the inspector they're the
five we're gonna have a look at in this
video let's start with the hierarchy now
the hierarchy is a place where all of
the game objects that are listed in your
scene will be presented at the moment
we've got two we have the main camera
and I click on that then you can see the
representation of that in my scene my 3d
world is right here and a directional
light and when I click on that that is
right there so the scene is where we can
look at things manipulate things and
visually represent what's going to
happen in our game and the hierarchy is
where all of those game objects are
listed a game object is basically an
object that we use in our game that
makes sense right
it's pretty straightforward what we'll
do here is create a new game object in
our hierarchy so we're gonna right click
in the hierarchy click 3d object I'm
gonna start by making a plane a plane is
kind of like a ground a ground plane and
you can see the moment we do that then a
visual representation of the appears in
our world
I was just scrolling in to look at it a
bit more closely using my mouse wheel
and the moment that I click on the game
object either in the hierarchy or in the
scene then you can see a whole bunch of
stuff just appeared over here on the
right in the inspector the inspector is
the window that shows me the details of
the game object and all game objects
have information about them that unity
uses to say what should be happening
with this game object in your game you
can see that when I click on the little
grey what are those things called arrow
chevron
when I click on that it expands or
contracts these different components so
at the moment we've got a transform
component the mesh component the mesh
Collider component and the mesh renderer
now you don't need to understand what
those things mean just yet for now all
you need to know is that that's
information that's attached to the game
object let's have a quick look at the
transform component transform component
is pretty straightforward because it's
showing what position this object is in
our world and we can type in numbers in
here say type in 110 well it's gone off
the screen because it's gone very high
or maybe we would type in 2 or 1 there
okay so it's changing the X and Z or Z
or y-coordinate so I can also click on
the Y here just hold my mouse and go up
and down it's raising it up and down in
our world so that's the position I can
also manipulate the rotation by moving
these or typing a number straight in 90
degrees for example put this back to 0 0
thank you and also the scale so I could
make the scale twice as big on the X
twice as big on the wire and twice as
big on the Z or the Z okay scroll out a
little bit so you guys can see that ok
so I can manipulate it there I can also
manipulate these things right in the
visual representation here right in the
scene by clicking on these tools up in
the top I can click on the move tool the
rotate tool or the scale tool and that I
can also use a W the E and the R on the
keyboard to do that
say for example I click on art that
allows me to scale I can grab this
doodad here I think doo-dads the the
official term the widget the the handle
on that I can slide the handle that way
I can slide the handle this way and
interestingly you can't scale a ground
plane up and down it's just a plane it's
just flat so some of these things unity
just knows and it does for you already
but I can scale it these other ways and
I can rotate it by clicking II and then
grabbing these handles and moving the
object around the world okay so that's
the fundamentals of adding an object
visualizing it now seen and then seeing
its components and its information over
here in the inspector it's going to add
a second object here 3d object
cube you can see there's a bunch of
things we can add don't worry about that
for now just gonna add a cube and I will
click on the W tool so they can move it
up in the world and see it if it's
underneath our plane we can't see it but
we can see an outline of it when we move
it up above that now we can see it make
it a little bit bigger but coming over
here make it a three by three by three
and then there you can see there's our
cube if I rotate I'm holding down alt
and moving with my left mouse button
moving around the cube here I can have a
look at it and see it in 3d space now
I'm gonna add one more game object into
our scene right click create object and
capsule I've got a capsule it's been
placed there I'm gonna move it away from
that a bit up a little bit and down a
little bit if I hit F on the keyboard
then it focuses right into that game
object gets me in nice and close and has
that in the middle of the screen so I
can come and see it then I can rotate
around a little bit more scroll back out
okay so I've got a capsule I'm gonna
drop it down a bit
now I'm gonna rename this capsule which
I can do in the inspector that's what
all its information is kept over here to
say player and that could be the start
of having a character run around in our
game we start off as a capsule then we
can add more details and add more
details until it gets to the point where
it looks like something amazing later on
in our game so now we have that there
we've got these two original game
objects the camera and the line we've
added a plane a cube and a player we've
got five game objects in our scene the
next thing we're gonna do is create an
asset so I'm gonna come down here in the
projects window I'm going to right click
on assets and create a material so again
there's a lot of stuff that we can be
adding here don't worry about that for
now I'm just going to find this one
which is a material and that's basically
a skin or a color that we can put on to
any of our game objects so I'm going to
change this to call it blue okay you
don't have to rename it but it's kind of
a little bit easier to see that the blue
things called blue click on that again
there's a whole bunch of stuff in the
inspector that it's showing us about
this asset here about this material that
we've created you can see down the
bottom here it says blue dot matte now
that means that it's created a dot m80
file that's going to be saved on our
hard drive there
now exists as a file and I'm going to
come over here into the inspector click
on the albedo color swatch here and find
a blue you can see that's dynamically
updated there that's wonderful get out
of that and now what I can do is drag
this blue over onto my capsule and you
can see as I was dragging it anything
that I dragged past it said you want to
make this blue door I make this blue
nope just the capsule for now now my
capsule is blue if I go and click on the
capsule you can see we have this blue
shader is now being represented in the
inspector because that is something that
has been attached to this player game
object ok and let's make a second
material over in here I can do that by
same process right click create material
or I can just go ctrl or command D to
duplicate that'll make the exact same
thing and call it blue one let's rename
this just clicking on it there rename it
to a red we'll say and then we will go
over into the inspector and we will
change it to red drag it over on our
green ground plane if I looked at that
red and say not quite right I can click
on the red asset again and change that
to I know a little bit more a little bit
darker red okay so and you can see that
it updates in the scene we can see a
representation of what's going on there
ok now that we've got some things in our
scene we can play our game and we click
play the play button at the top here
that shows us what our game currently is
and all our game is at the moment is a
camera that doesn't move and this side
view of a cube and maybe seen the
capsule there so we'll click back out of
play mode and when we clicked play mode
it automatically put us into the game
window at any time you can jump to the
game window to see how your game is
looking at the start of your game and
obviously when we put in behaviors into
our game things will move around and
stuff so you can't just click the game
window to see that you have to click the
play button and then it says write
everything start get get the ball
rolling with what this game is about
so click back onto the scene view I'm
going to find my main camera which is a
game object and you can see the game
object in the scene here I'm going to
move it up and as I move it our camera
preview is going to change
my goal here is to move it in a way
where I can see the cube and my capsule
so I move over to the right a little bit
rotate a little bit here there's a few
ways to do this but for now just not
very manually so you guys can see what's
going on and I can click if I want to do
one axis and another axis at the same
time you can see that I've got this
square in the middle that allows me to
move both of them at once there we go
okay so now when I click play this is
what our game will be showing it'll be
showing this camera position where I can
see my cube and my capsule and if we put
behavior in there then great stuffs are
going to happen things are going to come
to life likewise I can move around my
directional light to change the way the
shadows will be rendered and it shows me
dynamically what's going on as I rotate
around my light you can see that it's
changing in the scene view it changes
what we can see and you might be
thinking that's all well and good but
how do I make this world come to life
let me show you that very quickly the
mechanism for how scripts are added in
the game now scripts are added as
components to a game object so if I
click on my player here and say I want
that player to be doing something for
example when you push down forward it
runs forward and the way that we create
a script which is like a recipe or or a
program or a piece of code come over to
the inspector while clicked on this
particular game object add component and
you can see a bunch of things we can do
here we can add physics we can add
rendering we can add audio we can add
effects what we're looking for now
scrolling down the bottom is a new
script we're going to type this as
player movement you can cut your scripts
whatever you want but it helps to name
in a way that makes sense and we'll
click create and add and that has
created the player movement script here
if I expand open up this component you
can see it's sitting in there it's also
created it as an asset so all scripts
are assets and this script can be
attached to the player or I can go and
attach this to the object the another
object like the cube if I click on the
cube you can see it now has the player
movement script doesn't make a lot of
sense to have that particular script on
the cube because we want the player to
be moving not the cube so I can right
click
and remove that component now if we
double click on this to open it up it's
gonna open this up in Visual Studio for
you it might open it up in monodevelop
and you can see in here a whole bunch of
stuff that may or may not make sense if
you've got a background in programming
you might look at and say cool I know
what's going on here don't worry about
that for now I'm not going to show you
the scripting component of this that's a
bigger deeper conversation about getting
started with scripting I just want to
show you that this is where you put the
recipe or the information or the code
for making things happen in uni it's on
this script and then that script is
attached to a game object then when the
game starts when you click play it looks
at the script that's on the game object
and says what would you like me to do
that's the mechanism so scripts are
attached to game objects and then the
last thing I want to show you guys in
this video is the asset store so a
window that I didn't mention but the
asset store window just the pointer if
you can't find any of these windows I've
been talking about click on window come
down here and we'll click on asset store
that opens up the asset store tab this
is a really magical place for someone
starting out in unity because you can go
and find a whole bunch of art assets or
audio assets or user interface assets
things that allow you just to put them
into the scene and start playing around
with it so now I'm going to search for a
skybox and the skybox just jumping back
here to my scene the skybox is the thing
in the background that you see way off
in the distance and the default is this
kind of bluey sky with a grey ground I'm
just going to go in and find a skybox
I'm going to click on free over here
just to find free sky boxes and we'll go
and click on the skybox volume 2 this is
by the Hedgehog team okay and that'll
show you what's going on with this
what's one of the details of it you can
look to see whether you're interested in
it I've already downloaded it in the
past so for me it has the import button
here but for you it might say download
you click download it'll download it and
then you click import and that's the
process of importing these assets into
your unity project and I'm gonna click
import here bring these things in these
will be placed in the assets folder the
assets directory down here which is in
the project window so I wanted to show
that process when you're bringing in
external assets they're going to be
placed within this folder down here
there we have them down there I'm just
going to click back onto my scene find
by navigating through here it's the same
system like a Windows directory you can
have a look here it's got previews think
we're over the planet now I'm not going
to go into the details of how skybox is
work and exactly how this is all set up
that's something that we talked about a
bunch of our courses about assets and
importing assets and using assets and
creating your own assets but for now I
just want to show you that within this
particular asset pack not all this not
all the same by any means there's one of
these options in here if I just grab
that and drag it into my world
then it places the places this skybox in
the scene and my fairly basic scenes has
gone from boring to goodness me wait
suddenly flying through outer space with
this big molten planet behind us ever
make my ground plane a bit bigger we can
scale it up to say 100 by 100 by 100
then it makes it look a little bit more
like a ground and as I scroll around
move around I can see all this stuff
behind me if I click play it'll show me
what my game view is going to see and my
game view sees the sky off in the
distance which is really neat and gives
that extra flavor to my game okay so
just to recap in this video we've talked
about the hierarchy and that's where
your game objects will be listed the
scene view which is where your game
objects will be visualized and you can
manipulate everything in 3d space the
project window with the assets directory
which is where our assets are saved and
those are all things that are saved onto
a hard drive as well this is showing
what we've got saved as assets and then
the inspector which is the place that
shows all the details the information
the components of the game objects and
the things that we have within our world
the game window which is the
representation of what our game is
actually going to look like when we
click play on the play button and
finally we talked about the asset store
which I think is a really neat place to
play around with bringing in assets to
make your game come to life so that
you've got something neat to look at
when you're first learning unity so
that's a really quick introduction to
unity for you guys hopefully it's been
useful hopefully you're excited about
unity I'd love to see you guys come join
us on one of our courses thanks for
