thing that we need to do is to power up
the circuit and then here the Bluetooth
module with my computer the supplied
power we will need to USB cable to do
that will antenna later so what's
happening now is you see that the
Bluetooth module has a red blinking LED
on its PCB it's probably blinking and
that is telling us that the Bluetooth
module is in discovery mode is ready to
be connected in other words going to
turn the circuit like this so that the
side camera can pick the blinking LED so
that once we have the connection
established between the module and my
computer the LED will become solid will
stop blinking and that's how we know
that we've got a connection so let's go
over to my computer now before I do the
pairing between the Bluetooth module and
my computer I would like to upload this
little sketch so this little sketch has
got nothing specific designed to work
with a Bluetooth connection this sketch
just simply works with serial
connections so you can see it says this
is where it starts the serial interface
whatever that might be it might be USB
or it might be Bluetooth as long as the
serial is going to work and inside the
loop it checks to see if any data has
been sent from the external serial
device to the Arduino and if yes it will
read it then down here if that value of
character that was sent from the
external device from the remote from the
connected device to the ordinary is a
capital H then it will turn on the LED
that's all there is happening here and
again I repeat that this is nothing
specific to the Bluetooth module this is
going to work with the serial interface
as well
so before doing the connection can
upload it just double check they've got
the right settings so they said you know
you know and the correct serial
interface and upload the sketch another
study says that there was an error
during the upload it seems like the USB
interface was not able to actually work
and that is because I've got the
Bluetooth module connected so the thing
to remember here is that the Bluetooth
module is connected at this for this
demonstration on the hardware serial
channel of Maya do you know that some
pins 0 and 1 and these are the same
things that the USB interface is also
using right now there is a conflict
between the mode the Bluetooth device
using the two serial interface pins and
the USB interface using the same pins
and you can only have one or the other
we can't have both connected at the same
time so to make it possible to upload
the sketch via USB I'm just going to
unplug the Bluetooth module and just
leave it aside and that way there's not
going to be any conflict between the
Bluetooth module end they USB interface
trying to use the same you are the same
serial Channel great so now let's try to
upload again great so this time it
worked I'm going to bring up the serial
monitor
we still have connection by the USB
interface and I'm just going to type
capital H and hit enter and there you go
the LED turns on any other information
since the cross will turn the LED off on
and off great what I'll do now is I'm
going to remove the USB interface
and I'm going to power on my Arduino
using battery power I'm going to plug in
the Bluetooth module back into my
circuit and it's now in discovery mode
and let's go back to my computer and I'm
going to turn on the Bluetooth interface
on my computer and go into preferences
and see if we can find the HC 0 6
interface first and then connect to it
and there it is down here so click on
connect so this is the same process that
you follow to create a connection
between your computer and any other
Bluetooth device same process here so
connecting I need to type in the passkey
which is 1 2 3 4 will connect and there
you go we've got a connection so we've
got a connection between the computer
and the Bluetooth device the LED here
the indicator is still blinking rapidly
but that's okay now let's close the
serial monitor and go into the Adina IDE
and just change the port of
communication from the original USB so
now there's a new entry here and the
ports and we can select the HC 0 6 death
B so let's plug that in and then bring
up the serial monitor again and notice
that there's no connection the LED now
is solid it means that the module is
connected to a serial monitor or to
another serial interface on the computer
and let's try to turn on the LED h go
it's on anything else
it's off so exactly the same
functionality as before but now using a
wireless serial connection instead of a
wired serial connection so there was
pretty easy I think let's try something
else next let's plug in a Sybil sensor
and see how we can get the Bluetooth
module to help us send data back to the
computer via the wireless serial
connections were
