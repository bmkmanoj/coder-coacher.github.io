application and see just how quickly we
can do this in Salesforce and this is
one reason why Salesforce is so
successful is because you can create
applications very rapidly and so to
start off with I'm going to go to the
objects and fields section of the setup
menu now this is assuming you've got a
free developer account from Salesforce
so I'll make a link to this sign up for
a free developer account in the
description of this video and then you
just simply once you're logged in you
click on the gear icon to go to setup
and it was up to setup menu and we're
going to go to objects and fields and
select object manager now for our new
application that we're going to create I
need to add a new object to my
Salesforce instance here and these are
different standard objects that are
available in Salesforce and these may
differ somewhat in your own free
developer account depending on what
you've done with it but if I click on
the create menu and select custom object
I'm going to create a new custom object
in my Salesforce instance this
application I'm going to create a
mileage tracking application this is
something that you could use if you're
doing business related travel with your
vehicle for instance and the idea behind
this is that we're going to create a new
object called trip and then we're going
to have our starting and ending mileage
and put together this application here
in Salesforce so I'm going to make this
label for this new object of this
application this main primary object
we're going to use is called trip and
then the plural label will be trips and
it does not start with a vowel sound and
I'm going to scroll down and we're going
to have a data type the auto number for
the trip and we're going to start the
numbering designation with a T and then
a dash and then we're going to do five
digits
and we have the starting number b1 and
I'm going to select allow reports and
activities in track field history I'm
leaving I'm not going to take a lot of
time to explain all these designations I
am going to select the last search and
then as well add the notes and
attachments and launch the new custom
tab wizard but since I'm trying to see
how quickly I can create a new app I'm
not going to spend a lot of time
explaining this and we're just going to
move forward and see where we end up and
how quickly we end up there I'm going to
set a tab style and select a tab of a
car since this is related to mileage
tracker and click Next and then we're
going to apply one tab visibility to all
profiles default on and that's just the
default designation and click Next and
then we're going to include this tab in
actually none of these different
applications and click Save and so now
we've created our custom object we call
trip and we need to create a new a few
new fields and so if I click on fields
and relationships we need to add a date
field and let's go ahead and select date
radio button and click Next and we're
going to label this just with the term
date and this will be the date of the
trip that we take we have a formula to
populate this by default with today and
so I'm going to type in today and then
opening and closing parentheses check
the syntax make sure that that's right
no errors click Next I'm going to make
this visible for the default profiles
that are selected and click Next and add
this to the page layout and click Save
and new and then I want to have a couple
of member fields so the first number
field will be for the starting mileage
so we select number radio button and
click Next
and then we're going to call this
starting mileage we'll have the length
be seven digits long with a decimal
place of one so we can account for
tenths of a mile we're going to click
Next and we're going to accept the
defaults for the visibility of this
particular new field by profile and add
this to the page layout as well and
click Save and new to save that starting
mileage field and now we're going to
create one more numeric field and here's
where you select the data type once
again is number click Next and then this
is the ending mileage once again we're
going to make the length of this one as
well seven digits long and then one
decimal place to allow four tenths of a
mile we're going to leave the rest alone
and click Next and then we're going to
take the defaults here and click Next
and click Save so now we've got a date
field and a beginning and ending mileage
filled and now we're going to create a
formula field to subtract the mileage
the starting and ending mileage to get
our miles to calculate the mileage for
the trip so we click on new we select
formula click Next and then we're just
going to say distance travel this way if
you're owed ometer and your vehicle is
kilometers or miles it'll work either
way and so now the formula return type
will be a number we're going to click
Next and then we're going to do our
advanced formula by clicking there and
we're going to click insert field and
find our ending mileage and insert that
and then we're going to insert an
operator of subtract and then we're
going to insert another field with our
beginning mileage or starting mileage
and so this is just simply a math
equation for this formula we're taking
our ending mileage and then from that
we're subtracting the starting mileage
to give our distance traveled so I'm
going to check the syntax no errors and
we're going to treat blank fields as
blanks well let's just leave that treat
blank fields as zeros actually and let's
click Next
and we're going to take the defaults
here you know so it is read-only because
that's a formula field so you can't edit
a formula field and we're going to add
page load as well and click Save so we
have our new object we created called
trip and now we're going to go into
setup and the set up search actually and
create a new application now that we
have our object that we need for the
application and so in Salesforce an
application is just a series of tabs and
so if we search for app or apps here we
can go to the app manager and here in
lightning experience and this is the new
interface where sales forces of the
lighting experience app manager we're
going to select a new lightning app and
we're going to name this mileage tracker
when we tap out that field it fills in
the API name or the developer name
automatically with the underscore you
could add an image we're not going to do
that for sake of time click next we're
gonna do standard navigation instead of
putting this inside of a cell source
console and we don't need the service
setup menu options we're just going to
click Next and then for the utility bar
items we don't need any utility bars
here but you could add those these are
these icons here at the bottom of the
screen that I've got my mouse over and
clicking next we're going to make the
available items let's look for our trip
object you could type here and there's
our trips that's the plural that we
selected previously and then let's go
ahead and let's add an account object so
we've got in our application we've got
trips and accounts available let me
click Next and then for available
profiles we will just select all
profiles to make this app available to
by shift-clicking
from top to bottom and clicking the
right arrow to move them over to the
ride and click Save and finish and so
now if we click on the app launcher we
see that we have our mileage tracker
this is a new application that I just
created and I don't know how quickly we
did that but it was probably less than
10 minutes and so now we have inside of
our mileage tracker app we have our
different trips and also this accounts
tab now I want to go in before we create
any new trips is that in adding the
accounts to this application I realize
that for like a new trip for example I
want to add a look up for the account so
I can associate this trip with like a
client visit for example so here's a
preview of a new trip screen these are
the fields that we created that have
been added to the page lab but I'm going
to cancel out of that and let's go back
into our object manager and I've got it
in this tab here already and let's add
one more new field and this will be a
lookup field to the account object so
I'm going to select that as a count and
we're relating that lookup
to the account object and click Next and
then we're going to tab out of the field
label to fill in the field name and then
we're going to leave the rest defaults
and click Next keep the defaults here as
well as far as visibility and add this
to the page layout and click Save to
finish that out so now I'm going to go
back to my trips tab inside of the
mileage tracker app and I'm gonna go
ahead and click refresh just in case the
new button is cached in memory to not
include the account look up I'm gonna
click new and make sure we've got the
account look up now so you notice here
we've got the account lookup and I'm
going to select in the counties
associate this trip for now Dickinson
PLC is a just a sample account name that
comes in the free Salesforce developer
accounts unless say that my starting
mileage on this trips I'd take today my
mileage on my odometer was 10,000 miles
and then my ending mileage was 10,000
100.1 for example I'm gonna click Save
and now I'll bring me to the details
screen for that trip and you notice the
auto numbering of this record we did the
auto numbering with the five digits
starting with number one and preceded
with a prefix of the t dash and so we've
got our starting an ending mileage and
our distance traveled is showing in the
formulas one hundred point one miles and
so it's that quick that we've been able
to create a app inside of the Salesforce
platform this is just a hint or a
glimpse of why this platform is so
powerful the more that you're involved
with web development and creating
applications through iOS or Java or
traditional routes or even HTML you
realize quickly that Salesforce has a
better way of doing things now of course
there's limitations but you can create
an application that works out of the box
not only on desktop but this app will
serve you well on a mobile device as
well and so feel free to use this
application for your own purposes for
your mileage tracking if you're a
consultant or
salesperson and you do a lot of
traveling and you need to deduct mileage
off your tax returns need to track all
that you can pull out your phone and
very quickly log your mileage using this
new app that you just created on the
Salesforce platform</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
