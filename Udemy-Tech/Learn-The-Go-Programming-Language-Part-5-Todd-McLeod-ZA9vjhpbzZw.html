just on the web here in a moment but
this video is for people who are
interested in exploring downloading
what's called an IDE and an IDE is an
integrated development environment and
that's just a fancy almost like
intimidating phrase to say that here's a
piece of software that's gonna help you
write your code and so if you want to
download an IDE and installed on your
machine and get go installed on your
computer this video and probably the
next video are going to show you how to
do that and then you could write code on
your computer and compile it on your
computer and do that kind of stuff so
we're going to talk about that in this
video in the next video maybe two maybe
three videos and then there's a lot of
people do want to know that and then
we'll just go back I'll go back to
teaching you how to code by by some
weird noise outside my garage by by
doing it on the web I'll show you where
we can do it on the web real easily just
to get started so for editors for Ige's
there's two editors that really stand
out to me and one is Golan and Golan is
created by JetBrains
and so JetBrains also has JetBrains also
has created webstorm and then they've
created what's the one for java the
IntelliJ they created an intelligent
Abba and then Android Studios built off
of IntelliJ and so if you ever have any
inclination to do Android apps using
JetBrains is great because you'll become
familiar using go Landers great you'll
become familiar with JetBrains IDE s and
then when you go to Android studio it'll
be like oh this that's totally familiar
to me and so that's the reason why at
the college we use JetBrains because we
also teach Android studio classes and
it's easy for students to go from goal
and to webstorm - you know IntelliJ for
Java - Android studio it's all very
similar this is one of the best IDE s
that's out there they have a free 30-day
trial and if you are
you could Google jetbrains student I
think you need a student email address a
dot edu email address you could go here
and you can get it for free for a year
so you just click apply now the next
thing which is good to know about is vs
code so Visual Studio code right here is
another editor which is great for go
and so you could download vs Visual
Studio code and you could use that for
doing your go programming so those are
the two best IDE s which are out there
and so once you have those downloaded
and installed you could start
configuring them to use to do go
programming and in the course on udemy I
show you how to do a lot more of that
stuff in more detail so the the next
thing that you should know is that you
need to install go laying on your
computer if you're gonna run it on your
computer and it's called golang for the
go language go programming language and
also when you google stuff like if you
just typed in go concurrency right who
knows what you're gonna get but if you
type in go laying concurrency right go
laying concurrency then you know you're
getting stuff related to the go
programming language interesting six
hundred sixty six thousand results for
going concurrency so to download and
install go you just click on download go
right here and then you just choose
whatever version like Mac OS here's Mac
OS and I would choose well right up here
at the top Apple Mac OS I'd grab this
one here go one point nine point to
Darwin amd64 package right and and that
would download and install on my
computer you can do it for Linux you
could also do it for Windows so whatever
whatever you're using and then the
tricky thing with getting go installed
and up and running is setting
environment variables and so this is
where it becomes like a little bit of
like oh there's a couple of pieces to
learn if you're a beginner because you
have to do things at the command line
and so here's the command line and I
know you might be having that experience
where like I just started out really
basic and then all of a sudden it's like
okay cool we had that really nice basic
and
Daksha now like all this complex stuff
and and that's why I like this video is
really for people who have more
experience and if you want to get it set
up on your computer you should have some
more experience and if you take my class
on yoona me I'm gonna walk you through
like all the steps to understand this
this is a command-line interface like we
used to use computers only with the
command-line interface but now we have
this entire thing with a graphical user
interface where I could click buttons
and drag and drop things around but the
command-line interface once goes
installed you'll have some good
environment variables and and then the
go route is going to is going to point
towards where this file here that you
downloaded and installed that's gonna
point towards where all that that code
went so it's basically like the go
runtime the go the programming the pro
the code that's needed for go to run on
your computer and compile stuff and all
that and so that's so that's what your
goal is and then you're go pass needs to
point to your workspace it needs to
point to your go workspace so a go
workspace and let's just take a look at
that go workspace is going to have three
folders in it it's gonna have a bin a
package and a source and so bin is for
your binary so when you compile a
program your binary executables will be
stored in your bin and and then package
is for like if I've already compiled
third-party packages and nothing's
changed that's already compiled the
compiler when I recompile my program
doesn't need to recompile the
third-party packages that saves time
efficient compilation so that's where
that stuff gets stored and they're like
dot a files like an archive and then
here in source is your works is a is
your where your source code goes for any
programs that you run and create and
it's also your source code for any
packages and that has a name spaced
environment and so that name space
environment is going to allow for
different packages to exist and for you
to call different packages and again all
this is covered in the course so if I CD
and a source
right you'll see that I have all this in
here and then Phi CD and to github you
know and then I could go into goes to 11
which is me and I could look at that and
and then inside there I could see okay I
have a go programming repo and and then
I could look at that you know and it's
got different sections in there and if I
look at that in tired Directory users
Todd McLeod go that's my workspace and
right underneath that I've been
packaging source right and then in
source here's my namespace and github
goes to Levin code and so that that code
is out there on github but also it's on
my computer and so I could use commands
like go git and it's the go command and
I can bring that code down to my
computer from anybody's repo that has it
available and then it'll store it in the
namespace like it'll be github some
other person and then the name of that
repo with that code but I now have that
package available to work with and so
now if you're experienced you might be
saying hey what about dependency
management and there's different things
you start to think about and in the NGO
communities definitely thinking about
all that dependency management it's a
little bit of a work in progress still
but it's doing pretty great these days
so but that the main thing here is when
you install go first you gotta get an
editor go lamb vs code to me those are
the two default choices second you need
to install go once goes installed you
need to make sure that your go route and
your go path environment variables are
set to the right place go route is all
the code that you downloaded and
installed from golang.org for for go
programming and then go path it points
to your workspace and your workspace you
should only have one until you become
much more advanced just have one and
your workspace needs to have source
package and bin as three folders in it
and then in source you have this
namespace environment where all your
your code is stored and it's a domain
and then usually a username and then a
repo is how that works so that's pretty
cool so that's just a little bit of an
introduction to name spacing and using
an editor and that was all in one video
and how long did that take us
eight minutes not too bad that's a quick
blast through getting your own system
set up and and if you want to do it that
way to code awesome I recommend it and
if not we're gonna do do some coding
here where we just do it at the go leg
playground which we're gonna see in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
