we created this organization roma / that
implements the roma power interface and
we saw what that was and how it's used
in the Spring Framework next we're going
to create an implementation of our
organization Dao interface that we
created in the previous video and that's
this one here that has got these methods
so we're going to start work on that so
we're going to go to our Dao input
folder I'm going to right click click on
you select class we're going to call
this one organization Dao impl and we
need to add the interface we're going to
do a search for organization and we're
going to use chooses organization Dao
which is the interface we're looking to
override I'm going to click on or ensure
that inherited abstract methods are
checked click on finish and you can see
that by default all these methods have
had empty stubs created for us and we
can then implement and then we'll see
the actual code shortly and we can then
go ahead and implement that code so
let's start by creating a JDBC template
it's going to be a field so it's so
private JDBC template JDBC template and
then for the set data source method this
is where we're going to define that so
we're going to change that it will
actually call this this parameter data
sources to be clear what it is and we'll
get rid of the comment because we are
going to implement the code nail the
code is going to be JDBC template is
equal to new JDBC template and data
source is what we're passing to that
so online there's 17 as you can see here
we're wrapping the datasource in an
instance of JDBC template the data
source is going to be injected from an
XML configuration file with its own beam
decoration and we're going to be
creating that to a configuration file in
XML shortly now the data source itself
is a factory for our database
connections and if we open up a browser
let me do a search here for for Java X
dot sequel dot data source we can see
some documentation here we'll just
choose the first one even though it's an
older version of Java it'll still
suffice but actually in any event we can
change this up here to go to the version
8 documentation it's changed the 7th or
8th so basically it says here a factory
for connections to the physical data
source that this data source object
represents and it's an alternative to
the driver manager facility a data
source object is the preferred means of
getting a connection an object that
implements that data source interface
will typically be registered with a
naming service based on the Java naming
in directory now Jane di API so we know
XML configuration file we're going to
use an implementation of the Java X dot
sequel dot data source and we'll see
that shortly so going back to eclipse
most of these methods we're going to
leave until later videos but to one that
so we can work on now is just get all
organizations so let's implement that
and we can just do string sequel query
equals select star from organization and
then we can create a list of
organization objects all the list equals
and Australia BC template dot query
then we pass the query then we do a new
organization row mapper and then we
return our org list so to be clear they
get all organizations method returns a
list of all organization beans from the
table in my sequel and I've just written
some simple were sequel code here that
the selector returns all the rows in the
organization table pretty
straightforward the sequel code there
now the query method from the JDBC
template takes two arguments and returns
a list of organization objects the first
argument is the sequel query itself
which is just a string and the second
argument is the organization row mapper
in other words an instance of the aroma
/ which we coded a short while ago and
it maps each row of the organization
table to a results set object and then
on line 34 we're just returning the list
of organization objects alright so at
this point we now need to start working
with some XML we need to create the bean
stuff CP done XML so we're going to come
down here to the source main resources
forwarder or we're going to right click
here click on new select other then the
father we want is the spring bean
configuration file to bring bean
configuration file click on next the new
file name beans touch CP dot XML press
enter there I'll click finish and we've
got that open as you can see and what we
want to do first is coming to namespaces
and then we want to check the context
and if that pop-up happens to pop up you
just click on OK to that but I've
clicked on the options so it doesn't
continually pop up each time so we've
got the context tab now is showing down
here all right so what are we going to
be doing here we're going to be creating
the bean definition for the
implementation of the datasource
interface which we
just talked about a while ago now we're
going to be using the org dot Apache
Commons dot DB CP basic data source and
that's actually available within a jar
file which we downloaded when we added
the Commons dbcp related dependency in a
previous video in this section of the
course so the commons DB CP is a library
that's going to provide us with the
database connection pouring facility and
if we go back to the browser and we do a
bit of a search you do a search for or
Pachi got Commons dbcp basic data source
and open up the documentation
down here we get to feel detail and you
can see that that's we scroll down it's
got a user name there it's also got a
password and also if we scroll up a
little bit it's got this driver class
name now this is the database driver
which is available in the my sickle
connector dependency library that we
configured in the previous video in this
section of the course and incidentally
the username and password are what we're
going to be using to connect to our
spring underscore DB database that we
added in my sequel so in terms of this
driver class name if we go to this page
type in a new tab depth up my sequel
comm slash doc slash connector - J 6.0
/en forward slash connector - Jay - API
- changes the HTML so don't worry there
is a link in the resources section of
this video
but if we go to that - gyro this part
down here the name of the class that
implements Java dot secret driver in my
sequel connector has changed from combat
my sequel JDBC driver to combo see
called CJ JDBC driver the old name has
been deprecated so in other words what
we need to do is use this new name this
combo C called
CJ JDBC driver we need to use that as
our driver class name when we start the
configuration process and if we open
another tab and do a google search for
my sequel connector your role you should
be able to specify this first one here
which will give us the information we
need and if we have a look this I'm
actually an option here showing the
actual format for connection he was a
simple example for a connection URL this
is what will ultimately need to do to be
able to configure how my sequel
connector and we're going to be eating
something like that but we're going to
be removing this last bit is question
mark profile
SQL equals true so we're talking about
this and what it is shortly but
basically this is going to be the way
that we're going to be accessing the
database we'll need to specify this path
but then we'll also need to specify the
database name and then we'll also need
to pass a parameter to indicate that
we're not going to be using SSL for the
connection but it'll probably be easy if
we go back to the code and I'll show you
how to go about doing that all right so
let's go back to the beans tab let's
click on the new bean button the name
was going to be DS
we're version of a data source can be
anything you want but this is a good
abbreviation for a data source for class
let's click on the Browse button really
go for basic data source so it's using
the org dot Apache got comments dbcp
choose that and when I click on finish
then we're going to add some properties
to the bean definition the four
properties are talked about the username
the password the data source name and
also the URL so we're going to select
and do one at a time so I'm going to
right click add es then we're going to
check at beans and then we're going to
click on insert property element so for
this first one we're going to type
username in the username field and in
the value field we're going to type
dollar left curly brace JDBC username
the right curly brace so we're going to
be inserting a property value out of the
properties file and you've seen these
placeholders and how we work with them
in previous videos but we'll be doing
that again here so that's the username
won't do the same thing for password I'm
back onto clicking DES right click
select beans insert property element
name this time is going to be password
the value that's going to be dollar left
curly brace JDBC password right curly
brace and another one another property
beans select insert property this time
it's going to be the driver class loan
as we talked about
driver classname make sure you get the
capitalization correct and the valley is
going to be dollar left curly brace JDBC
dot driver class name rot curly brace
and you guessed it the last one is going
to be our URL so right click select on
beans click on insert a property element
the name we're going to call it 2 euro
and the value dollar left curly brace
JDBC dot euro alright so we done there
now we've got our four properties now
define and we can go and have a look at
the source code for that and you can see
that so I configured correctly yeah in
the raw XML view and we can reformat
that code it makes shorts nice and tidy
alright 10 let's just go back to the
resources folder right click click on
you select other and they want to choose
general and file we want to create
properties file
it's going to be organization dot
properties press enter there then we
need to put our four values in so this
one JDBC dot driver class name is equal
to comma dot my sequel dot CJ JDBC
driver then we want JDBC username that's
equal to dev user that's what we've
defined when we set this up originally
to our access to our database in my
sequel workbench JDBC dot password it's
equal to and he went to your password
now you won't see me typing my password
here but this is where you're putting
your password that you defined and then
finally we want the connection string so
that's going to be JDBC dot your role
that's gonna be equal to JDBC : my
sequel colon forward slash forward slash
localhost 3 306 slash then the name of
the database we called our spring let's
call a DB and then we need to add this
argument this parameter on the end which
is going to be question mark use SSL and
make sure you type the case exactly as
I've topped it here equals false all
right so let's finish the video here now
we've got this far in the next video we
need to go back to the beans
- CP del xml file and we need to start
out creating a bean definition for the
dao implementation that we started work
on so i'm going to save everything here
now and in the video and see you in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
