we were talking about numbers
specifically we looked at integers and
float data types so these are referred
to as data types in Python so integers
and floats in this lecture we're going
to look at strings I already mentioned
strings ping in the previous lecture so
a string is everything that goes inside
clothes however every and that is a
string and of course strings can be
stored in variables and you can print
those variables so we're using the
interactive shell now but of course you
can use a Python script as we did
previously so numbers were used to do
math operations but strings strings are
used for displaying information for the
user so let's say you have a web
application and you want to generate
some texts dynamically on the web page
so you would use Python all the backends
and Python would step send strings to
the HTML code an HTML or of the rendered
the code on the web page basically
that's the idea or if you want to create
a notepad an editor with Python such as
Adam let's say all these things you see
here so my program dot boy selection
find all these dudes be written as
strings inside Python and when you
display them all the interface using
various functions for instance if you
want to display a string on the terminal
you'd use the print function now strings
have methods associated with them what I
mean with methods is let me go ahead and
try out a method
methyls four methods you need to use a
dot notation so you refer to the string
which is string.c in our case actually
variable c but the variable is holding
the strings so it's the same as doing
here dot so let's do C dot replace and
what I want to replace is e with I so
I'm replacing four string here I'm
replacing letter E with letter I and
well that will do it will repeal replace
all the letters all occurrences of this
letter in the string so you would ask
where can we see these methods well
that's very easy actually you can do
dear a van pass a stream there any
string it could be C it could be an IP
string or whatever that will print out
all the available methods that you can
use with strings so let's say C dot
opfer that's who will cover the screen
of the string to upper case letters now
if you want to know what these methods
are about you could ask for help just do
help and then see sort of string or just
empty string dots replace just like that
and here you get the help and so you get
the definition here replace method of
the string instance so string is like
the blueprint that creates strings
objects or you can say the data type
that represents texts look here here is
a syntax so what you do is use another
string like we did
so I say here replace when you open
brackets here is old item you want to
remove from the shrink and that the new
item we want to replace it with oil
Alvin
what you see here in square brackets
that means this parameter is optional so
you can either pass it or not you know
in the previous case we didn't pass it
so what Python did was it replaced all
the currencies of of the e item but if
you want to replace only the first
occurrence you do one there and that
will replace only the first I only the
first e with oil that's how it works so
string some very support functions so
preen is a function here and they
support methods like this one here and I
also support operators so you can do
here plus there and you get here there
or you can make it more readable like
that so an empty space is also string
and yeah that's about strings for now
and I'll talk to you later
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
