coding and I'd like to start by diving
into our weapon class and doing some
actual weapon of implementation so let's
start going by heading into the edit the
header file and one thing we'll need is
we'll definitely need some kind of fire
function so let's just call this
function fire and create the
implementation for it there we go
so what we want to do in this function
is trace the world from pong eyes to
crosshair location which is the center
screen okay so we can just start right
away by doing some tracing so we get the
world and we'll do a line trace single
and we do this by channel and start off
by specifying a hit result that will
hold all of our data so this is a struct
that will be filled with a bunch of data
that so we know what we hit how far it
was and the the hit normal and all of
this useful information so let's specify
let's pass it in to the function now we
need a start point and we need an end
point then we need a collision channel
so let's start first by now we need to
figure out we somehow need to know who
our owner is or like who is holding this
weapon now we can do this later on by
specifying the owner so with that
assumption in mind we'll just get the
owner which will be o which will be of
type actor just call this my owner
and we just need to make sure that this
is actually set to true that is valid at
the point we need it so let's just move
this inside of the if statement now from
my owner will use get actor eyes
viewpoint so we'll start by specifying
we need to as you can see there's a
location and a rotation and they're
passing by reference so we need to
specify these as a location and that
rotator eye rotation now as this
function gets executed and we passed
these parameters because they're passed
by reference my tell us it's there we go
there see there effector a percent so
there they will be filled with the data
from the owning actor so once this has
run we have the correct information to
start doing a trace so we can start the
trace from our eye location that's
completely fine and the end location
will be something like the eye location
and then the direction that we're
looking plus a big number so let's just
make a new vector and call that trace
and we'll start with eye location and
then we would like to do a rotation but
this is a rotator so to convert this to
a vector that like a direction vector we
just get vector and we'll multiply this
with some big number usually use ten
thousand that should that should reach
far enough to hit any kind of enemy
elbow passes into the function now we
have one more that we definitely need
and that is the collision channel now
later on and the more in the weapon
Advanced section I would look I would
like to use our own channel so we have a
little bit more control but for now
we can use the visibility channel to
trace against the world so anything that
blocks this channel will get will block
our trace and it will return your
results and we can check if this you
know if this is something that we can
damage and then we have an some optional
parameters now I do want to fill in is F
collision query perhaps and I'll show
you why so if you make the F collision
collision query parameter perhaps this
is yet another struct that can hold a
bunch of data for us and we want to
first of all we want to ignore the owner
now let's just also just ignore the
weapon and then finally I would like to
be trace complex I would the set this to
true and now what this does it will
trace against each individual triangle
off the mesh debris hitting now this is
more expensive but it also gives us the
exact result of where we hit something
if this is a to false it will only do a
simple collection now this could be a
simple like bounding box collision or
whatever kind of simplified collision is
set up for the mesh that we hit we want
to spawn like effects on the point that
we hit and in case of a character we
don't want to for example trace against
the capsule because that will just you
know it will both look weird and you can
oh like to easily hit an enemy and I'm
also at that point we don't know if we
made the hatch shut or not so we want to
know exactly what we hit okay so we set
this to true and now we need to make
sure that we passes in actually so there
we go okay so we've set up a basic line
trace now one thing I would like to do
because this it returns a boolean and
that the boolean is true if it was a
blocking hit so if we had something and
only if we had a blocking hit
then we wanted to do an actual or then
we want the you know process our data if
it was not a blocking it then we have
nothing to process here blocking it
process damage okay I would like to draw
a line from where to where this line
trace occurred and that for that we need
to do first we need to include draw
debug helpers and that gives us a few
more functions so draw debug line
now again response in the world and we
use the same start and end locations and
for the Color Oops
have a color let's just use white for
now they won't be persistent the
lifetime we just make them one second
and I would like to make them a little
bit thick so they're easier to see
especially in the video there's one
thing actually left to do and that is
because we we haven't bound this event
anywhere not in C++ and it's not
available yet in blueprints so let's
quickly add a u function and make this
blueprint callable so we can quickly try
out this code and our blueprints so
let's call this weapon okay let's do a
quick we compile and once it's done
let's head into the editor and we will
edit the player pawn now one thing we
should just quickly do as a temporary
test code is will save this variable
well do all of this soon in C++ but for
now because blueprint is so quick to
iterate with we will use some blueprint
intermediately
let's call this current weapon and we
will connect that so you're sure that
this gets set and then let's just delete
these doom and then what I would like to
do is quickly use left mouse button now
normally you would go through project
settings input everything but as a quick
quick test we'll just use left mouse
button directly and I'll control drag
this onto the canvas and we will say
fire now we we were able to see fire
because if this is already part actually
it's even already of type BP rifle is if
this is type of of type actor which can
sometimes which could have happened if
this was of type actor then you would
first have to cast to BB rifle okay so
let's quickly hook this up let's compile
and let's play see what happens okay so
I forgot to do one thing if you go back
into usual studio and in the as weapon
cpp we rely on this owner to be set now
this is going to be still null because
we haven't set this up now let's go back
into the editor and go back into our
player pawn and one thing we can do is
open up the advanced properties and here
we see owner now usually this is
reserved for things like networking
which we'll definitely be doing later on
in this course so set up the owner and
now if we were to play we can see that
we have this line trace now we not we're
not line tracing from the camera in the
third person but instead we're line
tracing from what appears to be the I
position of the character now we kind of
want this to be a little different we
want we
her to maybe play the effects later on
from the muzzle flash but perhaps you
want to do the line trace from the
camera so we have to do a few
modifications I believe that for the
next lecture now we're ready to start
improving this fire function that we
created previously
I should might remember we are using the
actor eyes viewpoint and by default that
is using what appear to be the first
person location of the pond so if you
would just quickly hop over to the
editor and play you can see that the
line trace starts at approximately the
head position this is not really what
we're what we want so we can check
quickly we can quickly check the
implementation by unreal like algae and
this will bring us to the actor
implementation now actually wants to get
the pawn implementation because I know
that pawn has overwritten this so let's
shift alt s that will find symbols
that's exactly what we're looking for
so we'll search for get actor eyes
viewpoints now I can see there's a few
different development implementations
actor is the first one and we're
interested in the pond 1 version so now
we're in a header and we're all G in to
it so we go to the CPP file of pawn this
is all engine code but it's not as
difficult as it might seem and I can see
that whatever it's passing is the get
pawn view location that's the one we're
interested in
so again I'll G on this one good let's
see BP and here we can see what's going
on so it gets the actor location and
then adds a base eye height now if we
were to hop back over into the editor
and we open up the player pond we can
see that if we go to the viewport first
actually we can see that
on the route what the center is where
the arrow is right here it's right here
so that is our our actor location if we
were to query this and then the base eye
height is yet another value which we can
find here if we search for eye and that
is 64 so that comes up to about here now
we are more interested in using the
camera position as they as the eye
location so let's dive back into code
and now we know that this is the
function that we're interested in now if
you all G again you can see that this is
virtual and that means we can override
it and that's that's really cool so
we'll just copy this this function and
we'll go back into our own character
header file and just gotta make sure
that this is either a public or a
predicted so let's quickly check it is a
public okay that is important because we
need to make sure that that stays the
same so paste it right here and now the
only thing we need to do is specify the
override keyword now we can effectively
redefine what this function does so
let's create an implementation okay now
we don't need any of the base
implementation so we're not gonna be
calling this super I'm just going to
return and we're going to be returning
our camera components now let's first
just make sure that the camera component
is not now and then we return camera
components and we return get actor oh
actually it's a component so we get
component location there we go
so now if the camera component is valid
then we return the location of this
component instead of the actor location
plus height and if this for some reason
fails we need to have a fallback so
that's in that case call the super get
pond view location and that will then
fall back and to the original let's go
back the original implementation so that
would be good on view of location that
will then do this function okay so we
got that set up that's awesome let's
save this and do I think we're ready to
compile okay once it's ready let's head
back into the editor and we're pretty
much ready to just play again and see
the result now I can clearly see that
the line has is coming from a different
location it end is coming exactly from
our camera location when we press
left-click the fire so that's a little
nicer to make a really good third-person
shooter we'll need a lot more but this
is definitely a good start</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
