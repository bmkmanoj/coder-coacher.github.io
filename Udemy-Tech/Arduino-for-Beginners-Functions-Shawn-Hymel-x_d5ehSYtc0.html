write setup' and loop and these get
called automatically in the background
but there are times when you may want to
write your own functions in fact writing
your own functions can be extremely
useful for when you want to call a
section of code multiple times or you
want to divide up your code into more
manageable chunks but let's start by
writing our own function often it's
easier to think about how you might call
your function from your code before you
define it let's define an integer I and
set it to zero in loop will write I plus
plus to increment it now we have a
number that just counts up forever
at least until we reach the maximum
value for an INT we want to create a
function that determines if I is even or
odd and we'll use it to print even or
odd to the serial monitor so start by
initializing the serial connection in
setup we'll say that we want to store
the answer to the is it even question by
letting even b1 and odd be zero that
means we'll need another integer
variable we'll call it e we don't need
to initialize it to any value since the
first time we use the variable we'll set
it to something one or zero let's
pretend that we have already written our
function figuring out how we want to use
it will help us write the function later
so before we increment I let's call our
function which we'll name is even it's
important to note that functions can
have a return value this is some number
or character that is handed off from the
function when it finishes running it's
like a relay race where one runner hands
off a baton to the next runner this
means that we can store the functions
return value in a variable let's store
it in e so we have e equals is even open
parenthesis close parenthesis semicolon
once is even finishes running it will
return zero or one which is then stored
in e note that our function is even will
run only once when it is called on this
line so the code is in even will run
once then I will increment then is even
will run again I will increment and so
on because I is a global variable we
could just check I in our is even
function
but let's learn how parameters work a
parameter is a variable that we can use
to pass data to our function
they act as input and we call the actual
data we pass an argument or arguments if
there is more than one we need to tell
our function which number we want to
perform the even or odd check on we do
that by putting the data between the
parentheses of our function so now we
have e equals is even open parentheses I
close parentheses semicolon
let's finish writing the code that
prints even or odd will first print the
number so we can check it serial dot
print open parentheses I close
parentheses semicolon then to separate
it from the even or odd text write
serial dot print open parenthesis open
quotes colon space close quotation marks
close parentheses semicolon because we
know that e will be one for even and 0
for odd we can write if e equals equals
1 open curly brace serial dot println
even close curly brace else open curly
brace serial dot println the string odd
and Arduino should have added the last
curly brace for you after I plus plus
let's add a delay 500 so that we have a
chance to see the text flying by now we
should have an idea of how to write our
function we define functions outside of
other functions so we'll start writing
after the loop function we know that we
want to return an integer 0 or 1 so we
start by writing in
this is the return type note that
functions in C can only return one value
not more any of the data types we
discussed previously can be a return
type int float char and so on you can
also use void here like you see in setup
in loop to state that there is no return
value we need to return an integer so
we'll keep int then write the function
name is even in this case followed by an
open and close parentheses inside the
parentheses we need to declare our
parameter the data type of the parameter
needs to match the data type of the
argument being passed in since we're
using integers will declare the
parameter as an int we then need to give
the parameter a name we'll use a it
doesn't have to match anything we've
used before and in fact I highly
recommend not using the same name as a
global variable like I or e in this case
to avoid confusion if you need more than
one parameter you separate them by
commas for example we could have int a
comma char C comma float F comma and so
on note that if you asked for three
parameters three arguments must be given
every time you call a function so in our
is even call we'd have to provide a
character and float in addition to the
integer all separated by commas since we
don't need those just delete them leave
our input integer though now type an
open curly brace after our function
definition name and hit enter what we
write in between the curly braces
another code block will be executed
every time is even is called to
determine if our number is even we'll
use an if statement note that we're
using a now as that's what we called our
parameter the value of a will be what
was passed into our function if we look
at our call to is even we see that value
comes from whatever is an eye each time
is even is called to determine if our
number is even we need to know if it is
divisible by two
we can't quite use the divide operator
for that but we can use modulo right if
open parentheses a modulo two equals
equals zero close parenthesis open curly
brace return one semicolon if the
remainder of our number after being
divided by two is zero that means it is
divisible by two and therefore even so
we return one even though this program
might run we are still missing an
important step if you say that a
function returns a value you should
always make sure something gets returned
if a is odd in our function the return
statement is never called we need to add
a return case for when a is odd so right
else open curly brace return zero
semicolon now our function returns 1 if
the argument is even and zero if it's
odd upload and open the serial monitor
you should see each number printed
followed by whether that number is even
or odd keep in mind that functions don't
have to have return values or parameters
without a return value you should set
the return type to void let's write a
function called say hi' beneath our is
even function write void say hi' open
parentheses close parentheses open curly
brace serial dot println hi an arduino
should have closed the code block for us
with a curly brace notice that we didn't
have to call return because we specify
no return value type up and set up after
serial dot begin call our function say
hi' run it and you should see hi appear
before our list of numbers if it helps
you remember how to write a function
here is a template you should always
specify the return type for the function
even if it is void then name your
function followed by parentheses note
that function names follow similar rules
as naming variables you can only use
letters numbers and underscores no
spaces you define the parameters inside
the parentheses after the function name
between the curly braces is where you
write the body of the function what code
runs whenever the function is called
finally if you defined a return type
that's not void you should return a
value as your programs get longer
writing functions can help you keep
everything neat and orderly you also
should not be afraid to write a function
if you find yourself writing the same
few lines of code over and over again
thanks for watching if you'd like to
