VAR keyword to declare a variable and
you can declare an assign initialize a
variable all at once outside of the
function so let's say I wanted to do
that and outside of a function I wanted
to declare the variable a and store the
value assign the value Tod to it I could
do VAR a is equal to Tod and that's it
so I've declared a variable a and I've
set it equal to Tod right so I've
assigned the value Tod to this variable
a and it'll figure out what type it is
and that all totally works I can also do
VAR a string Todd and I can be really
explicit that this is storing a string I
cannot do this right VAR a string and
then a is equal to Tod that's outside of
a function body right so cindex are non
declaration statement outside function
body I can bring that and put it inside
of a function body and that's going to
work fine so I format there and I run it
and that that all works fine so there's
a lot of different ways there that you
could kind of do the variable thing and
the thing that you should know the thing
that you should take away is as much as
possible use the short declaration
operator and keep all of your variables
stored inside functions as much as
possible when you need a variable stored
outside of a function use VAR a and then
just set it to whatever the variable is
and don't worry about putting the type
in let that type automatically be
figured out by the computer less is more
it's more readable it's less for you to
type right just var a is equal to Todd
and and then if for some reason you want
to just be really explicit in your
program and let other programmers know
hey this is storing a value of type
string wonderful you can do VAR a string
but mostly just do VAR a and keep it
equal to that so there is one
interesting thing here about a zero
value so you should know three things
about variables as much as possible you
know use the short declaration operator
as much as possible use the short
declaration operator if you're going to
use declare a variable outside and
assign a value to it outside of a
function just use var
the variable name and set it equal to
the value that's the second thing you
should know and if you never need to
access a zero value use var so VAR c
string right or let me let me actually
do bar c int and and so when i set when
i declare a variable is of a certain
type but i don't store a value there
it receives something called the zero
value and you can go to the golang spec
and you could also go to effective going
and you can look through these two
documents and you can look through here
and you could see zero value right so
you could search there's 11 mentions of
zero value they're an effective go and
inside the language spec command-f this
0 value right here is an entire little
paragraph which talks about the zero
value each element such as a variable of
value set to the zero value for its type
false for bool 0 for an injured 0 0 for
floats
empty for strings and nil for all this
other stuff which you'll learn about in
the entire course alright so all of that
stuff sets it to the 0 value and when i
run this you can see that that VAR c n
to the 0 value of an INT is 0 so if you
ever need to declare something to be
it's 0 value that's also when you use
var so as a rule of thumb popular
practice use the short declaration
operator as much as possible if you need
a variable with a value declared in the
sign outside of the function use var and
then the name the identifier of the
variable and set it equal to the value
and if you ever need something to be
initialized declared and have a 0 value
assigned to it if you ever need
something initialize to a 0 value just
use var C and then the type of value
that that variable is going to store and
notice the language I use to just talk
about that the type which is nth a value
like a value would be like 42 right 42
is an n so the type let me write this
out so you see it the type of value that
is stored in the variable all right and
I also use the word identifier
okay so the C is an identifier meaning
that's how we identify that variable so
var is used when you want the zero value
store just Farsi and then the type of
value stored there this is going C is
going to be set initialize to zero value
of an int which is zero if this was
string and be empty string but you don't
see that when it prints out here you
just see nothing it's just empty string
so that's those are the three ways you
use variables try to use the short
declaration operator right and use it
inside functions do this if you need a
variable outside of a function and leave
the type out just easier less is more
and and then use var and then the
identifier and then the type of value
that is stored in that variable whenever
you just need a 0 value and 0 values the
other important thing here right so use
var for 0 value so those are like the
three rules of thumb for working with
variables and go the short declaration
operator the VAR keyword and then also
understanding a little bit about 0
values</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
