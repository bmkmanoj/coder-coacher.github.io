video on the ultimate AWS Solutions
Architect associate certification course
and in this video what I want to talk
about is five reasons you should get an
AWS certification why is it important
for you to consider getting a
certification why should you take this
course to prepare you for the
certification let's talk about that well
first it's a big market AWS is an 18
billion dollar a year services business
they are a cloud computing business
that's a big business
that means there's lots of people who
work with it there's lots of companies
that are using it that means it's a big
market a broad market that means there's
lots of demand for people who have
knowledge about AWS second there's a lot
of future demand coming forward AWS is
growing at about 40 percent per year in
fact it's the fastest growing enterprise
computing company in the history of the
IT industry and so as that continues to
grow as more companies begin to adopt
cloud computing and aw specifically and
as they use it more comprehensively in
their organization there's gonna be a
lot of demand for people who know what
they're doing with AWS a certification
in AWS the Solutions Architect associate
certification demonstrates competence it
shows you know what you're doing
AWS created the certification and they
did it so that they could have something
that people could bring forward and say
I really understand this I really know
what AWS is to find it and so if you
have that certification
it shows competence in a DBS and it
shows confidence in the things that AWS
says are important
a certification differentiates you from
other candidates if there's two
candidates and one has certification one
doesn't the natural inclinations go with
the one who has certification who's
demonstrated competence who's been
examined and has shown that he or she
has the knowledge and so really getting
a certification gives you a leg up in
the competition for jobs and remember
it's gonna be a lot of jobs but you
still always want to be able to
differentiate yourself from candidates
and be offered the position and then
finally and I'm sure most people have a
pretty interested in this the salary the
ATB resolutions architect associate
certification is the highest paid
certification in the entire IT industry
it's the one that's in the most demand
it's the one that's most popular so one
that companies are searching for the
most and that has the outcome of the
highest salary and so if you take this
course and learn all the information in
it all the material and then take its
certification exam which you'll be
prepared for you're gonna set yourself
up for a great job and really a great
future so I encourage you to take the
course and I encourage you to watch the
next video
