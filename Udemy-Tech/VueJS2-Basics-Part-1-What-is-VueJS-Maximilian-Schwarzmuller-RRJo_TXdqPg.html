have you here this video is about UJS
and I'm going to say it right away I
absolutely love view chairs it's a great
JavaScript framework in this video we're
going to dive into what it actually is
before we then start creating our first
app right away so let's start so what is
view chairs its creators describe it as
a library for creating reactive
components in modern web interfaces
certainly a nice phrase but what does it
mean it actually means that beauteous is
a framework you would use to make your
app more reactive to control parts of
your Dom by our view chests to
dynamically output data there to listen
and react to user events to bring that
mobile app feeling queue a desktop app
so making your app reactive is a very
first important takeaway you could all
think of view GS as kind of a
replacement for Jake we though you have
to treat this argument carefully it's
much much more than that it's actually
more comparable to frameworks like
angular 2 and react KS but if you want
to use it as a simple replacement for
jQuery you could do that it gives you
access to the Dom it makes outputting
data very very easy it fixes many of the
flaws jQuery has but again that really
is kind of an understatement it's much
more than that it's really great at
controlling the DOM and with that I mean
not just giving you access to some
element now keeping it in sync on its
own which means you have some data in
your JavaScript code you change it there
you output it somewhere to DOM and it
gets refreshed automatically you click a
button and you listen to that event it
gets executed automatically it makes
this reactive interactive approach
really easy well and finally you can
build single page applications with it
you aren't limited to creating simple
widgets or controlling parts of your web
page you can control the whole
application with view chairs it goes all
the way up to big enterprise level
single page applications so that is view
chairs comparable to react and
or two but really in my opinion like the
perfect combination taking only the best
pieces of both frameworks and therefore
really awesome now that we know what it
is let's dive into it and create our
first application in order to get
started with Lucia's visiting the
official page is probably a good idea so
I am on UTSA dot org and here we can
click on get started sounds like a good
idea if we want to get started well
we're actually landing on the
introduction page but let's switch to
the installation page now there are
different options on how you may install
view chairs it depends on whether you
want to set up a more complex workflow
using let's say wet peg or if you want
to simply import a script and get
started with it right away now for our
first steps I'll choose the easiest and
quickest way of simply importing a
script and I will choose a CDN year so
that I don't have to download and store
it locally and you may choose whichever
link you want I want you to choose the
first one from unpackaged here and with
that link I will now head over to J as
Phil jsfiddle if you didn't know is kind
of like a online editor where you can
write simple HTML Javascript and CSS
code and see it run there instantly
really nice to try out some things you
can also share it obviously not what you
would choose for a real project but I
will also have videos on how to set up a
more realistic workflow but for learning
and getting started with view Cheers
this is perfect so in there let's first
go to the HTML section make it a bit
bigger and add a script tag here you can
simply type script and then hit tab to
automatically expand it here we simply
import the script we just grabbed from
the getting started installation page
and you may remove this version number
two always fetch the latest version now
with that we're having access to view
chess none or let's use it let me create
a div here with hashtag I app to give it
an idea of app after hitting tab and
there there a one have a paragraph now
in that paragraph I want to output hello
world but typing it like this is really
not the view chair style
well that isn't JavaScript at all right
so let's
output this dynamically so my HTML code
is a simple div with a paragraph which
is empty now let's switch to JavaScript
and let's imagine there would have kind
of a result of some operation which you
want to output in our HTML code in the
end so in your running application to
use beauty is we have to create a view
instance first so we have to instantiate
our view object we can do this with the
normal new keyword and then we have this
view object which is provided to us
because we have this script import
appear now I'm not storing this view
instance in any variable because I'm not
interacting with the instance itself but
it still gets created because I have two
new keyword now right now this view
instance isn't doing anything it exists
but it isn't doing much we have to pass
an object in order to configure it and
to use it and in this object we have a
lot of different properties and methods
we can use to find unity we use this
view instance which is the core of our
view J's
application in the way we need to use it
now let's start simple
with one property you will often use the
L property this stands for element and
it tells of UJS which element in your
Dom so in the HTML code up there which
element do you want to control through
few chairs behind the scenes that
element will become the template of this
view instance and it will be this
template which is then rendered to the
DOM and 2d what the user sees in the end
by view jeaious so what do we want to
control well d div with the ID of app
sounds like a good target so this
element here takes a string which works
like a CSS selector and since I want to
select this div with the ID app I just
use hash tag app to do so now we get
control of this death and with that
control we now want to have some data we
can output there for dead we get this
data property like L this is kind of a
reserved we
the reserved property beauteous will
recognize and data actually is an object
so where L was a string dis is an object
and in this object we store all the data
we want to work with in this view
instance and this view instance again is
really just a contained piece of code
controlling a part or whole everything
of our Dome Dom whatever we want so
you're controlling this Dave with the
idea app now in here let's say we want
to have a property in this data object
and this name is totally up to you so
I'll choose title and I will say hello
world here now with that title set up we
now want to output it here in our dorm
and our HTML code which again behind the
scenes became the template of this view
instance well this view instance has the
title data so how can we output it view
jeaious gives us a certain text you may
know from other languages we use double
curly braces opening and closing and in
between we can interpolate we can output
some data so here we can simply refer to
title referring to our title stored in
the data object again data is a reserved
word in our view instance so vue.js
knows how to access the title and if we
now in JS file hit ctrl enter to load
this we see hello world on the right
because now we're dynamically outputting
our title data through string
interpolation with D double curly braces
here in our app or in our dev here with
the ID app which is controlled through
few J s and this is generally how view
cheese works you take control over a
part of the Dom then you may have some
data you also may have our things and
we'll come back to those and you can
work with the data you can also listen
to events I will soon show you in one of
the next videos and then create a
reactive or possibly reactive app with
that because the cool thing is and you
will see this in the next with you when
we also come to events whenever title
here changes it will automatically
update the Dom but again I come to this
in the next video
these were the first steps and that's
our first
vue.js application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
