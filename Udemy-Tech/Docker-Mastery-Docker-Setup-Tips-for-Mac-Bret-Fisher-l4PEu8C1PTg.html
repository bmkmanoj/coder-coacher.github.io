docker well this lecture is going to get
you all the tools you need to use this
course with docker and to get the best
Ducker setup on your Mac so the nice
thing is is I'm gonna be using all the
demos or at least most of the demos on
my Mac so it'll feel very native for you
the required version of Mac isn't
actually even recent so you probably
will be on the minimum version it's
actually a three year old OS at this
point on Yosemite and really Yosemite
works on every Mac hardware for like the
last ten years so as long as your laptop
is less than ten years old and you're
using a version of Mac that was released
in the last three years the docker for
Mac product that you can get from store
docker com will work and it's the best
way to use docker on your Mac it has all
the features and all the new bonus sort
of ease of use things going on in terms
of like networking and storage and stuff
and we'll get into that but that's the
really the best way to go if for some
reason you can't do that maybe your
office that you use your Mac from it
requires a Mavericks or one of the older
versions like lion or something that's
okay there's still an option known as
docker toolbox which is sort of the
legacy it was actually the only version
of docker we could use on a Mac up until
mid 2016 when they created docker for
Mac so dunker toolbox is still supported
still got the latest versions of docker
in it it's just not gonna have all of
the nice little extra features and
performance benefits of docker for Mac
other options for using docker on your
Mac include just installing it in a
Linux VM I mean however you want to
create a VM do that whether it's locally
with VirtualBox or VMware fusion or
parallels or installing it on a Linux VM
on the internet on the cloud you know
right on AWS or Asscher or digitalocean
so wherever you can get a Linux VM
installed you just can install docker on
that and you can
do 98% of this course that way other
options include actually installing
docker in a Windows VM on your Mac that
might sound kind of weird it's like too
many layers of stuff going on right and
actually that requires something called
nested virtualization so I don't really
recommend it I won't support it in this
course really I won't talk about it it
is possible to make it work in case you
for some reason
just want to run docker on a Windows
machine on your Mac I personally just do
that for testing and demo purposes but
if you want to do that it works with
VMware fusion it does require a little
special setting for nested
virtualization which means
virtualization inside a virtualization
so you've got to get that working but
I'm told by the docker team that it does
work and the last little option here or
tidbit I guess is that don't use
homebrew to install docker if you've
actually already done that you need to
uninstall that docker because what that
is is the command line only it's not
going to actually have the docker server
or any of the other features that docker
comes with it's only gonna have the
docker command line tool and that's
useful if you want to use docker to talk
to a server remotely but we're not going
to do a whole lot of that in this course
we're gonna focus on using docker on
your machine so the setup process is
going to basically go like this in this
lecture we're gonna actually install
docker and then check out some of the
settings or preferences for docker for
Mac and tweak those a little bit and
then we're going to download my github
repo that you're going to need in this
course with all of the code samples and
stuff then we're gonna talk about code
editors and I prefer a specific one
Visual Studio code just because it works
really well with docker but just about
anyone will work whatever favorite one
you use will work fine and then we're
going to show some optional things where
maybe you want to tweak your terminal or
your shell setup in your Mac so that it
works easier from the command line if
you're going to be doing docker stuff
all day long
okay so let's get started with the
install so go to store docker calm as
you can see I'm already there and
everything in this chorus is focused on
the free version or the docker Community
Edition docker seee so when this
interface changes because all interfaces
changes on the web right you're gonna
have to find the docker seee download
area and you'll see that there's an
Edition for all sorts of different os's
and we're gonna look for the Mac one
which happens to be at the top and over
here on the right I have this get
download now you can just click this but
you'll notice that also if you're if
you're an older version of Mac it'll
tell you hey the backup option is docker
toolbox but if we scroll down a little
bit we get two options and I'm going to
use the edge version the edge is kind of
like a beta and I'm of course a tester
so I like testing the software and I'd
prefer to see the new features first but
I find edge actually to be quite stable
and with this product only being like a
year old I actually find that it gets
the things I need the new features or
bug fixes faster as well so I don't know
your experience may vary and so
generally I tell people if you're in an
enterprise environment and you're
looking to have your whole team on
exactly the same version that you have
in production and to sort of match all
that up then I'd say good stick with
stable for everyone else I say give edge
a shot and if at any time you want to
change these two it's actually super
easy in the interface to change built-in
from stable back to edge and back and
forth so I'm gonna do the edge and we're
gonna run that dmg file and it should
open up a screen that allows you to drag
the docker app into your Applications
folder like a typical Mac would and
it'll copy that over and allow you to
run it so you can close this window we
can actually close the web browser and
go launch docker now the first time you
run it it'll give you this warning just
simply because you're downloading it
over the Internet and not from the Apple
Store so go ahead and click open but you
won't get that after that
now we're going to walk through the
setup process it's really easy we're
just going to click Next and it's going
to ask us for root privileges and then
we're going to get a nice set up menu
and one of the options is you can sign
in and create a docker ID it actually
gives you some neat cloud services that
we'll talk later in this course but you
don't have to do that right now it's not
a requirement we're just gonna wait for
it to start and you'll see at the top it
says docker is now running and you'll
notice that it gives me a menu bar icon
so I can get lots of options from here
including everything from checking for
updates to restarting docker to exiting
docker and by default this thing will
start every time your computer starts
when you log in and away we go so before
we go any further I want to talk about a
few preferences that you might want to
change one of them is I mentioned the
option of switching between the edge and
the stable versions in case maybe you
ever have an issue with edge you can
actually do that here and it will sort
of remove your docker VM and then create
a new one but so you want you don't want
to do this every day but in case you
have a bug and you think maybe there's
something to do with the edge version
you can always switch back to stable the
second thing is whenever you're working
with code that's on your host machine
and you want to work with it in a docker
container this is known as bind mounting
we'll talk a lot about that later but
for now just remember that when we get
to that section you need to make sure
that your code whatever you're gonna use
is in one of these volumes or one of
these directories on your Mac I should
say and so really for me I just make
sure that my code is inside my user
directories and for me that's slash user
slash Bret and for you it's your
probably your user name after the users
and so you notice that that's already in
here but if you're someone who makes a
custom root directory on your Mac you're
going to need to add that in here with
the plus symbol docker is actually on a
Mac running a tiny VM in the background
it's running a tiny Linux VM and that's
because docker doesn't run natively on
the Mac kernel Apple hasn't actually
built in docker functionality into its
OS kernel so we have to run this
a little vm and if you've ever run any
virtualization you know that it you can
give it however many CPUs and however
much RAM and I normally leave mine at
the two CPUs of the four on my laptop
and then I usually ramp my ram up to
like let's say four you don't have to do
that it all depends on how much memory
is in your system
I happen to have 16 gig of ram on my Mac
so I have plenty of room to give it more
access in Mac or in the docker
preferences do note though that docker
won't actually take up all of that RAM
unless it needs it so it's nice and
conservative that's the same thing with
the space too on the hard drive
it won't take up a huge amount of space
it'll only grow as it needs to and so
just because you're giving it 4 gig of
ram doesn't mean that it's not able to
share that ram with other applications
on your Mac it just means that docker
can use up to 4 gig of memory in my
computer and over here I have to click
apply and restart now that I've made
that change and there's lots of other
options you can look at here and read
about and actually see the help on
inside the menu but for now let's just
get into the command line so I'm going
to bring up the terminal it's actually
called terminal it's the Mac application
and if you're familiar with this you may
have all your own setup if you're not
familiar with terminal it is like
PowerShell or command prompt in Windows
and like a standard Linux shell and
Linux and it actually by default runs
bash which is just a standard shell very
common you can see that it's here at the
top and I can actually run docker
version here to know that my docker is
running and which version of docker I've
got running here so you can see the
client and the server are both listed
and we'll talk in the next lecture after
this section about what all that stuff
means but this basically getting this
back does mean that your docker is
working and you can talk to it so now
that we know that docker is installed
and working correctly let's clone my
repository for this course and if you're
used to get and github then this is a
pretty easy part that you probably have
done lots of times in your career
probably just this week and it's no big
deal but if you're new to get or
specifically to github then let me just
drop you through a couple of quick steps
on the easiest way to get my repository
downloaded so in a previous lecture in
this section I gave you some information
about where to find my repository and
the link to it it's a github comm slash
Brett Fisher or slash udemy - mastery
that's a lot to type so check out the
previous lecture on cloning the class
repository and that will get you to this
directory and right in here is basically
you can actually view it on the web but
we need the whole thing on our local
computer so you would normally on github
come over here to the clone and download
area and I don't recommend you download
the zip the reason is is that this
course is fluid right docker is always
changing they're always updating and so
this course will be as well and you'll
actually notice even on this page you'll
notice it like something changed less
than a month ago something changed two
months ago so things are fluid and if
you download a zip it's not easy to
update it once you're in the course but
if you open it in the desktop it'll
actually open it in the github GUI and
let you keep it in sync
doing a git pull on occasion and github
now has a new desktop and once you've
downloaded install that you can actually
jump back over to my repository and use
several different options you can click
the open and desktop which will open it
in the GUI for github or you can copy
the link and manually paste it into this
GUI and then you can put it on your
local machine the one important part
here is that you want to make sure that
you're putting it inside your user
directory so slash users slash Brett is
my user directory on my Mac and I just
have a default standard of I put
everything inside a code directory the
settings for docker as we mentioned
previously want to make sure that you
have all the location on your hard drive
where you might put code that's going to
be used inside a container I won't cover
that all again but if you make sure to
this on your side your user directory
you're good to go once you've downloaded
it I would probably do a git pull once a
month or so while you're still working
on the course to make sure that you have
all the latest fixes and updates as this
course evolved and while we're on the
topic of this terminal this terminal
works great you can use it your whole
career there are lots of people that's
been all day long in this particular
terminal application but in this course
you'll see me use one with a few more
features known as I term 2 and you can
find that at I term 2.com it's actually
open source and free and I actually
donate money to them because I use it so
often and there's one gentleman that
actually develops it and I really like
it so from here you're going to click
the download and install it just like
you would every other Mac application
and you can see that I have it here
running on the right and then I have the
terminal actually running on the left
and I can do docker version on this
right side and really honestly the only
thing that I have different on my I term
two versus the standard terminal is I've
customized it I've changed the colors
I've changed the shell and the options
in there you can actually find more out
about that at Brett Fisher comm / shell
that'll come at the end of this lecture
I'll mention that again so you know
where to go find it but there's lots of
little things and tweaks and stuff I do
that you can go get and as a reminder
none of that is required for this course
you can use the default terminal and the
default CLI just like this through the
entire course and it will work just fine
and the next little tip I want to give
you is to check out Visual Studio code
so if you don't have a preferred editor
you can check out Visual Studio code
it's actually a free version of a code
editor from Microsoft that's very
similar to Adam from github if you've
ever used that but it actually comes out
of the box with a lot more functionality
and one of the nice things is it has a
docker feature that you can actually
download as an extension so you'll see
that I've downloaded and installed it
already and under this button on the
left
there's an extensions option and you can
see that I have some basics like a spell
checker that docker one which is
actually really handy in this course it
helps you with docker files and compose
files that you will learn about and
gives you syntax highlighting and you'll
see that commonly throughout this course
and I actually have a few other ones in
there for different languages and tools
but really just the docker one is the
one that I recommend for this course and
so the last little thing we're going to
go through is actually the command tab
completion so I'm going to bring up a
new tab and I'll give you the link in
the end of this lecture and also in the
resources for this lecture but docker
has some great documentation on how to
get the bash completion working and what
that really looks like is when I'm in a
shell and let me make this a little
bigger for you and I start typing a
docker command docker container I get if
I hit tab I get the options of what I
can type and it helps me complete docker
commands so I can do something like this
and hit tab again and I get a bunch of
the options so you can do this on your
system too and well we can do that real
quick simply by copying this after we do
a few things and all the instructions
are here so the first thing is it says
to use homebrew well what is homebrew if
you're not familiar with homebrew it's
actually a another tool that this by the
way again all optional you can download
it from the homebrew website which is
brewed SH and what it is is a
command-line tool that helps you install
open source command line utilities with
a one-liner it's very similar to apt-get
on Linux PowerShell also has one on
Windows but basically once you have it
installed you can just type brew install
something and it and it will go get that
so in this case what they're saying is
that you need to make sure you have the
bash completion so let's go through that
real quick
so first install homebrew using this
command line right here which I already
have on my machine but it will install
the homebrew replication and then from
that terminal window I mean large it for
you you can actually type brew install
bash completion and when I do that it's
actually going to download the bash
completion and automatically set it up
on my machine I already have that
installed so when I hit enter it's
actually going to just tell me that it's
already there but for you it will
actually install the bash completion and
set it up so that you're good to go yeah
it says it's already installed I'm going
to clear my screen here and then the
next step is to actually link these
three resources into your terminal so
I'm just going to copy and paste that
and those three lines will make
permanent links so that way when I type
now docker container run - - and hit tab
you see that it gives me all the options
again and I can also start from the very
beginning and just type docker and hit
tab twice to get all the options here or
I can type part of one and hit tab and
it automatically complete it for me so
basically I'm hitting tab all the time
right and that's known as tab completion
it works out of the box and a lot of
Linux distributions but that's how you
get it set up on docker I brought that
into this lecture because a lot of
people originally we're asking me how to
get that working and doctor's
documentation is pretty good on getting
that started okay to sum up this lecture
let's cover a few of the tips that I
just talked about and also give you a
couple of extra ones before we get
started so the command completion for
your shell is totally optional but it
will help you this link will actually be
in the top left of your screen under the
resources and you can jump over to the
docker documentation for that we talked
about where to store your code for the
samples and the work you're going to be
doing in docker I recommend just
sticking it inside slash users slash
your user name on your Mac that's the
easiest place to do it
but if you
it's somewhere else you have to change
the settings and when you do that we're
going to get into the bind mount thing
later but just realize that you probably
shouldn't use the bind mounts for
databases really just use it for
software code that's really what it's
meant for and works the best with next
one is we didn't talk about this at all
we will later in the course
docker machine allows you to create
virtual machines on the fly with docker
built into them and you can use that to
create machines and manage them very
easily either locally on your Mac with
something like VirtualBox or even on the
internet with Azure or digitalocean
so do check that out if you're
interested in that it's not required for
this course but it is yet another way
that you can use docker and manage it
pretty quickly we talked about the code
editor for this course I'm going to be
using Visual Studio code a lot I will
also sometimes use vim but you can use
whatever you want there's no requirement
for anything specific it's really just
text files we're going to be editing and
then we talked about item two as a
potential replacement for terminal I
know lots of people that are
professionals that use terminal all day
long they're fine with it I just happen
to like some of the features in item two
and so hopefully you will too it's open
source and it's great stuff and if you
have any problems with your installation
definitely check out the docs at Dockers
website that link is fantastic there's
so much information there I personally
recommend you just read it eventually
because you'll learn more things about
your docker install on your Mac and how
the Mac works with it and lastly my
specific shell setup that I'm going to
be using in this course happens to be
the I term 2 plus not using the bash
shell it's something called oh my Z SH
and then I have a lot of other things I
change the colors I have a little whale
emoji in there I do lots of stuff right
but that's not gonna distract you from
the course like don't think that you
have to have all those things set up but
I do get a lot of questions from people
on how my cool little shell is set up
and I do spend an obsessive amount of
time trying to figure that thing out and
make it perfect
so do check out if you're interested in
any of those add-ons Brett Fischer comm
/l I do list everything that I currently
use in my shell set up in there and
someday I might make a full video on how
to set each one of those up but for now
it's really just a list of links and
information about them ok I hope you got
docker from Mac set up that just the way
you want it and it's working great if
you have to use docker toolbox for the
legacy option on Mac do check out the
lecture on docker toolbox for Windows I
know it's not Mac obviously but the
toolbox works the same way on Windows
and on Mac so that lecture will actually
teach you how to use the toolbox if you
have to but if you don't have to highly
recommend the docker for Mac get it all
set up at the terminal working and then
jump to the next section to get started
right now with docker
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
