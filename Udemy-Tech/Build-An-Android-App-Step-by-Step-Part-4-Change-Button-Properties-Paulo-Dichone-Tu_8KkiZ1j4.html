creator of one of the most popular
Android n Java developer courses on
udemy so in this video I'm going to give
you a free preview of a lesson from my
android angel developer course on udemy
calm in this lesson I'll show you how to
set up Android studio and build your
very first Android application alright
so let's get to it so we've already
talked about how we have XML which
represents the user interface so what
these are see you know app okay and we
talked about the Java code that we can
then manipulate our user interface and
get and respond to whatever users do in
here
so when they click a button or they do
something we want to respond to that so
all of that logic is of course captured
here in our Java class but now you may
ask well how do we then connect our Java
code with our user interface widgets so
buttons text views edit text and so
forth well there's this one file called
the are that Java file which is a file
that we probably will never talk about
it ever again okay but it's important
for you to to know about it to
understand what it does the art that
Java file or resource file as they call
is it's just it's a file it's a Java
file that connects the resources so
anything in this folder here ok draw
bowls layouts with map values all of
these resources here anything that
connected via the Arda Java file in fact
if you look at our main that activity
you notice here there's this method is
being called set content view what this
does it does exactly as it says it sets
the content view it sets our view
okay and you notice inside of it we have
the first thing we have you have this R
so that's that class we've I just
mentioned our so resources class dot so
we're accessing the layout folder which
is the this one here and this activity
underscore main and you see here it says
activity underscore main that XML you
noticed that we don't need to have
extension here Javad and road takes care
of all of that all have it's just the
actual name of the file so it's a pretty
important file it's a very important
file this one here they are that Java
now how do we find it well the first
thing you need to do if you go at the
top here we are at this level here it's
the Android project level if you were to
click on this icon here click that
you'll see now we have different views
or different levels of for us to view
our project as so we have the Android
which is where we are at now okay and we
have packages we have project and let's
go to project files once the open
project files your problems gonna be
like this so what I need to do is click
the app folder go to build and you will
see this generated source click on that
and you will see this our folder click
on that and of course the keep clicking
on a door test and go to Android you go
again to app and you will see this art
here if you double click on this you
will see this file here and this should
probably probably be closed like that
and it's just an empty ok so if you
click on this plus side here you will
see you can read this do not modify
because this comes with Android studio
it's created it's generated by Android
studio we don't need to do anything with
this the reason I'm showing you this is
because I want you to understand what
this how things are connected within
code and resources so our is what
connected resources with our Java code
all right again you will never will
never come here and you shouldn't it
says here
do not modify I so let's go back to our
Android project here view so now let me
show you something very cool here so if
we go to our layout here and right click
and you say new we say layout resource
let's call this new layout like that and
for with root element let's start having
constraint we wanted to constraint
layout so that things are aligned
correctly and everything else is fine
it's gonna be under a directory layout
which is where we want let's just put it
like that and all of a sudden so yes you
will probably want to have this because
I have set up a kit which we'll talk
later
I will just say yes and voila look what
we have now we have another layout here
besides our main activity ok which means
now we can actually add things to it
let's go ahead and add for instance this
button here ok and we have that let's go
ahead and put some constraints here at
the top let's put another one to the
bottom here we want it to be in the
center since we know a little bit more
now about properties click on button
let's change this button style to
something else perhaps oh we don't like
that how about that not great that's
cool
I like that and let's change the text to
high ok there we go
and of course we hear a design in the
design mode we can go to text mode and
you can see exactly I will have one
button under the parent layout here
which is wonderful
ok alright so now if we go back to our
main activity here ok if we do the
following look we had we said your set
content view so with what we want the
users to see is under layout and it's
activity that main what if we change
this to point to our new layout which is
that one there you say enter save this
let's go ahead and run again I said
all are on a Mac that should run our
emulator and look at that now is showing
our new layout so you notice the are
plays a big big big part here because
it's saying our go to resources so this
class are here in the background has
access to the resource so it goes our
dot access layout folder which is this
one here and then access the layout that
we need so we can go ahead and create as
many layouts as we want and we can
access via our are that layout now that
we didn't have that piece of information
that also means whatever else we put
inside of our layout here so let's go
back to our new layout if we were to put
a text view for instance let's put a
text view right about here and we know
about constraints now let's go ahead and
do just that and we want this to be at
the bottom a little bit up about 24 of
there it's perfect let's change the size
exercise to be bigger if you click on
that you can just go let's go to about
14 now so we have a text view and we
have a button here that means we can
also access these items here via our
code because we have to have a way to do
that okay since these are part of the
resources if you think about it we will
be able to use our are to access them as
well okay but notice something here the
these buttons these items are inside our
layout so if you look at our layout here
we just see the new layout XML which is
our layout so how do we then access what
is inside of our layout so the other
thing we need to remember here is that
all of these widgets all of these
components are also represented as
objects
that means a button is an object a text
view is not all of these or objects
which means we can actually represent
them in code as object and there already
exist
as object so we can tap into them now
these are going to be our variables that
are attached to our layout which means
if we go to our main here activity we
can reference those but first of all we
need to create them here at the top so
that way that way we can reference them
okay so now we know first of all we have
a button class so we'll be creating a
top instance variable that will
reference our button okay so we're gonna
call this high button okay that's why
and we've learned a little bit more now
let's always have this idea of always
put private there to make sure that the
access is private because this is an
instance variable and now that we have
this reference here of button is not
instantiated yet it is filled there now
we can say hi button is equal what we're
gonna do now we're gonna say button
we're casting okay
we're gonna say fine there's a method
called fine view by ID okay because each
view has an ID if we go back to this
layout and click on this hi for instance
and get rid of this let's go back you'll
see there's this ID here which is very
important since we're here let's call
this something that we'll remember say
hi button that way we have an ID that
will know what are we talking about okay
so now that we have this ID that means
we were able to get reference to this hi
button and then do whatever we want to
do with it okay so let's go back to our
main activity here so we have we say
find by ID this find view by ID can
return a lot of things that's reason why
we're saying well we want to be we are
talking about an actual button here not
any other view because remember
everything is a view so by putting a
button here we are saying we actually
want to find a view by ID but this view
is not
any kind of view it's a button type and
inside here that's when we say r dot ID
because again our our class resource can
get our widgets by ID dot and then we
can say hi button there we go
okay now our hi button has a reference
to this button here okay something
happened here let me put it there
perfect all right so now we have access
to our button which means now that we
have access our button we can do a lot
of things with this button if I say that
it since we have the reference to this
that means we also have reference to all
these properties who do you see now
what's going on here which is good
because now we can dynamically change
things let's say if we want on the right
time when we upload our application and
run our application let's say if we
wanted to change the title or the text
of our button now we can do there is a
function for that against the do high
button dot let's exit access we can go
set text and we can go ahead and put
hello button something like that and if
we were to run we should see
hello button great so are you seeing the
power that we have now ok so let's go
back here so what we had to do we know
that everything is represented as
objects so we have here we created just
an instance variable a field called high
button of type button and then we went
ahead and connected to the actual button
here our button the high button right
because we have an ID let's go back here
we have an ID that was changed to high
button ok that's very important because
we need to be able to access that ID
that way we know what are we working
with directly ok we did that and then we
just said well now that we have
that but that we're talking about here
we can change properties we can set text
color okay we can keep setting things
high that set text color for instance
okay we can go to and call color class
that blue if we want it okay we save
this and run again and look at that
hello button is blue now Wow
so now we see this what's happening here
so now we have the handle here which we
can do whatever one with this button
trying to figure out if we can add more
properties here and one of the things
that he can do is go to layout here and
look at this other properties and see if
you can figure out how to change them
okay perfect
