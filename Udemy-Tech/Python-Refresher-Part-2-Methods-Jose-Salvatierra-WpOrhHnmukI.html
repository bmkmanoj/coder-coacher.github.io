this video we're continuing with the
previous code and we're looking at
methods in the last video we saw the
print method and we understood that
print was something that you can do so
methods and always should always be
actions in this case the print method
just prints something out to the console
so that the user can see it in addition
we can also of course create our own
methods if our programs could only use
the print method that would be a pretty
boring program
in Python as well we can always type the
hash symbol and what that does is that
deactivates the certain line and that in
programming is called a comment so here
I'm just gonna separate two sections of
code by two hash symbols to make sure I
make it easy for us to understand that
this is a different sort of section when
I share this file with you
it'll also make it easier on you
so we've got the print method and the
print method we saw accepts a value in
this case we gave it a value 56 and here
we gave it the value
hello however we can also create our own
methods so let's do just that
let's create a method that replicates
what the print method does the first
thing we have to do is to tell Python
we're going to be defining a new method
and we do that with a DEF keyword and
notice how Adam already knows that def
is a Python keyword because it puts it
in purple
after the death keyword we use a space
and then we type in our method name
I'm going to call it my print method but
you can call it whatever you want the
same restrictions as with variable names
apply here so you can make it as long as
short as you want but it cannot start
with a number and it cannot contain any
special characters
after my print method we must also
include a pair of brackets and the
brackets here are so we can include
parameters let's talk about that in just
a moment then we are gonna put a colon
and then we're gonna press ENTER and
notice how Adam already starts the next
line slightly more spaced in this is
called indentation and it's really
important in Python whenever you see a
colon
the next line must be indented
and all the indented lines which we can
have many will be long inside this
method so for example my print method
may be something like print hello and
then we can also print world notice how
the two lines are indented afterwards we
can keep essentially the indented lines
and all the lines will run when we run
the method or we can stop indenting just
by deleting that space and any lines we
write after this will not belong inside
the method this is going to start making
sense as we look at Python more
okay so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
comment these out to disable them
essentially and then we're going to go
back to the terminal
and we're going to run our file again so
what do you think is going to come out
when we run this file
okay hopefully you give it some thought
you can always pause the video if you
need to give it a bit more thought and
that's really important in this course
and I will do this asking you questions
over and over just to make you think of
it so what's going to happen is
absolutely nothing nothing gets printed
out so why not we've clearly said print
hello clearly cent print world and yet
nothing is coming out
well here's why we've created a method
that prints hello and prints world but
the act of creating the method does not
run the method so we also have to run
the method after and we do that by doing
my print method and then open and close
bracket the opening and closing bracket
at the end tells us that we are running
the method so let's save this and run it
again and now I'm sure you expect the
right thing to come out and that is
hello world so what's the brackets for
why do we need them
well the brackets are there for a
specific reason which is for parameters
to give the method some values for
example we can call it my parameter and
then instead of printing hello world
we're going to print my parameter
so what do you think is going to happen
when we run this again
give it some thought and maybe even try
it out yourselves in your code editors
because what will happen is not nothing
extraordinary but maybe something
unexpected
we get a lot more than we signed up for
we've got a traceback
and then we've got a type error the
trace back in any programming language
is just a list of what went wrong really
and it tells you where things went from
so here it's telling us that in our file
variables underscore methods dot py in
line 17 my print method went wrong and
then it also tells us the type of error
in this case that's a type error quite
redundant and it says my print method
takes exactly one argument but zero were
given ok so let's analyze exactly what
this means we can see that we've ran my
print method in the same way that we ran
the print method earlier the print
method here had one argument my variable
and my print method has zero arguments
we've given it zero arguments
here is one of the arguments which for
your convenience and we'll rename to my
argument that seems to make more sense
parameters and arguments are the same
thing
and me coming from a Java background
tend to call them parameters but in
Python they're usually called arguments
my argument is exactly one so we have
one argument there we've given it 0
therefore payton says hey you've got a
problem here my print method expects you
to give it 1 value and you have not
given it any values so therefore we
break so let's give it a value for
example this string string hello world
and as you can remember this hello world
then goes into my argument so my
argument in this line becomes hello
world and then we're going to print that
out so let's save the file and go back
and run it again and what do you think
is gonna be printed out now
and as you may imagine the words hello
world come out so all we've done here is
we've said my argument is gonna equal
hello world and then we're going to
print that out
let's have another example of a method
for example my multiply method and this
method is not going to have one argument
but two so number one
and number two and as you can see here
multiple arguments are separated by
commas and that tells python that these
are two separate arguments that we want
what goes at the end of any method
definition you know it is the colon and
afterwards
every line has to be indented further
than the death so the death was at the
very beginning of the line that next
line has to be indented further normally
in Python the indentation is four spaces
but it can be anything but it has to be
at least one space so here I've got four
spaces of indentation you can have fewer
or more if you prefer
my multiply method then is going to do
something called returning a value so
we're gonna do is win a return number
one multiplied by number two
once again we can do result which is a
new variable is my multiply method five
and three
so what do you think is going to happen
in this instance what do you think will
be the result this variable here what
will be the value that we store in it
give it a wild guess but I'm sure you
expect 15 to be in this variable at the
end
so first let's verify that you are
correct I'm going to print result
and I'm going to comment this out so it
doesn't get printed out go back to the
terminal run this again and of course
you were correct and got the fifteen out
so here's what happened we created my
multiply method which sticks in two
parameters one called number one and one
called number two and then the method
itself didn't print anything all it did
was return a value
so here's what happened in order first
the five became number one sorry or
number one became five number two became
three so these values went in that
direction
number one times the Matua calculated
and gave us 15 and then when we return
what happened is that this entire thing
became 15 and then the 15 got assigned
to result so that's what returning is it
just essentially replaces the method
call by the return value and then you
can do things with it and in this case
what we did was put it inside the result
variable of course if we comment the
print out and we run the program you can
surely expect something or maybe nothing
will happen
and you probably got it right nothing
happens because once again we've not
printed anything out all we've done is
created a variable and creating a
variable does not print things out
we can also take it a step further and
use my print method to print the result
now here's all going to happen first
we're going to calculate the 15 and put
it inside result and then result is
going to go into my argument and that's
going to get printed out let's save the
file and run this again and the 15 comes
out
something to notice here is that we've
got the my multiply method and we are
putting the value into a variable but we
don't have to do that we can do my print
method my multiply method five and three
and I'm going to comment this out and
the same thing will happen the same
order first the five will go into number
one and the three will go into number
two we will calculate the result of my
multiply method which is 15 and then
we're going to use that result as my
argument and then we're gonna print that
out so exactly the same thing is gonna
happen and we can nest these methods put
them inside one another as much as we'd
like but naturally if we do that many
times the code becomes really long and
complicated and difficult to read so I
would not suggest you do that this
pattern here putting things in variables
and then using those variables is more
readable and therefore it's usually
easier to understand
so really that's everything for this
video so I hope you learn something and
let's quickly move on to the next one
we're going to be looking at some more
types of data that we can use in Python
other than numbers and strings I'll see
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
