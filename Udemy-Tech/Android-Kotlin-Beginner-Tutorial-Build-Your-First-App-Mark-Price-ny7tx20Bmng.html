with dev slopes calm and in this lesson
we are going to install android studio
and some of the other things that are
needed for android studio to run alright
and so you may notice that this looks a
little bit different from my regular
computer this because i wanted to do a
completely fresh install so that you
guys can see me go through step by step
instead of you know there might be some
stuff already installed on my computer
and and so we just want to do it a fresh
install alright so we're gonna go ahead
and do that and we're gonna open up
Safari and so the first thing that we're
gonna need is JDK the Java development
kit okay so to work with Kotlin which is
based on the java virtual machine
we're gonna need jdk and android studio
also needs it so all i got to do is
search for install jdk and then we're
gonna come here to the Java SE downloads
click here and then this is one we
bought in Java platform JDK let's go
ahead and click here and since this is
the set up for Mac we are just gonna
come down here and look for the Mac OSX
download it looks like it's about 230
Meg's so this might take just a little
bit of time so I'm gonna click here
oprah's you got it accept so accept the
License Agreement yep totally read that
and then we click here and just let that
download and I'll be right back once
that's done alrighty so the download has
complete so I'm gonna open up my
downloads folder here and let's just
open up and run this dmg here alright so
we are opening there fine checking
volumes alrighty so then we are going to
hold on decide later we're going to
double click on here to install the JDK
we're gonna sit continues it's gonna
take up a whole bunch of space no all
right
it's next step put those um okay and we
can move the dmg to the trash or why not
alright so now we have our JDK installed
next step is to go and get Android
studio so I'm gonna open up a new tab
and just search for Android oopsie
Android studio alright we can come here
to download Android studio and SDK tools
and so if at the time that you are
watching this this it says right here is
3.0 or above go ahead and click right
here alright but at the time of
recording the the version of Android
studio that has Collin built-in default
that's in beta alright so what we want
is come up here to where it says preview
so we're gonna click on preview so this
is their beta area alright so we were
going to download download 3.0 Canary 8
all right so we're gonna click here for
MEC and we are going to accept the terms
and conditions and click on download 3.0
alright so that's going to download and
yeah so holla be right back once that's
finished
alrighty that has finished up
downloading so I'm gonna go ahead and
open up my downloads folder again and
well look at that it is already
installed unpacked and everything all I
gotta do is just drag this over into
applications so I'll just drag that over
to applications and let's go ahead and
run it
all righty so we're verifying it
okay it's gonna give us a little bit of
a security notice just to make sure that
we know that we've downloaded it from
the internet and give us a chance to
refuse opening this potentially
dangerous app but we know it's a good
app comes from Android website so
whenever we're all good there and it's
going to fire up here in a sec alrighty
so then it's going to ask us if we want
to import studio settings from so if you
have a previous version of Android
studio then you can go ahead and import
studio settings from from that one so
that you can carry over your your
settings since this is a brand new fresh
install I don't have any import settings
I'm going to say ok you can see here
says pod by the intelligent platform and
if you remember IntelliJ is an IDE that
is developed by chip brains which are
who are the creators of Kotlin are so
IntelliJ JetBrains call in an Android
studio are all well intermeshed so
that's good for us
ok so now we're in the Android studio
setup wizards I'm gonna say next and I
we're just gonna do a standard install
so I'm gonna say next and right here is
gonna show us all of the things that we
need to download and and install to get
Android studio up and running we got the
emulator which is the Android simulators
we have the build tools Google
repository the hexam emulator
accelerator which is really important
for us because we need I mean what-what
hexton does that it really increases the
speed that the emulators are able to
perform app so yeah I'm just gonna say
finish and we're going to download all
of that stuff hopefully doesn't take too
long and I'll be right back once that's
done alrighty so that went according to
plan so everything has been downloaded
so let's go ahead and say finish and
then we are ready to open up and start a
new Android studio project so let's go
ahead and do that ok right-click her
just that click here and we're gonna go
over all this stuff
in depth here in the next couple of
lessons but just real quick I wanted to
set up a couple of more things so we're
just gonna go ahead and and do some
stuff here so I'm just gonna say test
and then whatever you have in here is
fine set your location by default that
goes into your Documents folder and sets
up a project called Android studio
projects that's fine for now so we say
next and then right here we have our our
phone and tablet which is what we're
going to be working with mostly and it
asks us to select a an API so there's
going to be our min API so I'm going to
select our Android 4.3 jelly bean and
again we're going to talk a lot more
about this in depth here in in the next
lessons like I said this is just to get
everything set up so I'm going to say
next and I'm going to choose an input
the activity and say next and main
activity and all this is the defaults is
fine so I'm going to say next and then
we're gonna say finish
all right so we are finally loading up
maybe able to hear the fans on my
macbook pro just screamin sounds like
something that's about to take off from
an aircraft carrier or something so yeah
Android studio is a very heavy on the
CPU this is a this is a pretty brand new
MacBook Pro - all right so here we have
what pops up the tip of the day and
those are useful sometimes
so I usually you can turn it off or op
you can turn it off or leave it on
I would leave a month occasionally
there's something interesting in there
and but yeah here we have our first
project and it looks like it's still
building some stuff so we're gonna wait
for this to finish alrighty so project
is finally all the way up you can hear
my fans winding down after that
Herculean effort of opening a project
and yeah here we are this is Android
studio we're not gonna go we're still
not gonna dive too much into Android
studio like what all of this all these
buttons are and everything does because
we're still in setup phase so what I
want you to do is come over here and
look at look for this button here got a
blue arrow pointing down and it's called
the if you hover over it it'll come up
and say the SDK manager
alright so if we click on that it's
gonna pop up and it's gonna show all of
the SDK platforms that are currently
installed all right and so what this
does is this allows you to run on your
emulator different versions of Android
ok and so in the Android world if you're
coming from iOS most users are not on
the latest operating system which in
this case is Android oh and so you'll
find that to support even a large
percentage of Android users you have to
go pretty far back in the Android
operating systems and so to be able to
test that your app
works correctly on some of those older
systems you need to be able to run your
emulator on it and so you need to have a
lot of some of these older ones
installed all right and so I'll
typically go back to about API level 18
and I think that covers about 90% or so
of users so if you want to do testing
and make sure that your app is working
for those older versions then you need
to click on all of these or how
whichever specific API levels you want
to test on and then you'll say then
you'll hit apply ok I'm actually not
going to do this because I have all of
these already installed on on my
computer and so once once I switch back
over to my computer you'll see that I
have all of these installed but for you
guys if you want to be able to test on
older versions of the of the Android
operating system it's not technically
even required you could submit an app
that only works on android 8.0 on the on
the newest operating system but you were
only gonna capture a very very very
small market in fact if we let's go
ahead and Google this if we say
something like Android operating system
distribution maybe that should probably
get us there let's see here is this it
let's see you here dashboards ok yeah
platform versions so you'll see here
that right now nugget is the latest
version oh is still in beta I believe
and so even the very latest nugget it
only captures only has 10% of the
android market 30% is on marshmallow
around 30% is on lollipop and about 17%
is still on KitKat it looks like there's
actually a pretty small percentage in
jellybean so I might actually move my
minimum SDK up to 19 I think
all right and so yeah so that's that's
that's uh that's kind of a breakdown
very few people are at anytime on the
very latest version of the of the
operating system so yeah go ahead and
download as many of the older SDKs as
you want to over here we have some SDK
tools if you don't have this right here
the Intel x86 emulator accelerator hacks
an installer installed go ahead and
install that as well we're going to be
using that for our emulators and that's
about all we need for setup so in the
next lesson we are going to take a look
at the Android emulators and learn a
whole bunch of stuff about how awesome
they are alright so I will see you then
welcome back Johnny be here with tips
Lopes calm and I hope you're excited
because in this lesson we are going to
create our first Collin app so you may
be panicking thinking well Johnny I
haven't even learned any Kotlin yet
don't worry there's not a whole lot of
actual Kotlin code in this app the main
point of it is to give you an
introduction to Android studio a taste
of Kotlin and honestly mostly just to
get you pumped about developing for
Android alright in the next section is
where we're gonna jump into learning
more and more about Kotlin the actual
language alright so let's go ahead and
take a look at the app that we are going
to create it is called dinner decider
and you know how it goes
when you're sitting around with your
friends or a significant other and it's
dinnertime and you ask them you know
what do you want to eat for dinner and
they say I don't know what do you want
to eat and then you just keep going back
and forth like that until you starve to
death well dinner decider to the rescue
all you got to do is say right down here
you click on decide and it will tell you
what you are going to eat for dinner and
the dinner decider is the final decider
so whatever you click here and it tells
you that is what you're going to eat all
right but not only that if it doesn't
come with we're going to program it with
about five initial food food types and
restaurants or whatever and but if you
don't like what is in there already you
can add your own food as I can click
here and say something like I don't know
McDonald's if that's what you're into
and then we clicked on the check and say
add food and then it's in our array of
foods and if we click on this there we
go we can see that we are restaurant or
food style that we just added all right
so it's a pretty cool we're going to
learn a lot of stuff here so let's go
ahead and get started I'm going to start
off creating a new project so let me
just go ahead and pull that over here
and we're gonna call this dinner be
cider or you could do dinner picker or
whatever you want to call it
alright and then here we have our
company
domaine alright and so here what we want
to do is have this needs to be a unique
identifier for for you because if you
look down here your package name what
it's going to do is going to take your
company name so right here you see this
as Johnny be calm and then it's going to
take your application name and it's
going to create a package identifier in
a reverse DNS format so it's calm Johnny
be so kind of the reverse of your
company domain and then the application
name right here alright and so what that
is doing is that's creating what is
hopefully a unique identifier for your
project and that needs to be totally
unique across all apps that are on the
Google Play Store so instance if we go
ahead and open up Safari I'm just going
to drag a window over here and we go to
the Google Play Store and we come in
here to apps and we just click on a
random appleís check out fruit ninja and
then you look at the URL here you'll see
com dot half brick dot fruit ninja and
so that's this particular apps bundle
identifier all right and so I'm not sure
if it's all the way to free or if that
is part of the category that it's in but
anyway so that's that's a what the
package name is for and then of course
since we're going to be working with
column we want to check right here and
then we can select a project location I
am going to put mine on the desktop here
so I'm going to select the desktop and
say open and that's going to screw some
things up it says so I want is desktop
and then dinner decider there we go
all right then I'm going to say next and
we're going to pick our iPhone and
tablet we're not gonna be messing with
where or TV or Android auto but it's
pretty cool that you can
know that these things are available to
you should you decide to develop for
them working with Android can open up a
huge you know just so many things run on
Android but yeah but we're gonna be
working with phone and tablet and right
here we are going to be targeting our
minimum SDK so we talked a little bit
about that in the last couple of lessons
what is the SDK and how you know not all
Android devices are running the most
current and I saw that 19 is actually
supporting about 90% of devices and so
that's good enough for me you know 90%
of people is pretty good and so again if
you click here on help me choose it'll
kind of give you a breakdown of the
distribution of users on the Android
operating systems alright so that's
pretty cool alright and then so that's
good I'm gonna say next and then we're
just going to go with an empty activity
but there are a whole bunch of templates
here that you can use to get started
things like a navigation drawer so you
have a slide-out menu things like Google
Maps a Google AdMob ads template and
we'll be using some of these later on in
the course but for right now we're just
going to be using this empty activity so
I'm going to say next and the activity
name so this is gonna be the name of our
Kotlin file that is the kind of that
controls the the code for the layout and
then the layout name itself so then you
can as we want we definitely want to
generate a layout file and then you can
check whether or not you want to use
backwards compatibility and so what app
compat activity does well we'll talk
about that a little bit later but
basically it just provides some
backwards compatibility for some
material design features and some other
things alright so I'm gonna say finish
alrighty so we have our brand new
project open here and it opened up our
main activity dot KT file so the dot KT
indicates that it is a Colin file and
then the other one that is
here is our activity underscore main so
the main activity Katy filed is the the
code that is going to kind of drive what
occurs on the UI and then the activity
main is our layout so here what we're
looking at is what's called XML all
right and so we can either design our UI
in XML and so what we have here is a
textview and you can see different
properties of it the width the height
what it says the text here our layout
constraints and so if we go into the
design tab here we can kind of see what
that looks like visually alright so we
have here a our our view we have one
text field and it is constrained you see
these little zigzag ease kind of look
like Springs those are our constraints
all right we can kind of move this
around and the constraints will update
accordingly
and we're going to talk a little bit
more about this here in just a bit but
we're going to do a little bit of a
speedy run-through of Android studio Roo
at first alright so over here we have
our project hierarchy and so we have
first app here and then we have three
folders manifests Java and resources so
here our first in manifests we have what
is called the androidmanifest.xml file
so every every application must have an
Android manifest XML file and it has to
be named exactly that and it's in the
root directory basically the manifest
file provides essential information
about your app to the Android system
which the system must have before it can
run any of the apps code so if you take
a look in here we have things like the
icon launcher the label s'more icon
launcher stuff what the theme is what
the main activity is so you see here
that main activity so that's referring
to this guy right here so it's basically
just some important information that the
app needs to know right now you don't
need to worry too much about this we
might go into a little bit more in
detail later on
but the second folder we have
is the Java folder so in our case we're
not working with Java files they are in
fact Kotlin files but the folder is
still named Java so we got a couple of
folders here we have the top one common
TV dinner decider and so this is the
main one that will be working in which
will hold all of our all of our Collin
piles and then you have a couple more
Android tests and tests so here's just
some example instrument tests and unit
tests okay and so that's what we have in
here and here's our entry main activity
Kotlin file and we'll come back to this
one then we have our resources folder
here we have drawables this is where
we're going to be putting our images and
other assets we have the layout folder
which contains our view and activity and
fragment layouts themselves we have
which contains our icon launchers so if
we look these out you see these are the
icons that are actually visible when you
launch the app from your phone let's see
here then we have values so here in the
values we have a few different files we
have something called colors so this
year this color primary is actually the
same color as what you see here in the
in this menu bar and we'll be updating
those here in a minute and then the last
thing that I wanted to go over real
quick is here we have a folder called
Gradle scripts alright and so Gradle is
a pretty confusing topic but luckily you
don't need to know too much about it
starting out basically all this stuff
all of these scripts all these
properties and everything what it does
is it takes all of your files your
resources your images and everything
that you have in these folders and it
packages it up it converts it into the
correct bytecode packages it up and
turns it into our apk file or Android
package kit and the apk is what you need
to be able to install apps that's the
file that you upload to
the the Android developer site when you
release apps and so that's what the
Gradle does most the time when you do
work in it you'll be working here and
they build Gradle and then module app
all right so if we open this up we can
see that we have a few plugins so we
have the Kotlin Android and Android
extensions plugins which lets us work
with Kotlin in Android studio you can
see that we have a target apk we have a
or here's the target SDK target SDK a
minimum SDK version the application ID
down here in dependencies this is
probably where you'll be doing the most
work is if you were using like Google
API soar firebase or any of the other
third-party libraries that you want to
use you'll put those dependencies right
here and when you make changes so even
adding some spaces trigger the changes
it'll say Gradle files have changed
since the last project sync projects
sync may be necessary for the IDE to
work properly and so you just click on
sync now since I didn't actually make
any real changes well I guess I'll do it
so just to show you so when you click on
sync it'll say Gradle project sync is in
progress and then it all reload the
necessary data for that change alright
so that's a pretty quick overview hey
let's see here anything else we can run
the app from right here we've already
looked at the AVD manager for our
emulators we've already looked at the
SDK manager so without further ado let's
let's jump into actually working on our
app a little bit alright so let's start
out and work on our layout ok I'm going
to open up our activity main.xml and we
are going to actually first off we're
going to work in the values because look
I don't like these colors that we have
so here under values we're going to go
to colors that XML and you can see that
we have here or this is another XML file
we have a resources tag that is opened
and then closed here and then we have
three color variables with names and
their values all right and so the what
we're gonna do is we're just going to
change these values and the values that
we were going to change into come from
our design which which gives us this
these these two nice cause we're gonna
get this color and this color and I
already have those that is five a seven
e 8c okay and so we're gonna put that
one here and for the primary dark right
there as well and then the accent color
is a little bit lighter and so that is
CC seven or CC d7 d C alright let's go
ahead and save that and jump back into
our activity main and now you can see
that the menu bar here has changed to
our color that we want all right and
let's check out this hello world and so
let's talk briefly about these
constraints I'm not going to go too
heavily into it as we're going to have a
whole section devoted to talking about
the constraints but basically when you
have so many different screen sizes like
Android does you need a system so that
even when you have go from a little tiny
screen all the way up to a tablet you
want to be able to have the UI elements
know where they need to be and where
they need to be in relation to other UI
elements and so that's what the this
constraint system does for us you can
see here that we have constraints to the
left the top the right and the bottom so
basically you can kind of think of these
constraints as bungee cords or Springs
kind of just holding things in place and
we'll go more into more depth later on
all right so this hello world text field
that we have I think this can double as
our
food label all right so what we're gonna
do is first off we're gonna give it an
ID
okay so IDs are very important because
that's what that's the ID that is going
to help us or that's going to allow us
to reference this UI element in code
okay so we're gonna call this selected
food text okay
and then let's go ahead and customize it
a little bit let's go ahead and say
instead of hello world let's give it a
default value of say Chinese food okay
so we're gonna have the default be
Chinese and then let's go ahead and
change the font to family so if we click
here on the font family and click on the
arrow here we can come down here to more
fonts and then we can come over here to
downloadable and what we're going to do
is we're going to search for one called
muley okay it's gonna select it here and
then over here we're gonna go with bold
alright and what this is going to do is
it's going to go ahead and download our
font to our to our folder over here and
the resources I'm gonna say okay and
then you can see here in resources that
we now have a mule Ebola XML file here
in the font folders alright and so that
has changed the font for that text view
and then we're going to go ahead and
change the text size let's bump that up
to maybe like 24
maybe maybe 30 alright so here you see
that is 30 SP SP stands for scale
independent pixels and that is used only
for fonts the SP for images and other UI
elements will use what is called DP
which is density independent pixels
alright so SP is used for text size and
what that does what the SP does is we'll
talk a little bit about this more a
little bit later when we talk about DP
but different screens have different
resolutions or meaning in the same area
of screen you could have a vastly
different number of pixels you could
have a very low resolution screen with
just a few pixels or you can have a very
high resolution
screen with a hole hmm you know
thousands or millions of pixels and so
with SP scale independent pixel what it
does is we're saying text sizes 30 and
30 SP so this size is going to look
roughly the same across different screen
resolutions all right so that's what the
SP and the DP do it makes whatever size
that you pick as long as you choose SP
or DP for other UI elements like images
then it's going to look roughly the same
across different resolution sizes
alright and so we got Chinese here so
that's gonna be our our food type and
then let's also change the background
color here so we're going to switch over
to our XML version and so the top most
element here is a constraint layout
alright and so what we're looking at
here in our in our overall view our
screen here this is a constraint layout
at its uppermost component in the tree
so everything we put into this view is
going into a constraint layout and so
that's why this is the top element in
our in our XML file and so then inside
of it
we have other text elements so we have
here a text view and in fact if I copied
this and then pasted it what we would
end up with and this is yelling at me
because it can't have the same exact ID
so if we just change that and then jump
back into text view or design view
you'll see that we now have two text
views they are right on top of each
other right now but if I move one you
can see that we have two now but we
don't we don't need to so or at least
right now so what I wanted to do was in
here change the background color of the
overall constraint layout alright so
here you can see that we have some
attributes such as the width and the
height which is match parent and so what
that is saying is that the constraint
layout should expand to fill the parent
in the height and width
erections so we're going to do we're
going to change the background colors
I'm going to say Android and I'm gonna
say background and what we want is the
color accent so just like that so we're
sanding the background equal to the
accent color alright so let's go ahead
and see what that looks like if we go
back to design hey there we go so now we
have changed our background color we
have modified and given our text label a
little bit of an upgrade and we've gone
over a lot of the a lot of the Android
studio features and how it's organized
we talked about the manifest file the
Java Kotlin files folder the resources
how the drawables work talk a little bit
about the Gradle script so in the next
lesson we will finish up this app we're
going to we're going to be working with
some images in the drawables file we're
going to be looking at buttons and
seeing how how we can use those in code
and you'll be writing your first a
little bit of Kotlin all right hope
you're excited for that and I will see
you in the next one
hey there ladies and gentlemen welcome
back Johnny be here with dev slopes calm
and in this lesson we are continuing on
with our dinner decider app we left off
last time just finishing up adding a
text view in our in our layout here
we have also modified the menu color and
the background color here in our colors
Alex ml file and we learned a whole lot
of stuff about Android studio in general
whoopsie alright so what we're gonna do
next is we are going to add our our icon
alright so you see here in our in our in
our app we have this nice-looking icon
here so let's go ahead and add that it's
how we're gonna do that is we're gonna
go here to drawable here and under our
resources folder and I'm going to right
click on the folder drawable and then
I'm going to go to reveal in finder okay
and that's going to show the drawable
folder alright and then what we're gonna
do is I want you to get the assets
folder that you downloaded should be
attached to the previous lesson and take
a look at the dinner DS header assets
folder and you're gonna see that we have
five folders here and it's going to say
drawable - hdpi mdpi xhdpi xxhdpi and X
X X X hdpi and those hold the yeah the
logo in different pixel sizes alright so
we're gonna do is we're going to select
all of those we're on a copy command C
and then here in the resources folder
right here I'm going to say ctrl or
command V to paste it and then we can
close that out and then if we come over
here to our folder here under drawables
we should now see a DD denardis header
underscore logo and we can check those
out right here alright great so now we
have our logo in our drawable resources
so now we can use it inside of our
layout so let's go ahead and add an
image alright so here is our palette and
this contains all of our UI elements
that we are able to add if you click on
all you'll just be able to see them all
here under
you got them categorized widgets text
layouts containers images etc you can
take a look at through here and and see
what kind of goodies you're able to just
drag and drop into your UI interface all
right so we're gonna be working with an
image of you here so I'm going to drag
an image view and just pop it in here
and then it's gonna pop up here and ask
us give us the option to give it a
specific drawable right now and we know
we want the logo here so I'm going to
select it and press ok and so there we
have it I'm gonna zoom in here using
command and I think thinkin let's let's
make that a little bit bigger so what
we're gonna do is here is I'm gonna
select layout width and I'm gonna
specify 150 DP width and 150 DP in
height and actually I think that might
be a little too big so let's actually go
with 120 DP and 120 DP on the height I
think that looks a little bit better so
I'm just gonna drag that up here and
here on our text label what am I gonna
do is I'm gonna actually remove some of
its constraints so how you can do that
is if you see here we have these filled
in circles and these are the constraint
handles and you can add or remove by
clicking on them so right now since we
already have one I can click on it and
it will delete that constraint then it's
gonna fly up to the top because it still
has that top constraint then I'm
actually going to delete the top
constraint as well okay so it's just
floating all it knows is that it needs
to be constrained to the left and right
by this amount all right and so what
we're gonna do here is we're going to
give the logo here constraints we're
going to constrain it to the top here so
hovering over this circle here I'm going
to create a connection and then you just
hold it and drag to the top then I'm
going to constrain to the right I'm
gonna hold and drag to the right and
hold and drag to the left and so that's
going to
Center it horizontally by default when
you give it left and right constraints
and then here over on the right here
this is another view for our constraints
and since I have left and right
constraints this slider here is a
horizontal bias and so I can give it a
horizontal bias of any number between 0
and 100 so if I bias it a 100 to the
right then it's going to be all the way
to the right if I bias it to 0 is going
to be all the way to the left we want it
to be right in the center okay and then
up here we have margins all right and so
if you'll see here this has an 8 right
here which corresponds to this 8 here
and so this constraint has a margin of 8
and then here we have a margin of 48
which i think is pretty good maybe like
50 and so what that says is that the
image view is 50 from the top view here
and so then with our label what I can do
is I can constrain this label to this
image view okay and then now it's
constrained to the left right and the
bottom of this image so then I can give
it a margin of say 24 and that looks
pretty good and our UI is starting to
come together now I want to talk real
quick about our sizes here we said that
we were setting this to DP and what that
stands for is density independent pixels
and so I wanted to go over a little bit
of the documentation with you that talks
about that so here we have at
developer.android.com slash guide slash
practices slash screen support if you're
just google android screen support I'm
sure this will pop up first thing and
what this article talks about is the
different range of screens that are
supported like you know Android has tons
of manufacturers tons of different
screen sizes tons of different
Lucian's and so what they tried to do is
make it a little bit simpler using what
they call density independent pixels
because you know kind of what this part
made me laugh it says to simplify the
way that you design your user interfaces
for multiple screens Android divides the
range of actual screen sizes and
densities into a set of for generalized
sizes and then a set of six generalized
densities l ldpi mdpi all the way up to
X X X X dpi and so what that is
referring to is the density pixel the
the number of pixels in a given screen
okay and so you have these six that
we're dealing with that's why in Android
studio when we added our logo we had
five folders with the different density
pixels and so what that what that does
for us is here it says talks about the
density independence as your application
achieves density independence when it
preserves the physical size from the
users point of view of user interface
elements when displayed on screens with
different densities maintaining density
independent independence is important
because without it a UI element such as
a button appears physically larger on a
low-density screen and smaller on a
high-density screen all right so we have
some examples here so this is on three
different screens that does not have
density independence in it so you can
see here that on the low-density
independence so we could say here there
might be this might be two by two pixels
okay so two by two pixels and if this is
going to be a two by two pixel label
then on the low-density is going to look
big but then on the medium density
screen since there are so many more
pixels the image and the text field look
smaller and then on a high density
screen is going to be even smaller and
so what density independence does is you
can
here so these three screens it has
density independence and so it roughly
looks the same across your different
resolution and different well resolution
it's the same across your different
resolution sizes all right so even if
you have a super high density screen
your UI element is going to look the
same as it does on a low-density screen
and so that's pretty awesome that's
super super helpful when we're dealing
with images and other UI elements so
that's why we use DP when we specify
sizes for our UI elements all right so
we have added our image logo we have our
label and we've have we have some
constraints for for these two so now if
I change what size were in if I go to
say a nexus 6 which is a lot bigger we
still keep the same location relative to
the screen and we're still 50 from the
top and we are still centered even if we
change our orientation so right here
let's see here right here we can change
their orientation in the editor we can
switch to landscape we're still going to
be 50 from the top and we're still going
to be centered all right so that's what
that's what we mean when we when we talk
about constraining objects so that they
know where they are fixed in relation to
the screen and other UI elements just to
go over real quick here some of the some
of these buttons that are related to our
layout editor here we have what is
called the blueprint so this is the
regular view and then this is the
blueprint view kind of shows a little
bit more always shows the constraints
and shows their margins and everything
let's see here here we can change the
size of the of the of the screen that
we're looking at this selects the api's
you can change your app theme here and
this is has to do more with the
constraint layouts you can remove all
constraints if you click
this and you can set a default margin
here and we'll go over some of these
other ones here in a few lessons when we
talk about when we dive deep into into
constraint layout all right so what do
we need now we got our logo we have our
text label we have these constrained
let's take a look at our app here and it
looks like we're gonna need a couple of
buttons and a textview all right
so let's do this bottom button first the
decide button all right so we're gonna
come back over here to our palette and
we're going to add a button so that's
under widgets okay and we want a button
here so I'm going to pick this button
and we're just going to drag it down
here to the bottom I'm gonna go ahead
and zoom in here maybe a little too far
here we go and what we're gonna do is we
are going to constrain it to the left so
I'm just clicking and dragging to the
right and then also to the bottom okay
so now we have it constrained to the
bottom but we want it to go all the way
and so we're gonna do is we are going to
well first we're gonna change this the
button style here I don't like this kind
of rounded style here so I'm gonna
select here and we're gonna do you
borderless okay and then we're going to
get rid of any margin here so the bottom
margin is zero so it's right flush
against the bottom we'll change that
here as well and here as well and then
we're going to go ahead and just we're
gonna drag this all the way to the edge
okay and let's go ahead and what we can
do is we can change the type of
constraints right now we have fixed so
whatever we have is going to be fixed to
that size what we can do is we can pick
this one right here alright and so this
is called match constraints and so the
constraint is set to the left and right
and so we are saying match it to that so
it's just going to expand to fill out
the entirety of the constraint all right
and then let's go ahead and add a
background to this
so here we can select background and if
we click here we can select instead of a
drawable a color and since we have kind
of our built in colors we can say color
primary which is good so I'm going to
say okay and so now we have a nice
background color on it then let's go
ahead and change the text so this is
going to say decide exclamation point
and we're going to change the the font
family so we're gonna go with muley bold
and then we're going to change the text
size let's go with about 24 maybe a
little small at 20 maybe 18 I think that
looks good and we'll change the text
color to background light looks good
alright so now we have wait for this to
catch up there we go so now we have our
button alright wonderful and just like
we were talking about in the last lesson
our UI elements that we want to
reference in code they need to have IDs
all right so I'm going to click here on
this buttons ID and we're gonna call
this decide button okay so that looks
good and you know I think that buttons I
think that buns taken care of alright
let's go ahead and add our text field
and so this is gonna just be a plain
text okay it's gonna put that here and
let's go ahead and give it an ID right
off the bat and we're gonna call this
add food text because this is the text
field that we're going to enter the
additional types of food styles or
restaurants that we want to added to our
array of restaurants or foods that we
can go eat at alright so this one's
going to be right here that's fine I'll
just change the font family to muley
bold that looks good text size is fine I
think everything looks good with with
this text field so we'll just go and put
you right here for now and then we're
going to need one more button alright so
grab this button and pull it out here
and this one is going to be called so
I'm going to double click and that lets
us add food alright so I just renamed
the button to add food and similar to
this button down here we're going to go
ahead and change its style to borderless
we're gonna give the background color
our color of color primary I say ok and
then I'm gonna go ahead and just move it
and line it to the left of this guy
right here and then I'm going to just
drag it over okay and just give it a
whoops just give it a sighs that looks
pretty good there and let's go ahead and
change the font to family for this
button I'm gonna say newly bold and then
the text size I think I feel looks ok
and let's change the text color to white
so here background light say okay
alrighty so now we have our text field
we have our button and so uh yeah let's
go back to our text field though we
don't want it to say name let's see here
so text actually we're gonna get rid of
the text so delete it and then here at
hint so this is kind of some placeholder
text it gives the user a hint of what we
want it to say and we're gonna say add
new food Dada Dada that okay and so now
they know that they can add a new food
here and then they'll add it by clicking
on the button and let's go ahead and
give some constraints here so one cool
thing we can do is we can right click
and say a line or Center and we can say
Center horizontally and that will add
our to left and right and center it and
then let's hope that's constrain this
button to the bottom button and let's
set it here so that it will bump it up
maybe like 40 maybe a little bit more
how about a 70
I think that looks pretty good yeah
let's go a little bit more
let's go eighty all right and then we
can drag this right to here and we can
right click and say Center and let's
Center it horizontally and then we're
also going to just go zoom in here a
little bit we're going to constrain
right here to right here all right so
we're constraining the the vertical
distance between these two elements and
setting that to maybe 24 it says you met
a little bit see how that looks and I
think that looks pretty good all right
so now we have all of our UI elements in
here we have them all constrained and
everything's looking real good we do
need to add a couple of IDs still I
think what do we have here we have the
ID for this one I don't think we have
the ID for this button all right so this
is gonna be add food button alright so
now I think we have everything that we
need to okay so if you change the ID
sometimes it'll ask you this it'll say
so we changed the the ID and says this
will update all XML references and Java
are field references so yes we do want
to do that and don't ask me again so
thank you I think we have everything we
need to jump into code and actually
start doing a little bit of Kotlin all
right so let's do that come over here to
our Java folder and under the dinner
decider folder we're gonna click on main
activity and here we are here we are in
our Kotlin file alright and so if you're
coming from java the first thing you
might notice is no semicolons yeah you
don't have to worry about ending every
line with a semicolon so that's already
right off the bat pretty exciting but
wait there's more so well before I get
into the and more let's take a look at
this file alright so we're here we have
a class ok
so we'll talk about classes later on but
the
as our main activity is what it's called
and what this is is it's extending
appcompat activity and we'll talk a
little bit more about extending and
inheritance and all that kind of stuff a
little bit later on but basically this
is saying that the main activity
inherits certain attributes from this
appcompat activity
all right and so then we have this
function override fun on create and so
in Kotlin we have the fund keyword to
indicate functions and so when we first
start out with a file in Android we're
going to talk more about the lifecycle
of an activity in Android later on but
oncreate is the very first function that
is called when the when the activity is
created after coming over from iOS it's
the same thing as viewdidload all right
so it's the first active pairs the first
function called when the activity is
created and so how kind of the flow goes
is we have our manifest Android manifest
you know it is looking here and is going
to look for main activity and so that's
this file here and then we have our
oncreate function which is the first
thing that is called when the activity
is created and then we have set content
to view all right so this is kind of
setting up the the layout that the user
sees and the layout that it is setting
up is low and behold our our dot layout
that activity main which is in right
here
if you just follow the path our is
resources layout is this folder here and
then activity main is this layout file
that we've been working on all right so
that's kind of the flow of how you know
when you start up your app a checks out
which is the first main activity to load
and then on create it goes and checks
out which layout to actually load and
show the user all right so that all
aside now back to the and more exciting
and more that I mentioned earlier for
Kotlin is that in previously in Android
in Java you would have to
find by ID all of your darn little UI
elements all right but watch this so we
set an ID for our food label right so we
said sit mmm what did we call it
I forget let's go back and look so back
in here this guy right here
selected food text alright so that's
what we called it so here in our on
create I can say selected food text and
if I press enter you need to wait for
the autocomplete if I enter then it says
import Collin X Android synthetic that
made that activity main and so what this
does for us is we can reference directly
the elements in our layout without
having to do that whole find by ID
nonsense alright so I can write here say
selected food text dot text is equal to
say Burger King and then if we run this
let's go ahead and run it is our first
time running it so let's go ahead and
check out how it looks I'm going to
press ok on the Nexus 6 emulator you can
choose whichever one that you created in
our last lessons and there we have it so
we directly set the value of this text
field in code and so that is that's a
that's a pretty exciting thing for for
Kotlin you know being able to reference
directly our UI elements and in the next
lesson we're going to go ahead and go
through all of the code and logic to
finish up our app alright so I will see
you in the next one
all right welcome back ladies and
gentlemen Johnny beer with deaf slopes
calm and in this lesson let's finish up
our dinner decider app alright so what
does our app do well it stores a list of
places to eat or styles of food like
Chinese American Mexican food you know
however you want to write it and then it
will go through and every time we click
the decide button is going to randomly
select one of those and display it we
can also add to that list with the add
food button alright so let's go ahead
and get start on that so here in
oncreate I'm gonna delete what we had
before what we need to do is we need to
know when one of those buttons is
clicked right and so how we do that in
Android and Kotlin is really simple we
can say we can reference one of our
buttons we can say decide button and
then I'm going to say dot set
onclicklistener
okay and so this is a method basically
saying whenever that button is clicked
we're gonna listen for it and then we're
going to do something so whatever
whenever is click whatever is within
these two curly braces is executed
alright so this is the decide button and
so we can just say print line and we can
say you click to me and then we can run
that just to test it out alright so we
got our emulator up here and so if I
click here click I clicked on this side
we need to open up our logcat here and
there we go you can see you clicked me
alright so if I click on that again
it'll keep printing that out alright so
we know that our onclicklistener is
working so what do we need to have
happen when we click on it well first
we're gonna need an array right so we're
gonna do is we are going to create that
list now food
food list is equal to list of and we
want and ArrayList of let's see here
this one right here ArrayList of var
aargh elements alright so this is the
one you want and so what this is is
we're creating an ArrayList and then we
can directly initialize it with elements
inside of the ArrayList and don't worry
too much about this right now we're
gonna go over in depth collections in
the next section alright so but just
know that we're creating a we're also
gonna be going over variables this is
how we declare one type of variable in
Kotlin okay so Val is declaring a
variable the name of the variable is
food list and the type is an ArrayList
alright so like I said don't worry too
much about this and just know that it's
kind of a collection of food types that
we're going to add alright so we're
gonna say something like Chinese and
then we're gonna say hamburger hamburger
I will say I don't know Pizza how about
maybe like Donald's and borrows ours is
an awesome pizza place all right so we
have an array list of 1 2 3 4 5 food
elements alright so now what we want to
do is when we click on it we're going to
need to randomly select one of those and
so again don't worry too much about the
the code and everything just follow
along we're going to create a variable
called random which is going to be of
type random ok so we're going to
initialize that and you should see that
we imported Java dot util right there
and so then we're going to need to
create a random food index so we're
gonna say random food is equal to then
we're gonna say random dot next int and
the next int what we put in here is food
list dot
count all right and so again don't don't
stress out about what's going on here
this needs to be renamed random food
don't stress out too much about what's
going on here especially right here this
is you know a little bit more advanced
stuff we just need it to be able to
create a random variable so don't fret
if you're not understanding this and
you're freaking out just know that we're
creating a random food integer okay so a
number that is randomly generated and
it's going to be between zero and the
maximum number of elements in the array
list all right and then what we're going
to do is we're going to set the selected
food label equal to the randomly
selected food in the food list and we do
that by saying selected food text dot
text so we're referencing the UI element
select the food text then we're going to
its property the text itself the string
that is being displayed in the text
field and we are setting that equal to
food list in the array and then we are
accessing it by set by passing in the
random food number that was generated
all right so when we click we are
creating a randomly generated number
that is between zero and the maximum
number of elements in the food list
array and then we set the selected food
text text label equal to whichever one
was Jenna randomly generated so if we
click it and it randomly generates two
then is going to set as the selected
food text label zero one and two so it's
going to select pizza so arrays they
start at zero so this is the 0th the
first and the second element in the
array so if it generates two is going to
be pizza if it generates four it's gonna
be borrows pizza if it generates zero
then it's gonna be Chinese food okay
so pretty simple let's go ahead and
check that out I'm gonna run our app
all right here we go a moment of truth
I'm gonna click on decide and we should
see ya should see the label up here
change hamburger Chinese hamburger
borrows Pizza Pizza alright so it looks
like it is working so that's pretty
exciting alright let's go ahead and
implement this part right here alright
so what we want to have happen when we
click on the add food button so when we
click on the add food button what we're
gonna do is we are going to grab
whatever is in the this text field and
we're going to add it to this array okay
so we need to create an onclicklistener
right so we're gonna say add food oops
not that one add food button dot set
onclicklistener
and we want this one with the curly
braces and then we're going to we're
gonna we're gonna grab whatever value
was in the food but food text field so
we're gonna say val new food is equal to
add food we're gonna reference the text
field and we're gonna grab out of it
it's text and then we need to actually
convert this to a string because as is
it's not very useful to us so we gotta
say dot two string okay so that turns it
into a string that is now stored in the
variable new food and then we're gonna
just say food list dot add and we can
add an element to the array so basically
we're grabbing whatever was inside of
the text field turning it into a string
and then adding it to the end of this
ArrayList okay and so the element that
we are adding here is new food all right
perfect
and then we'll go ahead and clear out
the text field so we'll say add food
text dot text
dot clear okay so that just makes it so
that when we click on the add food
button the add food text field will
clear out and it will be ready for the
next food that anyone wants to add okay
and let's go ahead and well real quick
just to kind of illustrate that we are
indeed adding it to this ArrayList let's
go ahead and print out the array so I'm
gonna say print line and we're gonna say
food list alright and let's go ahead and
run it alright so we can decide we can
get some randomly generated foods out oh
you know what I don't think we have
actually okay here we go I had an
updated the app actually so decide we
are switching out the the foods and
let's add a new food okay
so here I'm gonna say Italian food mmm
Italian food and click on the check and
we'll close the keyboard and when we add
food click on add food not only well
first it's going to add it to the array
so I'm gonna click add food and we can
see here that we printed out we started
out with just up to here but after we
clicked it now we can see that Italian
is added to it so now when we click on
decide a few times we should be able to
find our Italian food here for lucky
come on random out there was oh I passed
it but you saw that we added it and then
now it's available for our randomly
decided foods alright so that's pretty
much it
we've covered quite a bit for a first
app we've learned a lot about Android
studio and we've learned a lot about the
layout design we've learned some Kotlin
learned how cool it is and some of the
you know neat tricks about it not having
to reference by ID no semicolons Moo and
yeah so I hope you guys are having fun
so far and we got a lot more fun stuff
in store for you alright
