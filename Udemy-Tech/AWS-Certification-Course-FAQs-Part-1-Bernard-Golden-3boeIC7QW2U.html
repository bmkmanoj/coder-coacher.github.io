for the ultimate AWS Solutions Architect
associate course and in this video what
I want to talk about is some fa Q's some
frequently asked questions that students
or potential students often ask to
understand the course then the benefits
it brings so first one what is its
purpose what is the reason or the
rationale for the course why did I
create it well it's to provide an AWS
knowledge foundation you can take this
course knowing nothing about AWS to
start with no experience at all and it
will take you through learning a great
foundation of knowledge about areas it
will prepare you to begin using AWS on
the job so the first thing it does is it
grates creates a great knowledge
foundation the second thing it does is
it's focused on the AWS the Solutions
Architect associate certification and it
prepares you for that exam and that's
very important because if you saw in the
earlier video in this series there's a
lot of benefits to having a
certification and so being prepared to
pass the certification get the knowledge
you need and really work through
strategies around the certification exam
itself it's very important so that's
what's in the course a knowledge
foundation so you can use AWS and a set
of skills to help you pass the
certifications in well you might say
that's great
Bernard why are you teaching course what
brings you to the course what makes you
someone who can teach about it well so
first off I've worked in cloud for over
10 years in an earlier video in this
series I talked about what brought me to
cloud computing why am I so passionate
about it what my sort of introduction
was well I got I got exposed to AWS
maybe 10 years ago a little over 10
years ago and just threw myself into it
because I was so convinced that it was
going to be the future of IT and so I
worked with cloud for over 10
years I have a lot of knowledge that
goes into this course I've done a lot of
work around cloud computing and
well-known I have - a blog that's been
named to over a dozen best of cloud
computing blog lists and I was really
honored when Winer comm named me one of
the 10 most influential people in cloud
computing so you're learning from 20 who
is well-respected in the area in the
industry and then I've written five
books on cloud computing including AWS
for dummies so I wrote the book on cloud
computing on AWS that's my background
that's what I bring to the course ok you
might say well what is the course cover
well there's a lot of material and I'm
gonna be reading this off the screen
because a lot of content here there's 19
sections in the course so it's very
comprehensive it covers everything you
need to know to be an introduction to
AWS but also to pass certification exam
and these sections cover things like ec2
which is the core computing service of a
nebulous it covers I am which is
identity access management there's as I
said 19 sections very comprehensive that
makes up 27 hours of video so there's a
lot of content a lot of information not
only is there are there lessons in the
course that I've recorded and made
available but there's lots of other
stuff like hands-on activities so that
you actually do reinforcement of what
you've learned
there's certification exam preparation
meaning at the end of every section
there's a sort of tips for the
certification exam
plus there's practice exam itself so
there's an entire section on this
certification exam that's what's in it
so that gives you an idea of what's
what's in there the course covers the
key services that are part of the surf
fishing out into deep way so that you
learn everything you need to know about
for the certification out and really
everything you need to know to start
using them in a work environment it also
covers the core white papers that AWS
has put
and identified as being knowledge of
foundations that you need so there's a
couple of them that are really key one
is a security and compliance well
actually that's - a security white paper
and a compliance white paper but there's
a third one that they've really
emphasized now called the well
architected framework which is a set of
sort of best best practices or
principles on how to build really
scalable elastic resilient applications
on AWS the course covers all of those
white papers in detail so you have the
knowledge for them and they are covered
in the certification exam so that you
have the knowledge base for the exam and
then there's a course bring it all
together project where you build a
scalable resilient WordPress site and
that gives you a sense of you know how
to use it I mean it really reinforces
all these skills you've learned it
brings them all together in one project
but it also gives you a sense of how do
you build really great applications in
AWS what are all the capabilities that
you can use within a team us to bring
forward scalability and resilience and
so forth it's a great hands-on that
brings it that as I said brings it all
together makes it great so you might say
what do I need to know if I want to take
this course do I have to really have a
lot of experience in abuse do I have to
have a huge technical in the halls base
no you do not I generally recommend one
year of general technical experience now
that might be something you're doing on
the job but it might even be if you've
taken some courses in college or
university and it doesn't mean like a
computer science degree that might be if
you're doing statistics or some kind of
of scientific analysis you oftentimes
have used computing as part of that
maybe you've done some programming
whatever it might be that's enough
that's plenty to get going with this
course you do not have to have a huge
amount of experience or work in the IT
industry to take the course you don't
need to know anything about AWS we start
with the fundamentals the basics I I
created the course
with an assumption that you don't know
anything about any of us I start with
the very basics and then build on that
for you so you can come into this
without having ever worked with AWS and
you'll leave knowing how to use it in a
pretty significant way but you do need
to have a commitment to understanding
and learning about any of us if you're
not really motivated it's gonna be hard
because there's quite a bit of material
I mean the certification that Endymion's
puts forward requires lots of knowledge
and so you have to have a commitment to
really learn all that if you want to be
successful and pass the certification
but that's what you need to know to take
the course and then another obvious
question is well how long will it take
to for me to take the course well
there's 19 sections 27 hours so it's
clearly not something you're gonna do in
one day for sure but you know one
student got through it in two weeks I
mean he was clearly obviously very
motivated and really stuck to it but
it's it's not something that can't be
done in that kind of timeframe I
generally say two months is a pretty
good estimate and by the way there's an
entire lesson on how to create a course
plan on how to get through it as a kind
of a project that'll help you figure out
how long it'll take you to take it and
put together a plan in a concrete plan
that's written down to motivate you to
go through it and as I said there's a
schedule module to help you create the
course plan so there's all the tools
that you need to help you with your
commitment and help you get through the
course this covers all the FAQ that I've
put together on the basis of what people
have submitted to me over the other
students as they've taken the course if
you have other questions of course you
can always submit them in the Q&amp;amp;A board
and I look forward to seeing you in the
course
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
