but you have no idea where to start on
what software to use don't worry you've
found the right video since I'm going to
show you exactly how to set up your iOS
development environment this will give
you startup in no time
Apple makes it incredibly easy for us to
develop for their platforms all you
really need is a Mac computer
and free software Xcode which can be
downloaded from the App Store for
developing anything we are using what is
called an IDE or integrated development
environment this software bundles
everything that we need to convert our
code into actual executable applications
and for iOS Mac OS watch OS and TV OS
this IDE is Xcode
in it we can perform our complete
development process so we can do all of
our code at all the assets such as
images sounds of files we can even
design user interfaces in an intuitive
visual editor and we can then finally
compile and build our app so that we are
able to install it on an actual device
and we can then even publish it on the
App Store so in this small serious we
want to show you how to install Xcode
and how to get started with the software
since especially for beginners it can
look quite intimidating at first but it
really doesn't have to be so let's begin
by downloading and installing Xcode on
your Mac computer open up the app store
you can either find the program by
looking into the apps made by Apple
category or we can just type in Xcode in
the search field up here the first entry
that pops up should then be Xcode by
Apple if we click on it we can then
proceed to download and install the
software since on my computer it is
already installed it just says open for
you it should be download or install
since Xcode is quite a large program
depending on your internet connection it
can take a while to download after the
download finishes the software will
automatically be installed so that we
can start to take a look at what it has
to offer
I will now begin by opening up Xcode so
that we can take a look at what we can
do with it if you do it for the first
time you should be presented with this
welcome to Xcode window which will give
us some options that we can choose from
if for any reason the window is not what
you see you can always open it up
manually by selecting window and welcome
to Xcode from the toolbar we have three
different options to choose from the
first one is get started with a
playground which will create a file
where we can then write simple code that
will then instantaneously be executed so
that we can see it this makes it a great
tool for when you are just starting out
and you just want to play around a bit
in Swift the next option is creating a
new Xcode project an Xcode project
consists of multiple files as well as
resources which can then later be
compiled into an actual application for
iPhone iPad Mac Apple watch or even
Apple TV the last option is called clone
an existing project and it will only be
needed if you're working on projects
from repositories such as git but we can
clone pull and commit different versions
of our project which is necessary
whenever multiple people are working on
a project for now I'm going to select
the first option and thereby create a
new playground file we then get this
pop-up window which enables us to choose
from four different templates for our
playground
blank game map and single view we're
going to go with the blank template
which will give us an empty playground
file with little to no boilerplate code
already implemented boilerplate code for
those of you that aren't familiar with
this term means code that is
automatically generated for us so let's
click Next and we can then choose where
we want to save our new file we can
obviously choose a name for our file but
I'm just going to leave it as my
playground which is the name it has by
default if I then hit create the file
gets created and this is what we get on
the left side we can see three lines of
code which will then be automatically
executed and run in the right column we
will be able to see the output of this
code instantly this makes playground a
really helpful tool especially for
beginners who are interested in iOS or
Mike OS development since it enables us
to write code and get output without
having to worry about focus on project
structures dependencies provisioning and
such when you first load a playground it
might take a few moments until the
compiler as well as the simulator which
are responsible for the output have
launched in the background but sooner or
later
we should be able to see the output in
the right column in this default file I
can see the output hello playground
which is exactly the value that we
defined in the left column so if I
change this by maybe replacing
playground with world the output will
automatically be updated without me
having to save compile or run anything
so that it now also says hello world in
the right column the plague
is a fantastic tool for anyone starting
to code in Swift because it allows you
to learn language by writing and
experimenting with it after getting to
know the playground we're now going to
create an actual Xcode project to do so
we will any welcome to Xcode window
select the second option which is create
a new Xcode project after selecting this
will get another pop-up window showing
us a lot of different options since an
Xcode project can actually be a lot of
things so right at the top we can
differentiate between iOS watch o s TV
OS Mac OS and cross-platform apps for
now I will just stick with iOS or we
then have multiple templates to choose
from we can develop frameworks or
libraries which are not standalone
applications but encapsulated
functionality to be used and reused in
multiple projects at the top we have the
section where it says application
containing different templates for iOS
apps there are some that are very
specific like for example augmented
reality apps sticker pack apps or
iMessage apps which for example can only
be run within the iMessage app just like
sticker packs aren't standalone but can
be used within other applications the
most basic template is the first one
called
single view app which will create a
template for an application that only
has one you to begin with so I will
choose a single view app and then click
on next before selecting where to save
the project I will have to add some more
information to it beginning with a
product name which is the name of our
new app itself I'll just call it my
first
for the drop-down team I have my name
Timothy Meixner select it since it is
our developer account yours would
obviously be something else
alternatively you can create a project
without a team assigned to it
the organization name can be chosen by
you and ours is room Academy the
organization identifier can also be
whatever you like but it is recommended
to use this reverse domain style
starting with com dot followed by the
identifier of your choosing the language
can either be swift or objective-c swift
being the new programming language of
Apple which is already widely used and
great for beginners but we could
obviously still use objective-c in Xcode
which was the official language before
Swift but for now let's just leave it at
Swift we don't need to worry about you
three other checkboxes below and can
just click Next we are now choosing
where to save our project and a click on
create will finally create our project
as soon as it finishes loading we can
see our new app template and what's
great about this is that as we can see
in the left column here already have a
bunch of files in our project there are
some Swift files containing code we have
a main node storyboard file which
contains a visual editor to work on the
graphical user interface of our app and
a few more files what this means is that
even though we didn't actually work on
as a by ourselves yet we already have an
application that can be run and executed
we do not need to start from scratch
since the most fundamental parts which
are required for an app to run are
already implemented so we can actually
run this application and see what we get
I can run an application in Xcode by
clicking the little play button in the
top left corner which will then run the
app that we have selected here so my
first app on the device currently
selected which as of now is the iPhone
10 but we can choose whichever simulator
we like if I then click on the play
button and take a look at the info bar
in the middle I can see that my app is
being compiled and after it compiled
successfully it will be launched in a
simulator if we do this the first time
it's going to take a few moments so
don't worry if it doesn't start
instantaneously but we'll need to start
up the simulator application which will
emulate iOS on your Mac computer as soon
as the simulator finishes loading it
will eventually run our app it
automatically started and were then
presented with a white screen which is
completely normal so don't worry we did
not add any content to our new app
that's why we can only see this white
screen what we can see is that the app
is being run and there are no errors or
problems displayed this means that we
already have a valid application that we
can run in iOS and on iOS devices even
our physical devices such as iPads and
iPhones if we own them obviously but we
of course want to develop more than just
an application showing us a white screen
so it's probably a good idea to add some
more content to a project so let's stop
the application by clicking the stop
button right next to play and it will
take us back to our Xcode project window
where we can then begin working on our
app let's talk about the different areas
of our Xcode project window the window
displays quite a lot of information so
we want to take a moment
take a closer look at what we got just
to make sure we know where everything is
we have five major areas a tuba right at
the top a navigation in the left column
the center of our screen contains the
most important part which is the editor
the right column displays utilities and
right at the bottom we can find a so
called debugger and now I want to give
you a bit of information about each one
of them let's start with the toolbar
which only contains a few but important
elements we do have the play and stop
buttons which we've already gotten to
know in the last video and which we can
use to stop and run our application
right next to it we can select which app
to run and the device we would like to
run it on we have a list of simulators
available for us to use with iPhones and
iPads but if we connect any iOS device
to the mat we will be able to choose set
device from the list as well we don't
even need a developer account anymore to
test apps on our devices the center
shows a info bar that displays which
processes currently are running in Xcode
all the way to our right we have the
three buttons that enable us to show a
high different areas of our project
window for example the Navigator on the
left side
the debug area at the bottom of our
screen and the utilities column on the
right side this can be really helpful
especially if you're working with a
MacBook and maybe don't have a large
screen to work on because it allows us
to hide certain areas that we aren't
currently using to give us more space
for the areas that we currently are
working on next let's take a look at the
Navigator which as the name suggests
contains the navigation of our project
it is further divided in different
sections with these symbols up here but
for now only three of them will actually
be important for us the first being the
one that is currently selected
which is the project navigator that
displays all the files contained in our
project these files have been
automatically created by the template
and each file we select here can then be
edited in our editor area the next
important section is the search which
enables us to search our entire project
this comes in very handy when working on
larger projects since it allows us to
quickly find stuff I could for example
type in a new controler
says I know that this is contained in my
project and as soon as I hit return I
get a list with results that I can then
select which will highlight them in the
editor the last important section of the
navigator is right next to the search
and it is called the issue navigator
this is where all errors and warnings
will be shown and we can then select
them to see what the actual problem is
the other parts of the navigator aren't
that important to begin with so I'll
move on to the editor area in the center
of the screen this is the area where we
can actually work on our files so if I
for example have my view controller dot
Swift file I am then able to edit this
code
I could for example add an output to my
console by writing print hello world
right here this is how I can develop my
code in Xcode but we can also edit non
code files in the editor if I for
example select the main dot storyboard
file we will get a different window this
sign containing a visual editor that
enables us to design all of you this
editor window is also one of the areas
where we can make good use of the
utility column to the right we have two
major parts in its column and inspector
at the top and right below a library if
I now have a storyboard file like this
one I can add different elements to it
from my library for example we can see
labels and buttons right here I can just
add them to my view using the
drag-and-drop method just like so if I
then have such a visual element in live
view I can use the top half of my
utility column in the inspector to
further manipulate it for the label I
could for example change its color to
blue it maybe increase the font size all
of this can be done without having to
write any code just by adjusting
settings in a visual interface the last
area we haven't talked about yet is the
debug area at the bottom which is really
only important when we are actually
running projects since it will show
debug information that is triggered by
events in our application such
information could be an error or just
like we've implemented in our view
controller that's West file a print
statement that write something to the
console
I will now run the app again and we
should now see two things we should have
a blue label on the screen which we
added an e visual editor and we should
see the output hello world in our
console in the debugger area as the app
starts we can see our blue label and if
we take a look at the bottom we'll see
the output hello world in a console
which is what we added earlier to the
code of our Swift file so everything
seems to be working as expected you will
find a PDF in the description of this
video with a sketch off to different
areas so then you always know what these
areas are called and where to look for
them if you enjoyed this video make sure
