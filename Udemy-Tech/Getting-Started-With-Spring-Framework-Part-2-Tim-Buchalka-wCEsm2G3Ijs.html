creating a database application using
the spring JDBC template now from a
configuration point of view firstly I'm
going to show you how to use pure XML
based configuration and then we'll move
on to use a mixture of annotation and
XML configurations and with the goal
being to reduce the usage of XML now the
application is going to perform crud
that is create update read and delete
operations with the database when we run
this application and we're going to
start off by taking the classic JDBC
approach using placeholders now shortly
you'll see what a placeholders actually
mean and in later videos we will move on
and perform the same crud operations and
actually more using the named parameter
JDBC template and that's where you'll be
introduced to the concept of named
parameters and named parameters is
actually an improvement over the classic
approach but that's going to come up in
future videos for now though let's
actually get going so at this point you
want to make sure that you've got your
my sequel service running on your
computer and you've also got the my
sequel workbench open because we're
going to be using that and from the
previous section in the course you want
to make sure that you've created the
operations table because we're going to
be using that all right so we're going
to start by creating a new project so
let's go into eclipse
file new select maven project then we
want to click on this create a simple
project skip archetype selection click
on next for group ID we're going to go
with com docked in Pachuca as we always
do for the artifact ID let's go for this
project with the name of spring with the
ID rather of spring JDBC - template
that's demo - one and the version we can
leave as default and in fact the rest of
the fields we can leave it default
values as well and let's click on finish
now we're going to be adding several
dependencies in this project and
we can select dependencies by using the
m2 Eclipse plug-in and that's where
we've clicked on the Add button in the
dependencies tab or we can simply search
the maven repository on the web now
there are problems with them to eclipse
we find sometimes so the best way in the
way that we'll pretty well work all the
time is to do a search on the internet
or using Google to find the dependency
we want so for a number of dependencies
that we haven't used in the course to
date we're actually going to search for
those on Google but some of the other
ones the spring beans spring context and
spring call we'll just grab those from
an existing project to save a bit of
time so let's open up the spring
component annotation demo project
because we want to grab those
dependencies so we're going to go and
open the pond an XML file then go into
the pond an XML tab and let's just copy
those dependencies so the ones we're
going to copy I just came to be the
spring Corps spring context and this
spring bean so I'm taking a copy of
those then I'm going to close that
project down it's good we don't need it
anymore and then we're going to go back
to our newly created project and then go
to the Palmdale XML for that and go to
the Palmdale XML tab and we need to
firstly we need to create a dependency
tab tag I should say so dependencies and
then we go to paste this in here like so
and this is probably a good time to have
a look at this updates available because
you will get this from time to time so
let's go through the process of updating
it just to see how it works and you can
come up here and click to review and
install update so if I click in that box
it'll pop up here and it gives you a
list of things that you can actually
update so you can go in there and you
can select and deselect specific things
I'm going to leave everything selected
and just click on next icon next again
I'm going to click on I accept the terms
of the agreement click on finish and
that will actually go ahead and update
all the software now if you do see that
it's so usually worthwhile going through
the update process because things are
updating usually in a good way because
new functionality is being added or bugs
are being fixed
so I suggest you do update so whenever
you get the opportunity I'm gonna pause
the video now let's come back once this
update is complete now incidentally if
you didn't want to wait for this you
click on the run in background option
down there down the bottom and that will
do literally that it'll run it in the
background so you can continue coding
but in this case I'm actually gonna let
the update complete before continuing
okay so you can see the update is now
completed and it's someone ting Eclipse
to be restarted so I'm gonna click on
yes to that and we'll click on yes to
save the changes we made just prior to
starting the update the clip should auto
restart if it doesn't for whatever
reason we can just come down and start
eclipse again and you notice this has
changed now to the updated version so
that will update to on a semi-regular
basis the people who build this Eclipse
product are updating it so I do again
suggest you take those updates as they
come through
okay so we're back now so let's just go
back and look at our palm dot xml tap
and if you recall we added the
dependency tag there then we just pasted
in those three dependencies from the
other spring project that when we opened
the spring component annotation demo
project so we need a few more
dependencies to be added blamele the my
sequel driver the commons dbcp which is
a connection pool library from apache
and also the spring JDBC so let's go
ahead and grab the three of those and
we're going to do it as I mentioned in a
different way by searching for Google
and copying the dependencies that till
we find on the website rather than using
the m2 Eclipse all right so let's start
by looking for the my sequel driver the
connector so in Google will search for
my sequel connector maven and I started
typing repository and notice that to
autocomplete comes up that's obviously a
link that lots of people search for and
click on this first link in the mvn
repository website and that'll take us
to the connector then you want to choose
the very latest version you can see that
we've got a version released in February
2017 so click on that one which is 6
point 0.6 and we're going to click by
default it'll select everything but we
just want to copy just the dependency
component only I'm going to copy that
go back to eclipse then we're just going
to paste it prior to the end of the
dependencies tag there and we'll worry
about reformatting this document once
we've done all three so that's the my
sequel one the next one we want is the
Commons dbcp
dependency so we'll go back to Google
for that then we can do another search
this time for Commons - dbcp maven
repository that one there we'll do same
do were there we're going to click on
the first link we're going to grab the
latest version this case 1.4 and you can
see that it's relatively old February
2010 and note if there are other
versions here that are later but notice
that they're for specific types like for
example one point for Red Hat one point
for dbcp 330 that's obviously something
separate so my suggestion is good to
grab the one point for just the sort of
raw version and not anything that's
specific to a particular operating
system etc so click on one point for
same do there I'm going to just copy
just the dependency part and back to
eclipse paste that in and that leaves us
one more to do now so back to Google
again this is the spring JDBC related
dependency so we'll do a search for
spring JDBC maven repository search will
click on the link and with this point if
you recall we talked about this in a
previous video these versions here are
milestone releases they're not actually
due to be formally released at this
point in time and are more or less test
versions so we wouldn't be grabbing
those we'll grab whatever the latest
release is here and you can see we've
got a four point three point seven it's
being the latest release so I'm going to
click on that and I'm going to grab the
dependency information for those copy
that and go back to my Eclipse project
and we're going to paste it in now
noting there that the or glut Spring
Framework this is at the four point
three point seven release and these ones
that we've got here relate to an older
release so it probably wouldn't hurt to
update those and to be using the latest
releases of those as well so we can
actually do a search for that if we
wanted to just to check that so we could
do a spring context
and you can see 4.37 is the latest
release for that as well so we can
reasonably assume that all of those will
be at the latest release now so let's go
ahead and change those all to four point
three point seven or whatever the latest
version was that you found when you did
the spring JDBC dependency so basically
want to make sure that they're all the
same so it will probably work if you
look that as is but it's a good idea to
make sure that they're all the same
version so I'm gonna go ahead and make
those all four point three point seven
at this point now we've got all the
dependencies that we need added so I'm
going to just come up to the source and
I'm just going to do a cleanup document
you just do a format as well either one
of those work and we've got the format
we've got it nicely formatted now so I'm
going to save that and the other thing
we can should do now is just go back to
our project click on the spring demo
this spring JDBC template demo right
click on maven click on update project
click on OK it will be able to check you
little bit later to make sure that it's
built and it's downloaded the right
components all right so we're now
getting to the stage where we're going
to start our working with my sequel so
what we need to do first is create an
organization class that to works with
the organization table that we created
in the last section when we were
introduced to the my sequel workbench
and if we just go and open the my circle
workbench which I've got open I'm just
going to click into there well let's
just go and have a quick look at that
table and you can actually open open it
and click on select rows there's the
data that we selected we've got those
fields air ID company name even
corporation postal code employee count
and slogan so that's what we're going to
be doing is creating a much leaner
organization beam for our spring
application much leaner compared to the
previous version about the organization
beam have used in earlier videos we're
actually only gonna have the fields
these variables in other words they
correspond to whether the columns in
this table
and then we're going to have getters and
setters as well so let's go back to
eclipse and let's go and create that
class so I'm going to open this source
main Java and then I'm going to click
and create a package new package for the
name let's go with com2 machaca dot
spring demo dr. main let's create our
organization object in there so
right-click it new class and it's going
to be organization and as I mentioned
we're going to have the fields and
getters and setters so the fields are
going to be private int ID private
string company name private int let's
live a year of Incorporation private
string postal code Provident employee
count and private strings slogan and
let's create our getters and setters
right click click on source generate
getters and setters I'm going to slick
select select all make sure the
insertion point is after slogan and
click OK
there's our organization class and again
the idea of this is we're mapping it
effectively to the organization table in
my sequel
let's talk about the DAO pattern so Dao
stands for data access object and
actually is a design pattern
so the Dao pattern is in the industry a
widely accepted mechanism to abstract
away the details of persistence in an
application the idea here is that
instead of having the domain logic
communicate directly with the database
the file system the web service or
whatever persistence mechanism your
replication uses instead the domain
logic speaks to a Dao layer instead then
this said Dao layer then communicates
with the underlying persistence system
or service
there is an image that depicts the DAO
layer and that's the one in the middle
with the red outline direct angle and
you can see the application layers on
the left-hand side with the blue
rectangle and then the database layer on
the right with the green rectangle so
you can see that the application
business logic talks to the dao
interface implementation basically the
dao layer and it then communicates via
JDBC to the database so it's abstracting
away the need for you to write that code
directly yourself
all right so let's now go back and start
working on implementing this pattern in
our code all right so let's finish the
video here in the next one we're going
to move on and start having a bit of a
discussion about the data access object
or Dao design pattern we're going to be
using that in this application so I'll
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
