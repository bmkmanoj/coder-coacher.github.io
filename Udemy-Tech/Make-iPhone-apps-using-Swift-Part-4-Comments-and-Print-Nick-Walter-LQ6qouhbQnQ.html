want to learn how to make a nap my name
is Nick and I'm gonna teach you
everything you need to get started in
this lecture we're gonna be learning
about comments in print so let's go
ahead and start with comments first so
comments are way for you to write some
information inside your code that won't
actually get run as code it's just kind
of a way for you to leave a note to
yourself or maybe for someone else
that's working with your code let me go
ahead and show you an example I think
you'll understand more so I'm gonna
bring up an old example that we had of
the wallet so let's go ahead and say
I've got a variable called wallet do I'm
gonna set it equal to 14 which was you
know how much is in my wallet right now
now with this wallet you know let's say
it changes over time for example I go to
7-eleven and I buy some of that greasy
old pizza that's been under the light
for like five hours and I buy a big gulp
that cost like six bucks so now my
wallet is down to like ten bucks or
something like that then you know what
all sudden I just finished mate building
an app for my friend he promised that
he'd pay me a hundred bucks for it
woohoo so now all a sudden my wallet is
equal to like a hundred and ten bucks
right and then I say you know what with
this newfound money I'm gonna go and buy
a fidget spinner yeah I'm one of those
fidget spinner crazy guys so all sudden
you know that cost five bucks so now my
wallet has a hundred and five dollars in
it so I sort of this story behind what's
happened with my wallet as I move step
by step but when you look at the code
here you don't really know what happened
it's just like well he lost four bucks
then he got a hundred bucks and then he
lost five bucks and you're like you
don't really know but with comments we
can tell that story so to make a comment
all you do in Swift is you do two
forward slashes just like this and
you'll see it should turn anything it
should turn to green you'll see as we
type here but anything you type after
these two forward spaces will not get
run as code so I could literally just
type some gibberish inside of here and
it's totally fine this is okay now
you'll notice if I didn't have these
comments here it's gonna totally mess up
the playground because it's like trying
to make sense of like what is this some
variable name or something and like what
I don't know what this stuff is it
doesn't say variable is not a variable
name like gets very confused but you put
those two forward slashes in there it
says this is a comment this is just for
you the developer some information that
you're trying to read so that's what you
happen so if we apply this to what we
have here I could put a comment here
that says starting value of my wallet
okay and then when I go here and I you
know go buy the food at 7-eleven I can
say got food at 7-eleven I could also
say here I got paid for making an app
woohoo there we go oh I kind of like the
woohoo with the zero I didn't mean to do
that but it looks kind of cool and then
finally I can say I bought a fidget
spinner this is the weirdest example but
you can see now with these comments it
kind of tells a story about what's
happened inside of the code here so most
likely you're not going to be providing
this detailed of an explanation of
what's happening where you know of
variables changing over time and this is
kind of a silly example of you know just
changing this variable value but I
wanted you to see how comments work
typically I use comments most of my code
when if I'm trying to do something
really complex it's like okay first I've
you know step one I've got to make this
thing work and then like you know step
two do that other thing whatever it is
like then I just sort of write out what
it is I'm gonna do and then I'll type
the code for the you know that step one
here and then step two after that it's
just kind of an organ of the
organizational thing the other thing is
if you want other people to be able to
understand your code if you're working
with multiple people on a project it's
good to leave comments every once in a
while so they know what's happening
they're not required by any means but I
just want you to know that what comments
are and how to use them and one last
thing about comments these are called
single line comments if you want to make
a multi-line comment you can do a
forward slash star and then below if you
do star
another forward slash everything that's
in between these two things turns into a
comment so I could say hello my name is
Nick or something like this and you can
see all of this is in green all of these
are comments as soon as I get rid of
these all sudden you know we're gonna
get into some issues because this isn't
valid code but I typically I see the
multi-line comment used for if you're
trying to actually remove some code for
a second so for example let's say I
didn't want to see you know these
transactions happen down here what I
could do is I could do a slash star and
then a star slash by here and then it's
as if this code where I say while it's
equal to ten in equal to 110
equal to 105 it just doesn't happen
because if it's a comment it doesn't get
run as code so you can see the only line
of quote/unquote real code here is the
one when I say Wallet is equal to 14
okay so those are comments the next
thing that we're going to learn is how
to print some information so I was so
confused when I was first learning how
to program because when I heard the term
print I'm like print a piece of paper
right like I think when people hear
print that's what you think
and so people are saying oh in this
programming language really easy to
print something like hello world that's
a really common example that you see but
printing just means that you're gonna
display some text in something called
the console so whenever you're printing
something you're just having it show up
and the console is this thing down here
is this white space you can get it to
show or hide by hitting this button so
to print something it's really just as
simple as saying print you've got a
spell print right PR int and then you
have the two parentheses here and then
you have to put something inside of the
print that you want to show up inside
the console so you could put a string
inside of here like I could say hello
there
exclamation point and I'll send down
here in the console it hasn't updated
there we go it says hello there and I
could print out a number for example if
I do like the number seven it'll go
ahead and spit out that number seven
down there in the console now in the
playground it doesn't really make that
much sense because you can see you know
the values of things over here
the right-hand side so it's more for
when you're making apps and you'll see
as we move through the class win this
makes sense and why you would use it the
other thing that you can pass into this
print here is you could put variables so
for example this wallet if I put wallet
right in there so I say print wallet
it's gonna say whatever it's inside of
wallet right now it's going to print it
so something that's kind of cool here is
you can see okay when I print wallet
here it's 105 but if I put print after
each line of the wallet stuff it'll
print out you know where wallet is at
all those different times so when I do
this you can see it prints out 14 and
then it prints out 10 and then it prints
out 110 and 105 like all the different
times when it updates if I get rid of
this one you know it won't show when it
changed to 10 at least it shouldn't
let's see if it updates there we go now
it's just you know 14 110 105 so like I
said you won't see print used all that
much here in the playground but as we
make an app you will definitely see that
so the exciting news is with these two
pieces of information we are ready to
move on to start working with an Xcode
project we're gonna take these few
things that we've learned and already
start using them towards an app but
before we get there I have a quick
little challenge for you I want you to
make both a comment and a print so what
I'd like you to do is make a I'm gonna
bring that back just in case you wanted
to reference this I want you to make a
comment about what the weather is like
today and then I want you to print out
what you think the weather will be
tomorrow so again kind of simple example
here but first make a comment of what
the weather is like today and then what
you think what the weather will be
tomorrow
go ahead and hit pause and do that now
okay so if you unpause this I assume you
went ahead and did your challenge so the
first one was to make a comment about
what the weather is like today so I'm
gonna simply say today has been very
sunny no clouds exclamation point now
I'm gonna make a print statement of what
I think it's gonna be tomorrow
weather-wise so I'm gonna say print
thunderstorms and dual
it's probably not gonna be that but I
just want to spice things up a little
bit
there we go and I didn't spell
thunderstorms right but whatever kind of
a simple example here this was making a
comment in a print and that was probably
a good time to end there because Xcode
decided to crash on me so in the next
lecture we're gonna open up our project
and start adding some code there hey
thanks for watching what are you going
to make leave a comment below and let me
know and if you want to learn even more
I have a full 16 our iOS course that I
created just for beginners where I'll
show you how to make a ton of different
apps including a snapchat clone a
Pokemon go clone and the talk boy it's
usually 200 bucks but if you use the
link below you'll get a YouTube
