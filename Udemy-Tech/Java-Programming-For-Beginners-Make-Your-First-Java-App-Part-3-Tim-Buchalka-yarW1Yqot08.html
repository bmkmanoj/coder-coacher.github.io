is use the hello world application that
we created in the last section so I'm
just going to click in here in IntelliJ
and open that up and we're going to make
some changes so I'm going to do is make
a bit more room on the screen so we can
see what we're doing I'm going to get
rid of the project the project section
because we don't need that and also I'm
going to run at once by clicking on the
little green arrow if she saw me click
and I got to make sure we've got some
space here so we can see what we're
doing so we're going to be typing
commands on the left hand side and on
the right hand side we're going to be
able to see what the results of running
those commands are so if your system is
compacted like this this is a feature of
IntelliJ and if there's only one
statement it does what's called code
folding and it puts it all onto the one
line so what you need to do is just
click into somewhere in there in this
case I'm clicking just before the word
system and I'm going to press Enter or
return on my computer and I've never got
space to start typing my commands so
let's start talking about variables now
a variable is something that makes a
computer program very useful so what is
a variable well a variable is a place in
memory you think about like a box if you
will that you can store something in and
the computer allows you to have hundreds
or thousands of boxes each containing
their own pieces of information so what
we do with our variable that's what it's
called in Java that box is called a
variable and what we can do is we can
assign the type of information that we
want to put into the boxes and we can
also give it a name so why would we want
to use variables well the reason that we
want to use them is because they make a
program really useful if for example if
there's a computer program that you
wanted to create that helped calculate
someone's current age based on the date
and of course you'd need to enter in
their birthday and the computer would
need to store that somewhere it's ok
then calculate how old that person was
without the ability to store something
the computer wouldn't be able to process
anything and the programs that create
would be very very basic and not really
useful so a variable is used for that
purpose
to store information now as we move
forward with the course we'll be talking
about lots of different types of data
but we're going to start off with a
really basic one that's included in Java
and it's called the int which is short
for an integer so an integer in math
terms is a whole number without any
decimal points and it's the same thing
in Java so what we need to do is we want
to use variables we need to define the
what's called the data type then we need
to assign a name to it and optionally we
need to also define a value to it so
we're going to do is I'm going to go to
the end of the line and press Enter
I'm going to assign a new variable and
I'm going to type int all in lowercase
int space and we're going to call it my
first number and put equals 5 and then
I'm going to put a semicolon on the end
of it then once you do that Java know
set everything on that line is something
that it needs to process and figure out
what you mean so the first part of that
line I'll just make a bit more space
here first part here int that's what's
called the data type so we're telling
Java please assign a box or an area in
memory to be more precise that we'll be
able to store an integer an int number
and I'm going to call that box or that
memory location my first number and then
by using the equals and a number on the
end what I'm doing is I'm saying and I
want you to assign the value of five
toward now the good thing about a
variable is that so because it's because
of its very nature it can be changed so
we can assign a number to it and then we
can assign another number to it down the
track and we can continually change it
but what we've done with this first line
is we've said at the moment I want you
to assign the value five to our integer
which has got the name my first number
and Java is quite happily assigned that
and what we can do is we can then print
that out if we want to just to confirm
that that area that my first number
contains the right amount I can type
system capital s system you know Sam I
made a mistake IntelliJ is following
along and
options below what I'm typing couldn't
find what I meant so that's a good
indication that I typed something wrong
I'm gonna press backspace and type
system dot out dot print Ln
now that's one way of doing it I could
have gone Auto all that entire line like
that but there is actually abbreviation
intellij if I type in s o UT and you can
see what's happened there this is cut
this is actually a template that's built
into IntelliJ and that's an abbreviation
so if I now press the tab key IntelliJ
will print the whole line out for me
which is very nice so you can see in the
first print line at the very top where
it's got hello Tim that showed that
actually outputted to the right-hand
side
hallo Tim what would we need to type in
this box where the cursor is in the two
brackets in between the brackets to
print out my first number so pause the
video here and see if you can figure out
how to get the system to print that
first number come back and press play
once you've done that and does see what
the solution was so how did you go did
you figure it out well to actually get
it to print something we need to type in
the name of the variable and we're
saying to Java this is the box if you
will know this is the variable that I
want you to print the contents from so
in this case I just type in my first
number and I can just press ENTER if I
can see that the selection that IntelliJ
is showing me is enough then press ENTER
and you can see that's accepted that
there's no errors and I can click on
over here to the green arrow to run so
you can see what's happened now is Java
has printed the first statement that the
hello Tim which was from a previous
video when we made that change but it's
also printed the number 5 so that line
system dot out dot print line my first
number he didn't actually print the text
my first number but rather what happened
was because we put my first number there
so Java knew that that was a variable
and it went in and figured out and had a
look at what is in that memory location
or what was in that box if you will what
was the value of that variable and it
printed out the value not the name so if
we went back then I made a change and
made the value 10 there and run the
program again
we actually get the valley 10 so each
time we use that we assign that
statement if you will
Java is automatically looking at the
variable name and looking into the area
of memory that contains the value and
printing out the value now we're not
limited to just putting a number like
that we can actually put a mathematical
expression there for example we could
put 10 and you use plus the plus sign
and say 5 and you can probably guess
what that answer is going to be you will
run it the answer is 15 and that's
because Java looked at that the
expression 10 plus 5 is 0 well that's 15
he'd put 15 into the variable and save
that into that memory location now these
mathematical processes can get quite
complex they're literally like a
scientific calculator which we can
introduce brackets if you want to do we
can put 10 plus 5 plus 2 2 times 10 so
in theory that should be 10 plus 5 is 15
plus 2 times 10 is 20 so it should be 15
plus 20 so our answer should be 35 when
we run it and you can see that the
answer we're showing is 35 now what do
you think would happen if I copy this
line they're going to copy that entire
line I'm going to paste it what will
happen if I do this so what I've done is
I've taken the variable name of my first
number but I've surrounded it in double
quotes and the hint there is that it
changed to green you know it's much like
the first to print line with the hello
Tim it changed a green what do you think
will happen in there do you think it'll
print out the number 35 or will it print
out my first number let's run it and see
what will happen and you can see what's
happened there is because we've
specified at double quotes we've told
Java this is not a variable this is
actually a string and we want you to
print whatever is in there and not to
try and decipher that SMS
a variable but just to print it out as
it was so this case literally all it did
was printed whatever was in the double
quotes so generally speaking if you see
something in double quotes that's not a
variable that's going to be treated by
the computer as just a string as
literally whatever you want to type and
they're not going to put something else
in there my second number which
obviously we haven't got a variable
called my second number we could run
that and it just prints out my second
number because there's no relationship
to the variable there and what we're
typing in double quotes so let's go
ahead and create a second variable I'm
going to call it int my second number
equals whoops number equals 12 and I'm
gonna put int my third number equals 6
we're going to delete that second line
there and then I'm going to put int my
total equals I can put my first number
plus my second number plus my third
number so what's going to happen there
is the computer comes along and assigns
that my first number the value in this
case 35 my second number is assigned the
value of 12 and my third number is
assigned the value of 6 and my total is
in assigned the value of the first
number which was 35 second number which
is 12 third number which is 6 so if we
then go to print out my third number
then I'm just going to copy and paste
that we should get the value of 35 for
that line plus 12 is 47 plus 6 is 53 so
let's run that and why did it come up
with 6 well that's because I actually
printed out my third number which is the
valid 6 and not my total and this is
another good thing that intellij will
come up and tell you is if you see a
variable that's grayed out like that and
if you just hover your mouse over it it
actually gives you a hint and says well
if my total is
never used like so and it says that
variable my total is never used in other
words the computer was smart enough to
figure out that okay you've set up this
variable but it hasn't been used
anywhere so if I then go ahead and copy
that and paste that into the line to
print out that is it Grady more up till
it because the IntelliJ has quite
correctly figured out okay you're now
using that so now if we run this we
should get the value of 53 so as you can
see it can be really quite complex
one last thing I'm going to do is change
this a little bit you can even do
something like my third number equals my
first number times two so therefore the
value would be 50 thirty-five for the
first line 12 for the second line but
then my third number is the first lines
value which was we started was 35 times
two so that line would be 70 so it would
be 35 plus 12 is 47 plus 70 is 117 so if
we now run this we should get the value
of 117 and you can see we've got a value
of 117 so let's end with a challenge so
how would you define a new variable that
has a difference between a thousand and
the current value of my total so in
other words how would you assign that
variable that it figured out that
whatever the total was whatever the
value in my turner was to take that from
a thousand and to show the value from
that and then to print that out on the
screen go ahead and do that pause the
video here and then come back when
you're ready and we'll have a look at
the solution so how did you go did you
figure it out well to actually do that
we can type a new variable we can type
int my last one equals and it's simply a
matter of putting a thousand take my
total so that will then look at the
number 1000 deduct from it my total and
leave us a value which in this case
should be the difference between a
thousand and one hundred and seventeen
which is 883 if my math is correct so
what we can do is we can actually change
this now
paste that in there and if we run that
will actually run up there we go that's
the value of 883 now just a note before
I finish this video case sensitivity is
very important here now I actually made
a type of there generally speaking when
you're creating new Java variables they
should start with a lowercase M now the
point I want to show you here is by
changing their variable name to what it
should be which is starting with a
lowercase number Yunel get an error and
that's because if we type it in
uppercase and that's because Java is
case-sensitive when it comes to top of
your commands so it's very much a common
source of problems when you're learning
in your language is to get the syntax
wrong in other words the type of word
wrong but also do not type it in the
right case so as you can see there
because I changed this to a lowercase M
now from a human perspective that's so I
believe said ok well isn't that the same
thing because it's clearly it says my
last one no it's not the same thing as
far as the computer is concerned because
the M here is an uppercase M and that's
a lowercase M so anything ever can
change that to allocate m and by doing
that that fixes the error so do make
sure you check that out so it's a very
common cause of errors and if you see
something highlighted like that in red
that's usually a good indication that
there's an arrow if you're typing and
you can hover your mouse over it and it
will usually tell you what the error is
this case cannot resolve symbol my last
one what that is saying is it cannot
find a simple or actually a variable in
this case called my last one I'll change
it to lowercase M it now matches the
variable name that I've assigned on the
previous line and it will work so that's
the integer data type we've now learned
the basics about that in the next video
we're going to start looking at some
other data types and how to mix and
match those and take our results to the
next level so I'll see you in that next
