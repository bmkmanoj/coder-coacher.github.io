of the HTML CSS JavaScript crash course
this is where the crash part comes in
we're gonna stumble through some
JavaScript JavaScript is a much larger
topic than things like HTML and CSS and
as you saw in the last CSS video I had
to skip through many things and just
tell you not to worry about them just
copy this just to focus on the key
points that's gonna happen in this video
but worse because there's a lot to talk
about and I had a choice do I show you
the very very basics and leave you with
no end results or do I show you
something a bit more intermediate and
maybe breeze through some of the syntax
or explanation in order to make
something and I decided because this is
a short format it's YouTube I wanted to
make something that makes you feel good
at the end we are going to do the latter
we're gonna make a project and that
means that some of this is gonna go
really quickly that's okay because the
point is to just expose you to
JavaScript have you feel comfortable
with the idea of what JavaScript does
what it brings to the table
compared to HTML and CSS remember hTML
is the structure CSS is the style
JavaScript is a whole bunch of things
it's the interactivity it's the
reloading of new data
it's the sending of HTTP requests it's
what allows you to make games I could go
on and on there's just a lot but we're
gonna focus on getting this button to do
something to do this to switch the
source of the image tag so this is
actually a really common pattern in
JavaScript what we do is we work with
HTML elements just like we did with CSS
we select elements based off of a name
or something like an ID and then we
style them with JavaScript we're going
to select elements like the button and
I'm going to write code that specifies
when this particular button is clicked
do something and that something is going
to be to take this image tag so we're
also going to need to select the image
using JavaScript and we're going to
update this source we're going to change
this from kiddie bed to maybe
kitty door or Kitty laptop one of these
photos okay
so I've opened the file up it's called a
pas and there's already a little code in
here for you first before we talked
about that this is how you write a
JavaScript comment so you could add any
notes you want typing two slashes it's
the easiest comments out of HTML CSS and
JavaScript in my opinion you can also
use command slash as always type a
little note and you can toggle it on and
off with command or control slash okay
so what I've given you here I just
didn't want you to have to type this
yourself it's a list of the image titles
of the URLs so we have this first one
images slash kitty bed jpg this is a
list of all the other ones all six and
the approach we're going to take we're
going to run code that every time you
click the button we're starting with
this image URL we're going to keep track
of where we are and then we're going to
add one and move forward to this one and
update the image to this URL then you
click the button again and we'll update
to this one and we'll keep moving until
we at the end in which case we'll have
to wrap back around but we'll handle
we'll get there so this is our first bit
of syntax this is what's known as a
variable so it is a list of data it's
called an array that's what these
brackets mean but don't get too caught
up and we're storing it under the name
pics this is up to us we could call this
images I could spell you could call this
my cat stuff it really doesn't matter
but we have to refer back to it later
and if you're following along pics will
be the easiest and this VAR keyword just
means that this is a variable and a
variable just means that I can refer to
it later and have access to this
information so there's a lot I know
let's begin by selecting the button so
that when I click it I can do something
and I'm going to show you some code here
it looks like this document dot query
selector and then I'm going to pass in
button what this code will do is it's
going to go search the document HTML
document and it's going to look for the
first instance of button I could also do
query selector
which will find all buttons but we only
have one so it doesn't matter query
selector button and it's gonna go find
the button kind of like what CSS does
here except we're going to store it in a
variable and I'll just call it BTN again
up to you name that something that
you'll remember I mean it's in the same
file so shouldn't be hard and a lot of
my semicolons which are not
deal-breakers as much as they are in CSS
you need them there but that's for
another video what this has done now is
I've gone and selected the button and
then I've saved it to a variable called
BTN but there's a problem just like in
the last video just typing code in here
doesn't do anything unless I link to it
over here that are not connected I'm
going to connect them now and to do that
I'm going to show you another tag called
the script tag so I'm going to type
scripts and then hit tab and I'm going
to put it at the bottom of the body and
the reason for that is that our script
is going to rely on data on elements
that are defined earlier we need to
reference the button tag and if I put
this before the button tag the code is
going to run before the button exists so
we put it at the bottom and I need to
add in a source attribute that says app
J s that's the name of our file over
here so if we have more than one script
put whatever file you want there just
like with our CSS we could have two
style sheets one called app two dot CSS
so we put this here and if we want to
make sure that it's working at the very
beginning we can type alert hello from
fjs alert is a really annoying little
bit of code what's known as a function
and it's just built into your browser it
will make a little pop up you may have
seen these before on particularly scummy
websites they'll use alert sometimes so
if we save and reload our page we should
be able to tell that it's working if we
get that pop-up and there we go
this page says hello from a PJs so of
course that's not what our end goal is
our end goal is this so let's start by
we've selected that button
now how do we know when it's clicked
this is some other JavaScript syntax
that's gonna potentially be very scary
I'm going to type BTN the button we
selected and saved we captured it in a
little variable with this name
BTN add event listener so javascript is
very center centered around events that
happen on your page when you click on
something when you hover over something
when you type a letter
there's tons of events that are
happening all the time and we can take
JavaScript and listen for those events
and do something and we're going to
listen for a click on that button so
that's not the only type of event that
we could listen for but that's what we
care about when you click on this so
we've selected it over here now I want
to run something when we click and this
is the other scary part function
parentheses curly braces and then I'm
going to hit enter and add a semicolon
at the end all but I'll say about that
little piece of beautiful code this is
one of the hardest things about learning
JavaScript is some of the syntax is very
ugly compared to some other languages
what I type inside of these brackets
will run whenever this button is clicked
basically says add an event listener to
this thing for when a click happens when
it does happen run this code and let's
just start by alerting clicked and I'm
going to get rid of this annoying alert
up top so now we should only see alert
if we click on the button moment of
truth if we refresh nothing should
change I'm gonna click and there we go
so we now are listening for click and
running code whenever we click that
button all we have left to do which it's
still a good amount is change the source
of this image when it's clicked on okay
so let's start by just identifying how
we even find the source of that image
and to do that we have to follow the
same process of selecting the image
first so I'm gonna make a new variable
called IMG again up to you to use a good
name that makes sense
and I'm going to set it equal to
document query selector and what am I
going to select
I want to select the image tag to select
the button I used button the name of the
tag to select the image I use image the
name of the tag just like that I know
I'm moving really fast I just want to be
here to support you it's okay if this is
crazy to you just play along and try and
focus on these high overall ideas we
select something and then we do
something when we clicked on it but now
we're gonna focus on the image and we
want to change the source before we
change it let's just let me just show
you how you actually access the source
so we have this thing called IMG we can
do dot source dot SRC which should be
this images slash kiddie bed jpg and if
I just do this on its own it's basically
going to access it's gonna ask what is
the source and then just disappear into
the darkness it's never going to show up
anywhere we're not printing it so let's
alert that and this is really just the
intermediate step for us to understand
what happens this won't this is not
something we're going to keep in the
final result but if i refresh now and I
click there we go this is what's alerted
that's the source what we want to do is
now update that source and we could
start by just picking any of these let's
do Kitty in the sink just copy one URL
totally up to you and we're going to
change IMG source to equal that URL so
this will only work one time you click
on the beginning it will be kitty bed
and then we change it to this but then
every time you click after that it's
going to keep changing it to this so
again it's just an intermediate step but
now it should change to this photo oh my
gosh
massive photo let's test it
refresh click and it changes but now
every other time it is changing but it's
just changing to the same source over
and over the code still runs though so
here's the biggest challenge at this
point I have to explain to you how we
access data out of these arrays this is
an array
where there's all of these pieces of
data in a list there in a row and
there's an order the way we access
things is using the variable name picks
and then square brackets and a number
each one of these has a number that
corresponds to it this one starts at 0
and then this is one just to I'm not
typing real code all the way up to 5 so
to access let's change the let's go to
Kitty basket down here instead I'm gonna
have to get rid of those numbers maybe
I'll put them over here as comments
there we go so to change it to this URL
I could access picks one and I'm going
to do that and delete that and just
change to picks one and now if i refresh
the page and click it goes to picks one
which is kitty in the basket looking
extra grumpy now what we need to do is
have this number change we want to start
at 1 or 0 and then go to 1 and then next
time you click it should go to 2 and
then go to 3 and to 4 into 5 to do that
we're going to need to make a variable
here instead of using 1 every time we're
gonna make a variable I'm just gonna
call it let's go with counter and let's
start it at 1 the reason I'm going to
start it at 1 is that Kitty bed is
already here so if I started at 0 the
first time we click it would change to
Kitty bed again and then it would change
to 1 into 2 right now it's not going to
change at all counter is always set to 1
so if I replace one with the word
counter you could fill in this value
here it's just saying all right change
the images source to the counter item
which is 1 in the pics array which is
this it's sort of like cross-checking
counter is 1 picks one gives us that
change this source and if I refreshed
and rerun the code nothing would change
because it's just going to have Kitty
basket but there's this one thing that
we're going to do now which is after we
change it we want to update counter and
I'm going to do this counter equals
counter
plus one so this says take a counter and
reset it update it to be the current
counter value plus one so the first time
through counter is one we do picks one
and then this line runs and this says
counter plus one which is two is the new
value for counter so then next time you
click it's now going to do pics of two
giving us this and then counter will be
updated to three so next time through
goes here and it keeps going until we
hit the end and we'll see what happens
so let's try refresh I'm gonna truth we
click it worked it worked again it works
again works again one more time now
we're at the end if I try oh no we get
this ugly little error I'm going to
refresh the page one more time and to
fully understand what's happening let's
go to inspect but change to the console
tab or you can use the shortcut command
option J or control option J in chrome
to open up what's known as a JavaScript
console and this allows us to inspect
and to figure out what's happening so if
I click that button again and I caused
that error after this I trigger it we
get this error message and you can see
that it's saying file not found because
it's trying to find an image called
slash undefined when we access I'm going
to move pics over I'm going to copy this
code and move it over here we start at
pics 1 then we went to pics 2 then 3 and
I'll just hurry up we go to pics 5
that's the last one
remember we count starting at 0 6 items
but 5 is the last number when I go to
pics 6 I get undefined so what it's
trying to do is change the source to
literally be the word undefined which is
not going to work for us undefined is a
special value in JavaScript that means
nothing was found nothing's there it
hasn't been set yet so undefined it's
not going to work what we want to do is
is
check alright is I equal to six then
reset it to zero if we hit the end
change it back to zero and that's easy
to change it to zero at least it's just
I equals zero but if I do this it will
always be zero every time through
instead we want to add some conditional
logic and the syntax looks like this
if counter triple equals the number six
which means we've gone too far right
that means we're at the very end if
that's the case we're going to change it
back to zero and we use these curly
braces again and reset counter equals
zero so this code only runs when counter
is exactly six so it starts at one this
when we click is not true so then this
code runs and it moves it up to two
counters to this it goes again this is
not true because counter is two which is
not equal to six keep going until
finally we get to the last image we
change the source we update counter to
be plus one meaning six then next time
you click instead of trying to do image
that source equals pics of six this
catches it if counter equals six should
be zero now and let's see if it works
refresh the page I'm gonna truth again
let's go to that last little photo with
think it's called kiddie wall and there
we go
we loop back through so we're going and
going and going until we hit the end we
check have we gone too far start over
and that's it that's the bulk of our
logic that's really it total we've
written everything that we set out to do
I know the entire crash course was a car
crash of a course but this video in
particular was very quick very fast
paced I think I know I spent a lot of
time trying to reassure you that's okay
but really if you are new to programming
you're new to JavaScript this has to be
overwhelming but my goal is that you can
look at these lines of code and explain
to yourself or try to explain to
yourself at least what is responsible
for what so you don't need to be able to
write this on your own immediately
that's a whole other skill that takes
time to memorize this but I would hope
that you could explain to me what this
sign is doing that it is selecting the
button from HTML and saving it with the
name BTN and then this line is saying
whenever that button is clicked run this
code and this code is changing the
source of that image that we select here
to be one of these images and this image
of the counter is going up by one every
time we click until we hit the end in
which case we reset it so this code is
checking to see if we've gone too far
and raining us back into zero and that's
kind of the gist of all of it here
there's a lot if you're new to it but if
you can break it down like that then
this was somewhat successful if you're
still lost on things I wouldn't beat
yourself up over it because there's
entire I mean I have courses on
JavaScript that take hours to get to
this point where we actually go through
if there's a lot more to talk about than
just these couple of lines but we go
through and really explain we have
thorough exercises on everything this is
warpspeed
compared to that okay so I think this
marks the end of this crash course for
now hopefully we all survived let's just
wrap up so we have our index.html that
contains our HTML elements the structure
of the page we use these brackets and
the tag syntax to wrap elements herbs
excuse me to wrap data text and explain
what it should be this should be a
header this should be a button this
should be a paragraph the image tag for
example does not have any text inside of
it we pass an attribute to specify where
the image should be found same thing as
this link tag there's no text inside to
be found all that it does is specify
where to find a style sheet then we have
our style sheet the longest bit of code
we typed it's all relatively
straightforward in that it always
follows the same pattern you select
something curly braces if I don't mess
it up like that inside the curly braces
property colon a value semicolon Oh
gosh messing this all up and it all
follows that format select something
than a property and a valuable property
and a value over and over and over it's
just that there's a ton of properties so
that's the hard part with CSS is
understanding all of them and then we
get to our JavaScript and this is where
we add interactivity some functionality
instead of just displaying things we're
actually making it do something based
off of human interaction and there's a
lot of stuff happening here we already
walked through it so I won't spend time
you know stepping through every line
again but just remember how it fits into
the equation hTML is the structure CSS
is the style javascript is the
interactivity so next steps from here if
you enjoyed this I guess I'm supposed to
say you know comment like subscribe all
that stuff
when I first YouTube video or I guess at
this point the fourth in the series this
was my first thing on YouTube overall if
you did like it though or you didn't you
could leave a comment but as far as
continuing to learn there are tons of
great resources out there you know I do
have courses that you can find I'm sure
I'll put a link in the description but
also there are lots of free resources
online other YouTube videos that you can
continue to explore whatever path you go
down hopefully you have a slightly
better understanding of how these three
technologies fit together thank you for
your time and oh yeah help me name my
cat I'm not kidding I really don't have
a name for her right now I've been using
the name kitty and kitty cat for like
two months and I'm ashamed she needs a
name so leave it in the comments anyway
thank you and goodbye good night good so
long something I need a catchphrase I'll
work on that anyway bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
