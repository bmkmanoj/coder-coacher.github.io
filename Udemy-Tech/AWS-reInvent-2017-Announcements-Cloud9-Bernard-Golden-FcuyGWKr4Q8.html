for the ultimate AWS certified Solutions
Architect associate course and in this
video I want to talk about the recent
reinvent conference that AWS put on and
about the most intriguing announcements
you maybe you've already seen number
five now I'm gonna talk about number
four cloud nine so what is cloud nine
well cloud nine is a cloud-based
integrated development environment and
IDE is they're often called or typically
called that lets you write run and debug
your code with just a browser it
includes a code editor debugger and
terminal pod nine comes prepackaged with
essential tools for popular programming
languages including JavaScript Python
and PHP now what does that mean well
instead of using something like a text
editor 'like any any number of text
editors or something like that
now AWS has actually created a tool that
helps you write applications for AWS and
has a lot of support and capability
surrounding it so instead of you haven't
do a lot of heavy lifting to run your
code and debug it to set breakpoints so
it'll stop running a certain point so
you can check where things stand in the
application to help you identify where
problems arise this is basically a very
this is an IDE ingredient develop
environment that is very integrated with
AWS so it's already set up to talk to
services to understand what you have to
do with keys to make connections to set
roles and so forth it's kind of a
response to the Microsoft Visual Studio
Microsoft Visual Studio is are very well
established tool that people in the
Microsoft ecosystem have used for years
well Microsoft updated over a few years
ago over the last few years to really be
integrated with Azure so it makes it
much easier to write code on your
desktop test it on your desktop and then
upload it into
- so it can run in a in a in a cloud
environment well how nice is that for
AWS it supports serverless with local
and nativist executions so you can write
lambda functions test them on your local
machine to make sure they operate
properly make sure that you know there's
not any things that would hang or
anything like that you can test it out
locally but then you can upload it in
yes and then run it again and it's got a
seamless way to do that so you just
basically press a button say do it
locally oh now I'm ready to deploy it up
into my ec2 my editors account and it
can take care of that it provides a
capability of sharing there's a there's
a very popular programming paradigm
called pair programming where two people
simultaneously work on a program and
this allows you know two heads are
better than one it allows two
perspectives to happen it allows two
sets of eyeballs to find problems well
cloud 9 is set up to enable pair
programming within the AWS environment
it's also integrated code star which is
the AWS sort of development environment
for managing code deploying code
building executables and so forth it's
integrated with that to make it very
easy to upload code and trigger a whole
set of events within the application
lifecycle to get the code checked in to
make sure that it passes any kinds of
static tests things that you want to do
it to do any kind of evaluation of the
code to run some other kinds of tests to
make sure that it operates properly to
deploy it to actually push it into
environments to execute it does all of
that it's integrated with code start to
enable that so you can basically be
working on your own browser on your own
machine hit a button and it'll trigger
all kinds of stuff and cloud NIH's
integrated to do that so you don't
longer have to worry about creating all
those integrations and passing all that
data around it takes care of it so I
said it's a response to Microsoft Visual
Studio and it's free what more could you
want
so that's my number four most intriguing
at AWS reunit
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
