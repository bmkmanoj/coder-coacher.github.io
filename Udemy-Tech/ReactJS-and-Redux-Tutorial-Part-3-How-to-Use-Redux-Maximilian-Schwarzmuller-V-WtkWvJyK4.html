out react.js for now so redox works
standalone it doesn't meet react chest
and actually you can use read acts with
our front-end frameworks of your choice
you with plain JavaScript you so I'll
leave out react chest for now so that
you understand how redox works before I
then in one of the next videos show you
how to wire up react chest and read acts
so in the next is in this application
where I of course use react chairs I
will comment out everything here I'll
need it again later and then down here
I'll work with redux I already get my
web pack server running and in order to
work with Redux I need to add it so I
will install it and with NPM install and
well Redux here and I'll add the save
flag to add it to my dependencies so
this will pull down Redux and install it
should finish without an error looks
fine and then I can use it again I will
come back to the reactions part in one
of the next videos so in order to use
Redux the first step is to create a
store and I import the effort if you
create such a store from the newly added
Redux package so the one we just
installed the method I need is called
well create store and as you might guess
this method allows us to well create a
store so I will create a new store in a
constant here call the create store
method and this method takes two
arguments I'll start with the second
argument first which is the initial
application state now this could be a
JavaScript object could be an array but
here I'll keep it real simple and just
pass an integer just a number one choose
any number you like now what's the first
argument the first argument is the
reducer and when I use now I said I can
use multiple
users and I will come back to multiple
reducers in one of the next videos for
now let's say only use one reducer
remember reducer is the part which takes
your actions you dispatch anywhere in
your application and then does something
with that action so it changes your
state I'll create a new user here name
is up to you but I'll name it reducer
it's a constant and it's basically just
a method I'll use the fat arrow notation
here like this Q create this method and
it takes two arguments these arguments
will be passed automatically by read
acts it takes a state and it takes an
action so here I then can do something
upon the action now what you typically
do in a reducer is you want to determine
which action occurred because one
reducer typically handles multiple
actions so a switch statement is a
suitable thing here to check the type of
the action so I check action dot type so
in a switch statement I then want to
handle a case let's say add we want to
add something to our number remember our
state is just a number so the add case
here I'll add the logic soon for now
I'll break and then these subtract case
now I'm writing this all upper case you
don't have to but it's a convention you
typically use to name your action types
or to give them upper case names so you
might want to adopt this right now do
you reducer does nothing it just checks
which action occurred but then it does
nothing with that action it doesn't
change our state an important thing is
our reducer always has to return a state
so here I'm just returning the unchanged
state we have to return a state because
this is the new state our application
will use from this point on because as a
next step I will pass this reducer
method QD create store method here now
sets up the very basics of our redux
application where our application using
redux we have a store which we created
here and this store knows this one
reducer and it knows hey this reducer
will give me the new state therefore the
reducer has to return a state otherwise
we will get errors because our store
doesn't receive the new state it expects
it only has the initial state the one
but it doesn't get new states therefore
reducer has to return States again as of
now it only returns the initial state
already state we pass to the reducer
talking about passing something to the
reducer let's do this I want you trigger
such action I was talking about
dispatching actions in the previous
videos
these actions for now are dispatched on
the store which means hey store here's a
new action and a store will then send
the action to the red user because it
knows the reducer is responsible for
handling the action the store does not
handle it the store only knows who's
handling it the reducer so we dispatch a
new action here and dispatching an
action means calling the dispatch method
that's a method the redux package ships
with and this dispatch method here
expects a JavaScript object now that is
the action we send and here is the point
where I was talking about earlier I am
setting a type property and then I'll
set the type of D action I want to
dispatch now I can use any string to
give this action a name but of course it
makes sense to use a string I'm already
handling here so if I were to choose
multiply here well then we wouldn't find
it in the switch statement and nothing
would happen so let's use add here and
this means with add being triggered we
will land here in this case block of
course no code is run you're except for
the break statement which gets at gets
us out of the switch statement here but
we will land here and if we add code
then the ad code here will be executed
so that's the type but we also need
something else we need a value or a
payload to this action now here you may
choose a name of your choice but
typically you will use payload and as
you will see in later videos if you add
our packages which enhance the redox
functionality let's say those packages
will oftentimes expect that you use
payload here as name for your values so
using another name might then lead to
problems so I'll stick to payload and
that's the payload of the action
typically annual tedious and later
videos of course in your redox app for
example if you change the username the
payload would be the new username now
here it is simply the number I want to
add let's say 10 so now we're
dispatching an ad action with a payload
of 10 and of course this won't trigger
anything as of now so in order to
trigger anything here let's take our
state here and set it equal to the old
state plus action dot value now we're
changing the state we get our state pass
to the reducer and then we set the new
state to the old state Plus this action
value and then we return the state here
so in order to see something I then do
when everything you typically don't do
in your reaction because there you will
see something in well on your web page
of course but since we don't use react
here I will subscribe to my school's
store here which means whenever the
store is updated fire this callback I
pass here
the callback I pass as a federal
function so this function gets executed
whenever the store is updated and here I
simply want to log store
were updated and then let's print story
get state which is a built-in whoops
which is a built-in function which gives
us the new state so with all of that in
place if I save this and go back to my
application here and I open up the
console reload the page we see store
updated not a number so something is
going wrong here what could that be
it's of course that here I should use
payload and not this so now you see
store updated 11 so value of course was
wrong because I just explained that we
should use payload here and then I did
it wrong so payload is the thing to use
here with that you see we get store
updated 11 because the initial store is
1 as you see here the initial State
excuse me the initial State in the store
is a 1 and then we dispatch this add
method were add action here which adds
10 so if I change this to 100 here well
then you see a 101 because initial state
is 1 we add 100 we get 101 easy huh so
let's dispatch another method we could
dispatch another add method here for
example add 22 and then we could
dispatch subtract method so let's say we
want to subtract 80 then now of course I
have to implement you subtract method
here so state should then be state -
action dot payload and if I save this
and let me reload this UC store updated
when happened 1 because we add 100 then
you see store updated 123 because we add
22 to 101 and then you see store updated
43 because we deduct 80 from 123 and
that is how Redux works in a nutshell we
create a store we tell the store
or who is responsible for changing the
state we then dispatched an action this
dispatched action is handled by the
reducer we execute some code depending
on which action gets executed we return
in a new state the new state is stored
in the store and well we're informed
that the store changed and of course
later this part here the subscription is
handled by react.js so these are the
very basics and with that let's go onto
the next video where we will have a look
at using more complicated types than
numbers as a state specifically objects
and arrays which is something you'll
typically do in your application</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
