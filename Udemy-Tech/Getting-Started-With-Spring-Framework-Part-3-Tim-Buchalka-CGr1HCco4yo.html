coding what we need to do now is we need
to create an interface Organization Dao
and as a general rule it's almost always
best practice to code two interfaces so
I'm going to come over here and create a
new package or we can click on the
existing package and then right click
and select new select package then we
can just change it so where it's got
comm timber jacket spring demo domain
let's delete the word domain and make it
Dao again Dao is data access object
we're going to right click that click on
new select interface the name of the
interface we're going to go with
organization Dao this enter there and
let's actually spend some time now
coding this interface so we're going to
actually define six methods they're
going to perform crud that is create
read update and delete operations we're
going to then create an implementation
of this Dao interface so we'll start
with one method then eventually get to
implementing the rest of them but let's
actually go start with the method
signatures that we're going to be using
first one is public void set datasource
and the argument will be datasource TS
and we can add imports for that and
let's add some comments to this as well
set the data source that will be
required to connect a hole to create a
connection to the database next one is
public boolean create and that will
accept an organization object
organization or an argument create a
record in the organization table select
then import for that one as well right
the third method is going to be method
to return a specific organization public
between an organization object and it's
gonna be called yet organization we need
a parameter passed to be able to look
the specific one up and integer ID
that's the parameter so retrieve a
single organization and this one one is
a method to return all the organizations
from the organization's table so public
we're going to return the list of
organization objects we'll call this one
get all organizations and no arguments
retrieve all organizations from the
table and I'll have the import for that
that's a Java dot util dot list right
next one is going to be delete won't be
able to delete a specific organization
public boolean delete and accept an
organization that's an argument oops and
a delete a specific organization from
the table and we also want public update
organization walk so we can update the
details
organization and we need to return
something there but we'll chat a billion
okay that six button is also one more
that's also out of public void cleaner
alright so they're all reasonably
self-explanatory I've tried to explain
those as we've gone through and in
general I'd always suggest you try and
document your classes and interfaces and
interfaces I think are even more
important to be documented and that's
because the interface is a contract that
all implementation classes must obey so
you can see here that we've taken the
time to talk him in the methods right in
the interface as to what it actually
does so that another coder you could
come and check this out and know
straight away what they're trying to do
what each method was trying to do or
trying to achieve so kept the
documentation short here for our time
sake but in practice you know if you're
writing real applications I suggest you
know the more elaborate documentation
you can add that is still appropriate
and useful the better in general I
suggest that every method I came in a
return type also needs to be explained
and documented but again we haven't done
I haven't done it here for the sake of
brevity all right so next we're going to
implement a spring interface called a
row mapper so let's go to Google and
just take a quick look at what that
actually is we can do a search for
spring ray mapper and that should take
us to the right link there so I'm going
to click on that to see that it is the
right one we've got quite an old version
their pods look so that's two point five
one or two is I'll just type the link in
the link is available in the resources
section so doc stop spring dot IO slash
spring framework slash dots slash
current will go to the root and actually
do it that way so Java doc - API indexed
on HTML we do that and we can to search
for it's a much easier way of doing it
click on there and click on am actual
frames is enabled
and then we can just do a quick search
and the one we want we just do a search
for right Napa and this is why I won't
actually that I was talking about the
interface for Romo / you can see here
and your phrase used by the JDBC
template for mapping rows of a result
set on a per row basis now
implementations of this interface
perform the actual work of mapping each
row to a result object but don't need to
worry about exception handling sequel
exceptions will be caught and handled by
the calling JDBC template and they're
typically used either for JDBC templates
query methods or for our parameters of
stored procedures so that's but this
this is the functionality that it
actually gives us so we're going to
create a class now that implements this
interface so back to eclipse and what
we're going to do is start with a new
package there first in an implementation
package for our dao code so we're going
to click on package and we're going to
call this one we've got to spring demo
dao will put impl on the end of it as
we've done before for implementation
deviated and we're going to create our
new class in there so I'll right click
it class and we'll call this one
organization row another okay I'm going
to add the interface add I'm gonna do a
search for org dot spring framework
well actually what we're doing to be
quicker to type in row mapper
and just make sure that we're selecting
the org dot spring framework JDBC core
click on OK click on finish all right so
next what we need to do is we need to
start writing our first methods we're
going to write the map row method time
to come over here and just hover over we
can sort of see that it says that the
type organization row mapper must
implement the inherited abstract class
or abstract method row mapper so I can
click on add and implemented methods
knowing that we're going to add some
more code there and that satisfies
eclipse for now so we're going to
replace where the references to tea
though we're going to replace that with
organization so organization here for
our organization object and likewise we
scaled to return an organization as well
and then import here let's actually now
implement this method so we're going to
start with organization org is equal to
new organization then we're going to do
Oh set ID
RS don't get int ID and by default it
keeps doesn't always do a great job with
naming here are 0 and arguin doesn't
really make a lot of sense let's change
that to instead of 0 and we'll make that
results in RS instead of AG 1 let's
actually call that row num because
that's actually what the limits are all
about Roy num all right so next we want
to set the company name so org dot set
company name and we accepted that to RS
target string and we want to now talk in
the name from the sequel the my sequel
database it's gonna be company
underscore name it is important to get
that name exactly as you've had it
entered in my cycle work then so I click
on that and you can see we've got
company analyst core name so basically
all our columns we've used underscores
and lowercase so you want to duplicate
that back in the Java code alright so
next all dot set a year in corporation
Paris get int and that's going to be
year of incorporation lowercase and
separated by underscores then set postal
code and that's our s dot get string
that's gonna be postal let's call code
and set employee count Paris document
that's going to be employee
let's call count and closing parenthesis
and
set slogan iris don't get string and we
call it slogan and then we just return
the organization object you see that map
map row it actually wants a result set
in a row numbers I've just changed the
names that were sort of incorrectly are
generated by eclipse to make that make
it more sensible for us so it's got a
result set and the row num as the your
two parameters there so we're
implementing the row mapper interface on
line ten and this row mapper has only
got a single method that we need to
override which is this map row and
that's of course what we're doing here
and we're creating a new empty
organization object then we're
retrieving the data from the my sequel
database and putting it into the
relevant field in our organization Java
object and then ultimately returning
that from this method you know just to
be clear the two parameters that
tomorrow takes here in line 12 result
set well that represents the set of rows
that will be returned by the table an
execution of the sequel query and the
rhone um the second argument that's the
number of rows returned for example the
first row will have the row number one
so we're not going to be utilizing row
number but later we might in any of it
that's part of the process that we need
to implement and as i mentioned we're
basically just using cetera the setters
that we've defined in the organization
object to go ahead and actually save
those all right so let's in the video
here in the next video we'll continue on
and we need to then create an
implementation class for our
organization dao interface but we'll
start working on that in the next video
and what I'll do though first is I'll
just save this should fix those errors
the errors are now disappeared and will
continue as I mentioned in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
