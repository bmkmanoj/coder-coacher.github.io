video I'm going to give you a free
preview of a lesson from my wordpress
for beginners course on udemy calm in
this lesson I'll show you how to install
and activate custom themes on your
WordPress website now let's learn how to
install a new theme in the last lesson I
talked about how we already have a theme
pre-installed when we install a
wordpress the 2017 theme there's lots of
themes out there thousands upon
thousands of themes some paid some free
a lot of themes you can find by
searching for WordPress themes on google
and finding different sites one place
that I highly recommend is the Envato
marketplace called themeforest.net this
is where I've purchased themes in the
past and you can see if you go to theme
force net just thousands upon thousands
of themes that you can look through and
they come with all kind of variety for
every purpose so a theme is basically
the look and feel of your website and
you can find specific themes related for
corporate creative ecommerce education
mobile and these come with different
tools perhaps a membership option or
perhaps a different type of portfolio
option or different types of sliders or
different types of home pages so you
might want to check out these ones if
you're interested in purchasing the one
that I've used a lot for my other
websites like video school online.com is
the avada theme $60 but it's very
customizable and when you go to any of
these themes on theme forest you can
actually demo them to see what they look
like so you can see that this is a
sample template with Avada they come
with all kinds of sample templates over
here for photographers for any kinds of
people so there's lots of customized
ability with all of these themes but
there are also very good free themes so
to change your theme go to appearance
and then themes and this takes you to
your theme menu you can see that the
active theme right here is the 20
17 themed you also have a 2015 or a 2016
theme already pre-installed to add a new
theme click this add new theme button it
will take you to a page of WordPress
themes that you can search through now
you can just scroll through and preview
them by clicking the preview button or
you can sort by popular latest or if you
have a specific idea or something you're
looking for or a specific theme you've
heard about you can search through the
themes this way so say let's just pick
any one at random say we end up liking
this fit club theme because maybe we're
starting a an exercise fitness theme
well first we'd probably want to preview
it by clicking preview you can see what
it kind of looks like and say okay that
looks great you can either click install
from here from the preview page or click
install from this page here so with
these themes that are hosted by
wordpress.org
it's basically already on here so you
just install it quick and easy like so
once it's installed you have to activate
it so you can activate it by clicking
here or if we go back to our themes page
you'll see that it's now one of our
theme options so if I click activate and
then if I go to my home page and I
refresh you'll notice that I have a
whole new theme installed a different
look so that's how you install a theme
from wordpress.org say we got a theme
from themeforest.net
and we want to install it well when you
purchase it you can see here how I've
purchased different things from Envato
including WordPress themes and songs
from audio jungle you want to download
the installable WordPress file only it's
probably a good idea to download all of
the files and documentation and then
within that folder that you download
you'll have the WordPress file and then
under your themes you want to click
upload so appearance themes and then
upload click upload theme and then you
want to choose the file so it should be
in a zip file so I'm gonna go to my
desktop go to my installable theme file
that I downloaded
and install that theme click install now
now this might take a few minutes
depending on how big the file is and how
fast your internet is once it's
installed you'll get to a page like this
where you can preview it activate it or
return to the themes pages if we go back
to the themes page you'll see that Avada
is now an option so I can click activate
and now if I go back to my home page and
refresh it's going to appear like the
avada theme one thing that might happen
if you install a theme from theme forest
or any other premium theme you might
need specific plugins required for that
theme to work properly for example with
vada theme we need a plug-in called
fusion core and fusion builder you'll
typically get a notification as soon as
you install a theme saying you need this
so you can see here on the left-hand
side of our menu now I have the avada
theme that comes with some menus it has
this big installation required message
so what I would do is just go to go to
manage plugins and then all of these
plugins are required and so I'm gonna
have to install the ones that are
highlighted as required just by clicking
the install button here now since you're
probably not going to be using the avada
theme I'm not going to do that but there
is one other thing I want to show you
about themes since you probably aren't
using Avada I'm gonna go ahead and
delete my avada theme now to delete it
one thing I need to do is to deactivate
it
so to deactivate it I'm just going to
actually activate a different theme so
I'll just activate this 2017 theme now
to delete this theme or any of the other
themes that I've installed I can click
on the theme itself to view the theme
details then click the delete buttons
and then confirm by hitting the OK
button
so the challenge for you is now to
install and activate the template we'll
be working with throughout this course
of course if you want to follow along
with what I'm doing in each lesson the
template is called sparkling and you can
find it right here through the wordpress
themes so I'll let you go ahead find it
and install it and then activate it and
when you do your website should look
some
like this with your own name up here and
in the next lessons we're going to start
diving in customizing the content
designing our website adding pages
adding blog articles and all sorts of
other cool things thanks for watching
