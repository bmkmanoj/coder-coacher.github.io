real experience with IntelliJ IDEA we
managed to create our very first hollow
whirlwind application and even modified
the program to print our name it's now
time to explore IntelliJ IDEA a little
bit more just to understand the various
windows and start to understand how
things are put together and just to have
a look and see where IntelliJ IDEA
stores our files as we're creating our
programs first things first if you look
at the top of the screen you can see the
location where IntelliJ IDEA has placed
our programs and if you remember in the
previous video we defined the location
where that was going to be so I'm going
to go into that folder just to have a
look and see what files are in there so
I'm going to open up my finder and you
would open up if you're on a Windows
machine you'll open up Windows Explorer
and you can see that I'm in my desktop
my path is desktop Java programs as you
can see at the top there so I'm in the
right folder I'm going to go into the
hollow world folder and you can see that
there's a number of files there that
have now been added by IntelliJ IDEA
first is there's a hello world
IML now that is a file that's created by
IntelliJ IDEA and that's used to sort of
keep track of the state of this project
so it's not something you would ever
need to edit or open or use in any way
but you certainly wouldn't want to
delete it either but the interesting one
is in the SRC folder SRC is an
abbreviation for source there's a file
that you can see it's called hello dot
Java so and that equates exactly as you
can see just above the Finder window
there hello dot Java so when you create
a new class in IntelliJ it creates a
file and it ends it in dot java
so all Java files that you're creating
end in dot Java so if we have a look at
the out folder expand that you can see
there's a hello dot class file and
looking at the sizes you notice that
hollow dot class is larger than the
hollow Java now the hollow duck
is the compiled version of the class
whereas the hello Java contains the code
as you can see on the screen there the
hello duck class if I go to open that
contains what looks a little bit like
mumbo jumbo it certainly hasn't got the
same code that we typed into the
IntelliJ IDEA in the previous video now
a dot class file is the compiled version
of the program and that would be the one
that you would use to distribute and
send your code out to other people but
we'll be talking a lot more about class
files in the future videos for now all
you really need to know is that you
create programs in IntelliJ they're
saved off in a file format that ends in
Java and IntelliJ will automatically
when you run the program create these
dot class files so just keep in mind
that till you probably don't want to
delete anything in these files for now
you do all your changes to your Java
code normally would be done within the
editor itself with an IntelliJ IDEA
and not anywhere else so go back to
IntelliJ now so over here to the left is
the project view the project window and
you can see that this project is showing
on the screen there if by chance yours
isn't showing project you can click on
this drop down box and select project
from that and if you recall that mirror
is pretty well exactly what we saw a
minute ago in the Finder window so
IntelliJ in the standard project view is
really mirroring the contents in the
internet a idea product with what's on
file and that's all handled for you
automatically the other thing i want to
point out is that you don't need to
worry about saving files and some
programming languages you may need to
actually mentally save your files the
IntelliJ product is automatically saving
things for you it's rare that you'll
ever need to if you do want to try and
do that for some reason pick up here
into file and click on save all but
generally speaking IntelliJ is handling
the saving of this behind the scenes and
writing those files out and writing any
changes you make to those files as I
showed you in the Finder window
now one of the other things you can do
you can change the location of some of
these windows for example you might
decide that down here this little run
window you may want that on the
right-hand side instead of down the
bottom so what you could do you can come
over here and click on this little cog
and we could click on move to right and
you can see now we've now cut that file
in the right hand side and of course
that frees up more room down here that
was being taken up in the past when that
run window was at the bottom of the
screen you can also windows bigger or
smaller to your taste that's whatever
you need and you can open and close a
particular window by clicking the View
menu going to the tools windows in this
case with project if I select that again
that actually removes the window from
the screen and if I want that window to
come back again click on View tool
windows and project and you can see I've
got a shortcut to the right hand side
there on a Mac its command 1 but that
will be different depending if you're
running Windows or Linux but just go to
the relevance option view tools platform
and you'll see what the shortcut is
you'll end up getting to know these
quite well as you use IntelliJ and start
expanding your knowledge of Java they're
gonna open up the project we know again
you can see that's now open another
thing you can do is you can set the
windows to floating mode to do that
click on the COG for the relevant window
anything to click floating mode once you
do that you've got a free-standing
window that you can move anywhere on the
screen and it's not actually fixed or
docked in with the rest of the windows
that are part of IntelliJ IDEA that
could be good for example if you had
multiple monitors and you might want to
put part of your some of your windows on
the one monitor and the rest on another
and to go back click back and you can
just click on floating mode again and
that will actually put it back where it
was and if you want to you can come over
here to the Windows menu and you could
save the current layer if you have a
particular way that you wanted to save
the windows to always go back to that
particular state you can click on store
current layout as default and then if I
go ahead and make some changes for
example if I move that back to the
bottom again and let's say I close the
project window
I can come back here to window restore
default layout it actually goes back to
whatever the state was when you actually
saved it so that can be quite handy just
to size up the windows and to choose a
format that makes sense for you and
works with your particular setup so you
know know the basics of how to
manipulate IntelliJ IDEA and to create a
custom layout that suits your machine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
