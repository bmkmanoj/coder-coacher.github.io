layouts that you can use to create app
screens in Android studio and we're
going to be having a quick look and a
few others a little bit later
now using layouts to position items on
the screen used to be quite complicated
when you wanted to line things up
horizontally and vertically and to get
the screen just the way you want but
fortunately in Android studio 2.2 Google
introduced two constraint layout and
that basically replaces all these other
layouts and we'll discuss the older
layouts later just so that you're
familiar with them in case you have to
work on updating older code written in a
previous version of Android studio but
for most of the examples in this course
I'm gonna be using this new constraint
layout when creating layout screens
because it really is the way forward and
offers you so much versatility compared
to some of these older layouts now
Google didn't just introduce a new type
of layout they also completely revamped
the Android studio layout designer to
handle that layout so what we're going
to do is create a new project and get
into discovering how to use this new
layout designer now this first project
isn't our button click app it's just
something that we're going to use to
have a play with the designer and
probably get into a right mess and the
only way to really learn how to use the
designer is to try it out so the goal
here isn't even to run this application
and in fact I won't even be doing that I
will just be placing things on the
screen moving them around and generally
just showing you how to put things where
you want and have them stay there that's
why I said we were going to literally
play with it so have fun do experiment
and try things out make a mess of it all
and start again and maybe more than once
you can't do any harm here I just want
to stress that and you can just delete
the project directories if you have made
that big mess and just start again and
it's just a great way to learn and
really get a lot out of this
Android studio designer
so what are the best widgets for
demonstrating something on screen is an
image view because it's a very visual
component and you can easily see what
it's doing on the screen so I'm going to
be adding this image view to our layout
shortly now an image view requires an
image and it obviously wouldn't be very
interesting if it didn't have an image
so the first thing you want to do is to
download the two sample images that are
included in the resources section for
this video so I suggest you just
download those and just save them
somewhere on your computer because
you'll be needing to reference those
shortly
this is what the files look like and you
can see that the two filer names their
ball underscore 640 by 480 jpg and
there's also a ball underscore 100 by
100 jpg
did download those and put them
somewhere because we'll be referring to
them shortly
now with that said you can of course use
any image if you want so by all means if
you've got another picture that you want
to use in place of these use those but
one important thing to note though is
that there's a really odd peculiarity in
Android studio it doesn't like images
that have capital letters in the
filename now you can only use the
character 0 to 9 and lowercase a to Z as
well as - underscore + . in your file
names now there is in fact a good reason
why Android studio don't allow these
uppercase letters and that's because
filenames in Windows aren't case
sensitive so in other words ball dot jpg
with a capital B is as far as Windows is
concerned the same file name as border
jpg with a lowercase B but on Linux and
possibly under OSX depending on your
file system they would be classified or
classed as two separate files so it
would be very easy to produce a project
on one operating system that wouldn't
work on another so rather than build a
complex set of checking Google just made
the rule that uppercase letters aren't
allowed which if you think about it
makes everyone's life easier not having
to deal with an uppercase scenario but
do bear that in mind when you create any
type of resource in Android studio
including your own images and also if
you try to import them and also I don't
suggest you include a full HD sort of 19
by 20 times a thousand and 80 image
remember that these are we viewed on a
three inch screen so you probably would
be good to choose an image that is
around the size that I showed you on the
previous page so I'm going to assume
that till you've got your image files
ready let's actually go ahead and stop
the project and you can see that I've
got my two images on my desktop the top
right hand corner there so I'm going to
click on start a new android studio
project now I'm going to call this one
playing but before I do that notice down
the bottom under project location if
we've already used an application named
Android studio quite helpfully appends a
number to the end of it so that so we
don't override the same directory so the
my application was one that we created
in a previous video so if I leave that
as the default name it's automatically
come up with my application too but I'm
going to call this one playing but
you'll find that if you do come back and
create new projects of the same name the
next one will be called playing two
playing three and so on
so I'll leave that as the default name
company domain you can leave that too as
per previous videos it's up to you
whether you want to use the same domain
name or another one one reason that you
may want to keep the same company name
and to use my domain name is it makes
some other tools and we'll be using to
look for file differences in projects
easier comparing your source code to
mine but it is completely optional if
you want to use your own domain name you
can if you want to make things easy for
yourself use my domain name it's totally
up to you so I'm going to leave the
other things as they are and click on
next
I'm going to leave this screen exactly
as we've discussed previously with API
16 selected and everything else
deselected click on next
and I'm going to go with an empty
activity I'm going to use the default
activity name and layout name also make
sure that we've got the checkbox ticked
for generate layout file and backwards
compatibility the app compat backwards
compatibility is important and we'll be
discussing the ramifications of images
by clicking on that box a little bit
later so click on finish
so we'll just let Android studio do its
thing and finish which it has now and
I'm going to close this now close the
little tip of the day and you want to
make sure that you're in Android view I
have talked about that before you can
choose project if you want but I suggest
staying in Android view it's not easy to
find things with generally speaking next
we're going to come down here and open
the res and then open the layout folder
now we've got activity underscore main
open us a tab here which we can click
automatically but just in case it's
closed any of these files if you want to
open them again you can just double
click them and that will also make that
tab active if it's already opened in the
at the top of here and depending on the
amount of screen real estate you've got
you can also click here to turn one or
both of these screens off in my case
I've got enough space so I'm going to
leave both of them on the other thing
I'm going to do is ask that you have
both of these buttons on so in other
words this would be with the buttons off
with the strikethrough the image start
with both of those off and we'll be
talking about what they do and what they
mean as we work through these videos so
the first thing we're going to do is
start by deleting the hello world text
that you can see in the middle of the
design and the blueprint images so if I
click on that
notice how we get what looks to be a
pair of rock denim jeans showing up but
the zip is appearing in the blueprint
that's just sort of saying it's selected
and that's a constraint which we'll be
talking more about shortly but I'm just
going to select it which I have and then
press the del button on my keyboard and
that removes the textview for that was
showing hello world completely from our
screen now now strangely in this version
of Android studio it still shows the
properties in the properties panel to
the right even though we've deleted to
the View but we'll just ignore that for
now it does take a long time to create
these courses so we've had to start with
a preview version of Android studio 2.2
so that the course could be ready in
time so things like this may well be
fixed when the final version of 2.2 of
Android studio is released
and it's even quite possible that you'll
be on Android studio 2.3 or even higher
at around the same time Android in comes
out or shortly thereafter let's just
keep that in mind that you might find a
few things will be slightly different
okay so we're going to add this image
view that I talked about so the first
thing we want to do is use your
operating systems File Manager to find
those two images that we've previously
downloaded so both need to be selected
in your file manager and so if you're on
Windows use the Windows Explorer bar
manager Nautilus on Linux or if you want
to Mac you use finder some on a Mac so
I'm just going to navigate to that
folder if you recall it was my desktop
so I'm going to click on the desktop
there's my two files I'm going to select
them both in my case so I'm sticking the
first one holding down shift and
clicking the second one you do the
equivalent thing on that Windows or
Linux by holding down ctrl then I'm just
going to right click and click on copy
and they'll be equivalent to command for
Linux and Windows once you've done that
we can they'll go back to Android studio
come over here to the drawable folder
I'm going to right click drawable I'm
going to click on paste we then get this
message to pop up which is just really
confirming that we're copying whatever
was in our copy buffer into that folder
location which is drawables which is
correct so I'm going to click on OK and
we should see the images which you see
now in the top left hand corner appear
in the drawable folder so at this point
we're now done with the project pane for
now at least so I'm going to come down
over here and click on the little button
here to close the pane for now they've
got a bit more space I'm also going to
just move this over bit so we can see
read the names of these there is views
and I'm just going to move this over a
little bit as well so that we can read
some of these some of the text that
relates to the different various
properties on this screen so the image
view is actually down in the list of
widgets so we need to just scroll down a
little bit and you'll find that it's
down here under the images in media
section so you can see we've got this
image viewer here appearing under the
images and media section so I'm going to
click at once and I'm going to hold down
my left mouse button I'm going to dress
I'm just going to drag it into the
corner first just to show you what
happens notice that when I'm moving it
around it helpfully shows on both the
design and the blueprint screens that's
going to put it into the corner release
the mouse button and it pops up
automatically with a little box and it's
asking for which file name in other
words which image we want to put on the
screen so I'm just going to click on the
ball and a score 640 by 480 and click on
OK
so you can see what happened there
briefly the image seemed to be out to
expand to be almost the full size that
Android studio brought it back to a
small image so I'm going to actually
delete that and just to show you how we
can actually instead of just putting it
in the left-hand corner we can put it in
the middle so with that selected I'm
gonna press the delete button on my
keyboard again to remove it and this
time I'm going to do the same thing I'm
gonna come down here and notice these
little guard lines come up when we're in
the middle of the screen the vertical
guide line comes down and if I keep
moving down we also get a horizontal and
if I position myself in the middle of
the screen we get both cord lines for
horizontal and vertical showing telling
us that effectively we're in the middle
of the screen so I can release the
button again come over here to select
ball underscore 640 by 480 click on OK
and our image should now appear in the
middle of the screen so that's it for
this video we've made a good start to
this in the next video we're going to
talk a little bit about resizing the
image and what some of these properties
means specifically scale type so I will
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
