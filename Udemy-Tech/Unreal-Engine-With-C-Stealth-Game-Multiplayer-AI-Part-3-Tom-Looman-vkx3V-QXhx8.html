go into the header file and I'll start
by adding some components now the first
component we want is a mesh component so
I'm going to add a you static mesh
component
I call that mesh comp and this will just
be you know sphere or something to
visually show that the objective exists
and now we want something else that is
the sphere component and that is going
to hold some collision information so
ago that's sphere comp and this is what
we're going to be using for collision if
that done we head back over into the CPP
file and we'll just say mash comp is now
we instantiate the components so we say
create default sub object use static
mesh component and now we have to give
it a name so give it similar mesh comp
and then we do the same with the sphere
component oops
sir components create the other sub
objects and we have to specify the type
use fear components and again we have to
pass in a name fear comp oops
severe comp now as you can see this is
not highlighting for it yet well the
setting mascapone is fine if i try to
all g it try to navigate into it it
doesn't actually work so if I shift all
OH I can actually sphere components and
it does exist here but it's not showing
up for us now we have to add some
includes just just like here the FBI
subjective actor so I'm going to look
over here and say classes components
three components okay so we only need to
look at anything after private or
classes so the components sphere
components that's the one we're looking
for
so we're just gonna do like so
components sessions fear component I
know you see that it changed color now
adding these includes it basically tells
the compiler what kind of objects we're
dealing with and where the compiler has
to search for the types in this case we
add these four component here okay and
now I just need to specify a route
component so which of these two is gonna
be the first components in the hierarchy
now I'm just going to pick let's see the
mesh component su root component and I'm
so gonna set up attachment set up
attachment and I'll use the mesh
components X so our mesh component is
the root and the sphere component
attaches to that component you'll see in
blueprint what that hierarchy looks like
and before we compile I want to go and
back into the objective factor and I
want to make sure that we expose these
by using au property so I'm going to say
visible anywhere and going to specify
category and I'll call these components
and a copy and paste these over because
I want these to show up and I want us to
be able to change some properties on
these on these components in blueprints
specifically okay so we got that and I'm
gonna press the 5 and built this alright
so there's an issue
it looks very cryptic but there is an
easy solution as you might remember this
sphere component was not properly
colouring until we added the sphere
component here that means that the
compiler needs a little bit of help
finding out what kind of type we're
dealing with in this case in the header
file it doesn't know what it's dealing
with now we don't want to be adding this
include in your header file because I
would just that would add a lot of
compilation time until we don't want to
add extra includes any header file when
we can avoid that so what we can do
because we don't actually need to know a
lot we just need to know what this is
what this words is specifically so we
can do that by for declaring
like so use fear components now we told
the compiler that you sphere component
is a class and that it's all he needs to
know here it doesn't need to know what
kind of members it has what kind of
functions that it can call because that
is only something we'll be doing here so
that's why we have to do the include
here and not only header file so this is
all we need for that and then let's see
if it told us something else I think may
have all been related to the same issue
yeah let's let's try it at five again
and see what the compiler tells us all
right so that was the only issue so now
we were loading back into the editor all
right so we're back in the editor and
you can already see a bit of a
difference here now we have that that
objective that we had it if you can use
sure it's real like soon there we go
this a little objective now already has
a different representation that little
sphere that we saw earlier it's gone
because that is a default route
component that just gets replaced once
you add your own and now we have this
little sphere component you can see and
we should have a mesh but you know
there's we didn't assign any kind of
mesh to display so it doesn't have
anything yet so I'm just gonna edit BP
objective drag that in like so and now I
would like to just open up the full
blueprint editor and now you can see
what we got so we have the mesh
component and we have these sphere
components and the mesh is on the route
that's the first one in the hierarchy
and that means whenever the mesh
component moves the sphere component
will move with it so we can actually see
what it looks like in the viewport now
again we don't have a lot to see here
because we haven't assigned anything so
let's just start by assigning something
editor sphere let's pick the editor
sphere now it's a bit enormous I'm going
to click this lock here so we change all
three immediately on a scale
let's check this to 1 or 0.2 perhaps
okay and now he's the sphere components
is very small it's only 32 units so we
can just drag this out
like so and now if you were to compile
this and check it in a viewport we can
see that it has actually changed and
updated and already looks a lot better
so now we have our first objective class
we have the original representation
setup now one thing we do have we or one
thing we haven't done yet is this mash
components has collision and this sphere
component is actually the only one we
wanted to have colliding so I could
change this in blueprint you know I
could just set this to be no collision
but let's also do this in C++ just to
show you how that thing is done okay so
I'm going to kampala anyway or with that
complete we are ready to move into the
next lecture where we're going to let
this objective react to a player
overlapping with it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
