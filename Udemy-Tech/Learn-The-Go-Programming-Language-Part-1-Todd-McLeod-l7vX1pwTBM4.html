program and my name is Todd McLeod and
I've been a professor of computer
science at California State University
Fresno I'm also tenured faculty at
Fresno City College and I'm gonna teach
you how to use the go programming
language and there's a really important
thing that we're gonna learn after this
video but the first thing you need to
learn and the first choice you need to
make is what language you're in learn
and who are you gonna learn it from
those are like two of the most important
choices you can make
and so you already know a little bit
about my credentials but I want to tell
you about the credentials of the go
programming language and I first became
interested in the go programming
language because of its credentials so
in 2006 almost over a decade now twelve
years ago Google realized that none of
the modern programming languages were
meeting its needs so just stop and think
about that for a second Google said like
none of the languages are meeting our
needs and they decided to create a new
language so Google to me is the best
software engineering firm to have ever
existed and they decided to create a new
programming language because none of the
current languages were doing what they
needed to have them do and so they
started creating the go programming
language so that was the first thing
that grabbed my interest when I was like
oh I want to know about this language
Google's creating a new language the
credentials of the go programming
language the fact that it was created by
Google and it's now open source that was
the first thing that grabbed my
attention the second thing that grabbed
my attention about the go programming
language was the fact that was the
people that Google hired to help create
it and so the people they hired to
create the go programming language were
luminaries in computer science some of
the heaviest hitters in computer science
these are like the Babe Ruth's and the
Reggie Jackson's of computer science
they hired Rob Pike in Thompson and
Robert grass Omer and so these are some
of the same individuals who helped
create the C programming language the
UNIX operating system and the utf-8
encoding scheme coding scheme which is
the world's most popular coding scheme
and so to me that was absolutely
phenomenal
that Google's creating a new language
and they have these luminaries and
computer science to help create it and
so those credentials of the language
were first grabbed my attention about
the go programming language and if you
go to golang.org which is the official
website of the go programming language
by the way the go programming language
was open sourced and is released version
one in March of 2012 so the language is
about six years old now coming up on six
years and I've been involved with it
since about 2014 2014 and so so it's
open source it's compiled has a
compartment collector it runs super fast
and what I wanted to show you here about
golang.org is why did they create the go
programming language why did Google
create it so you can go to documents and
then you can go to frequently asked
questions and then frequently asked
questions one of the questions is is why
are you creating a new language and when
you look at that question they wanted to
accomplish three things they wanted
efficient compilation efficient
execution and ease of programming at
that point in time in mid-2000s you
could have any two of those three know
one language accomplished all three but
a phishing compilation efficient
execution and ease of programming and so
that was the goal of the go programming
language and what is the go programming
language good for it's good for what
Google does Google is literally
rewriting their some of their
infrastructure and go YouTube is all
written and go so if you want to do
network applications if you want to do
web applications if you need to do
something as a utility for DevOps to
handle computers or to process files go
has a lot of different things which it's
good for so that's golang.org the
official website of the go programming
language and that's why Google started
creating a new language and then the
last thing I want to share with you is
there's a presentation that I give at a
lot of different talks and I'm just
gonna bring that up and cycle through
some of the files here so I will just
fly through it so here's a Rob Pike Kim
Thompson
and Robert krasimir and a few other
engineers at Google and here are the
three goals efficient execution
compilation and ease of programming and
then I really like this slide because
you can pause the video here and just
take a look at it but you know it kind
of charts out where go is in the
ecosystem of programming languages and
again you could see you know another
really nice chart here where it go is an
ecosystem of programming languages this
is by Brad Fitzpatrick that chart and
you could also kind of see a little
example here of you know what you could
do with go and in this entire
presentation and my entire course on
learning the go programming language you
could get to it and all of these
materials by taking my course on udemy
and so you can check that out but
performant multiple cores concurrency
compiled Network clean syntax powerful
standard library garbage collected these
are all reasons that go is created
compiles on many OSS so you can work on
a Mac compiled a Linux or compiled a
Windows or vice-versa those are all
awesome it's backed by Google it's open
source and what other language is used
for all these web apps network servers
mobile apps machine learning image
processing load balancer system admin
hardware scripts crypto awesome crypto
and then it's really widely used you
know so just interesting quote here an
interesting quote there you could pause
the video and read that companies using
go write just keeps everybody is using
go basically go is the next big thing
and I'll show you one little metric on
that in a second to so everybody's using
go and I think that's it that's all I
wanted to show you about about the go
programming language maybe this one
right here this is what I wanted to show
so on Twitter you can check me out at
Todman underscore McCloud right there on
Twitter but here is a Stack Overflow and
they show go as the top paying
technology in the United States goes the
top paying technology so it's the
highest paying programming language now
it's a really great language to learn
it's great to learn because it requires
you to understand
and actually use correctly a lot of
fundamental concepts in computer science
so I'm excited that you want to learn
something about go this is just to this
video here is just kind of give you an
introduction to the two most important
things you need to know when you're
learning starting to learn to code and
that is which language are you going to
learn and and then also who you're going
to learn it from and so you heard a
little bit about the credentials of the
go programming language Google Rob Pike
and Thompson Robert krassimir
highest-paying programming language in
America the best language to learn today
in my opinion and you heard a little bit
about my credentials
I've taught computer science California
State University Fresno and I'm tenure
faculty president City College and and
so I think you're in a really great
place in my opinion you're in the best
place in the entire world if you're
interesting learning about computers and
programming and I'm just gonna give you
an introduction here these videos are
for YouTube and I'll give you a little
bit of a taste of and get you started
with with programming it'll give you a
taste of what you'll learn if you come
take my entire course on udemy so super
excited you're here super glad you found
this video and follow me on Twitter I
look forward to being your friend and
helping you learn helping you learn one
of the most amazing things you can know
today which is how to program and I'm
gonna talk in the next video why
programming is so amazing so uh BAM
you'll see in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
