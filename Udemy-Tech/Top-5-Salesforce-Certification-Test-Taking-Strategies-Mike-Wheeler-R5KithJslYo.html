test-taking strategies and I've added
the words very important in the title of
this because I've probably said this
dozens of times to people in it's rare
that people actually listen and take
this advice and what I mean by this is
that if you want to pass the exam use
the time allotted
don't bail out after 30 minutes don't
wimp out go to the full 90 minutes even
if you think you're going to pass or
even if you think you're going to fell
you're spending $200 u.s. in order to
register for this exam and so get the
full 90 minutes experience if for no
other reason to embed these questions in
your mind as you're taking the exam
you're inevitably going to reach the
valley of despair potentially unless
you're fully prepared and you nail this
out of the box you're going to hit some
questions and you're going to be just
shocked and stunned and filled deflated
don't fear don't freak out stay the
course and do the full 90 minutes now
what I mean by that is if you don't know
the answer to a question and you have no
idea just pick something and then check
to review it later it's no big deal go
on to the next question take the full 90
minutes and get through those 60
questions initially and then when you
get to the end of that first pass you
don't have to click Submit you can then
go and review those that you mark for
later review so your second pass I
always recommend that you do those that
you've mark for further review now you
may have 30 of those 60 questions that
you marked that's okay if all 60 of them
you're not sure about that's fine just
go through and that now it's where you
take more time in reviewing more fully
those that you mark for later review
where you read the question look at what
you've answered and then if you have to
readjust some that's fine don't worry
about it and then unmarked those for
later review so that as you're going
through and revisiting those that are
marked you eventually will get to where
you've reviewed all of those and so then
finally you may have a few minutes left
or you may be getting down to the wire I
want you to take it down to the last
minute okay and so then you go back
through the exam and read each question
that you can and the
answers as well and you may find that
you answer some things wrong I found
that the second and third time through
the question set I've gleaned further
information on concepts because there
may be other questions that cover the
same material in a different angle and
so you may start to realize that
question two in question 37 cover the
same thing from different angles and
that helps you to look at and compare
those two questions and the possible
answers to figure out what the right
answer is other things that are kind of
common-sense that aren't so common that
I found out there is that when you're
approached with a question that's
multiple choice decide which are the
wrong answers immediately and rule those
out and then check the ones that are the
potential right answer and market for
later review and so that increases your
odds of getting the answer correct and
then as well another key thing to note
is that you'll be asked to answer
multiple choice questions and these
questions are scenario based and
sometimes you'll be selecting the one
correct answer and sometimes you'll be
asked to select the two or three correct
answers and so the main thing to keep in
mind when you're dealing with a
multi-select question where you need to
select two or three correct answers is
you've got to get that entirely correct
in order to get credit so what I mean by
that is if you have to select the three
correct answers and you only get two
correct
you missed the question entirely just
keep these things in mind as you're
taking the exam is that you want to take
care to get these things fully right
take all the time that's available to
you and not just click Submit too early
and why this is key as well is if you do
happen to fail the first time if you
take the full 90 minutes reviewing these
questions then they'll be etched in your
mind more fully and that leads me to my
final point and that's doing the brain
done now a brain dump is where you right
after you're done with the exam and
especially if you fail there's no reason
to do this if you pass but if you fail
the exam the first time you want to go
through from memory and record either on
your phone through a voice memo or
writing down any sort of concepts that
you can recall from the test now you
want to do this from memory without any
sort of aid at first to just pull out
all the high-level things that you can
remember and then I recommend doing a
second pass of this brain dump
immediately looking at the exam guide
and so I recommend that
if you've gone on site they have a copy
of the exam guide in your car so once
you get out to it you can look at the
exam guide that will trigger your memory
for additional things that were on the
exam there's no harm in making a note to
yourself saying I remember a question
about whatever it is and that it here's
some of the possible answers and these
are things that you can then study and
investigate further then this brain dump
is vital in helping you to self identify
your weak areas and then guide your exam
preparation further for your retake I
also recommend that you schedule or
retake within two to three weeks of
failing the first time if you do fail
that's while everything is fresh in your
mind and you're not losing ground I find
that people that wait months between
tests end up failing again the next time
so just a relentless pursuit and you'll
get there it may take it one attempt or
two and some people I've known as taking
four or five times but in the end the
end goal is to get certified and of
course you want to hit that out of the
park the first time because it saves you
time and money also encourage you to
just go through this course again if you
need to you can also visit trailhead to
get hands-on experience to supplement it
