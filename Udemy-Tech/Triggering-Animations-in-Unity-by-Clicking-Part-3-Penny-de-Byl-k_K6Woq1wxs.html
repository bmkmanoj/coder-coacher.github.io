we've created a clickable chair that the
bot will walk towards and then it will
trigger the sitting-down animations now
we need to consider aligning how the bot
sits on the chair so that he looks like
he's actually sitting on the chair and
not near the chair or in the wrong
direction so what we're going to do is
to create an anchor point on the chair
and use that to a line where the bot is
sitting right so if you select the chair
in the hierarchy right click and go 3d
object cube now that's going to create a
cube sitting at the origin of the chair
remember that the chairs origin is
actually off to the side just here where
you can see the axis now we've created
this cube to be the anchor point and
what we'll do now is just give it a bit
of a resize eventually you actually want
to remove the mesh renderer off of that
cube so that you don't see it anymore I
always make it out of a cube these actor
anchor points because you can you've got
some sort of point of reference right so
this is our cube that's still attached
to our chair and we want it to kind of
be on the chair now we're also using the
cube not only as an anchor point but
also as the direction that the
characters going to face and we'll use
the z axis which is this blue axis to
orientate the character so when you're
sitting on a chair actually rotated the
other way around so let's just um well
I've got that cube selected I'm going to
rotate it by 180 degrees around the
y-axis it's up access which I'll have it
pointing outwards so now we've got a
position to anchor to and also a
direction to use so to implement that in
the code if we open up the set on script
from before and I'll just go up to the
top of the program the first thing you
need to do is make the code aware of
the anchor that we've just created so at
the top we'll create a public game
object anchor and later on pass through
the cube to that so that the code knows
about it now the other change I've made
also is just down in the auto walk
towards function here and wherever it
was just transformed position or this
dot transform position it's now anchor
dot transform dot position and you'll
find that the changes have to take place
here here here and down here so rather
than using the cube on the chair the
collider of the chair as the point of
reference for walking towards we're
using the anchor position now another
piece of code we actually get rid of in
this function is this line here because
what it's doing is pushing the character
forward by a very small amount each time
this function runs now the character
itself because of the nature of the
humanoid animations actually pushes
itself forward and uses the animations
so this here can cause us trouble
because we're trying to push it forward
with the code as well as the animation
so let's just delete that code out of
there
all right so save that and go back to
unity now if you select the chair on
which this is attached at the bottom
with the sit on script there'll be this
anchor exposed just like they had the
character before where we put the Y bot
into there so you want to grab this cube
if it's not already and drag and drop it
into this anchor point here so that the
code knows about it without at that
point of reference the bot will just
walk off into infinity but with the cube
it now knows where it's going to walk to
so let's just play this and see where
we're at
all right so I click on the chairs gonna
turn and walk towards the chair
and then at this point he seems to be
kind of stuck so what's going on if we
select our bot while it's still running
you'll see that the bots got a Collider
around it
now if you select the cube the Q's got a
Collider around it and if you select the
chair the chairs got a Collider around
it so it's the physics system that's now
stopping the bot not our code so we want
to leave the physics systems in place
for the chair we need that Collider
because you want to be able to click on
it now in order to make it not to stop
the bot from moving you can go over to
the inspector and for the collider you
can actually tick this is trigger which
will make the object be able to be
clicked on but won't affect the physics
of the bot so the bot actually can't run
into that chair and for the cube as well
you want to do that now you can totally
remove this box Collider it's not even
needed neither is the mesh filter or the
mesh renderer all we really are using is
this transform but I'm just going to
turn that box Collider off on the cube
and then you can remove it later alright
so let's have another go play and let's
walk over to the chair okay so what on
earth is happening you might not have
thought that you'd programmed your BOTS
to do this
the code is saying keep walking towards
the anchor until you get within a
certain distance when you're within that
certain distance then you can sit down
so the issue here is the bots actually
never reaching that certain distance
okay it's always because of its
animation which is pushing it forward
it's always going to be a certain
distance away from the cube okay because
the code is actually testing the
difference between the why bots anchor
oh sorry
origin point which is right down here
and the cubes origin point which is up
here now these two guys are
on the same level okay so the bots
origins down here the cubes are regions
up there so there's always going to be
this kind of distance between them so
checking if the bot is inside a really
small distance the cube is never going
to work so we need to modify our code if
I just go back into that sit on up here
to change this distance to make it a bit
bigger than 0.6 so obviously the
distance between the cube and the bot is
never becoming less than 0.6 allowing us
to sit down now if you want to check
that out if you can just grab this line
of code that works out the distance
let's copy that and up here I'm going to
put in a debug dot log line inside that
I will put that function that works out
the distance so that we can print out
what the distance is each time let's say
with that now this is a great way of
debugging ok so if I click on the chair
it's going to start printing out the
distance in the console that you can see
there now once we're close to the cube
when we start circling around it because
we can never get close enough you'll see
that these values here are fluctuating
between in my case 0.8 and point seven
ish okay so that seems to be about as
close as that bot is going to get to
that cube so testing in the script for
it being less than 0.6 is totally
useless because it's never going to be
less than 0.6 so let's make that less
than point H now we can delete that
debug line we don't need that anymore
all right now just peeking through at
the bottom you'll be able to see an new
function and I'll talk about that later
so just ignore that for now okay so
we'll save that and let's go back to
here and press play
let's go and sit on the chair so he's
walking over to the chair now you can
see that in this case the cube triggered
the sitting down and the other thing if
you watch very carefully is that when
the sitting down is triggered he's a
little bit away from the chair and
there's a sliding that happens to come
back and align him with the chair so
that's what that extra function that I
haven't shown you yet is doing because
otherwise he could end up sitting out in
space out here but you want him to be
aligned with that particular cube the
other thing at this point if I just
pause it and look at the boss and the
cube itself
remember this code is trying to align
the position of the bot with the
position of the cube but you've also got
physics coming into play and if you look
at this Collider that's around the bar
you can see that it's sitting quite
neatly on the ground and if I just press
play and try and lift him up you'll see
the physics system working against me to
always bring it down now you could turn
that off the physics itself which I will
show you a little later in another video
because we need to but in this case it's
not absolutely necessary it's more about
making sure that he's kind of positioned
on that chair now he's feet at this
point are nice and flat on the ground so
your option here is to actually make
that chair just a little bit smaller
rather than trying to get him to sit up
on it because these are pre-made
animations okay so if we just done grab
this chair just grab it as a whole and
hit the R key I can just resize that
down a little bit and then if we play
and go and sit on this chair we should
get a bit neater sitting
yeah okay so that's much better and that
at this point we can now go to that sit
on cube which is down here and turn off
the mesh renderer so it's now invisible
so we can click on it and wander over
and sit down now the reason that there's
this bit of a slide thing going on
before he sits down is because you're
never going to get your animations your
code and your physics system stuff all
lining up absolutely perfectly because
you're using third-person assets someone
else has created your animations and
you've got your physics system working
and they're all going to be competing
with each other for positioning of your
bot so it really is a lot of trial and
error and positioning when you're doing
it this way right so now he's sitting
quite nicely on there I'm going to show
you the code that actually drags him
back and sits him down neatly onto that
chair so back in our sit on function if
we just go here if we go down to the
bottom there's a new function called
annum loop what it does is it takes over
the movement of your character or I
should say the alignment of your
character after it has finished walking
towards the object so after it's
finished walking towards the object what
happens is that this is first testing if
you're not sitting on anything and if
you're not sitting on then return
because if you're not sitting on then
you don't want this extra little
adjustment to your character's position
happening but if you are sitting on what
it's going to do is create a little loop
similar to what we use before are
actually moving the character but just
to loop the rotation and to loop the
position of your character to align with
that cube when you're greater than 0.1
of a distance away from that anchor
position
now if you end up being much closer at
that point it will just snap the
character to the right position and we
know from experience that it doesn't get
it absolutely perfect because you've
also got the physic system and the
gravity involved so the gravity is
pulling the character down so the Y
position won't be the same but you will
get an X in a Zed position that are the
same so the character we pretty much
aligned with that chair
now this lerp function where does it get
run from gets run inside a new function
here a fixed update function that unity
uses after all of the other updates have
happened and after the physics systems
and stuff and all those things have
aligned then runs this animal upright at
the end and that's giving you that
little sliding along the ground before
he sits down now it's not absolutely
ideal you can see it's quite obvious in
this case but that's the nature of these
particular animations if you want to
slow the sliding down then you could
just make these values in here that are
hard-coded for those loops a little bit
smaller so that he doesn't slide so much
that is obvious all right so that's the
end of that code and getting your
character to sit down onto a chair okay
so let's just play it again
finally and we'll go over let me sit
down now we've also coded it already so
that we can click on him and he will
then stand up from the chair at that
point remember that the control of the
chair over him is released and you
should then be able to use the arrow
keys to walk away and then it doesn't
matter where you are in the world you
might be over here you can click on that
chair and all of the other code that
we've created for the looping will
automatically walk him back towards the
chair align him with the chair and he
will sit down on it into the spot where
that cube is
