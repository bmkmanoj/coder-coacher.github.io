get at the module is that once you turn
it upside down you'll see that this is a
serial device and these two hymns
implement the serial connectivity
between the Arduino and the Bluetooth
module so notice there's an RX t pin and
a txt him here and there are the two
pins that allow you to connect your
module to the adrenal notices one on the
Arduino pins 0 and one receive and
transmit and that's where you need to
connect your Bluetooth module what
you've got to do is to make sure that
the received him on the module is
connected to the transmitted pin on the
Arduino and vice versa so receive will
go to transmit and receive on the
adrenal will get the transmitted on the
Bluetooth module the other two pins J
and D and VCC are simply connected to
power 5 volts Pavel will do it so let's
go and do that right now
I can either connect the Bluetooth
module to the ad unit by simply plugging
it on to the Hera just like that and
just notice that pin number 0 on the
adeana is they received him and that is
conveniently connected to the transmit
pin on the module and they receive pin
on the module is the correct position to
be connected on to the transmit pin on
the Arduino now we just need a couple of
jumper wires to provide power now just
to keep things a little bit more tidy
I'm going to use the breadboard with an
LED to do this experiment so gonna
unplug it from the Arduino and just plug
the module here on the breadboard so
I've got the wide little jumper wire
that provides 5 volts power to the
rightmost
or the module which is VCC and the gray
jumper wire conveys ground hint I'm
going to grab another two wires plug
those to the receive and transmit so as
we said the red wire is receive so that
will give to transmit on the audrina and
the orange wire is transmitted on the
module so it's going to go to P number
zero which is receive on the Arduino
let's continue with a wiring so I'm
going to go for power now so five volts
in on the other you know will get to the
red power rail and let's grab a blue
wire for ground you can ignore this
jumper wire I'll be using it later they
last think that there is to do is to
connect
the current limiting resistor of the led
the Statue - okay number eight on the
Arduino so that will Adam determine the
LED on and off via the bluetooth module
