name's Nick and I'm gonna teach you
everything you need to get started so
exciting lecture here we're gonna start
working on that Xcode project that we
had created earlier the one on the
desktop that I called Swift fun maybe
you get it gave it a different name
whatever doesn't matter so go ahead and
open up the Xcode project file to get
that project open and if for some reason
you deleted yours you didn't make one
earlier you can just go ahead and create
a new one you can watch that previous
video about how to do that okay and I'm
gonna go ahead and get rid of this
playground that we had in the background
I want this to be our singular focus so
what we are gonna learn in this lecture
is about sort of the visual part of
making an app so there's kind of two
sides to an app there's the visual side
and in the programming side so for
example let's say we make a weather app
we've kind of been on a weather trend
here right so let's say I'm gonna make
an app that you know tells what the
weather forecast is gonna be so it might
show well you know this is today's
forecast tomorrow the day after that
whatever for the next five days in Xcode
if you're gonna make this weather app
inside of this storyboard file this one
that says main dot storyboard this is
where you would create all the visual
parts of the app so you would you know
maybe make a picture where you could
have like a Sun or a rain cloud
depending on what it was and then you
know have some information like today's
high is 74 whatever like you would
figure out where everything is spaced on
the screen how it's going to look so
that's the visual side of the app then
on the programming side of the app
you've got to have some code that says
you know go to the internet and check
what the you know weather is going to be
for this location and speaking of
location go ahead and access the phone's
GPS to figure out where they are then
you can go to the internet and say for
this particular location that the users
in go get their weather forecast and
then display it visually on the screen
so just know when we're working on apps
there's the visual side and then there's
the code side and all the visual stuff
that we're gonna do is going to be
through this storyboard file so the
first thing that I want to introduce to
you here is something called a label and
so if you
want to add a label into your app a
label is something is a way to display
some text inside your app go down here
to the bottom right hand corner and
scroll down until you see something
called label it should be up pretty
close to the top here and all we're
gonna do is click drag it on here to
this like white box okay
so this little white box that we have
here the technical name for it is a view
controller but basically it's the screen
in our app so I want you to just drag
this out somewhere on the screen
probably you know maybe up at the middle
near the top and then we are going to
run our apps just so that you can see
that this works and what this looks like
so over here at the top where you see
the name of your app and to the right of
it you can select where your app is
going to run there's all these different
devices that you can simulate your app
working on so for example i'm gonna
choose iphone 7 probably good size to
work with Apple is probably going to
come out with a new phone so by the time
you're watching this there may be you
know iPhone 8 or whatever it is inside
of there but I'm gonna choose iPhone 7
for now and to see what our app is gonna
look like we can run something called a
simulator and that shows us on our
computer what this app would look like
if you ran it on somebody's phone so I'm
saying simulate this on an iPhone 7 and
then all you do is hit the play button
over here ok so play button the
technical term is run but it looks like
a play button to me so that's what I'm
going to call it so if everything's
working with your app you should see a
little message there that says build
succeeded and then this new app opens
here down here called the simulator and
you'll see it basically creates like
this little mini iPhone on your computer
it'll take a second to load up here but
essentially this is where you can test
up out your app and see what it looks
like
so you can see here comes our app and da
da da where is our little label that
says label for some reason that is not
showing up there we go it took a second
to pop up here but there it is so you
can see there's our app called label if
I change this to something like Hello
so to change a label if you double click
on it that's where you can start
changing the text inside of there so I'm
gonna say hello or
that's kind of the classic example you
might have to stretch this to the side
to make sure all that text fits inside
of there but go ahead and hit this Run
button one more time play button Run
button you might get a little pop-up
that says hey do you want to stop the
previous simulator that was running
before and just go ahead and say yes to
that in fact I recommend just checking
the box that says don't ask this again
just always terminate the last one but
anyways you can see when we did that all
of a sudden now HelloWorld shows up
inside of there so this is kind of the
flow that we're gonna follow we're gonna
make some changes here in the storyboard
inside of Xcode then we're gonna hit run
then we're gonna open up the simulator
and see what it looks like there okay so
we have this label inside of our app
okay that's fine
but you'll notice that it's not exactly
in the center and something that's kind
of tough here is that there's a lot of
different iPhone screen sizes there's
the very tiny iPhone se there's the
really big iPhone 7 plus who knows like
I said Apple might come out with a new
type of iPhone that's even bigger than
that I don't know but to see what your
app is going to look like down here at
the bottom you can see what your app
looks like on the different diseases so
if I say I want to see what this app
looks like on the iPhone 4s you can see
hello world's kind of off to the right
if I do the big like iPhone 7 plus now
it's kind of off to the left and you
know 7 it looked okay there this is what
it looks like on the se like you can
sort of see what your app is going to
look like and we want this hello world
for example to be in the center of every
app you know regardless of the screen
size here so whether it's this one or
the very tiny one we wanted to show up
in the center so to do that we're going
to take this label that we just created
and we're going to add some constraints
to us so constraints allow something
inside of your storyboard to be
positioned you know relative to what the
screen size is going to be so when you
have your label selected here make sure
you've got that clicked come down here
to where you have these two bars we're
gonna select this and we're gonna check
this box that says horizontally in
container that's saying we want to
Center this puppy horizontally inside
the app so if we go ahead and say add
this one constraint you can see
boom all sudden outs in the middle and
if I open this up on the big iPhone 7
plus it's in the middle there if I go on
the tiny iphone 4s the SE whatever size
it is it's always in the middle now this
still isn't working here because Xcode
is not quite sure where to put this it
knows on the left to right that it needs
to be in the center but doesn't know on
the up/down amounts like should it be
really close to the top should it be
down at the bottom so for example if we
just wanted this to be in the middle of
the screen regardless of you know what
device it was on we can while we have
this label selected we come back hit the
same thing but this time we check
vertically in container and say add that
constraint in boom now if you know we're
on something really big or something
very tiny it's always in the middle here
so to test and make sure this works I'm
gonna go run this on the iPhone 7 see
what it looks like and if you can always
you know test this on the different
device sizes I think it's kind of just
quick to check it you know down here at
the bottom and there look at that we've
got the hello world right there inside
of the middle so one thing that I'd like
to point out with these constraints is
that they can sometimes the more and
more things that you add to the screen
things can get kind of confusing so for
example with this one let's say you
added the wrong constraint or you added
one too many times like I went back here
and I said oh I also want to do
vertically in container like I've added
multiple things saying go ahead and
Center this well you can select this
label and if you come over here to the
right side menu and if your right side
menu isn't showing up you can hit this
little thing to make it hide and show go
to the little ruler option here and this
will show you all the different
constraints that you have and if you
hover over them it'll show you them so
for example you can see there's two here
that it's a align it you know
horizontally here in the middle so I can
select one of these hit the Delete key
and now I've only got my two right and
you know I could get rid of both of
these for example and now there's no
constraints on this and I could you know
simply come back and say I'm gonna check
both of these I want it centered
horizontally and vertically and then
BOOM all sudden this thing's back in the
middle okay so you have it what did we
learn inside this lecture well we
learned
you know how apps have a visual side in
the code side we haven't tapped into
that code side yet but we've learned
about the visual things that's for the
next lecture we learned what a
storyboard is and then within a
storyboard we learned how to drag a
label out into our app which is a way to
represent some text so in the next
lecture we're going to talk about how we
can actually change the information
that's inside of here hey thanks for
watching what are you going to make
leave a comment below and let me know
and if you want to learn even more I
have a full 16 our iOS course that I
created just for beginners where I'll
show you how to make a ton of different
apps including a snapchat clone a
Pokemon go clone and the talk boy it's
usually 200 bucks but if you use the
link below you'll get a YouTube
