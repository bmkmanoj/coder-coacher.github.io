to variables and we had a bit of a play
around with integer data types that's
now time to talk about different types
of data types and more information about
the integer data type so I'm going to
close this first project down by
clicking on the Red Cross in the left
hand corner of the screen and I'm going
to create a new project let's select
Java let me click on next I'm going to
click on create project from template
click on command line app click on next
we're going to call this one byte short
int and it will make sense as we go
through the video while I'm doing that
I'm going to change the base package to
comment in machaca but you can change
that to literally at this stage whatever
you'd like click on finish now firstly I
want you just to check a setting before
we go any further I'm going to right
click the project name here and then the
go down to where it says open module
settings you'll select that and you want
to make sure that this language level is
actually set to 8 which is JDK 8 in the
previous section we installed the Java
development kit version 8 so we need to
set that to 8 to make sure we don't get
an error as we go through this video
click on OK okay I'm going to double
click main now to make a bit more space
and I'm going to start running some code
now if you remember in the previous
video we created some code that did
something like this into my value equals
10,000 so what that was doing was
creating a variable called my value of
type integer with a value 10,000 in so
in computing terms the computer has
allocated enough space to store an
integer and it's assigned a name for
that variable of my value but what
actually is an integer we know that it's
a whole number but what can we store in
an integer in like is it an infinite
number we can store in there so in
actual fact in computing terms normally
there's always a limit as to what it can
do there's a minimum and a maximum so
with a data type int the computer as
science enough space to store a number
that is between the ranges of around
about minus 2.1 for
and billion to positive 2 point 1 4 7
billion so in other words a number that
is in that range if we try and use a
number that it's smaller than that range
or greater than that range we'll
actually get an error and that's because
it physically won't fit in the space
that the computer has allocated and in
that scenario what you would use is
you'd use a different data type for that
particular type of processing that you
want to do and I'll be talking more
through this course showing you which
data types to use for a particular
scenarios generally speaking the integer
data type I've introduced that to you
first because that is the most common
data type and you'll normally use that
that'll be your first variable if you're
looking to process something in whole
numbers you'd probably be using an end
but I want to show you some of the
alternatives and just go through so you
understand behind the scenes then
minimum and maximum values that can be
stored in this data type as well as
other data types so it turns out the
minimum range I'm going to delete that
they put my min value for an integer is
I said minus 2 billion so it's minus 2
billion 147 million 480 3648 so that is
the smallest number that can fit in an
integer so we try and make it smaller
still like we put them make the 8 on the
end of nine we actually get an error and
if we hover our mouse integer number too
large so how that sounds a bit funny you
think that would that would probably
should say integer number too small but
essentially what it's saying is we've
tried to exceed the boundaries of the
minimum and maximum values for an
integer we're seeing that back to the
lock the smallest acceptable number you
know I'm just going to copy and paste
this and we'll create a second variable
with a maximum value the maximum value
is like getting rid of the minus oneth
front that's the maximum number 2
billion 147 million 480 3647 so again if
we try make that larger we'll get the
same error integer number too large so I
said that back to what it was so if you
need to do whole number calculations an
integer will only work if you've got
numbers that are inside that range now
obviously for the computer to store a
number that large or that small it takes
a certain amount of space now just
before I go on I just want to make it
clear
that anything number that you type here
that you see that is a fixed number that
you're typing in in a statement like
this when you're defining a variable
this part here to the right is called a
literal so we're typing in a literal
there to the right and that's a fixed
number it wouldn't be a literal if
you've done something like you've
created something like a times B and you
had those variables that existed in your
project that would not be a literal
that's an expression but where you're
typing in a number locked out I've just
done an undo that is there literally now
what you can do is you can change this
you can put underscores in there to make
them a bit more readable this has been a
feature that has come out since Java 7
and that's why I asked you to have a
look at for the module settings when we
went into that earlier in the video
because this would come up with an error
unless you've set that module change to
test for to Java right
so if you're typing in a literal you can
use underscores that makes the number a
lot more easy to read so I suggest where
you've got a large a literal number that
you're typing in like that use
underscores to make it more readable so
as I said the integer is allocated a
certain amount of space by the computer
being efficient if we want to do some
calculations and we don't want to use a
number that's within that range we want
to use perhaps the much smaller number
we can use a different data type in Java
makes available to us different Java
types for different types of things that
we might want to calculate so the next
data type I want to discuss is called a
byte so we can type this like bite why
byte value equals 10 so what we're doing
is we're telling the computer this is a
data type of type byte and we're
assigning the value of 10 and the name
of course we're defining is my byte
values now byte value is much is
allocated by the computer a much smaller
amount of space and consequently it can
fit a much smaller number in actual fact
a byte can only store a number in the
range of minus 128 to 127 so literally
there's a smallest number that will fit
in a byte and the largest number that
can fit is 127 so we try and exceed that
and get an error and likewise if we try
and make the number smaller than the
amount of space we'll get an error as
well so why don't we ever want to use a
Byatt
a byte is more efficient because it's a
rented round about terms it would
normally take about a quarter of the
amount of space of an integer so if
you've got a lot of calculations it can
be far more efficient to use a bite
because you're not allocated because the
computer is not allocating as much space
for a byte than it is for an integer and
particularly in situations where a
computer hasn't got a lot of memory or
there's a particular type of Java
program you're running and particularly
on mobile devices for argument's sake
that haven't got a lot of memory it does
make sense to use the right datatype for
what you're trying to achieve
so that's a byte there's also another
one which we call a short and a short
the value for a short will put my short
of a lead for the name and this can
store a larger number at 30,000 for
argument's sake but the actual and
largest number that can be stored in a
book in any short is - 32
seven six eight so we try and go smaller
I get an error and the largest is 32767
then we try and exceed it we get an
error so again that's a different type
and generally speaking a short is
allocated a wrap twice the amount of
space that a byte is and about half the
amount of that an integer is what I'm
going to do is I'm going to put a space
there and I'm going to put what's called
a comment we're going to put two slashes
like that and that defines a comment
that we can just type something in there
that is for us and that command is
ignored by the computer that's really
great for documenting and making sense
of a program to give yourself some notes
that you can refer to later so what I'm
going to do is just outline what these
variable types are so we're gonna put an
integer it's good to think of an integer
it has a width of 32 a byte two slashes
again part has a width of eight short
has a width of 16 and generally speaking
a byte is half the size of a short in
computing terms in terms of how much
space has been allocated and a short is
half the size of an integer that's three
data types that are all based on whole
numbers there is one more data type and
that's of use where you've got a number
that you want to process that is a
larger than the amount for an int and we
call that along we put a long while long
value equals 100 now technically that's
wrong because when you're assigning a
long value you want to actually put the
letter L on the end of it and that tells
the computer that this is a long value
you can put lowercase L or uppercase L I
suggest you use an uppercase L because
that's a little bit easier to read than
the lowercase L which sort of blends in
it looks like a 1 so in other words that
looks like a hundred 1001 if you don't
look at it really carefully but if you
put a capital L you can see clearly that
that's an L and not a hundred and long
has a width of 64 so what that means
it's double the width of an integer and
the actual number that we can store in a
case of an integer these minimum number
was 2 to the power of 31 but a long
value we can actually store
huge number it's actually 2 ^ 63 so it's
something like this I'm gonna paste the
number in I can't actually tell you what
that number is but it's actually a huge
number that's the minimum that's the
smallest possible number then you can
see there it's got 18 numbers after the
9 so 19 numbers in total so it's a huge
value and the largest value is the
positive version of that minus 1 so it
would be like that so that's the largest
possible number they are for data types
in Java that deal with whole numbers so
when you're developing a program in Java
you would be deciding when you're using
whole numbers as to which datatype you'd
be using to solve your particular
problem and actually work through this
course you'll see a lot of these data
types in action and you'll get more of
an understanding as to which one to
choose for a particular scenario in
general as I mentioned you want to
choose the integer by default so
probably 9 times out of 10 or 8 times
out of 10 you would go up here you
achieve your integer when you're dealing
with whole numbers let's have a talk now
about arithmetic in the different data
types in the previous video of course we
did some basic arithmetic using the
integers we can do something just as a
recap we could come up here and we can
put int my total equals my min value
divided by 2
it's left the forward slash is the
divided by so that's just a simple bit
of arithmetic which takes the value of
my minimum value which is minus 2
billion 147 million four hundred eighty
three thousand six hundred forty eight
divided by two no problems here it was a
byte value look at what byte when you
buy it value equals my byte value in
brackets / - ah but we get an error now
why do we get an error because that
seems to be okay in the case of the
integer we just defined it in brackets
to mean my minimum value divided by two
but here we've got an error and if you
have a look at the error that's coming
up on the screen it says incompatible
types required by it found int so what
it's saying is well you're defining and
a variable of type byte so whatever you
type on the right hand side should be a
byte should be of type byte and when we
type in a number that fits within the
range of a by
it accepts it as you can see on the line
the minimum value we haven't exceeded
the minimum value or we haven't exceeded
the maximum but when you type in an
expression because remember something
that isn't a fixed number like in the
case above that this is an expression
whereas the one above is is a literal
because it's actually just a fixed
number and what's happening here is this
is the nature of Java and what I was
saying about how an integer is the sort
of go-to or the default data type you
should use for whole numbers by default
when you're making an assignment in an
expression Java converts that to an
integer so what's happening here is
we're looking for a type of a booking
for a value that's I'll type by it to
put into our my new byte value variable
which is type byte but Java has
converted that automatically to an
integer and therefore it's now
complaining and saying well I'm sorry
but that's an integer and you're trying
to fit an integer into a byte and we
know that an integer takes up a lot more
space than a byte so that number
physically won't fit into the area of
memory that has been assigned this is
just a weird thing that Java does and
what you need to do to get around that
is you need to specifically say to Java
look I want you to treat this as a byte
so to do that we do something called
casting so we just put something in
front of that we just put in in brackets
by it so what we're saying is Java I
want you to treat that as a byte and
Java gets rid of the air and says okay
if that's what you want to do I've
converted it I'm not going to make that
an integer anymore that's now a type
byte so therefore my new bike value
which was a type byte has been assigned
a byte value and we might just print
some of these out so we can see that
we're on the right track here and we can
put something like Maya total equals
this is a way to print the value and
print a bit of texture as well plus my
total they will put my new byte value
equals my new bike value okay let's run
that and as you can see looks like we've
got the right results there so that's
correct
likewise for a short you need to also do
the same thing so we can't just put
short when you short value equals my
short value divided by 2 because of
course we get the same error
and the error is looking for short and
found it in together similar error but
this time it's too short
so we'd fix this one by typing short
generally speaking an integer is the way
to go and you can see that that is the
case because Java by default if you
don't specify the top that you actually
want it converts it to an integer
automatically and that's why I would
suggest that you always work generally
speaking with an integer unless you've
got good reason to not do that okay so
I'm gonna delete that and I'm now going
to issue a challenge to you now that
I've deleted that off the screen so
create a byte variable and set it to any
valid byte number it doesn't matter
create a short variable and set it to
any valid short number create an int
variable and set it to any valid int
number lastly create a very variable of
type long and make it equal to 50,000
plus 10 times the sum of the byte plus
the short plus the integer values
okay so pause the video here and go away
and do that and when you get back I'll
go through and show you how to do that
so how did you go did you figure it out
well let's make a start on that so we
will do something like bite we'll call
it bite value equals say it's 10 short
that's our first variable a second
variable short value equals 20 and int
int value equals 50 so how are we going
to do the next bit well the next bit
would be a long we'll call this our long
total so I put a long total equals 50
thousand plus 10 times and it's actually
a lot easier than you think it's quiet
plus short plus int int value it was a
little bit tricky in that you don't need
to enter the cast there because this is
converting automatically to type long
and long will quite happily accept an
integer to be more precise we could
probably put an L there 50,000 L plus 10
L times the bike value pasta short rally
plus integer value you can put that out
in a total and if you run that now we're
going to total of fifty thousand eight
hundred and that's because it's 10 plus
20 plus 50 that's 80 so that's 50
thousand plus 10 times 80 is eight
hundred so it's 50 thousand eight
hundred so a little bit of tricky one
there in that you didn't need to do a
cast there and the pointing the point I
wanted to make there is with a very
variables of type longer integer you
really don't need to do any casting like
you do for shorts and bites if you put a
value in a bracket for bite or short it
will automatically be converted to an
integer and a variable of type long will
also accept an integer value but of
course just finishing off if we wanted
to do this to a short variable which I
put short total we might say it's 1,000
plus 10 times and then we put our bike
value short value plus int value we're
going to get an error there and what we
would do is we put the short here and so
everything we want to deal with there is
going to be typed short and we then have
to put another bracket there so
of Adaline so it's basically saying
everything in this bracket is to be
converted to a short so you can see that
Java makes you do a little bit more work
when you're dealing with your variables
of type byte or short and the point I
want to make is that using integer is
the best one to use generally but even
if you are using type long Java and
there was a lot of the complexity for
you and you don't have to do this
casting because a long will happily
accept an integer when you're defining a
value to it as well and just to confirm
before we finish if we print out short
total short total short toner will run
that Shana was 1800 and of course it was
a thousand plus 10 times 80 which is the
sum of those three ten times 80 is eight
hundred total was 1800 so that's by its
shorts integers and Long's
in the next video we're going to go
ahead and start talking about decimal
numbers because of course to date we've
only dealt with whole numbers but there
are scenarios where you want to actually
go ahead and use decimal points for
example converting pounds to kilograms
or something of that nature where you
want to deal with decimal numbers so
we'll go ahead and work on that in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
