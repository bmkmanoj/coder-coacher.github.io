established the connection between the
Bluetooth module and my computer and we
were able to use it to why the slit and
on end of an LED in this lecture up edit
simple analog sensor which is the photo
resistor here with a 10 kilo ohm
resistor and I am taking the signal from
the junction between the resistor and
the photo resistor and that goes to
analog pin 0 from where we'll be taking
values I haven't uploaded the sketch yet
the sketch that we'll be uploading is
this one here I've got information on
how to do all the connections in here
and all the parts you need etc but I
just want to show you that the only
change between the previous sketch in
this sketch is that now we've got a
sensor that is connected to analog pin 0
I've got a little bit of code it keeps a
passage of time because I want the
audrina to sent an update to the serial
monitor every 1 second so that's every
1000 milliseconds still this is just
using the serial class nothing fancy
here specifically dedicated to working
with Bluetooth modules it's all just
serial devices as far as the Arduino is
concerned so insert the loop we've got a
bit of code that reads the value from
the serial interface and then again
turns the LED on and off depending on
what that value is if it's hate you will
turn the LED on and then it will stay on
here the last block is what upper edit
in this sketch is to take a reading out
of the analog pin and then every 1000
milliseconds or every second this sent
that value through to the serial monitor
using whatever connection might be
available why at the serial or Bluetooth
serial so I need to upload this sketch
to the Adreno first and just like
before to do that we need to release the
you odd channel we need to unplug in
other words the Bluetooth device I'm
going to remove the battery as well and
plug the USB cable back him just to
upload this sketch so check on the port
that sure that's correct that hasn't
shown up yet to give it a few more
seconds and they are these are the port
that I want for my USB interface and
upload this sketch great bring up the
serial monitor they've got a few
readings here
so 99 330 okay that works and turn the
LED on and off great alright so just
like before will unplug the USB cable
again power from the battery and connect
the USB module just try the next row
okay so back into
discovery mode for the Bluetooth module
and bring up my bluetooth preferences
there's the hc0 six you won't connect
automatically so I'm gonna have to
forget it and go through the process of
connection again
so obviously this process is slightly
different on other operating systems but
again I repeat that it's the same
process to can that you follow to
connect with any other Bluetooth device
so that's one two three four and
connected great now let's go back to my
adeno IDE and select when you port hc0
six and bring up the serial monitor
again great so we've got information
being sent over the photoresistor
sending us data started turn on the LED
as well you go they'll it is on it is
off so all again that is happening
wirelessly they can imagine now how you
can use a method like this to provide
let's say basic telemetry for your
project so if you've got a project and
you'd like it to be able to send you
data untethered to your computer then
using a Bluetooth module is just a
drop-in replacement for your USB
connection and this is a method that I
used in one of my other courses in the
Arduino robot cause where I had a small
either in a wheeled robot and I wanted
able to get telemetry from its sensors
to see what the robot is doing as its
operating and then having a USB cable
tell it to it because the or what is
more bio was a bit awkward and it made
testing
quite hard so all I had to do was just
plug in the bluetooth module directly
onto the header of the other you know
and I had a drop-in replacement serial
connection that allowed me to do this
title telemetry it was pretty easy to do
great so now you know how to send and
receive text from your other you know
using a Bluetooth module in the next
lecture I'd like to show you one more
thing and that is how to be able to use
both the Bluetooth module and the USB
interface at the same time without
having to unplug USB in order to upload
a new sketch to the Arduino so let's go
ahead and look at that next thanks for
watching if you'd like to learn more
