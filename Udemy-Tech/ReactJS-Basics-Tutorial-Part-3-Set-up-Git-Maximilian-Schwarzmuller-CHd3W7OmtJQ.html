was just about to do that and then
recognize that this might be interesting
for our people too
I'm setting up get here now I treated it
with getting it of course need to have
downloaded and installed it on your
machine so dad sets up a git repository
and then I created this git ignore file
to tailgate which files I don't want to
see on git and which files and folders
are these its denote modules folder
because this can be recreated with npm
install it then is the dist folder
because that will be created by web pack
automatically and it's in my case G dot
idea folder which is just the hidden
folder which holds my project
configuration by my IDE it would also be
the NPM debug - dot log file if you got
this which is a file which gets created
in case of any errors with NPM and I
don't want to use worse than dead file -
so these are the files I'm putting there
and with all these files in place I will
just well make my initial commit so add
all files which are not ignored you
might get repository and then commit
them with the commit - and message which
is my initial commit setup finished
that's actually my master branch here
but I will also create a new branch for
this check it out which will be called
setup and this should then also hold the
very same cold
so with that I'll continue with the next
video just wanted to share this with you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
