you troubleshoot CCNA scenarios in
preparation for the CCNA exam we've been
told that PC one on the left in this
topology is unable to ping PC two in
this topology I'm using gns3 and Cisco
IOS
V routers as Radha 1 and Radha T and to
mimic the pcs in the topology
and don't trust a user when they tell
you something as Ronald Reagan said
trust but verify we've been told for
that PC one is not able to ping PC two
and we've verified that that's true
notice we're getting a u in the output
which means that the traffic is being
forwarded to a router and that Rada
doesn't know what it do with a traffic
now to ensure that trace rot runs
quickly I'll disable IP domain lookup
and then we'll run a traceroute to PC to
notice the traffic is getting to write a
1 but is not going any further
so it looks like there's a problem on
router 1 on rider 1 show IP rot show IP
route shows us that the only routes in
the routing table are directly connected
networks and the local IP addresses on
the Radha because this is a remote
network we need to run writing protocols
on Radha 1 and route it to to exchange
routes so Radha one needs to learn about
a network 10 one-30 from router 2 so on
router one show IP protocols are we
running a routing protocol and the
answer is yes we are we running OSPF
OSPF is enabled in area 0 on gigabyte 0
0 and in area 1 on gigabyte 0 1 so show
IP ospf a neighbor we don't have any
neighbor relationships though show IP
ospf interface brief OSPF is enabled on
gigabit 0/0 in area 0 and it's enabled
on gigabyte 2 0 1 in area 1 so rather
one looks good
what about write it to show IP protocols
we are running OSPF on Radha too but can
you spot the problem you should be able
to see it in the output of this command
to help you show IP ospf interface brief
notice OSPF is not running on any
interfaces on Radha - why is that look
at the
output it's rotting for networks 10.10
dot 0 0 0 0 255 this means there's an
exact match on the first 3 octets in
other words OSPF is only running on
Network Ten 10.0 do we have any
interfaces in that network show IP
interface brief no we don't we have an
IP address configured as follows and one
configured as follows
oh SPF is not running on any interfaces
on this radha show run pipe section OSPF
that allows us to view the OSPF
configuration so oh s PF has been
configured but notice the network
command has been configured incorrectly
so radha OSPF 1 no
network 10100 the command should be 10 1
0 0 0 0 255 255 now you don't have to do
it that way but that's one of the
options
notice suddenly a neighbor relationship
is established let's have a look at the
output against a show IP ospf interface
let's rather do a brief because that's
too much output notice OSPF is now
enabled on both interfaces of router to
show IP protocols this looks a lot
better show IP ospf neighbor neighbor
relationship is established to router 1
show IP rot we have an inter area rut on
router to to network 10110 and on Radha
1 show IP ospf neighbor
we have a neighbor relationship to 10 1
2 3 1 show IP rot we have learnt a route
through OSPF now notice it's not an
inter area route the route is in the
writing-table but it's showing as an
intra area route
whereas this route is an inter area rot
Campisi 1 paying PC to answer is yes so
this is a decision that you would need
to make based on your design show IP
protocols on Radha 1 shows us that OSPF
has one interface gigabit is 0 0 in area
0 that's fine
this interface is in area 1 whereas on
router to you we have both interfaces in
area 0 so the network works but perhaps
you want to do it this way so rather a
wispy f1 network 10120 and do it more
explicitly and then network 10 1 3 0
I'll show you the output in a moment if
you weren't sure about what I was typing
so show run section OSPF we have two
Network commands configured this network
is an area 0 based on this command
and this network is in area two based on
this command show IP ospf neighbor
neighbor relationship is established we
have an inter area rut on router 2 and
on right of one we now see an inter area
route 10 1 3 0 / 24 in other words this
network is in area 0
this is area two and this is area 1 it's
important that you update your
documentation and make sure that you
configure your network correctly per the
documentation so to confirm that show IP
protocols this is correct its area zero
this is also correct
that's area one show IP protocols on
router 2 output looks as follows this
network 10120 is in area zero and this
one is an area 2 now the reason why we
have a difference in the output
he's noticed the interfaces on router to
don't have OSPF commands on them we
enabled
OSPF in the writing process using the
network command
whereas on Rada one
Oh SPF was enabled on the interfaces
individually and not under the OSPF
process both methods work in IP version
4 in IP version 6 you need to use this
method to enable OSPF on individual
interfaces so that's an example of how
to troubleshoot OSPF please comment on
the video let me know if it was useful
to you please also subscribe thanks for
watching and all the very best</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
