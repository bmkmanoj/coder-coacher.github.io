options this particular lecture is
designed to broaden the horizons so that
you realize that it's not just
Salesforce administrators that get hired
with this certification that's also a
prerequisite for other certifications
but additionally there's a lot of
different jobs out there that sometimes
will have this particular certification
as a requirement so the admin
certification serves as a baseline or
foundation that establishes a certain
level of experience and knowledge that
you have on the Salesforce platform and
once you've exemplified that experience
in knowledge you have a lot of different
options as far as career path goes and
jobs that you could potentially fill the
the most obvious one would be that of a
Salesforce administrator and there's a
lot of jobs out there for administrators
in addition to that I've seen jobs for
data analysts and that would be around
running reports and creating reports and
dashboards things that have to do with
analytics and you usually see this admin
certification coupled with some excel
experience for instance or maybe some
SQL so if you have a background and
experience with Excel and especially if
you had some SQL experience then you may
want to hone in on a data analyst path
and really focus on the reports and
dashboards and then once you're
certified as well there's a lot of data
analyst jobs that you can find there's
also a path you can take that's called
in Salesforce parlance is called
implementation specialist and these have
to do with the consultant exams and so
this administrator certification is a
prerequisite for the sales cloud
consultant and service cloud consultant
exams which I mentioned previously and
so if your end goal is to be a
consultant and work on the platform
you've got to get this exam out of the
way and past and then you can do things
like help implement Salesforce with
companies a lot of times companies will
buy Salesforce they'll buy their
licenses and then they're stuck with
well now why how do we get this running
in our organization is
they will hire out a cell sports partner
that specializes in implementation to
get them off the ground and running and
so you can find yourself very needed
within those partner companies as well
additionally I've seen people with this
administrative certification that served
the role of a business analyst these are
individuals that will gather
requirements set up meetings with
subject matter experts they'll create
what are called user stories and they
will gather the requirements to then
hand off to developers and
administrators to then build a solution
on the platform sue if you have a firm
understanding of the platform if you
have the certification that goes a long
way in knowing what the platform can and
can't do in water good candidates for
the platform and what should be
leveraged through other solutions as
well I've also run into people that had
this certification that serve as a
project manager and a lot of times on
Salesforce related projects that I've
worked on as either an administrator or
developer in addition to the business
analysts that I've spoken about earlier
I've seen project managers that also
have a really good understanding of the
platform and an effective project
manager is someone that can manage
people can meet deadlines can you know
usually we'll know some sort of project
management software and familiar with
you know keeping a budget and keeping
things on a schedule and it's real
helpful as far as cell sports projects
relate to have a team of individuals and
ideally you want a project manager you
want a business analyst and you want a
developer two or five or whatever and
for the day-to-day operations you want
one or two administrators to handle
things like provisioning user accounts
deactivating users create reports
dashboards loading data that sort of
thing other job possibilities that are
available to you once you've attained
this certification would be marketing
manager I've worked with marketing
managers that have the admin
certification and they've really focused
in on the campaign side of things a
campaign
be a marketing campaign where they're
tracking their leads and sending emails
through the Salesforce platform and
there's a lot of functionality on the
back end of that that you can do through
either third-party applications such as
a Lacroix or native Salesforce
applications such as ExactTarget or par
dot other jobs that I've run into people
serving on the platform with this
certification would be technical
pre-sales engineer this is someone that
would be familiar with the Salesforce
platform and would be assisting a sales
person that's you know going to a client
site or doing a demo and the pre-sales
engineer some ones that would set up a
new Salesforce instance and set up
specific objects and page layouts and a
certain view so that it's relatable to
the client that they're trying to sell
to so that if you're trying to sell to a
telecom company you have telecom related
verbage on the page layouts and and
potentially even some of their accounts
and set up and loaded up and that sort
of thing so that you're not trying to
you know sell a telecom customer and
you've got a dairy farm for the example
you know that helps bring success having
this certification
if sells is more your route and you want
to kind of help Co facilitate that the
technical pre-sales engineer could be
the way to go additionally I've seen
sales managers I've seen people that
have gone on to become developers and
that's a real common thing is that and
that's kind of the path that I took
because I wasn't a traditional developer
in the sense that I couldn't code in my
sleep I knew how to do HTML but I didn't
know Java or a Ruby or anything like
that and so my introduction to
object-oriented concepts and being able
to now code came through first learning
how to do the declarative side of things
on the Salesforce platform and I
personally got my developer
certification first and then went back
and got the admin and an advanced admin
certifications but in the ideal scenario
you want to get the admin certification
first so that you know what can be done
declarative way rather than with
and that makes you a better developer in
the end so if you're ultimately wanting
to be a developer this administrator
certification is valuable in that it
helps you know a lot of the things that
aren't covered on the developer side of
things there's things that are glossed
over or not you won't be strong in if
you skip the admin side of things like
security the profiles and roles and that
sort of thing so additionally there's a
whole area around being a Technical
Architect itself forces branching that
out for a lot of different areas because
this gets into really a deep in the
technical side of things and so they've
got levels of certifications now for
domain specialists and then domain
architect and then finally technical
architect hopefully this gives you an
idea is that you've got a lot of options
and you know I wanted to spend a little
time going over this so you see that
you're not necessarily going to use this
certification just to be an
administrator and if that's why you want
to do that's fine you know being an
administrator is a full-time job and
usually once Salesforce org has 75 to
100 users they need a full-time resource
to maintain the platform and
troubleshoot and take care of issues as
they arise and so that's that's
definitely I think the vast majority of
people that's the job that they feel
when they get to certification but
there's a lot of people out there that
go on to do other things and so I think
the main key is that this course covers
the foundation and then from there you
know just exposing you to different
opportunities that are out there and
you'll you'll find your way you'll your
passion will lead you and where you
ultimately need to end up because this
platform is so massive and ever-changing
that no one person can know it all the
longer I go on the platform the more I
realize I don't know and so you you've
got to find a specialty and a niche on
the platform and you can support a you
know a highly profitable career working
in just a specific niche of the platform
whether that's admin or developer or
architect technical pre-sales engineer
or whatever any one of the
you'll have recruiters bugging you to
death so it's a good problem to have
it's a good time to be on the platform
so the goal for you is for right now is
just get the foundation laid and then
let your passion guide you from there
