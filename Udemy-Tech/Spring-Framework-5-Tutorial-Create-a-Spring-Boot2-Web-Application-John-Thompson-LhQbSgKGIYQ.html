the founder of Spring Framework guru and
in this video I'm gonna show you how
easy it is to create a simple
application using spring boot 2 and the
spring framework and what we're going to
do is to display some simple jokes and
we're going to utilize a tool called
time leaf which is a templating engine
and we'll take jokes from a random joke
generator for Chuck Norris quotes and
we'll take those little Chuck Norris
jokes and display them on a web page I'm
going to show you how to do that using
spring framework 5 and spring framework
to era I'm sorry spring boot 2 and what
we're going to do is go through and step
by step we're going to build this now
after this little section of the video
the rest of this is from my course
spring framework 5 beginner to guru this
is a section of the course where we do
go in and build that joke set so I'm
going to share this with you we're gonna
assemble the lessons together now in the
full course you will get full access to
all the source code examples not going
to have that on YouTube but you will see
everything step by step and all the code
that is generated for it so you should
be able to build a working example so
it's pretty pretty easy application
using spring framework we are going to
use spring boot 2 in this and we will
get a working web application that's
going to display a little Chuck Norris
quotes or Chuck Norris jokes so I hope
you enjoy this video I think you'll get
some value out of it if you are new to
the spring framework
all right we're gonna have a lot of fun
in this module of the course what we
want to do is create a web application
for displaying jokes and we're gonna
have some fun we're gonna use Chuck
Norris quotes in my spring boot actuator
course I did a project for a spring boot
actuator to display random Chuck Norris
quotes and I happen to have that jar up
on maven central so we can pull down
that jar into this project and get a
ready-made random Chuck Norris quote so
the format is it's going to be a little
bit different I'm going to give you an
assignment in the next module we'll go
through the assignment and you'll have a
downloadable PDF that you can use of
that assignment I'm going to challenge
you to work through it because this is
going to use stuff that we've used all
the way through the course so far and
this is a chance for you to apply it now
I am going to go through that assignment
and then the rest of this module in this
course is we we will go step by step to
go through that assignment so I'll show
you exactly that so I'm going to give
you a challenge so you can go out and do
try to take on the challenge and if you
get stuck don't worry because I'm going
to go through everything step by step
we'll do the live coding exercises and
I'll walk you through it step by step
and at the end of this in this module of
course you'll have a working little joke
gap that you can hit refresh on and see
a little Chuck Norris quote should be a
lot of fun to do
all right we are gonna go over an
assignment to build the spring boot joke
app and the first thing we want to do is
head over to spring initializer and
create a brand-new spring boot project
and in that project all we are going to
need is the web in time leaf dependency
so just those two to two dependencies
will work for us and we are going to add
in a dependency this is from my spring
food actuator course where we had a
little Chuck Norris jokes ener ATAR and
we want to bring this jar into our
project so we're gonna add that to maven
as a dependency or if you want as you're
working through this you can also use
Gradle that is at your option and then
we need to get a handle on the Chuck
Norris quotes class from that jar and we
are going to call the method get random
quote and that will give us a random
Chuck Norris joke to display on the web
application the next thing that we want
to do is create a spring MVC jokes
controller and we want to map the
context route to that and I found
sometimes it can get a little flaky so
we want to do slash and an empty string
and that should should keep things happy
with that as far as mapping the root
context so in that way we can get just
go to localhost 8080 and our joke page
will display so we're not gonna map
anything complex there next we want to
pass in the model to our controller and
we are going to append a joke property
to that and from our service layer we
are going to get that that joke and
append it to the model and we're gonna
pass that back to a time leaf and then
on step seven there we are gonna return
a view name of Chuck Norris and then of
course we want to create a time leaf
template called Chuck Norris and on that
template we're gonna want to display the
joke string property so I'll leave that
up to you as to how you format the HTML
and we'll go through and add a property
there and then of course we want to run
the app and we should be able to hit it
hit refresh and see a random Chuck
Norris joke display on the web page
you
okay in this section what we want to do
is create a brand-new spring project and
we're gonna use supreme initializer do
that and I'm gonna do it right from
inside of IntelliJ so I'm gonna come up
to file it's a new new project and we
are gonna use spring initializer you can
see that it is there at start dot spring
Daioh and if you are not using IntelliJ
you can go right to that website you
know I'll toggle that over to that right
now there's a spring initializer website
so you can go there and generate project
and that will download a zip file that
you can use for the starter of the
project but I'm gonna use IntelliJ
through for this demo come back over
here to IntelliJ and we leave it at the
default and say next and I'm just going
to use my domain dot joke and I'm just
going to call it a joke app and snapshot
versions alright
currently Java 1:8 is the preferred
flavor of Java anxiously waiting pound
Java 9 right now and all we need is the
web dependency and then we also want
time leaf so that's under template
engines so just a recap so under web the
web dependency then template engines
time leaf so that's the only two
dependencies we need or the spring
initializer and I am going to go up here
and grab the milestone one of spring
both spring boot two and I will update
this in the future as the new milestones
and releases come out
and here and I want put it I have a
directory called spring five jokes app
again now I'm gonna say finish and we
can see that it is coming down while
IntelliJ is doing this thing let's
toggle over here and I've already
created a github repository so I'll be
under my github account spring framework
guru and this will be spring 5 - jokes
app and once I get this loaded I am
going to commit it to github but I won't
let you see that part I don't think we
need to be teaching you get at this
point so the spring boot application has
downloaded we can see that we have an
initial project so we have a basic
spring boot application and we are ready
to start coding on it now one thing I
just noticed is that we have an on
manage palm file found so IntelliJ is
not happy let's take a look at that and
I'm going to come over here to maven
projects see if it refresh will do it
there we go so you may or may not have
to do that IntelliJ is usually pretty
good some surprise we had that little
hiccup there but sometimes it does
happen and we can see that is currently
indexing the dependencies and I noticed
this red icon here so for some reason
tell J isn't seeing everything yet but
it is indexing and as it resolves the
dependencies that should come up and
work properly ok I resumed the indexing
finish IntelliJ did find all the
dependencies so now this does look like
a normal intelligent project that we've
created out of Spring Buddha initializer
I'm leaving this in just in case you
guys are following along inside of
IntelliJ and you you run into this
little hiccup initially it did not pick
up the maven project and all I did is
click refresh and it found it right away
and then indexed it
okay I've gone ahead and added a readme
for that in this project that's the only
thing I had you can see it
I got a headline spring boot jokes app
and describing that it's a Chuck Norris
application and we can see that it is
now pushed up in github so I just want
to clarify the the master branch of this
isn't just going to be the original
spring boot project I may go back and
update the releases at spring boot goes
through the release cycle for spring 5
and spring boot too but for now that
this is just as it is came out of as it
came out of the spring boot initializer
so we've completed steps 1 and 1.1 and
what we want to do now is add in the
dependency for the Chuck Norris for
actuator this will bring in that jar
file and if we come over to maven
central we can see that there's the
dependency and currently version zero
zero two has been released and if
anybody wants to contribute go ahead and
fork it and add in a joke and send me a
pull request and I'll do it another
release so we're gonna come back over
here to our maven pom and all we need to
do is add in that dependency and we'll
get out of the free advertisement for
maven repository and I just want to
point out as far as maven pom management
I usually like leaving the spring stuff
at the top and then any other
dependencies that I add and then at the
bottom I like to have the tests and
that's kind of a convention that a lot
of Java developers follow
it's a rough convention there's no
official convention there but this is
pretty common to see and we're going to
go ahead and import those changes and we
can see down at the bottom that IntelliJ
has refreshed and if I come in to maven
projects and look at the dependencies
you should see that
there it is so there's the jar you can
see that he's bringing in actually
brings in spring food actuator so it as
a requirement so we shouldn't be happy
when we run this and somebody in dented
with tabs instead of spaces tabs are
evil in my opinion very hotly debated
topic amongst developers but I I
definitely do prefer spaces over tabs
and that completes the second step so we
now have the dependency in the next
video we will go in and create a service
to return a joke from the Chuck Norris
quotes class
okay we are looking at the third step
here to create a service so I'm going to
switch over to IntelliJ and create a
service that is going to return back a
random quote string from that jar file
where we have the the class Chuck Norris
quotes and we're gonna use the method
get random quote so let's come over to
IntelliJ and you can see that I have the
application up and what I want to do is
take a quick look at that class and if
you do command o inside of IntelliJ and
say that I already had had that typed
but if you do we get Chuck Norris quotes
and if you just hit enter now you can
inspect the class that came in out of
that jar you can see nothing too too
crazy here it's simple ArrayList and we
put in a bunch of bunch of strings and
then we have a method here that's going
to get a random quote off that Ray list
so nothing too crazy there I'm going to
close that and what we want to do is
create a package now for our services
and now we'll create a new Java and
we're going to do an interface here and
we'll specify that as an interface and
we will say okay and now we want to add
in one method I turn back a string so
pretty simple just get joke and see that
it has been created and it's green
because I have not added it to get hope
yet now let's create an implementation
for that
so we can see that right away IntelliJ
highlights that it read and if I do
command and implement methods so here's
where things can get a little
interesting so let's do so we're gonna
do a final property there and so now
let's go in create a constructor to
initialize that variable almost like
none so we have a zero our constructor
okay the reason I'm doing this is just
to be a little bit more efficient in in
our Java code so I'm doing a final
variable there and so it cannot be
changed I'm initializing it inside the
constructor so the constructor doesn't
need know anything about it and that way
what's going to happen when this class
runs inside a spring spring will create
at once and then will be reused in that
class so it's not going to get created
with every request if I were to run this
I could have just created that inside my
method but then every time I ran we'd
have the overhead of that object
creation so just a little bit more
efficient showing you some a little bit
of Java tips here so now we need to
return that so now we had just added in
a method call there on line 18 to return
back a random quote and the last thing
we want to do is make this a service so
we need to add in the at service
annotation so just a just to recap what
I did
I'm created a services package created a
joke service interface with one method
to get a joke and return a string and
then we created an implementation of
that so we are writing to the interface
and we created a private variable set
final so it can't be changed
and we initialized that that class
inside the constructor for a joke
service implementation and then we are
gonna have the method get joke return
back a random quote from that class so
our services all set to go now and that
completes test number three on our
assignment to create a spring boot jokes
out
oK we've completed the first three steps
on our assignment and what we want to do
now is go in and create the MVC
controller for the jokes so we don't
want to map the context route and add a
property of joke so first note eckle 4
through 7 here so let's go through and
and do that now I'm going to toggle over
to IntelliJ and will will start knocking
this out so first up I'm gonna create a
new package for the controllers and
let's create a Joe controller go ahead
and add that to github for you guys and
we want to annotate this as a controller
now we created that service we want to
be able to use that service from there
our controller so there's the property
for that I'm going to hit command n for
new will create a constructor joke
service and spring will auto wire this
for us but I'm gonna show you the
annotation so that shows our intent now
we want to add in a method that's gonna
get called and it's going to return a
string so there's our show
joke method and let's at we want to use
the request mapping parameter now we're
gonna add in a couple honest so / + MV
empty string so that that's going to map
out the context root for us now we need
to append the model with a property for
the joke so we're gonna specify that as
a input parameter to the method and the
spring framework will pass in an
instance of the model now we want to add
an attribute and that property is going
to be from the joke service get joke and
then finally what we want to do is a
return our view name and we said to use
the view Chuck Norris from our
assignment so now we are gonna be
telling the time leaf template engine to
show us that view for Chuck Norris which
doesn't exist yet and we'll be creating
that in the next video so just to recap
we added in in the joke controller we
annotated it on line 12 with app
controller this makes it a spring
component a spring MVC controller we
added in our joke service and we are
using the interface and we added a
constructor for the joke service which
will get auto wired by spring and then
we created a method on line 23 their
show joke and that will take in a model
and we are adding an attribute to the
model called joke and it will be a
random joke string from the joke service
and we are returning back the view name
of Chuck Norris and then finally on line
22 and that is what setting up their
request mapping so when we get a request
to the context root this method on the
controller will get invoked to go to the
joke service get a joke append it to the
model and return it back
you layer so you're filing along that
completed number four number five number
six and number seven
okay back to our assignment in this
section what we want to do is create the
view layer and so on number eight we
want to create a timely view for Chuck
Norris and we want display the joke
string property and at the end of this
we will run the application and see
jokes displayed in our browser so let's
toggle over to IntelliJ now and by
default Spring Buddha it's gonna keep
everything in the templates directory
and if you pull this down from github
the template directly might not be there
that's one of the problems with github
it if I remember correctly it does not
store empty directories so sometimes
I'll confuse people but the time leaf
templates will be kept under resources'
slash templates so we want to do now is
come in and create a new HTML file and
we are going to do html5 we're gonna
call it Chuck Norris and add that to get
now the first thing that we want to do
is add and the time leaf XML space and
I'm gonna cheat I have one over here and
I cut and paste that in because I don't
want to type all that out so what this
does is it makes this a XML template
using the time leaf space let's change
our title to jokes
now we have a little paragraph tag and
we're going to say joke here now we can
take a quick preview of this okay so
this is the natural time leaf template
and this is what's naturally going to
look like in the browser so a little
chuck norris joke insert joke here that
is our template and what we want to do
is come in here and we are going to use
the time leaf command to substitute out
that paragraph tag so we are using this
tag so this time leaf tag the text tag
says basically replace the text step and
that's in between the paragraph tags of
the HTML and that's gonna work based on
our controller so we are appending the
model attribute joke from the joke
service so it's going to get that and
append that into the text so it's
looking for that out of the model so
let's go ahead and run this now you can
see that it's building down at the
bottom and I have port 8080 in use on
something else hold on one second okay
this is actually something that does
happen quite a bit I had a another
IntelliJ window open I had left Tomcat
running on 8080 and you can see here
it's complaining about 8080 saying
that's the port may already be in use
which exactly and that's what it was so
as you develop in spring you will
definitely see this I promise you that
so we're gonna restart it now and we see
that we came up normally and let's jog
over to Chrome this time let's go to
localhost and I ran into an error here
so let's take a look see what that is
okay so I made a mistake here so that's
what happens when you see live coding so
it's looking for template Chuck Norris
and I named it Chuck Norris instead of
you I used an e so I was going in fixed
that I'm gonna go and refactor and I'm
pretty sure I'm gonna have to restart it
spring boot for that get picked up yeah
it's not happy so I'm gonna restart
spring bootie so that new template gets
picked up now further down the course
I'm going to show you spring boot dev
tools and that would have picked it up
if I had dev tools installed but I do
not so we have to do it the
old-fashioned way and bounce the
container yeah all right code runs
faster when Chuck Norris watches it I do
another one Chuck Norris causes the
windows blue screen of death I hope you
guys aren't using Windows I used to hate
that see if we get one more out of here
log statements are always at the fatal
level so fun little app I hope you
enjoyed this and let's double check our
assignment so we we went in the create a
time leaf template view for Chuck Norris
we're displaying a joke string property
and ran the app come over here and you
see that we created an html5 document we
add it in the XML namespace for time
leaf which gives us the namespace for
the time leaf tags we're using time leaf
tag of text to replace the string so
when I view this in a natural template
engine we can see that it comes up with
insert joke here that is the natural
time leaf template engine whereas if I'm
over here I am seeing that string get
replaced by a random string
I'll kill minus 9 that is one of my
favorites
okay I'm gonna show you a little tips
and tricks with spring boot and what we
can do is change the banner on startup
so when I come in and start up spring
boot and run our little joke application
you can see right at the top there I get
this a little banner that comes up so
let's change that we can do ASCII art
for that and there's a lot of different
generators out there and I got one up in
chrome right now so this is mine here
I'm gonna go ahead and copy that now you
can see you can do it a number of
different different fonts in this little
tool here so it if you just google ASCII
art and this website is one the first
ones that come up so if you want to play
with your own slogan you can do do so
the Star Wars one that's kind of cute
too so once you get that copied over to
your clipboard what you can do is come
over to IntelliJ and in your resources
folder create a file called banner dot
txt and we are gonna add that to get
I'll put it on a new branch for you guys
and now there's my my text so there's
banner text and if I come in and restart
spring bootie
now we can see that banner get created
at startup so it's actually pretty
prover s'tel and that they've added some
other features I think you can display
an image there now too that gets
rendered out but this is good enough for
now so you can override that banner text
I do that when I'm working for clients
quite a bit I will customize the banner
start up just kind of a little nice
touch to add in the clients logo name
there and you might want to put your
name there instead of having a spring
pop-up so something fun that you can do
with spring loot
now this concludes the section on the
spring boot jokes app so just a little
simple app but it got you a chance to go
through and review some of the stuff
we've been using in the course that we
were able to go in and grab idli create
a functional spring boot web application
so we went and created that project in
spring spring initializer brought it
down added in the dependency for my
little Chuck Norris quotes and then we
went ahead and created the service layer
if you remember we went in and used
interfaces for the dependency injection
to set that up as a spring service and
created the controller we injected in
the interface type spring was able to
find that in the spring context and it
found it by type and it wired it into
our controller for us we asked the
controller to return back the joke jokes
property on the view model and then we
pass that over to a time leaf template
and we now have that template binding
that property out of the model and
displaying it on a web page for us and
every time we hit refresh we go through
the whole cycle go to the service get a
random joke and display it on the web
page so fun little app but it helped
reinforce all the stuff we've learned
too through the course so far
