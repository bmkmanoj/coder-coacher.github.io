talking about web application
penetration testing before we can start
talking about that we need to understand
what is a website and just like I said
before a website is just an application
installed on a computer that computer
probably just has better specs than your
computer but it fundamentally it works
exactly just like another computer so it
has an operating system and it also has
a number of applications to allow it to
act as a web server so the main two
applications that it probably has is a
web server and a database a web server
is like Apache and the database is like
MySQL and these are the web server
basically understands and executes the
web application so your web application
would be written in PHP or Python and
any programming language really the only
thing is that the web server needs to be
able to understand and execute this web
application the database contains the
data used by the web application so all
of this is stored on a computer called
the server the computer is connected to
the internet and it has a real IP
address so anybody can access that
computer and can ping it so the web the
web application is executed by the web
server which is installed by which is
installed on your server on your target
therefore any time you request a page or
you run the web application it's
actually executed on the web server and
it's not executed at the clients
computer it gets executed at the web
server and then it sends a HTML page
which is ready to read for the target
person or for for the client so let's
have a look on an example and let's say
you're on the phone or on your computer
and you wanted to go to facebook.com so
you type in facebook.com into your URL
this will be translated using a DNS
server
an IP address so there is a server that
translates and every name comm dot edu
or any website with a name with a domain
name so this is a domain name too
it's relevant IP address so your request
facebook.com/ the request goes to a DNS
server it translates facebook.com to the
IP where Facebook is stored and then you
go a little a go to Facebook to the IP
address of Facebook it'll execute the
page that you wanted using all of the
applications that we spoke about and
then just give you ready HTML so what
you get back is just a mark-up written
in HTML which is a markup language of
the result of executing the program so
the program gets executed on the server
and then you just only get the result
this is very important because in the
future if we wanted to get anything
executed on the web server if we wanted
to get a shell or a burst shell or a
BYOs
execute on the target computer then we
need to send it into a language that the
web server understands so for example
PHP and once you execute it there it
will be executed on that computer not on
your computer so regardless of the
person that accesses the page the this
the web shell that you're gonna send if
it's written in PHP in a language that
the server understands is going to be
executed on the server and not on your
computer therefore it will give you
access to the server and not access to
the person who accessed that server
javascript on the other hand there is
some websites use javascript and
javascript is a client-side language so
if you manage to find a website that
allow you to run javascript code then
the code will be executed by the clients
so even though the code might be
injected into the web server it will be
executed on the client side and it'll
give you it'll allow you to do things to
the client computer and not to the
server so it's very important to
separate between a client-side language
and server-side language
