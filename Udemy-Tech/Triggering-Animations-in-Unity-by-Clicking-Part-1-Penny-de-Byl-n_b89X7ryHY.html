to trigger an animation by clicking on
an object that's in your scene if you
open up the starter files for this
particular lecture you'll find that
you've got your bot in there if you
press run you'll be able to actually
walk that bot around so he's already got
animations on him and some code for
moving him about now there's also a
chair in the scene which is this chair
here if we click on it you'll be able to
see that it's just a chair you can use
any other objects you like if you have a
different type of model that you want to
bring in while I'm here I might just say
when you bring an FBX model into unity
it by defaults puts an animator on it
you can see that in the inspector and
that chairs not animated itself so we're
just going to go ahead and remove that
particular component and you will get
that animator appear on a lot of the
models that you bring in so if they're
static and they're not doing any
animation just get rid of that so the
first thing we need to do is to create
our sitting animation so if I go over to
the animator in that animator for the
bot that would be called controller as
you can see down here it has the idle
and the walking and they have the
transition which is set to is walking
true to go in that direction here and is
walking false to go back so this is
similar to what we've done before and
you can see there's a speed element
which controls the rate at which you're
walking over here in this multiplier and
that will allow you to go forwards and
backwards so the code that's on that bot
in that controller is code you've seen
before so it has the usual input.getaxis
for vertical and horizontal which is
going to do your rotations and then it's
going to do your translation so this is
the starting point for this project
to begin with let's create our sitting
down animation so in the assets you'll
find that there's a stand to sit
animation a sitting idle animation and a
stand up from sitting animation now
these have all been set under their rig
tag to be humanoid so just check that in
yours now this one is called stand to
sit is where you start standing up and
then you sit down you know if we just
play that through here you'll see what
that animation looks like now I've
actually got this animation called stand
up now that's probably a little bit
misleading because it's not so let's
just change the name of this while we're
in here to make it a little more obvious
so this is sit down from standing hit
the enter key and then just hit on apply
down the bottom to apply that now once
that's done we can actually add that
stand to sit in here which will come up
as sit down from standing we then have a
sitting idle and a motion that we can
bring in because while we're on the
chair we want to stay in an idle and
then we also want to stand up so stand
up from sitting which is this one here
now I believe that it also got the wrong
name in the animations for that oh sit
down so this is let's change that to
stand up from sit and just apply that
all right so now when we bring that in
it's going to make a bit more sense when
we see it in our animation state diagram
now it doesn't matter what you call
these because as you would have seen in
previous videos they were called take
zero zero one take zero zero two this is
just for us to understand what's going
on so this first one is to sit down from
standing and we're going to make a
transition to go to sit idle and then
we'll make another transition to stand
up again okay now just ignoring this
much of the moving around I'm going to
right-click on this sit down from
standing and set it as the default state
so what's going to happen now when we
run this is that it's going to just
create a sitting down animation on our
bot so let's just have a play and watch
what happens because we want to make
sure that this sitting down is all
working for us okay so we've already
seen a few little issues there what
you'll see is when we go from this sit
down standing to sit idle is that the
bot actually sinks if we go into the
scene and play that again just watch
that after one animation he does the sit
down and then he's up in the air and
then he'll sink as he's sitting on the
chair then when he gets back up again
okay that one's all right there
so we have to play around with our
baked-in values in our different poses
to make sure that that transition is a
little bit smoother so what's happening
when we're sitting down is that there's
this Y transition that's happening that
we don't want if we go to the standard
set animation and over to the animation
tab for that so selecting the animation
from the assets folder not from up in
the animator we're going to bake in
let's bake in the rotation while we're
here and we'll bake in that Y position
and apply that and let's do that also
for the standing up one we're going to
bake in the rotation and the Y and we'll
do that also for the sitting down idle
all right so now let's just run that and
see how that's affected our sitting down
an emotion right so you can see there
that the bot didn't transition down to
the ground so we're now ready to put
this particular animation sequence in
with the other animations so we're going
to begin in the idle State so let's go
back and make that our default animation
okay and then we're going to go to this
sitting down and use a boolean value for
that so we're gonna add a ball and call
it is sitting now from the idle State
we'll go make transition to sitting down
and we'll set that to is sitting as true
and when we're going to stand up is not
when we go from stand-up to walking or
stand up to idle but we actually want to
put the standing up on this transition
so you won't ask trigger a standup will
stay sitting in this idle state until
we've decided we're going to stand the
butt up so on this transition to
standing up we'll put the condition for
is setting to false and then from there
we will automatically make a transition
going back to idle without any
particular trigger so it'll stand up and
do that animation and then just go back
into this idle animation okay so now
we're all set up and ready to go to
write some code and we'll look at the
code in the next video thanks for
