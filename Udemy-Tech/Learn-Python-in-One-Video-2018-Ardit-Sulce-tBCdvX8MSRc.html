This is an all-inclusive video
where you will learn Python from scratch
so make sure you have an hour to dedicate
to this video. My name is Ardit Sulce,
and I'm a Python instructor on Udemy.
I'm author of one of the top Python
courses on the web today, the Python Mega Course:
Build 10 Real World Applications.
The course is hosted on Udemy and
currently it has 70,000 students.
I’m also the founder and I maintain the
Python blog PythonHow.com, a blog
about Python, and I have used Python in many
areas including even studying
earthquakes where lots of data processing
is involved and so on you have to use
Python for that too, and many many
other applications.
Alright, so let's dive in! You don't need
to install anything in this tutorial.
Whether you have Python installed or not
in your computer it doesn't matter
because you're going to use an awesome
online service that gives you free
access to a Linux computer. You're going
to access that computer through it’s
terminal so you're going to give
commands unix, linux commands to the
computer to write code, and execute
programs, and create folders, and create
files etc. The terminal will be displayed
in your browser so all you need is an
internet browser which I assume you
already have and so that allows us to
focus on going straight ahead to writing
and running Python code instead of
dealing with installation issues that
can easily distract you from learning
Python. Later on if you want you can
install Python in your computer and
that's an easy process as well, but
believe me, having the possibility to write and
run Python code from the browser it will
really help you learn Python.
Moreover later in real life you're
most likely going to host your
programs on Linux servers, not on Windows
not on Mac because Linux works best
with Python and generally with hosting
applications so here is how to have
access to your own Linux server or
computer if you like, and be able to run
Python. Go to pythonanywhere.com.
That's the service you're going to use
and this is how the website looks
currently, you want to go to pricing and
sign up so you have to sign up for an
account here. And go to create
a beginner account which is free, create
a username for yourself, email, password, and
click register. I agree to the terms and
conditions, register, and that's all.
In a few seconds you’ll have access to
a Python environment. Let's look at
the tour quickly, or I can make my own
tour to you. So, I talked about using the
terminal to access your Linux computer
actually let me be clear about something
you know you're not going to have an
entire Linux computer where you have
access to everything like to install
software, let's say you cannot install
Photoshop in this computer because they
give you a certain environment with
limited memory and so on. For example
with the free plan I think you have around
500 megabytes, yeah, here is the quota of
files. If you want to pay later you can
pay. Anyway we're going to use a free
plan which is very good and yeah you
don't have a physical computer, but you
can use Python just like you're doing in
a normal computer. You can create files
and folders and you can you can install
Python libraries as well, and so other
terminal, how to open the terminal?
You can open the terminal by going to the
bash button, and then to start Python all
you have to do is type python 3.5 and
that will open Python 3.5. You can
also check if there is Python 3.6.
First exit the session.
Exit Python 3.6. I think they will
implement this in the near future.
Yeah, there is Python 3.6, great! We're going
to use Python 3.6 then. I think they,
I think they have just added this in the
last days, anyway the difference between
Python 3.5 and Python 3.6 is not very
big, so anyway. Now we have an interactive
Python session so let's start writing
our first code here. Print hello.
So what that will do is it will print the
string hello, the text hello, so this is
your first Python program, however this
is an interactive shell which means if
I exit this now, I go to the terminal again
so this is the terminal, and this here
was the interactive Python session or shell
if you like, and now I've lost this
code, I mean I didn't save it in a file,
so I lost this program. If you want to
save a program in a file which
you normally want to do with real
programs, so the Python interactive shell
is just for testing things, for testing
your code how it works in them, while you
build a program you want to test short
lines of code, short pieces of code and
so on. Now you want to insert this in
a Python program, or in a Python file in
other words a Python file contains the
Python code which in other words you
can say contains the Python program that
does something. I'm going to use an
editor here which is called nano. Nano and
then you give the name of the file, let's
say program1, pro1.py. Give it
the accession .py, so .py is
the extension for Python files.
And that will open the Nano editor where
you can write Python code.
So what you do here is go ahead and use
the print function which is a Python keyword.
Print is a Python keyword and then hello.
Then, in order to save and exit the
editor, the Nano editor you need to press
control X, you can see here it stands for
exit control X, and Nano will ask you:
Save modified buffer? So if you want to
save it you should press Y, and then enter
here, and that with save pro1.py,
the file in your local folder. Now how
to execute this program? Well, you should
write Python 3.6, and then the name of
the program pro1.py and here
you get the output printed out on
your terminal, so that's it. You just
wrote a Python program. Now without going
any deeper into Python let me tell you
few things about this terminal thing.
Maybe it looks a bit scary, so let me
explain it. I'm going to explain a few very
important Linux commands that you can
interact with the Linux computer, so now
for example where are we here?
Well, to know that you can type in pwd, so
this is a Linux, a Unix command. Pwd will
tell you where you are, so this is the
current directory, the working directory.
I'm in this folder now just like you are
in a directory on your graphical
interface on Windows, or Mac. Here we are
not in a graphical interface, but we are
currently in that folder just like you
are currently in that folder.
So everything you do here it works for this
particular folder. Now if you do ls that
will list all the files that are in the
current directory and folders as well.
We don't have any folders here.
We just have readme.txt which is
a default file and we also have pro1.py,
the file that we created
with Nano up here. Good!
Now it's good to have a good meaningful
directory structure so what I mean is
you can create some folders to have your
Python files. To create a folder you
can do mkdir and the name of the
folder that you want to create, python or
py_project. You know don't use spaces, use
underscore if you if you want to
divide the words because using spaces in
the names of your files and folders may
cause problems, so just use underscores.
And ls and you'll see that py_project
has been created. Now how can you change
the directory from the current directory
which is this one in here? How can you go
to py_project you can do that using the
CD command which stands for change
directory, and then type py and then
you can use the Tab for auto completion
and that will go to py_project or you
can type it down the complete world,
but you know, this is shorter, and now you can
see that you are in this folder.
That's your current directory. To go
back you need to do CD and two dots and
you go back here again. And to move a file
from pro1.py to another
folder like py_project you do mv which
means for move, and you see now that pro1.py
is not in this directory
anymore, it should be in here, ls yeah.
Here this, pro1.py. So I'm going to work
on this directory from now on.
And consider that the first lesson so
setting up Python on Pythonanywhere and
also creating our first program which
was print something. And now let's talk
about variables. What is a variable? Well,
let's look at our program again, you can
use the upper or down arrow keys to scroll
between your last executed commands like
if I want to find my last command Nano
pro1.py, or you can type it down.
If the command was very far away,
let’s say it was typed in earlier.
Anyway Nano pro1.py will open the
program again. Print hello, so variables,
what are variables in Python? A variable is
any name that you create that it's not
a Python keyword. Let's say name it's not
a Python keyword. Print is a Python keyword
and you don't want to use the print name
for a variable, so name is the name of
of my variable, and variables can
start with a letter or an underscore,
but they should not start with a number
because numbers they also are considered
as keywords, so you don't want to use
a number for naming, for starting
a variable name, but you can use a variable,
a number, sorry like here. That would be
a valid variable name and then you assign
a value to that variable, and then if you
assign a variable, a value to that variable,
so that variable now is like a container.
It contains that value currently and
here what you can do is you want to
print out name1 variable, control X, Y,
and enter to execute. Python 3.6 pro1.py.
Sorry! I mistyped
python 3.6.
So guess what output are you going
to get for a while! Well, we're going to
get hello because now you can go with
the upper arrow key to open Nano
again so the variable was holding this
value therefore the value of variable is
printed out, however if you update the
variable with another name like that,
control X, Y and enter my browser got
crazy at the moment. Anyway it's not
a problem, just a display issue. Python 3.6.
So this time we got hi executed, why?
Because this is something important you
should know about Python, how python
execute programs.
So when python execute a script, this is
called a script, or a program if you like.
So a script is executed from top to
bottom, so Python first goes to execute
the first line so what it does is it
assigns the hello string to name1, to
that variable and then you're using
again that variable and assign a new
string to that, so at this point the name1
variable will be updated with a new
value and therefore when you print out,
when you use the print function which is
designed to print something on the
terminal
that the function will print out the last
value, and of course you can
assign numbers to variables like 10, or
even numbers with a decimal point like
10.5 and of course you can
print them out like that, and you'll get
10 and this brings us to the other
lecture which is about data types, so
this is how you create variables.
Now data types. We have different data types
in Python and actually we just used three
of the data types in here. This is called
a string data type. It is always enclosed
in quotes. They can be either double
quotes, or single quotes, so even if you
had single quotes the script would work
again. That's a string. Now we have
integers. An integer is a whole number.
So it's not a decimal point number with
a dot here, so you can have minus 10,
minus nine, minus one, zero, one, 100,
1000, those are integers. Then we
have floats, floats are numbers with
a decimal point, and if you don't trust me
you can actually print out the type of
name2 for instance, and also the type of
name3. Make sure that you have an equal
number of opening and closing round
brackets or parentheses if you like,
otherwise you'll get an error, so let me
try this and printing out the type of 10,
and the type of 10.5.
And here is what you get, so this is
a class int which stands for integer and
this is a class float which stands for
floats, so for integers and floats. Now we
also have more compound data types in
Python such as lists. A ist is, let's
say, or was named it differently mylist1
equals to, you have to open closed
brackets and so a list is an array
that contains multiple objects. Now an
object is considered this one here, this
is an object, this is an object.
Everything in Python actually is
an object and you're going to learn
later on that you also have more
complex objects such as a file, an excel
file that you load in Python, so that's
also a data type, a certain type that has
certain properties, and you can do
certain things with those types, and so on.
So we have lists which are very
important, and they can have multiple
data types. Let’s say it has 1, and
maybe it has ‘Hi there’, a string, maybe 10.5,
and maybe variable name2 also, why not?
Let's go ahead and print out that list
object, my list dot, mylist1, control X,
Y, and enter, execute, and this is what you get.
So we got printed out all the items
of the list, even 10.5 for the name2
variable, so don't confuse variables with
objects, with constants so to say. ‘Hi’ is
a constant, ‘Hello’ is a constant when you
put them in quotes, so those are data
types. A variable name is a variable name
is a variable. It can hold multiple
different objects inside, okay.
Now maybe you're confused about why we
have different data types, but let me
open a Python interactive session.
We have different types of objects, of data
in Python because that's a way to keep
things organized like if you want to
perform an additional operation between
h and 1 Python will tell you that
you're doing something wrong, be
careful with that. I mean you try to add
to the wrong type to your string, so
you can actually add up strings h plus h
would be hh, but you cannot add up
a string with a number. Of course if this
was a text, a string you’d get h1, so you
need to explicitly tell Python what
your intention is, so do you intend to
use one as a number or as a string?
Because it changes things like one.
Sorry! Plus ‘1’ gives ‘11’ which is
a string, and sometimes you want to do that
to make the operation between two
strings which are numbers, but you know
you want to treat them as a string,
and the way to treat them as a string is
by using these quotes, but if you want to
treat them as numbers, you do this
without quotes, you get 2. Now you should
also know that every, all the data types
they have different methods attached to
them, you can see a list of methods using
dir function, so this will tell us what
methods you can apply to string data
types, or you can also do you know any
kind of string there. You'd get the same
exact output, so this I would say don't look
at these methods with unerscores because
they are used internally by Python and
you're not going to use them, but these
are methods that you can use, so for
example capitalize. What happens if you
do ‘Hello’.
capitalize() and you need to use brackets
there. Well it didn't do anything, sorry,
because mmm this has to be a lowercase h.
So if you pass a lower cage, a lower
case h in the string ‘hello’ it will
capitalize the first letter, and so you
would say what if I want to capitalize
all the letters of the string? Well, you have
to look at the methods listed here maybe
you'll find something that makes
sense, so for example upper, maybe upper.
You say ‘hello’.upper, and you get HELLO in
capital letters, uppercase in other words.
Now if you look at integers, methods for
an integer, you'll see that they are
different from strings actually, and
actually it's only a few of them because
mostly you're going to use integers
using operators such as that, or a minus
operator such as that. You get a negative
number. Or you can use division like that.
So basically what happenes, what's
happening here is that you're using
shortcuts, operators are like shortcuts
of these methods in here, so what else
do you have? You have division, 2 times
for instance 10, you get 20.
You can also do division, sorry, operations
with floats as well. All the operators to
use with integers you can use them with
floats too, and you have the power,
so 2 in power 3 is 8, 2 times 2 times 2
it gives 8. You can also use the division,
the floor division operator like you
know, type 4 and you get 2, and now for
more advanced math operations Python
doesn't have everything by default
loaded, so you don't have a built in
function, a built in operator for the
square root, but is very easy to import
the math module, import math, then you do
math dot square root of 9, and you get 3.0.
So a math is it's like a built-in,
a Python module that you can load in
Python, but normally Python doesn't load
it by default because it doesn't want
to make your program heavy with loads,
lots of names, of functions, and objects.
But if you want to load it then you can
do that. All right, let me exit this session.
Now I'm going to talk about user input.
Let me open pro1.py, our program, so user input.
Until now all you have seen is just
a useless program like you write something
in your program and then very statically
you output what you wrote using a print
statement, but what was it was a point of
that? I mean where is the user, you're not
interacting with an user. You are the
program, you're writing your strings and
you're printing your own strings, but how
about letting the user to
actually send some output, for example
the user wants to submit
their name and you want to print out
their name dynamically, so depending
on what they input. To get
user input, to create a prompt for the
user you need to use the input function.
Input.
Like enter your name. Maybe put some
colon there, and a space to make it user
friendly, the message, and now let me go
ahead and execute this to see
what you get.
Enter your name, Ardit. And what happened
is we got the list print out. Why is that?
That's because all you did is
you’re assigning some values in
your variables and then you create a list
variable as well, and then you ask the
user for some input. The user enters that
input, and that's it. I mean you're not
saving that input into a variable,
and you are not processing that input.
All you do is print your list which is this
one here, that's what Python does, so what
you want to do is assign a variable
here, user name maybe if you like.
And just pass the variable in there, enter
your name, Ardit, and you get Ardit
printed out, but you can't do better than
that like go to your print function and do
something cool like your name is.
Then you use a string formatter here,
or a placeholder in other words which is
%s, that's a special string
that is going to be replaced by the
value of the variable that comes after
this percentage operator in here.
So what's going to happen is that the print
function will print out this string and
then if it finds this %s it
will look for the value after the
percentage sign, so in this case this is
a variable, but you can also put a string
here, but in this case this will be
replaced by the value of the variable.
Let's test this, so your name is Ardit.
That's a cool program that you can make.
That's about user input and making your
script dynamic, but this is a very very
simple example. Later you going to
make programs, more advanced programs in
real life like let's say you ask the
user to enter some coordinates of their
position, and then you produce a web map
showing their position on the web map.
Yeah, that would be possible to do.
And this is what the user input. Now let's
talk about conditionals, conditionals in
Python. Well, conditionals, let's say,
let's say this is actually a user name.
Let's call this enter your user name,
or enter a user name, let's suppose,
let's suppose that the user is, you have
a program where you are asking the user to
enter a new username they want to create
a username.
And then you have some rules like you
don't want the user name to be less than
five characters and you want the program
to decide whether to do something or
something else, so whether to let's say
print the string ‘username valid’, or the
string ‘user name is not valid’. How to do
that? Well, that is done using
conditionals, and conditionals are used
using if and else key words, so let's say
if, sorry! If the length, we use
the len function to find out how many
characters a string has. Len username.
If it is greater or equal to six
characters, so six would be a valid
username with six characters, but even if
it is greater than that we'll accept it.
You need to use a colon here, enter, and here you
need to use indentation which basically
is white space, and normally it's a good
practice to use four white spaces, one, two,
three, sorry four. Indentation tells
Python that the line you're going to
write in here depends or is part of this
block here, so of the conditional block.
If the length of the username is greater,
or equal to six then you want to print out
the string ‘username is fine’ like that.
Enter, else, a colon again, enter, one, two,
three, four, print ‘is not fine’, and that's it.
And let’s leave the other the print function
there, it doesn't do any harm.
Let me see what we get!
Enter username. Let me enter a short
username. So it says username it's not
fine, and we also got this other string
here, your name is Ar. Let me try again.
Upper arrow key. Ardit1. User name is fine
because this actually has one, two,
three, and four, and five, and six
characters. Now if you want to also have
an upper limit here like let's say ten
here, so what are we doing here is saying
if the length of the username so if this
number here is less than 10, and greater
but greater than six or equal to 6, so if
it is between two numbers we say
username is fine, else print username is
not fine, so let's put a long number
there, and you get user name is not fine.
If you have a user name with seven
digits, seven characters you get user
name is fine. So that's about
conditionals. Now let's look at loops.
A loop is used to perform an action
multiple times, for example what if you
want to print out all the items of
mylist1 each at one line? Well, you could
do like print mylist1, and you'd access
the first item of the list like that.
Print mylist1, one here. Let me
explain what zero and one means.
You know lists they have a hidden index
system, so the items of the list, each of the
items has an index, the index starts from
zero, so the first item will have an
index of zero, the second item will have
an index of one, the third item an index of
two, three, and so on, so this expression
here will print out one, and this other
one will print out ‘Hi there’.
Let's test this! So look at the end.
1 and ‘Hi there’, but you know this is not
very efficient because I have to write
this four times using all the indexes,
but imagine if you had a list we have
1000 items, you know in real life
you're going to have lists, big lists.
Normally what happens in real life is
that you know this time we typed this
down manually, but normally you're going
to produce lists from databases. Let's
say you have a database, or an excel file.
And you're going to use some special
functions that you're going to learn
later where you can create a list out of
that column of the excel file
automatically so you don't have to type
all the items of the excel
file into this syntax with square
brackets, you’ll create this automatically.
Actually this is, I teach this in my
Python Mega Course: Built 10 Real World
Applications. We work with lot of data there.
Anyway, now to print out all the
items one by one in a very efficient way
you need to use loops, and the for loop
is a very used and popular way,
very powerful to do that, so let's say it for
item, you can use any variable here,
this is variable, for item in mylist1.
What do you want to do to the item?
Well, you want to print the item like that.
Let's see what we get them then
I explain you the expression. You get 1,
‘Hi there’, 10.5, and 10, all the
items of the list. So how this works is
the for loop what it does is it will
execute this action for all the items of
list so it goes in the first iteration,
it goes to the first value, it stores
that value into the item variable, so
item at this point will be equal to one.
And so when you print the item variable
you get one print out, and then it goes
to the next iteration so it looks if
there is another item in the list.
It prints it out, it looks for the other
item, it prints it out, and then it looks
for the last item, it prints that out, it goes
again to the list and if there are no more
items than the loop ends, and you know it
goes to the next lines of your programs
if there are lines in your code, if there
are not the script will finish and you’ll
get the output, that's it.
Of course you can do more advanced
things in here like you know if type of
the item is integer, you want to create
product maybe variable which is item
times 10, and then you want to print out
that product so try to visualize what
we're going to get here, else, or let me
expand the conditional elif type
of the item, sorry, this has to be an equal
operator not an assignment operator, with
assignment operators we assign values to
a variable, with an equal operator we
compare a value to another value.
I'll explain all this thing in a while,
but let me write first
if type item equals, is equal, sorry, yeah,
is equal to float, print product equals to
you know if it's a float so what you
want to do maybe is item times 100.
Else print out ‘It's probably a string’.
Let me exactly this, see what we get.
So what we got here is 10 for the
first iteration, ‘It's probably a string for
the second iteration, so for the second item,
than 100 for the next one.
10, ‘It's probably a string’, and 100.
Let me explain why we got that. So what we're
doing here is we go to the first
iteration, so item we'll get a value of 1
in the first iteration, so forget about
the loop, think that item is actually 1.
You can visualize it's like type 1 is it
equal to integer? Well, if that is true
then we create a variable product, and we
multiply item times 10, and we print
out the product, the value of the product
which in the first iteration will be 10.
So 10 will be printed out and I think
it was printed out as you see here.
10 was printed out in here, and if the if
conditional is evaluated to true, then
the other ones are ignored, they are not
executed, and so what happens is that the
loop goes through the next iteration.
So it goes now and item is equal to
‘Hi there’, and is type equal to int? So is it
an integer? No, it’s a string, it’s a str,
so this will not be executed because
this is not true. What happens is that
the conditional goes to the next check.
It checks if the type of ‘Hi there’ is equal
to a float. No, it's not. So this will not be
executed, and then we go to else which
means that if this was
evaluated to false, and this one was
also was evaluated to false what remains
is you know else otherwise if those are
false, then do this here, so it prints out
‘It’s probably a string’, which you can see
in here, ‘It’s probably a string’. Then it goes
to the next iteration, now item will be
equal to 10.5, so is it an integer?
No, it's not an integer.
It is a float therefore, 10.5 times 100 is
going to give us 1005 I think, yeah.
But we got a 100 there.
We didn't get 1005, we got 100
because we didn't print out
anything here so I forgot to include the
print statement, therefore what happens
is that the loop goes to the next item
which is name2 corresponds with 10.
So ten is an integer, 10 times 10 it
prints out 100, it didn't do
anything for this case, so let me
correct this, print product and
execute, so this time we got 10,
‘It’s probably a string’, and 1050, sorry,
100, and yeah, that's it. I think this summarizes
the for loop and the conditionals as well.
Pay attention to the indentation!
So we have nested a conditional here, but think
of it as independent, so if you had this
starting from the very first character
here, again you'd have the indentation
no matter where it starts, so this
indentation from here to here is of
the if conditional, then this one here from
sorry, from here to here is of the for loop
and so on.
All right, you have two more concepts to
learn and then you're going to have
a very good foundation of the Python
basics, you'll be you'll be ready to
explore more about Python after that.
Because these are the fundamental
building blocks that are you going to
use to build every type of Python
program later, so we're going to talk
about functions now in Python.
Let me delete some of the lines here
to make some space.
I'll keep name2 because I'm referring
to it in this list. Yeah, that's it.
Now functions. What is a function?
A function is this print function here
which is designed by Python developers
to get a string as input and to produce
an output, so functions produce an output
given some input. Now Python also gives
you the possibility to write your own
functions, so your custom functions, and then
you can use them in your script, so let's
create a function that gets the age of
the user and the current year, and then
the function calculates the day, the year
when the user was born, as simple as that.
So how to do that? That you can do using
the def keyword which means define
a function which you need to give a name.
Birth_year like that, then you open the
brackets, round brackets and then you
use a colon. Now in these brackets go
the parameters of the function, so what
parameters will this function have?
It will have the age and the current
year, so those are like variables,
but they are called parameters here.
Then you need to indent four spaces, 1,
2, 3, 4, and so how can we calculate
the year of birth having age
and current year? Well, we can substract.
Let’s say birth year equals to currents year
minus age, let's keep it simple like that.
And then a crucial keyword of the function is
the return statement, so that defines what
the function will return. In this case it
will return the value of birth year.
Once you have created your function you
can go ahead and call it because if you
execute the script now this will not
output anything.
Python will just record the Python,
the function definition in the memory,
but it will not call it because you
haven't told them,
you haven't told Python to call it.
You have to tell them to call it, birth year
like that, let's say the age is 29 and
years 2018, now if you if you do this again
you will not get any output because
you're not printing anything, you're just
calling the number, so this would be
a number actually because this is a number,
so this would be a number. Actually let
me let me use another name for this
variable not to confuse you, let me use
like that birth_y which stands for birth year.
So this is another thing and this
is another thing, this is name of the
function, this is a local variable inside
this function, and I have to reflect that
in here. We create the variable here and
we return it here, and here we call the
function birth year which will have
a value of 29 for age and 2018 for current
year, and you have to print it out, so that
will print out the value of birth_y
variable, exit.
Save the script. And yeah, here we go.
The last output
is the birth year, cool! Now of course if
you want you can ask the user to
dynamically enter their age, and not
simply passing the age to the function code.
We have to modify this so
here is our input function, and let's
change this to enter your age.
Enter your age, let's make the variable name
more meaningful, user_age, now user age
actually also need another input
function here which is going to be current year
equals to input, enter current year, like that.
So user_age, current_year, let me give
it another name not to confuse you.
Current_y, not to confuse you with
the name of the parameter here, so that's
another thing. Now what you do is
birth year, instead of passing this
statically like 29, you want to pass the
user age value which will be fetched by
the input function, and also the current_y,
current year as given by the user.
I will execute this, will get an error for
now, but I will explain you,
but I’ll explain you why you get that error.
And so it's better to see the error so
that you understand it. Your age 29.
2018, and you get this name error, name user
name is not defined, and that is in line 7.
So this is pointing you, you need to
read the entire error message, don't
panic, just read it. It says error
message happen in pro1.py file
in line 7, this is line 7. Okay, it says user
name is not defined. Really, we haven't defined it?
No, we haven't
because we deleted the user name,
the variable, therefore we’re getting this issue
here, so let me create a dummy username.
A variable here just to avoid that error.
I think you get the idea.
Now I'm going I'm going to execute this,
but we're going to get another error.
29, 2018, type error so it's again pro1.py
in line 7, integer has no
length, yeah, that's because I assigned
a number in the user name.
Therefore numbers don't have length,
len function, so let me put a string
there, execute, again we're going to get
another error which is good because it
trains you to actually deal with errors
And,
so the error happens in this file again.
Originally at line 28, so print birth
year, user age, and that traces up to line 25.
So Python wasn't able to execute this
line because of this line because in
this line what what's happening is
that you're trying to perform
a minus operation between two strings.
So string, current year is a string,
age is a string, and why is that?
Well, that's because an input function
always produces a string data type, even
if the user enters 29 the input function
will actually convert that to string ‘29’
with quotes, so what you want to do is
you want to convert that into an integer,
or a float if you like, and current
year as well
into an integer, like that, execute the
script again. 29, and for some reason we
got the first age converted successfully
to an integer, but not current year.
Why not? Let's see, 25! Sorry, sorry!
what I did here was nothing. I didn't use
the int function, I just passed some
brackets there. That should be fine now.
29, 2018.
And finally 1989 is the output which is
good, so it’s working, great!
All right, now let's see how to interact with
files from within Python, first let me
make some space here, ctrl shift and 6 to
mark the beginning of this block,
and then the down arrow key to select the lines
you want to delete, and then ctrl K to delete them.
If you want to paste them back, then
control Y, so let me do this again and if
you want to delete a block of
text in your editor, in your Nano editor
press control, shift and 6 at the same
time in the beginning of the first line,
and then the down arrow key to select all
the lines like that, then control K.
That's it.
Now let me go ahead and show you how to
for example read a printout,
the content of the text file into the terminal
via Python, so first we need to have a
text file, and let me exit the editor.
You can create a text file using Nano for
example, example.txt and you can write
something there. Hello world! control X, Y, and enter.
And you see you ls that's the example.txt
file is there, or you can also do
something else. If you want to upload
external files you’ll need to go
to the dashboard, and then files.
Then see where you are currently, you want to
click here, so now you are in py_project,
and then you can upload a file, like let's
say Spanish.json, and now if you go
back to your dashboard, and you see that
your console is still open, so just click it.
Now if you do ls, you'll see that spanish.json
is there, so this is how you upload a file.
Now let's go back
to our script, and let's see how you
can load the content of the example.txt
file into Python.
somehow I didn't save the changes here,
so this is not gone yet.
All right, let me go here. To open a file
you need to create a variable and store
the file to that variable, so we're
dealing with a file object, just like we
have strings, numbers, we can also have
file objects, you can create file
objects with the open function, and then you
pass the path of your file which in this
case is example.txt and you can pass
the modes of opening the file, so read
mode means that you open the file in
read mode only, you're not planning to
write anything into the file,
just reading then what you want to do with
the file? Well, maybe store the content
of the file in a variable, let's say the
variable content, file.read and
print content, that's what I want to do.
Let's see if this will work out.
Executing the scripts now.
All right, we got Hello world printed out.
So that's cool. Now except of…
Now in addition to reading a file, you can
also create a file with Python.
The way to do that and be let's say file2
equals to open example2.txt.
So there is no example2.txt in my folder.
Python is going to create it.
Let me delete some lines, some empty lines here
to make some more room down here.
Once you create a file object, you may want
to write some content in that file.
Let's say ‘Hey there!’.
Execute.
And so nothing happened,
nothing new happen on the terminal
because we are not printing any output,
we're just creating a file, but you
can see now if there is such a file in there.
So it is example2.txt. If you
want to see the content of that file, you
can open it with Nano, example2.txt.
Yeah, the string is there. Hey there!
That's how you create a file with Python,
and something you should know is that you
know, once you create a file and finish
with the operations with that file, then
you need to close the file, that is a
good practice because it's frees up
memory in in the Python script, while the
script is executed, so once you have done,
once you're done with this file,
why not closing it and release some memory
so that Python goes to the next line and
things happen faster, yeah you also need
to close this file as well, file2, so once
you're done working with it.
And that's it.
Of course things will work the same now.
So this is what I wanted to teach
you in this long lecture about Python
and let me let me summarize
what I told you.
You’ll learn about, you’ll learn about
variables, how to assign variables,
you can use names, custom names in
a variable, you can use underscores, and you
can use numbers, but not numbers in the
beginning of the variable name, after that.
And then use the assignment operator
to assign a value to the variable
which can be of different data types.
It can be a list, an integer, a float,
and other types of things, even you know
input functions, so here is a variable
we're applying an input function which
will create an object depending on
what the user inputs, and there are other
functions then.
We have int function which converts
a string into an integer if that string
contains a number. If the string is let's
say the string ‘Hi’ you’ll get an error because
you cannot convert the string ‘Hi’ or
‘Hello’ into an integer, okay. And then you
learnt about for loops which allows
you to apply an action multiple times.
So in this case the action is a bit complex,
so it's all these actions here, so this
will be applied multiple times until the
list is consumed, so until the iteration
goes the very last item and there are no
other items after that. That’s what the loop
does, but you can also simply put a print
function here like for item in my_list1
colon print, down here print item.
And that's it.
So we had conditionals which are
very important in decision making in
your program because it makes your
program intelligent. We have if, elif,
and else, then you have functions
which makes your code very organized.
You see that you could even do
this without a function like just use
the print function that prints out the value
of the age, you know the value of the current
year minus age, but having functions will
keep your code more organized, so you can
use reuse that function
with different values, yeah.
Then, we looked at files, you can interact
with files from within Python as you saw.
I showed you how to upload the file into
pythonanywhere, how to write content
into a file, and so on. So feel free
to watch this video one more time
if there are things that are unclear to you.
The more time so watch the video,
the more time you practice Python
the better you’ll become.
It's all about practice. I think I gave
you a good foundation of Python skills.
If you want to learn more you can look
at the Python Mega Course which
I have produced. It's hosted on Udemy.
The course is prized, but can have a coupon
code which you can find further down in
the descriptions. The course will teach
you how to create 10 complex applications
including websites, building
websites with Python, and creating
a motion detector program that detects
motion and objects from the computer webcam,
and then you have data processing,
web scraping at cetera et cetera.
Lots of programs there, and yeah,
hope you enjoyed this,
and talk to you in next videos!
