and in this video i'm explaining the
difference between a self-hosted
wordpress site and wordpress.com this is
a common question I get from beginners
who are looking to build a wordpress
site but end up on wordpress.com and
then wonder about themes and plugins and
all of the things that you can do with
wordpress.org the key difference is the
amount of control you have in what your
website looks like wordpress.com is an
easy to use free to start web creation
platform you can think of it like any
other web builder like Wix calm where
they have a limited amount of styles and
options for building your own website
but it's really easy to get up and
running and it's free to start we're at
pressed org or the WordPress web
building platform is a free open source
software to create your own website
you're in charge of hosting the website
yourself installing your own themes
installing your own plugins and while
you have a lot more control there's also
a bit more cost Here I am on the
wordpress.com website and you can like I
said get started for free I'm gonna
click on the click see plans option so
you do have this free option but when I
click the compare plans you can realize
that it can actually end up costing a
lot to get started if you want to use
any sort of premium theme or be able to
monetize your website you're going to
have to start to pay from wordpress.com
and still when you're paying like this
you don't have access to all of the
thousands of themes and plugins that you
can use with a self hosted WordPress
site you have to go up to this business
plan to be able to install your own
plugins upload themes have google
analytics remove the wordpress.com
branding and all of the stuff that
actually all of this is free when you
use wordpress.org you just have to host
it yourself what's confusing for some
people about wordpress.org and self host
word
sytze is that when you go to
wordpress.org it's not easy to
understand how do you actually get
started with building your own website
and that's because you actually don't go
to wordpress.org to get started you
start with your host or you can build a
website on your own platform or your own
server on your own computer and then
upload it but really what you're going
to want to do is purchase your hosting
and then install the WordPress software
onto that host and then you can log into
the backend of the WordPress software
dashboard to start building it
I have other tutorials here on the
channel about how to do that or in the
full WordPress for beginners course you
learn all of that there are many
different hosting companies out there
the most popular ones are like
bluehost.com
or hostgator.com and while these are the
most popular they also get a lot of
complaints from people because the
customer service might not be as good
but personally I've used Bluehost for
the past 6 or 7 years on my own website
and I haven't had really any complaints
here on the wordpress.org website what
you can see are all of the themes and
plugins that you have available to you
these are all free and you can also find
lots of themes that are paid on other
websites too that might be good for
specific ecommerce or different types of
businesses or websites but there's
literally thousands of them available to
you
same with plugins plugins are the
extensions that you add to your website
to do specific tasks like blocking spam
speeding up your website securing your
website adding contact forums growing
your email list with opt-in forms and
all kinds of things like that hopefully
by now you understand the differences
between wordpress.com and a self-hosted
wordpress.org website really quickly I'm
just going to run down the differences
again with themes which is basically the
look and feel of your website you don't
have control on wordpress.com there are
only a limited amount of themes
available to you with wordpress.org
there's thousands of frees options or if
you pay for a theme that you find online
you can upload any
WordPress theme to work your
wordpress.org website same with plugins
there's a very limited amount of
plug-ins for WordPress com
and you have to pay extra to be able to
use those and on wordpress.org there's
thousands of free options plus any
premium ones you can install it and
there's no added cost except for the
cost of the plugin if it is a paid
plug-in in terms of the expense and cost
of getting started you can start for
free on a wordpress.com website as we
saw but then it's quickly adds up if you
want to add any bonus features we saw
those prices going up to $25 a month for
starting your self hosted website there
are great beginner plans from Bluehost
and Hostgator that cost as little as
three or four dollars a month but
typically you're going to look at paying
five to ten dollars a month for your
hosting plan
you'll also need to purchase your own
domain name on both platforms if you
want a custom domain name and that
typically cost between 10 and 20 dollars
per year in terms of being able to
monetize your website with wordpress.com
you're not able to monetize with
wordpress.org you are in terms of
branding with wordpress.com they're
going to put ads on it they're gonna put
their own branding on it unless you pay
them with your own wordpress.org website
you have complete control to put
whatever branding or remove whatever
branding you want extra things you might
be interested in with wordpress.com you
have very limited analytics with
WordPress dot or you can install
advanced plugins to see all of your
Google Analytics and other analytics for
people visiting your site with
wordpress.com you can't really create
your own membership site or ecommerce
store it costs extra to do that and with
wordpress.org you can start doing that
for free once you have it hosted and up
and running using different plugins or
themes lastly one of the biggest cons to
a self-hosted website is that the
maintenance is a little bit more intense
you are in charge of updating your
themes updating your plugins things that
are crucial for the security of your
website with wordpress.com all of this
done automatically because you're using
a platform that you have less control of
but they're doing all of that back-end
work for you so with a wordpress.org
site you have more control but you have
more work to do to make sure it's up to
date at the end of the day both are
viable options for getting up and
running but you should make this
decision
right now before you start building your
website it's not easy to convert from
one to the other so while I personally
recommend a self hosted website in the
end I think it's going to cost less even
than a wordpress.com site if you're all
about free programs and free platforms
wordpress.com might be the one for you
to get started with if you have any
questions about these differences send a
comment below and if you're interested
in taking your WordPress skills to the
next level and a complete course on how
to create a website a self hosted
WordPress website we're also going to
include a link for my WordPress for
beginners class below thanks a lot and
hope to see you in the class</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
