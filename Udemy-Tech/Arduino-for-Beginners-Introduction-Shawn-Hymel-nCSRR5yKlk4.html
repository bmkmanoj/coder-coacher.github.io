programming and C you might be asked to
display the phrase hello world on your
computer screen this famous phrase dates
back to an internal memo at Bell Labs in
1974 teaching people how to write simple
C programs however if you look at your
microcontroller board you'll notice that
there's no easy way to plug in a monitor
which makes writing the phrase hello
world as a first program actually quite
difficult when it comes to programming
microcontrollers there is a first
program we can write that is quite
simple and it tests functionality all we
have to do is blink an LED this program
lovingly known as blink or blinky by
embedded engineers tests the basic
functionality and is the microcontroller
equivalent of hello world by doing this
we prove that we can compile code with
correct syntax run it on the
microcontroller without any hiccups as
well as toggle voltage levels on pins in
the end we know that we can dive into
microcontroller programming and start
building embedded electronics once we
have this working to start I'll show you
how to write a simple blinky program you
can follow along by copying the code I
write on the screen this is the first
step toward learning how to write your
own Arduino programs from scratch let's
begin take a look at your Arduino board
most of the popular Arduino boards have
an on-board LED connected to pin 13 if
you have an unknow like this one you'll
see an LED labeled L this is the LED we
want to make blink and it's electrically
connected to pin 13 through a series of
copper traces on the board to give our
Arduino power and send our compiled
program to it plug in a USB cable to the
USB port on the side of the Arduino plug
the other end into an available USB port
on your computer open the Arduino
program
select File new to make sure we are
working with a fresh sketch you should
see two blank functions already started
for you which act as a template every
time you go to write a new Arduino
program which is also known as a sketch
everything you write between the curly
braces of the setup function is run
exactly once as soon as the Arduino
board boots once your setup code is run
the program then runs everything you
write between the curly braces in the
loop function because it's labeled loop
the code is run again and again forever
as long as the microcontroller has power
note that every Arduino sketch should
have one and only one setup function and
only one loop function even if there is
nothing between the curly braces in
those functions to blink our LED we
first need to tell the Arduino that we
want to control the voltage of pin 13
using code this is known as setting the
pin as an output and we do that by
writing the following line of code in
the setup function pin mode open
parentheses 13 , output close
parentheses semicolon note the capital m
in pin mode as this is a special Arduino
function that were calling to set the
mode of a pin we specify pin 13 as our
first parameter since that's the pin
number whose mode we want to modify we
then write the word output in all
capital letters to denote that we want
our pin 13 to be an output mode it's in
all capital letters because it is
another special constant known by the
Arduino system if you changed any of the
letters to lowercase you would not be
able to compile your program the
semicolon at the end of the line is very
important in C and C++ it marks the end
of a statement without it the compiler
will likely fail when it tries to
compile and you'll get an error at the
bottom part of your Arduino program we
can leave the line with the double slash
it is a comment and will be ignored by
the compiler now move to the loop
function and write
right open parentheses 13 comma hi close
parentheses semicolon in between the
curly braces similar to the pinmode
function we called earlier this function
tells the Arduino that we want to write
the value high to pin 13 in the case of
our Arduino Uno
this will cause pin 13 to go from zero
volts to 5 volts which is enough to
light our LED then underneath the
digital write function write delay open
parenthesis 1000 close parenthesis
semicolon this is another function we
call to have the microcontroller do
nothing for 1000 milliseconds or one
second under that right digital write
open parenthesis 13 comma low close
parenthesis semicolon which tells pin 13
to go from 5 volts to zero volts turning
off the LED finally write delay open
parenthesis 1000 close parenthesis
semicolon under that this will force the
microcontroller to wait another 1 second
because these four statements are
contained within the loop function as
soon as the microcontroller runs each
one in sequence it immediately starts at
the beginning and runs them again over
and over and over we now need to tell
the Arduino program which board we are
using and on which USB port it can find
it select tools board arduino gen we
know uno then select tools port and
whichever port appeared by plugging in
the arduino for me this was calm 4 on
windows and it might be slash dev slash
Cu dot USB serial - some letters and
numbers on Mac OS press the upload
button and you will be asked to save
your program you can choose to save your
work with a name like blinky or just
press cancel either way the art
no program will compile your code and
automatically send it to the Arduino
board you should see the phrase done
uploading appeared just above the status
pane if you see any errors carefully
read the error messages and compare your
code to the code presented in this
lecture assuming the compilation and
uploading process went smoothly you
should be presented with an LED that
pulses on for one second and off for one
second
in later lectures we will attach leds
buttons and various other electronics to
the available pins on the Arduino board
this will allow us to do things like
create fun light patterns accept user
input read sensors and control motors
one cool thing about microcontrollers is
that they are designed to continue
running your program even if they are
not attached to a computer so if I plug
my Arduino into a battery that provides
5 volts it will run the last program I
uploaded to it which is blinky in this
case just note that some of these phone
charger batteries will automatically
turn off if not enough current is being
drawn from them getting to blink is a
very important first step as it proves
you can compile code and run it on your
microcontroller in fact I highly
recommend you run this simple program
every time you receive a new micro
controller or Arduino platform once you
know it works you can begin developing
on it thanks for watching if you'd like
to learn more check out my Arduino
fundamentals course on udemy in it I'll
show you the basics of C and C++
programming how to build circuits and
how to make things like robots and
Internet connected sensors if you use
