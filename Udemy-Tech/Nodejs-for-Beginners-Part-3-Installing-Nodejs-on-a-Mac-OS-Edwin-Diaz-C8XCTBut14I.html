lecture we are going to be installing
nodejs on a macro operating system all
you have to do is go to no js' DAC org
and you have two different versions here
that we can that you can use the stable
version and the latest version I'm gonna
be using the stable version as this
works very good with everything and once
you download it just click on the
package and you're gonna get this
installer right here all you gotta do is
follow the prompt as you can see this is
going to install then the us our local
bing directory in your operating system
and you can visit there by doing CD and
then tap in this address there and you
can see that a node program is going to
be located in that directory and the NPM
is also going to be there let me show
you real quick how to do that so see
thee hi /usr local and then been I
already have this program here so if I
do LS to list the contents of that
folder you can see that I have all this
in here including node let me see if I
go to the this is going by alphabetical
order and I gotta go to my ends right
here and node and NPM that's what's
going to be installed in your computer
and that's where it's going to be
installed so I can click continue
continue just to show you how this is
done but I already have this installed
and then you type in your password ok
and once that's done all you gotta do
and it says it's done there is also done
it's telling us to make sure that our
path is correct so the reason why is
trying to make sure that the path is
correct that actually Noda is inside
your path or that this local been isn't
in your path actually it's because it
needs to find the node so let's go and
open another terminal window I'm gonna
click clear this out and terminal is
very easy to find guys come on you know
how to do this right you can find it in
in your launch pad right here
okay terminal you can just find it just
in case
so to go and make sure that this is in
my path I'm gonna go CD four slash et
Cie paths as a matter of fact I'm gonna
do sudo nano sudo so for Super User Nano
is the editor we are using we type in
the computer password you're not gonna
see it but you got to type it in and
enter that's not my password let's do
this again there we go so this is my
path and this is what I got inside my
path okay /user us our four slash local
slash bin make sure that that's their
out of the out of the box node or the
program node is going to be looking or
our computer is going to be looking for
this file for this path when we execute
a command for example if I type in node
now that that it is installed you can
see that we get this greater than symbol
so that's why we need to have that path
there so that way our computer knows how
to find this program or any program
inside the user local bin directory okay
so now that we know that nodes install
that we can easily go into the show that
just like we did right now my ctrl C and
ctrl C again to get out and that's it
okay but you can go and say node - v + o
- V and you can get the version number
that's how you know note is installed
okay no make that bigger so you can see
it - V okay that's it thank you so much
for watching guys and I'll see you on
the next lecture</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
