mark Pricer with dev slopes dot-com and
welcome to your very first
unity3d video game and we're not just
gonna build a couple of cubes and say
this is our very first video game no
we're gonna make something really cool
so what I want you to do is go ahead and
download the starter project you have to
have it to this and also of course you
have to have unity installed and then
click your unity icon here to open up
the loader window and we're currently
using unity of 5 point 4 point 1 F 1
unity 5 X is fine for this tutorial and
if you're using anything older than
unity 5 just upgrade it's free and much
better so what you're gonna do is click
the Open button and go find the starter
folder that you got in the pack you got
from the download ok and we're gonna go
ahead and click roll a zombie starter
and it should look something like this
pretty boring see a main camera and a
directional light okay now your layout
may be different than my layout I've got
an inspector here project here and all
these different things over here what
you can do is you can change these
around if you want so in our case I'm
gonna click layouts and I'm gonna click
default okay and it has moved some
things around so if you've never used
unity before go ahead and do that go to
window layouts and default will all work
on the same exact layout today often
mine changes when I get bored but will
be consistent today so we've got a scene
here okay and we've got a game here
which is actually what you look at when
the game is running and what we're gonna
do and by the way this is a beginner
tutorial so I'm not going to cover every
single thing we're just gonna get you
from A to Z in this game okay meaning
you're just going to build the game and
we're gonna learn a lot more later on in
other videos so what you want to do is
go down to this prefabs folder here and
see that floor object I just want you to
drag it over here into the hierarchy on
the left okay and if I hold down alt
okay with this move button selected up
here I can drag around as you can see I
can drag around with the alt button okay
now I can press Q to pan which is what
I'm doing here and that's the little
hand up here at the top left so I'm
holding down alt and I'm pressing Q 2 to
pan and this looks really boring right
you got four little cubes here and a big
giant floor cube here so what I want to
do is give these things some life so in
your assets at the bottom left click
floor and click the circle one here
we're gonna take it and drag it on to
the cube floor here that's looking a lot
better now let's give these cubes some
life
click materials and we're gonna select
green and drag it on that one blue
that's the second one red we're gonna
drag it on the third one and yellow on
the fourth one it's looking really
really nice all we've done here is we've
applied some materials these ones have
colors and the other one has a wood
texture and here's the idea of the game
we've got these cute little zombie
creature balls and we're gonna use some
gravity and they're gonna roll for it
and every time they hit one of these you
get a point but you also have to keep
pressing them back up because the if you
they fall off the edge you lose the game
and so it starts getting hard because
you're moving from you're moving to the
left through the zombies and you're
choosing which one is about to fall off
then you press the up key and then it
goes back and you'll see what I mean as
we get closer to it but we've just added
some color to these cubes here and we're
just getting our game in the general
direction of where it needs to be okay
the next thing I want to do is I wanna
bring our little zombie creatures into
the game so we got some zombies here and
these are these are pre-built okay
actually where are they prefabs in the
prefabs well regard our zombies okay
there and they're pre-built so what I
want to do is just take each one and
drag it on to the hierarchy like so one
two three and four okay there's our four
little zombies all in a row
that sounds like a nursery rhyme huh
someone finished that okay so I think we
made our cubes the wrong colors here we
should have put the zombies in first huh
let's just change them around the first
one I'm in here the materials folder at
the bottom left the first one we're just
gonna click this yellow material and
drag it on the yellow brick yellow blue
and then green on the third one and red
on the fourth one now holding all again
I can pan around here in the scene to
look at these cute little zombies okay
so the idea again is we're gonna tilt
this board the zombies are gonna roll
into these these blocks here you're
gonna get points okay
so what I want to do is I just want to
go ahead and play the game for the very
first time okay so this is in play mode
notice how I can't move it or do
anything with it okay you got our four
little zombies here they're actually
animated and ready to go of course
you're gonna learn those things later on
and they look great okay so there's our
four little zombies and let's go ahead
and try and get some rotation in here or
physics going notice how the zombies
they're just floating there in the air
they're not doing anything and we need
this to be tilted we need the zombies to
roll on it how do we do that well we're
gonna click our for our floor here and
we're gonna press E or the rotation
button up here to rotate it and holding
down alt I can pan around okay and when
I say alt it's alt or option okay
depending on Windows or Mac and what you
can do is you can click this little red
line and rotate the board make sure
they're not touching it just floating
above like that okay so now it's rotated
but again they're not falling right so
how do we get them to fall down well we
need to have physics implemented so what
we're gonna do is we're gonna click our
four zombies I'm going to hold down
shift to click all four I'm gonna click
Add component on the right hand side
we're gonna go to physics and then we're
gonna go ahead and do rigidbody a
rigidbody is what makes objects listen
to the world of physics okay and we do
want use gravity we want gravity to
to apply to these guys so they fall down
so let's go ahead and see what happens
if I play the game so they fall down but
they keep falling they're not hitting
the board and there's a reason why the
reason why is our zombie creatures here
they don't have a Collider and neither
does our board so I don't think it does
let's see no are we our board does have
a Collider and our zombies do not okay
so let's go ahead and click all four
zombies again holding shift and let's
click Add component
we're gonna go to physics and we're
gonna go to fear Collider and I'm
holding down alt and using my mouse
wheel in notice how the sphere colliders
are not where they should be in the
zombies they're too low right we want
them to kind of be round so the zombie
rolls but it's gonna look silly if it's
below the zombie so what I'm gonna do is
on this sphere Collider okay I'm just
gonna move it up a little bit till it's
right about the middle of the zombie and
I'm also gonna increase the radius about
right there which is point five six and
the Y is 0.56 so now they're nice and
round and do you think that they're
going to hit the board and roll let's
see ah interesting
so now they're rolling and they're
falling off see how easy that was
okay so we just dragged a rigidbody on
these guys to put a Collider on make
sure they're using gravity and they're
now hitting the board which is exactly
what we want to do awesome
so the next thing we want to do is we
want to be able to swap between the
zombies by using the left or the right
keys okay we want to be able to say hey
which is aa B is currently selected that
way when you press the up key that's the
zombie that goes flying backwards so
we're gonna have to write our very first
script in unity and if you don't
understand programming that's okay
you're gonna learn these things as time
goes on and it's going to be fairly
straightforward now for this game anyway
so first things first is create a new C
sharp scripts we're gonna right-click
assets and go to create c-sharp script
and we're gonna call this game manager
it's going to be a script that runs our
entire game and what we're gonna do is
we're going to drag the script manager
over onto our main camera in unity
unlike any other type of game engine you
actually take your physical script
images there that you can see in your
project and you can drag them onto
objects and it applies to the object
which is pretty darn cool
okay so what you're gonna do is you're
just gonna double-click this file here
to open it so what you're gonna do is
you're gonna open this file by going to
assets open c-sharp project and it's
gonna go ahead and load monodevelop over
here you can expand it and now you see
your game manager dot CS file I'm going
to zoom in here holding down alt or
option and then the scroll wheel here
you're gonna see a start function and an
update function the start function is
called
whenever the game starts or whenever
this object comes to life the object
that this script is attached to and the
update function is called repeatedly
over and over and over X amount of times
per second like 60 frames per second
something like that and so what we want
to do is we want to be able to use the
left and right keys to swap between
zombies meaning you have a zombie that's
selected one of the four and it gets
bigger that way it shows you that it's
selected and if it's selected you can
press the up key and then that zombie
will move forward so how do we do that
well let's write some code we're gonna
say public game object selected zombie
and we're gonna do one more thing we're
going to use a c-sharp list so I need to
import or use import a collection so
we're going to say using Unity engine
are not Unity engine system dot
collections dot generic this is the
library that lets us use a list and what
we're gonna do is we're gonna say public
list okay and then the
the less than sign we're gonna say game
object greater than sign we're gonna say
zombies okay and again if you don't
understand what's going on that's
completely fine we're just building a
game here and having fun and showing you
the world of game development so what's
really interesting is I made these
public using the public key word and if
I save my file and go back to unity okay
if I click the main camera where I drag
that scrip on to those things are
available to me over here on the
inspector the selected zombie and the
the list of zombies how many zombies I
have so I'm gonna put a four in there
cuz I know I have four zombies and what
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna drag the
zombies over to these slots and so the
first one is the yellow one so make sure
the main camera is selected and then
just drag the yellow zombie into element
zero and then blue in to element one and
then green into element two and then
read into element three okay and lists
or arrays and programming always start
at zero which is why it's zero one two
and three and the selected zombie we'll
just make that to start off with our
yellow zombie that'll be the one that we
start off with okay so what we want
happen to have happen is if the zombies
selected we want it to be bigger so we
need a starting size which is the scale
here okay so if I click this zombie his
scale is 1 1 and 1 and so that's the
default size so what I really want to do
is I want to press the R key on this
zombie holding down alt to rotate and
just make him bigger like a lot bigger
like 1.4 that lets us know that he's
selected command Z to undo that and now
what I can do is back in my code now
that I know 1.4 is the number I can do
something really cool I can say public
it's called a vector 3 x y&amp;amp;z position is
and vector 3 okay three points in space
if you remember some high school math
vector three we're gonna say selected
size and public vector three default
size save the file come back to the code
and click the main camera and what I can
do is the selected size remember it was
one point four press tab one point four
press tab one point four that's the
scale we want it to be larger and the
default size is one tab one tab one so
that's going to set the size of the
zombies okay now if I go back to my code
okay we can actually make we can select
our zombie to make it bigger
okay and so what's going to happen is
whenever we press an arrow key it's
gonna select a zombie and so we also
need to we also need to make sure the
size is properly set when the game
starts as well too we're gonna do is
we're gonna create a function Boyd don't
worry about what the word void means
you'll learn about that soon but
basically it means it's not returning
anything this function isn't we're gonna
call select zombie okay and we're gonna
pass in the zomp
we're gonna pass in the zombie that's
being selected so we're gonna say it's
app type game object and we're gonna
call this one the new zombie
okay so we're creating a function where
we pass in the zombie that we want to
show that's selected so which function
would be a good function to start off
with making our zombie a bigger size if
you said the start function that that is
exactly right so what I'm gonna do here
is in the start function I'm gonna call
the select zombie function and I'm gonna
pass in the selected zombie okay the one
that's up here and then over here we
just want to change the size of the
zombie and this is fairly easy we say
new zombie okay dot transform dot local
scale equals and we're gonna say the
selected size okay so we're gonna select
a zombie it's this new zombie here and
we're gonna set it to the bigger size on
the
start and you do that using zoos new
zombie transformed at local scale
transform is a unity 3d component that's
like position in scale and then local
scope just means the scale of the model
the 3d model and then we set a size on
it which was one point four right so I
saved this go back to my game and the
yellow one should be bigger which it is
awesome so we know that the codes
working you just wrote your very first
script and it's definitely working so
congratulations there okay so what else
though we also need to be able to select
between zombies using the arrow keys if
I press left it needs to go back to the
red zombie then the green and the blue
if I press right it goes blue green red
and back to the yellow it needs to be
interchangeable so we need to write code
for that so let's go back to our script
and let's actually write the code that
we need to run this okay
so what we're gonna do is we're gonna
have a function here called void well
let's do the input first actually let's
go over here in the update function and
detect whenever there's key presses okay
so that's as simple as saying if input
get key down we're gonna say left to get
the left key we're gonna end that there
and then we're also gonna say if input
dot get key down right put my curly
braces we'll do one more if because
we're also going to need to get the UP
button right so if input get key down
we're gonna say up then we're gonna do
three different things here based on
what key is pressed
okay so let's handle the left one first
so another function void get zombie left
curly brace is there and what we're
gonna do is we're gonna see remember how
a list or an array starts at zero so if
we're at the very first one if we're at
the yellow one it means we're in slot
number zero and so if we go to the left
it means we need to go to which slot
zero one two three so if we go from the
if we press the left and the other guys
selected we need to move over to slot
number three otherwise if we press the
right key right
it would go plus one plus two but if
it's the final slot three and we press
the right key we need to go back to zero
so you need to write code to support
that so it can loop right so I think we
need to keep track of what position the
current zombie is so we can do that
easily up here as well too we can make
this one private because we don't need
unity to see it and we can say private
int and we're gonna call this selected
zombie position we'll start it off at
zero and then what we can do is over
here and get zombie left okay you can
say if selected zombie position equals
zero it's a double equal sign there okay
if it's equal to zero what do we want to
do well we want to select the
appropriate zombie so we want to say
select zombie and this is going to be
the third one right because we're from
the first slot and we go to the left we
need to go to the third one or the
fourth fourth element or number three
zero one two three so we're gonna say
select zombie and we have a list up here
called zombies right and so to get an
item out of it by its index we're gonna
say zombies three like so so we're gonna
select zombie number three of which of
course is the fourth one because we
start at zero so if we're at position
zero we're gonna loop back to the end
that makes sense
else what we're gonna do is we're gonna
say select zombie and then we're gonna
say in fact let's let's break this out
in the two lines here let's say game
object new zombie equals selected zombie
position are sorry zombies there we go
and then we're gonna put a square curly
a square bracket here just like we did
over here to get the item out of the
array or out of the list and we're gonna
say selected zombie position okay minus
one and if that's confusing to you what
we're doing here is we're grabbing if if
we're not at the for your first element
and we press left I mean
all we have to do is take away one so if
I was in if I was right here okay
currently had blue selected and I
pressed left I know I need
I know blue is 0-1 so I would do 1 minus
1 which is 0 gives me that one same
thing with the green this is 0 1 2 and
so to get one less I would say this
current position minus 1 to give me this
of course if we have the special case
which is we're over here then we don't
subtract 1 we go all the way back onto
the right hand side and that's what this
code is doing here and I find it helpful
if I visualize it just like that
sometimes until I get it if you don't
understand what's going on so what we've
done here is we've just grabbed one of
the zombies out of that list and we're
storing it here in this variable and
you'll learn about those as well if you
don't know how to if you've never
programmed before so there's our new
zombie and what we're gonna do is we're
gonna select that zombie now calling the
select a zombie function we're gonna
pass in the new zombie wonderful then
over here if the get keydown function is
called we just say get zombie left like
so make sure you put the parentheses and
the semicolon after it okay now we need
to create the other function for going
to the right get zombie right and it's
gonna be similar but just in the reverse
right so if selected zombie position
where you need to handle the special
case first equals 3 so if it's the very
last one right so if we're 0 1 2 3 4 on
the red one and we press write we need
to go back to 0 okay so if the selected
zombie position equals 3 then we need to
select zombie okay and we're going to
say zombies 0 like so just like the
first one else okay then it's the
opposite of the other one right select
zombie and this time I'm not going to
separate those two into two code lines
we're gonna do it all in one just to
show you different way of doing it we're
gonna say zombies selected zombie
position plus 1 like so
and there we have it and then over here
on the gate key down right we're gonna
say get zombie right so to follow the
chain of events
if someone presses a left key here it's
gonna call this left function which
selects the zombie which changes its
size if someone presses the right key
it's gonna call the right keith this get
zombie right function and it's gonna
pass in that zombie and then change its
size okay and if all this is super
confusing don't worry you can watch this
video again and you're gonna learn more
later
so with that saved click the play button
and if I press my keys notice how
they're changing okay although one
didn't change on this I don't know if
you noticed that here if I press right
okay so we have some bugs and also we
forgot to set our zombies back to their
normal size after they were no longer
selected okay and this is what's called
prototyping a rapid prototyping or
iterating you build something out you
test it you see what's wrong with it
you go back in your revise and you do it
again so let's go ahead and do that now
I'm gonna open up the code so what we
haven't done yet is we haven't selected
a new zombie okay
meaning we haven't set the new zombie
okay it's still holding a reference up
here to the old zombie which is not
right so what we want to do okay is we
want to in this code here when we're
passing in a new zombie all right we
want to pass in the new zombie that was
selected so we're gonna go ahead and say
selected zombie equals new zombie but
before that don't you think we should
change it back to size so even before
that line of code we can say selected
zombie all right dot transform the local
scale equals and we're gonna say default
size this time right so what we do is we
take the old zombie even though it says
selected zombie it's about to be changed
right because we're selecting a new
zombie so we take the old one put it
back to size and then we reset it to the
new zombie and then we change the new
zombie to this the bigger size which is
how it's supposed to be okay and this is
great but one of the problems that we
have is none of our indexes are being
changed okay if you look at this here
selected zombie position plus one okay
we're never changing selected zombie
position to reflect the current zombie
that's being selected so we need to fix
that too so all we need to do here is
just set it so what we can do is right
here we can say selected zombie position
equals three so the same thing that
you're setting it to here right and then
this one selected zombie position equal
a selected zombie position minus one the
exact same thing you're doing here right
and then we'll do the same thing here as
well to a selected zombie position
equals zero to reflect the new zombie
we're selecting and otherwise selected
zombie position equals selected zombie
position plus one okay error we need to
clean up here is
actually now that we've increased the
zombie position we don't need it here in
Ras anymore so we've basically changed
it here and then we're grabbing that
from right here in our zombie positions
so we just refactor our code a little
bit and I think this is a better
solution so let's go ahead and play it
and see right right right right left
left left this is looking great
okay so notice how if I go to the left
it goes to red to go to the right it
goes back to yellow our code is
definitely working and again just to
recap our code okay if you press the
left key this is what we do we see if
it's in the in the very first slot if it
is we set the new zombie position to
three and then we grab that zombie st.
similarly here we if it's not in that
first position then all we're gonna do
is subtract it by one and select that
zombie out of the list and then we're
gonna select it down here so this is all
working great our zombies are moving
from left to right but what we also want
to do is when you press the up key we
want that zombie to move up okay we want
to we want to push it up so how do we do
that well we can do that by applying
force to an object so what I want to do
is create a new function here void push
up and what we're going to do is we're
gonna grab the rigidbody component off
of it and add some force to it some
simple code here I'm just going to say
rigidbody we'll call it RB give it a
name and we're gonna say selected zombie
this is when the up Keys press write get
component rigidbody
parentheses like so and what i'm doing
here is when I say get component I'm
grabbing the component off of the zombie
this rigid body right here I'm grabbing
that script so I can work with it okay
and what I'm gonna do is I'm going to
say RB dot add force we're gonna add
some force I'm gonna say zero to the x
position zero to the Y position but ten
to the Z position now we're gonna say
force mode
impulse we kind of want it to be like a
right like you're punching something or
hitting it up and what this is doing
here
this zero zero and ten we don't want it
to move to the left or the right we want
it to move back right which is the blue
one right here that's the Z position
okay we want to add force to the Z
position so that's what we're doing here
when we press the up key adding some
force to it so let's go ahead here in
the up key and just call that function
so we go up here to the key up and say
push up push up and then we're gonna go
ahead and click play and when I press up
on the selected zombie it adds some
force pretty cool huh
I like it they're gone that's really
awesome now I don't want all the zombies
falling at the same time look at them
they're all kind of just falling at the
exact same time which I don't know it's
not very creative is it so I'm gonna
hold down alt here in the scene and what
we're gonna do is just maybe make these
different heights when we start off for
one so we're gonna say the blue zombie
starts off up here the green zombie
starts off up here and the red zombie
starts off up here okay and then also we
can play with a little property on each
one of these so if you click the zombie
over here in the rigidbody you notice
they have drag and drag is like the
resistance you know like if you were
dropping a piece of paper because it's
so flat it would drag as it's floating
down and so we're gonna add some angular
drag so it's the drag of it's spinning
okay and so the more drag you have the
slower the object's gonna go so let's
increase the drag of the red one just a
little bit and the green one a little
bit more and we'll leave the blue one as
normal and we'll increased Luxur
decrease all the drag off of the yellow
one now what's gonna happen is they're
all gonna start at different speeds make
the game a little more challenging a
little more variance so they fall there
we go okay they're not all coming down
at the same time let's try it again
dink dink dink see how they're all
slightly different but it's not quite
enough I'm gonna add a lot more drag on
the on the red one here okay and also
what I'm gonna do is move them back a
little bit to just just for fun okay
this one back and this one back just to
give it a few more variances I'm gonna
click play and here they go oh yeah look
at that they're following all the
different speeds I like it a lot and now
it's getting a little bit crazy because
I got to keep moving back and forth to
keep these zombies from falling all
right pretty cool great so the next
thing I want to do is I actually when
they hit these blocks here we just want
to know when they hit it so we can
increase the score but the problem is we
don't have a score to increase yet so
let's do that now let's create a very
first user interface for this game okay
we're gonna go to on this screen right
here in the hierarchy right click and go
to UI and click text okay and it's gonna
create and this big huge block you're
probably thinking what's going on here
but let's look at our game scene here
okay what's gonna happen is that text is
gonna overlay on our game scene alright
and you can't see right now because it's
so gray right here and small so what
we're gonna do is we're gonna change it
here we're gonna put some pretend
numbers in this text I have text
selected and we're gonna say scores 100
and then we're gonna probably want to
increase the font size by a lot and
increase the width by a lot and increase
the height by a lot and there you can
start seeing it pop up okay like so and
that font size is a little too big so
let's put it right about there and then
I'm going to move the Y position up here
just by clicking and dragging this is
what I've been doing is clicking and
dragging okay and then I'm gonna move it
over to the left by clicking and
dragging and there we go the only thing
I want to change is I want to make this
color white I just don't like that color
there
and now what I want to do is I want to
change the sky box because that's just a
boring color so let's go ahead into our
project down here and click your sky box
folder see that purple thing right there
just drag it onto the background
actually we need to click Seen first and
then drag it on to the background now
it's looking pretty cool and if we go to
the game we can see the score a lot
better and our game is starting to come
to life so again we need to change the
score every time an object is hit so
first things first is we're gonna go
into our main script our game manager
okay we're gonna create another public
variable and it's going to be called
text but we don't have the Unity imports
for text yet so we need to import that
at the very very top and you can do that
by saying using Unity engine dot UI and
now right here we can say public text
and we're just going to call it score
okay and on the start we also need to
keep track of score as well too so let's
say private int we'll call this one
score text actually and we're just going
to call this one the score and we'll
start it off at zero so down here in the
start when the game first starts we want
the text to say score and then show the
actual score so we can do that by saying
score text dot text equals and then
we'll type the word score with a colon
and a space I'm gonna say plus score so
this is going to take this number here
and turn it into a word or string and
then it's going to print it to the
screen whenever it starts now we also
need a function to add score every time
one of those blocks is push so we're
gonna say public void we'll need this
public for later because our tiles will
need to access it public void add point
and this is going to say score equals
score plus one so every time a block is
hit we add one to the score and then we
need to change the text so score text
dot text will do something similar
equals score plus score the same thing
as we did before
okay this is looking great and so that's
how we'll add the score but we don't
have any score being calculated because
we don't know when the zombies are
hitting the tiles so let's go look at
our tiles here these cubes okay well
these cubes don't have any type of box
Collider on it so we need to add those
now select all the cubes holding shift
and what we're gonna do is click Add
component physics box Collider and it's
gonna add colliders to all of these and
then what we want to do is we want to
turn on trigger okay we don't want our
zombies to hit them and then be bounced
off of them like real physics we just
want them to roll right through because
the idea of the game as you hit it and
then you've got to quickly move your
zombie back up okay so that's what we
want to do and now we also are gonna
need another script okay so I'm going to
right click my assets folder and create
a brand new c-sharp script and we're
gonna call this tile like one of the
tiles on the floor okay and let's go
ahead and you can resync your project by
going to open c-sharp project like so
okay and then if you expand you'll now
see your tile or you could have double
click the script and it would have
opened it for you
so here's our tile and right now there's
nothing interesting going on in this
right so what we want to do is we want
to detect whenever a zombie hits a tile
and we can do that using a special
function because we marked them as
triggers we can say void on trigger
enter collider other this is the other
object that's being passed in that it
that's hitting it like in our case the
zombie but we don't need that object we
just need to know when it hits so we can
get some points and so what we're gonna
do is we need to get a reference to the
game manager so we can call that add
that add points function so we're gonna
say public game manager and we'll just
call it game manager with a lowercase G
like that and what we're gonna do is
we're gonna say game manager dot add
point that function is right there
waiting for us
pretty awesome and then what we need to
do is select these cubes make sure you
save that script file select those cubes
and just drag this script over here on
the right hand side to the
add component and then with all of these
still selected grab your main camera and
drag it over here onto the game manager
and then it's going to take the script
that we put on game manager on the main
camera and it's gonna have a reference
to it right here so we can call the add
score function which i think is pretty
awesome so let's see if it actually
works
score should be a at zero and actually
it's not working
we forgot to drag the score on the main
camera click main camera scroll down and
sure enough we didn't drag the score
text on to the slot like we were
supposed to
oops let's go back to our main camera
there it is okay perfect now let's run
it
score zero so when the yellow hits we
should see four points once they go
through one two three and four whoo-hoo
so the logic for our games all done but
I think we need a little more character
to the game so let's just do a little
bit of music a little bit of music you
know like in that movie like white
chicks you know he's like in the car
he's like how about a little bit of
music and he puts on that Alanis
Morissette song and then Terry Crews
starts jamming out and singing it anyway
Oh see it's funny movie man camera click
that and notice that there's an audio
listener on it
well audio listeners like your ears in
the game like what's listening to the
sound and odd sounds can play from audio
sources so let's also add an audio
source add component on the camera audio
source awesome and we've got some game
music right here take that game music
and just drag it in to the audio clip
slot
make sure play on awake is going and
make sure loop is going and then when
you play it
it works and it's a lot more character
to it and one last thing is when they
hit these objects here I kind of want
them to beep how do we do that well
let's go back to our code of our tile
and let's just do that real quick we're
gonna have to get another audio source
and we're also going to get an audio
clip so we're gonna say public audio
clip that's the song or the sound effect
we're gonna put in there
we're just call it hit and then we're
gonna say audio source source in this
case we don't need to make it public
we're just gonna get the component so
what we're gonna do is here in the start
function we're gonna call say source
equals get component and it's gonna find
the audio source that's on this tile
which we haven't added yet but we will
okay and then down here when we add a
point we're gonna say source dot play
one shot just play it one time and we're
gonna say play the hit sound so we save
it let's go back to our code click all
four of these tiles click Add component
audio audio source and this time drag
the beep sound onto it do not put the
play on the weight because we don't want
it to start right when the game starts
and then one more thing we need to do is
we need to actually drag the audio oops
this is wrong I put it in the wrong slop
the beat needs to go over here and then
I'm gonna select this one and say none
there we go so the the beep is right
there and this all looks scraped we put
the audio clip on it so now if I play it
okay so we've got a real game here and
actually this game can get quite a bit
challenging if you if you're moving
around you know and you're like okay I
need to get the point but I need to move
up but I don't want to hit too far are
they coming flying off so it starts to
get a little bit crazy and so you have
to have a game here we can adjust the
rules in the gameplay and things are
looking really really cool some other
things you could do if you wanted is you
could click your main camera here okay
and you could adjust it around to get
different angles or views if you didn't
like this view or if you wanted it let's
say a little bit I'm holding down alt to
rotate if you wanted it like pointing a
little bit higher you know you could do
something like this
okay or if you wanted it lower you could
do something like that if you wanted
these guys to move differently you could
click one of their objects here the
green zombie or blue zombie and you
could change the angular drag okay you
could also in your script you could
increase the force when one of these
guys is hit okay this this 10 we could
have put it to a higher number anything
we wanted to do in fact you can make it
a little more you can make it a lot more
interesting I'll let you I'll let you
play around with it but we've got a
fully functional game here you can press
it up oh no I want these guys slower I
need to get more points and the idea is
the idea is to get as many points as you
can before you lose all of your
characters without accidentally knocking
them down or we could just fling them
off just for fun
you know horse put sound effects and
stuff on there as well so you've learned
a lot this was your very first you need
a game you did some scripting you
learned how to drag materials onto the
screen you learned how to write some
code with public variables that you can
drag and drop in the interface you learn
how to play with some sounds how to put
a skybox on you've done a lot of things
and if you're completely confused with
the coding and it's like overwhelming
don't worry it was meant to be it's this
is game development and it just takes
some time but you're gonna go I'm
actually gonna cover in much more detail
in all the other videos every single
thing that we've done here and you're
gonna learn everything so if you're an
absolute beginner you're going to get
the deepest explanation of all these
things so by the time you're done you're
gonna understand everything that this
was just a small intro really cool stuff
