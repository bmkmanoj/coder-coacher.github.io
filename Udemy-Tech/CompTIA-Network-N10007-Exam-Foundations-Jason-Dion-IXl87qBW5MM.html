exam in the current version is the N
1000 7 now network plus is a
vendor-neutral networking certification
that has been trusted around the world
it validates your essential knowledge
and skills that you'll need to
confidently design configure manage and
troubleshoot any wired or wireless
device CompTIA Network+ is certifying
individuals that are in demand worldwide
according to CompTIA org now what does
all this mean well it's a vendor neutral
certification which means we're not
going to focus on how you configure a
Cisco router or a juniper switch or a
brocade switch or any of those type of
devices instead we're going to talk
about networking from a vendor neutral
perspective where we cover all devices
we're going to learn all the concepts
and fundamentals which builds the
foundation for you to then learn any
specific manufacturer that you may find
inside your workplace now the exam
itself is going to cover the
configuration management and
troubleshooting of common wired and
wireless networking devices so this will
include things like your desktop in your
laptop but also wireless devices like
smartphones and tablets
it'll also cover things like internet of
things including your thermostat your
TVs and other smart devices we're going
to cover it all if it has a network
connection we're going to talk about it
inside this class this is going to
ensure that you have a good
understanding of network documentation
network standards network security cloud
technologies and virtualization
technologies because all of this is
covered on the Network+ exam now the
Network+ exam is broken down into five
domains with the percentages you see
here on the screen now they're roughly
one-fifth each plus or minus a little
bit so you'll have to study everything
pretty equally if you're going to pass
the exam this includes things like
networking concepts infrastructure
network operations network security and
or troubleshooting in toolsets but don't
worry throughout this video series I'm
going to cover each and every one of
these domains as we go through all of
our videos and teach you everything you
need to know to pass the Network+ exam
now the exam itself is made up of 90
questions or up to 90 questions in 90
minutes now what does that mean well on
the exam you're going to get a mixture
of multiple choice and performance-based
or simulation questions now depending on
how many simulation questions you get
you're going to get less multiple-choice
questions so the maximum number of
questions you're going to get is 90
which is one question per minute which
is a pretty fast pace but in reality
you're probably going to see somewhere
around 70 to 80 questions because you're
going to get somewhere between three and
five simulation or performance based
questions now the multiple choice
questions I find those to be much easier
because you don't have to memorize
things you just have to be able to
recognize things so if I give you four
choices a B C and D you just have to
recognize the right answer not come up
with it from scratch because there is no
fill in the blank questions but there
are simulations now the simulations will
involve doing things like they may have
you set up a wireless router they may
have you reset an IP address those kind
of ideas we'll talk about those
throughout this class as well now the
exam is out of 900 points and you have
to score 720 on that which equates
roughly to 80% the exam itself is
expecting you to have experience of
about nine months of hands-on networking
experience so if you've never touched a
router or switch before you're kind of
coming at this at a disadvantage but
don't worry I'm going to teach you
everything you need to know to pass the
exam and the exam does recommend that
you already have your a plus
certification now it is not a
requirement you don't have to have a
plus to sit for the Network+ exam but
you should have reviewed at least the
materials from a plus and be familiar
with them because a plus focuses very
much on the endpoint devices those
tablets and smartphones laptops desktops
and servers network plus we're going to
focus on
interconnection of all of those devices
so having that background will be very
helpful in this course if at any point
you start finding yourself lost because
you don't have that information in your
back pocket I would recommend checking
here on the platform for an A+ course
and watching through that just to bring
yourself up to speed and get to a level
playing field now the exam is brand new
as of March of 2018 when I'm recording
this video everything I'm going to teach
you is for the current exam n00 7 which
takes everything that was in the old end
zero zero six and adds more to it so as
the exams get on we add more information
and they get a little bit more difficult
but don't worry I've got you covered
I'm going to teach you everything you
need to know to pass the N 10007 version
of the exam now are you ready to go sit
for the certification exam this is a big
question you have to ask yourself at the
end of this course and the reason why is
these exams are not cheap they're gonna
cost you about 300 to 350 dollars to sit
down and take the Network+ and to earn
that certification so when you go in
there you want to make sure you're ready
to pass the way I recommend figuring
that out is taking practice exams you
want to take practice exams if you're
scoring at least 85% or more you're
ready to take the real exam now if
you're not scoring 85% or higher I want
you to take more practice exams and
there are practice exams everywhere for
you to take you can find them on udemy
you can find them on my own website you
can find them in the back of textbooks
that you can get from the library or
safari books or many other places but
take lots of practice exams because
nothing prepares you better for test day
than taking lots and lots of practice
questions now once you've taken these
practice exams and you've gone off to
take the certification exam I want you
to tell me when you pass come back here
and post in the QA let me and your
classmates know how you did did you pass
what was helpful what wasn't helpful
what should we really focus on in our
studies all of that helps each other to
get really better at this and so
we can celebrate with you and celebrate
your win now once you've got that
certification
what is that entitle you to do well the
biggest question I get is what kind of
job can I get with a network plus
certification
well like I said network plus is a
foundational certification so it's used
by a lot of different jobs including
helpdesk technicians Network support
specialists network administrators
Network field technicians network
engineers and network analysts with a
network plus it is an entry-level
certification and to an entry level to
intermediate level position so you're
gonna be able to get jobs that require
about one year of networking experience
now you're gonna have to start
entry-level just like everyone else did
but you'll be able to move up through
those ranks pretty quickly if you have a
good firm handle on the concepts so go
out there get that job and start
building up to the next certification
like security plus or C YSA or ethical
hacker or CISSP network plus is just the
beginning of your journey and it's
really going to set you up for success
