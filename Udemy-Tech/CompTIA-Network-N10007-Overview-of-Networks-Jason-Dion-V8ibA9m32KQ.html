of a computer network what comes to your
mind do you think of a router and a
switch do you think of your wireless
network at home that you're accessing
this video over is it limited to just
computers is it limited to just the
Internet is it limited to Wi-Fi or wired
networks like Ethernet or fiber well no
there are a lot of networks out there
there are a ton of them and when it
comes down to it the purpose of networks
is to make connections between machines
now if you have an Apple watch
there's a connection going between your
watch and your phone over Bluetooth and
that is a network it's called a personal
area network there's the typical Wi-Fi
network that you're used to when your
cell phone connects to the wireless
access point to connect to the internet
or your laptop's connecting to a hub
which then connects to a switch which
connects to a router which connects to
the internet there's all sorts of
networks out there and these networks
all have been converging in the old days
we had different networks for different
purposes when I grew up we had a
telephone network and all it did was
make analog phone calls and then we had
computer networks that would transmit
data back and forth and they were
separate things but over time all of
this has merged and now we have voice
video and data all traveling over the
same network when you pick up your cell
phone it doesn't care whether you're
making a voice call whether you're
making a text message or you're doing a
data the Surfing of the internet all of
it is treated the same it's all ones and
zeros going over a digital network and
now we have become so reliant on our
networks that we expect a hundred
percent uptime and while realistically
we can't get a hundred percent we have
come to expect at least 99.999% which we
call the five nines of availability what
does that really equate to in our
networks in a business network
it means I'm allowed five minutes of
downtime or year that's it 365 days 24
hours in a day and I have to be up all
of it with the exception of five minutes
that's the challenge of network
technicians we've got to keep those
networks up and keep that data flowing
and that's what we're going to teach you
how to do in this course so what are
some examples of network traffic
well there's file sharing there's video
chatting like Skype and FaceTime they're
surfing the web when you go to Google or
you to me or Jason Dion calm or Dion
training.com
there's social media with Google+ and
LinkedIn and Facebook and Twitter
there's streaming video like you're
watching right now or YouTube there is
email there's messaging and there's
voice over IP all of these are examples
of network traffic and there's new
network traffic being designed all the
time that's what we're going to be
supporting with our networks and it is a
huge challenge to maintain 99.999%
uptime
but we're going to work our way through
it as we go through this course thank
you for watching if you'd like to learn
more check out my Network+ certification
