to debug with Python and also how to use
the built-in date/time library python
comes with a powerful debugger that can
help you find mistakes in your code we
can set a trace that allows us to
essentially stop our code at any point
hold it on pause and then decide and
explore variables and operations we're
also going to discuss pythons date/time
capabilities let's load up a notebook
and see how these libraries work
let's imagine that we have three
variables X as a string one Y as an
integer two and then Z as the integer
three and maybe later on you have
hundreds of lines of code and somewhere
along those lines you say result is
equal to y plus Z and then you print out
the results and then a couple hundred
lines down you say okay result is equal
to y plus X and then you get this type
error and maybe you get another error
that you really can't interpret this
one's a little easier to interpret it
says integer plus string so you know one
of these is an integer and one of these
is string but maybe you're also having
trouble telling which is which so if you
have hundreds of lines of code it's
going to be really hard to try to find
where your error is occurring and in
order to solve this issue we can
initiate a trace using the debugger
module so to do this the first thing we
need to do is import Python debugger or
PDB and then let's set up the situation
again so we'll have X equal to this one
string y equal to two Z is equal to
three and then let's just say there's
lots more code here so hundreds of lines
and then we'll say result is equal to y
plus Z and then we print out the results
and then somewhere along the line we
have a lot more code so more and more
code and then we're going to set a trace
here we say PDB and then we call the set
trace method open and close parentheses
and then you have lots more code and
then we'll say new result is equal to y
plus X and then we're going to print
that new result let's make sure it's an
underscore there we go let's take a look
at what we have set up here I have my
three variables defined we can imagine
there's lots of more code I have some
sort of operation and then I have lots
more code and we're going to comment out
this set trace for right now
lots more code and then we tried a new
result and print a new result if I run
the cell I get some sort of type error
and it tells me hey your type error is
happening at this line line 17 where you
having a new result is equal to y plus X
and I'm getting this type error but
maybe I have so much code here that I'm
really unsure what Y is and what X is
and when you're starting off programing
what you sometimes do is in order to
debug you just print out maybe type of x
over here and then you print out type of
Y and this is a way for debugging for
beginners since they need to print out a
bunch of statements and see what is
actually what so then when they run this
code they see oh it was a string integer
they look back and they say oh X was
that string so that's the problem
however it's much easier to use a trace
so we're going to uncomment this line
and have Python debugger set trace and
what this does is it runs all the code
above that trace command and then allows
you to pause and have an interaction
with a Python shell so we're going to
run this and here we can see the Python
debugger and now I can type variables
out as if they were already defined in a
shell so I can type in X and it gives me
back X and I can see here it's a string
or I can type Y and it gives me back to
here or I can say what is the type of X
hit enter and it tells me class string
and this is a much easier way to play
around if your variables and check
what's happening and you can even do
operations here you can do something
like Z plus y hit enter and it will tell
you the result is 5 so you can both
check variables do operations all is if
you had a Python shell open right in the
middle of your code this allows you to
interact with the variables that you've
already defined instead of having to add
in a bunch of print statements and it
saves you a lot of time because now you
don't need to search your code and kind
of discover where the problems are
instead you can interactively set a
trace and then work with your code there
and when you want to finally end this
you can just type in quit and it will
quit the Python debugger
so that's how this works you can see we
have the kind of quick command but it
allows you to set a trace and then play
around all the variables as if you had a
shell open there now there's a lot more
functionality for the Python debugger
but definitely the one you're going to
be using the most is this set trace
functionality so keep it in mind next
time you find yourself having a bug
that's hard to find let's now discuss
date/time objects and this basically
just shows you how to work with basic
dates and times in Python in order to
create a date or a time you need to
import the date/time library and then
you can say something like t is equal to
date time dot time and then you pass in
the hour and this is a 24-hour clock the
minutes 15 minutes and then we can even
pass in seconds and if you want you can
even pass in microseconds but we won't
do that for now so we can show you what
happens if you don't pass them and you
have this date/time object so if you say
type T it's this date time that time
object meaning that it's indicating a
time and we can grab the hour off of
that time or the minutes or the seconds
and you can even grab microseconds off
of this if you don't define the
microseconds when you created this
date/time object it'll just default to 0
and it's the same for not defining
seconds so if we were to take off the
second and then rerun this it would end
up saying seconds is equal to 0 and
microseconds is equal to 0 if you want
to get the current date then you can use
a date object so that's going to be
similarly date/time except instead of
saying time you will say dot date and
then if you want you can define a date
using year-month-day so you can do
something like 20 18 months is 10 day is
11 and then you have this date object or
if you want today's date you can say
date time date and then say today run
that and that will grab the dates off of
your computer's operating system so it
will say 2018 january 18th and if you
want the date time that is both the date
and the time
can say date time date time and then say
now and that grabs both the date and the
time information so here we can see the
dates information and then here is the
time information hour minute second and
then microseconds so there's both time
objects which is just the time there's
the date object which is the months the
year and the day itself and then there's
date time objects which is both the day
and the actual time so let's quickly
show you an example of how you could
time your code because most often you're
going to be interested in using this
library if you're trying to figure out
what's the most efficient way to do
something and the way to do that let's
say you had a list comprehension saying
results x squared for X in range and
let's make this a larger number we'll
say a 10,000 so I want to know how long
did it take to actually create that
result what I can do is create an
initial timestamp T is equal to 0 and
say date/time dot date/time now and then
right after we run results I'm going to
say T 1 is equal to date time dot
date/time dot now and then what I can do
is say that the difference is equal to
date time at point 1 minus date time
initial at T 0 and if I check out my
different object object with CIF I can
check out the microseconds and it took a
total of 4,000 14 microseconds for this
result to run and if you check out
seconds it's going to be 0 because it's
not a long enough time for it to
actually measure it out in seconds so it
only took in this case four thousand
fourteen microseconds now this number
may be different depending on your
computer and if you make this number too
small for example if you just make it
ten this is going to run so fast that
it's likely your computer won't be able
to actually catch how fast it did it so
we're gonna run this and see if we can
catch the difference and it looks like
it was 502 microseconds so keeping
depending on how fast your computer is
if this number is too small it may just
say zero here in my case my computer was
able to catch it because it took some
time but that's something to know if
you're having really fast operations it
won't really make a difference timing
them instead you can run them multiple
times and this diff object if we check
it out
it's a time delta object which is
essentially just the difference between
due to date/time objects and that's
really it for the date/time module so as
a review off of date/time you have time
objects that you can create which
indicate hours minutes seconds and
microseconds you have date objects you
can create which is years the month and
the day and then you have date/time
objects and a lot of people tend to work
with date/time objects because if they
don't want the time information they can
just default it to zero so we have the
year the month the day and then hours
minutes seconds microseconds and this
allows you to quickly time your code so
you can test which block of code is more
efficient we'll see you at the next
