the HTML CSS JavaScript crash course
where we're trying to build this simple
website right now this is what we have
not quite there but we've got all this
the page structure in this video we're
gonna focus on cleaning it up making it
prettier throwing some paint on it
shrinking this image down absolutely
but also changing the background color
the font the the button needs a lot of
work if you can compare it to what we're
trying to end up with there's a lot of
stuff to do also making the image a
circle okay
so CSS is what we're going to use to do
that and first things first we need to
open up the correct file in the starter
code which you can also download if you
haven't been following along you can
just download the current starter code
that already has the HTML written open
up app dot CSS in whatever editor you're
going to use so I have it open here
there's already a line in here I won't
go into too much detail but I just
didn't want you to have to type this
yourself this is importing a font from a
website called google fonts we can't use
all the fonts that you might want to use
in the browser so if there's one fancy
font you definitely want then this is
one way of getting them assuming that
they are free a lot of fonts aren't but
anyway we're not going to go into that
this is here for you as starter code
this is how we write a comment in CSS so
if I go to this line and type command
slash we're no longer importing that
font it's just there now let's dive into
the real syntax so CSS is all about
styling HTML elements so we have all
these elements we say things like I want
to make the h1s on this HTML page purple
and I want to make that font Helvetica
and their font size 200 pixels and I
want to add a 1 picture pixel green
border we do that through CSS so we
specify what we're trying to style and
then we specify what the styles should
be if I go back to app dot CSS let's add
in our very first rule so we type the
name of an element a tag name like h1
and then curly
races and I'm gonna hit enter in between
then inside of here I add the actual
properties I want to change so if I had
a note here I'd say what we are
selecting then instead of here the note
would be how to style it so these are
just notes again they don't do anything
what we want to do let's let's start by
changing the color of that h1 and we
just type color colon and then you can
see sublime text automatically added
this semicolon every CSS property we
style will end with that colon or
semicolon so color and let's go with
purple my favorite color so we have a
property named colon purple semicolon
save the file and unfortunately it's not
going to work just yet because this HTML
file has nothing to do with this CSS
file they're not speaking to one another
if you are using code pen to follow
along you do not have to connect the
files that's one of the good things but
also a bad thing from an educators point
of view is that you don't have to worry
about that but in the real world you do
so the way we do it is through another
HTML tag that we haven't seen I'm going
to put it in the head so the body is
where we put our content that shows up
on the page the actual elements the
structure of the page the head is where
we put metadata things like the title of
our document or a reference to a CSS
file so our CSS file is called app dot
CSS it's in the same folder the tag name
we need is called a link tab link tag so
I'm just going to type link and hit tab
and it autocompletes a bunch of this
stuff link and then this rel equals
stylesheet attribute we won't worry
about that type equals text dot CSS so
we're linking to a CSS file and then
href an href needs to be the path to
find this file which in our case is
simply the name of the file app dot CSS
if you change the file name or if you're
following along name it whatever you
want but you need to refer to it using
that name and if it's in a subfolder
then reference that folder fold
whatever it is slash app DEP CSS or
Styles that's a common way of
structuring things okay so we have app
dev CSS now it is linked and we are
styling all each one's to be purple
we only happen to have one but it would
affect all of them so if you save and
refresh our page see if you can see that
beautiful purple text excellent okay so
the rest of this video is just gonna be
us going through a couple properties at
a time styling the elements and let's
actually begin with the background color
of the body so the whole page has this
salmony color I'm going to select the
body which is where everything is inside
of so this will give everything a salmon
background color if I select the body
and the property is called background -
color you can actually see in sublime we
get all this autocomplete so background
- color and rather than typing one of
the built-in colors like purple or
yellow I'm going to use a custom color
using a hexadecimal code if you don't
know much about color it's just a system
for representing colors and we're gonna
type F six nine six eight zero six nine
six eight zero and save alright and if
we go back now refresh we get that
salmon color next let's finish out the
Styles with the body so I'm gonna give
everything in the body a color so I'm
actually gonna undo this color purple
for now I'll just comment it out command
slash and instead I'm going to assign
color to the body and what that will do
is change the text color of everything
inside of it unless we override it
unless I specify no h1 should actually
be yellow so color and I have another
hexadecimal code and this is for a
purplish color so octothorpe or whatever
this is called hash symbol - e1 - 63
yes I am reading that sorry for that
awkward pause save now refresh our page
notice right now all the way down here
this is black text only the h1 was
purple
but now the h1 is this purplish shade
and so is this text down here cool now
let's finish up we're gonna change the
font of everything in the body we're
going to do font family and then we
change it to the name of a font which
I've already imported up here for you
it's called in the font it's called
source code Pro that's coming from
Google so your computer most likely
doesn't have this the browser definitely
won't have this we have to include a
custom font which I didn't have you type
save at our semicolon we need one of
those after every property and then go
back keep your eye on this h1 as i
refresh awesome so that is now a
different font as is this down here so
what we've seen not only can we style
specific elements like this like an h1
or a button but if we style a parent
like the body and I say okay the body
has a font of source code Pro and a
background color of salmon or a font
color of purple this had a font color of
purple this had a font pillow of color
of purple a button is a special case
I'll talk about why later but what we've
seen is something called inheritance
where the color is being inherited from
the body style because we didn't specify
anything for the h1 next if we do
compare the font here to the font here
you can notice it's a lot thinner this
is way bolder so there's a property that
we can use to change that called font
weight font - weight and we set it to a
number and I actually imported all
different font weights if you want to
use these it's actually better to only
import the ones you need but if you'd
like to experiment we can say font
weight is 207 refresh the page and
you'll notice that our h1 is still the
same weight but down at the bottom the
paragraph is lighter weight that did
change so what happened well without
going into too much detail if I
right-click and go to inspect in
and make sure I'm inspecting this h1 if
we scroll down somewhere here we go
these are the default styles that my
browser assigns and it gave it a font
weight of bolt so you can see inherited
from body font weight 200 is crossed out
it's not being applied because my
browser automatically gave it font
weight of bold it just decides that
every h1 should be bold unless I
specifically say it shouldn't be so if I
go back I'm just gonna copy this line
but instead add it to h1 this is more
specific this is going to override and
if i refresh now that change takes
effect we don't have time in this video
to go into a ton of detail about how all
this works but every browser has default
styles that's how we saw that black and
white text that's how you know the
default button styles for example will
look different in Safari compared to
Chrome or Internet Explorer and in our
case font weight was set to be bold
now it's crossed out because I manually
specified it for the h1 so there are
rules that govern what styles apply when
if there's a conflict okay I will close
out of here now let's get this image
shrunken down so I don't have to keep
scrolling across this football field to
do that we just select image tag and I
may I mentioned this earlier when we
write h1 here this is applying to all H
once it just happens that we only have
one h1 on our page but if we had more
than one all of them would be font
weight 200 we only ever have one body on
our page but if for some reason you
added two then both of them would have
these styles so I'm going to type IMG
for the image tag and to set the width
of the image or the height we can just
pick one I'll do height 500 pixels it's
the number that I decided on and if I go
back now and refresh way better and I
just zoomed out to the actual size a
hundred percent this is what it looks
like so 500 pixels it's not that large
that's great let's let's get it rounded
now
so there's another property to make
things round you might be wondering
where these properties are coming from
or how do you know what is a property if
you go to mdn just like in the last
video there's a CSS reference instead of
HTML and we scroll down these are all
the properties we can set there's a lot
there's more properties than HTML tags
so there's things like background color
which you've worked with background size
what else
scroll behavior alignment letter spacing
display Direction align content there's
just a bunch of things that we're not
really going to get into but if you ever
have questions you can come here and the
property we want to make the corners
rounded is called border radius and
border radius if we specify a small
percentage like 10% and add that
semicolon if i refresh you can see it
round to the corners a bit but if we go
50% at least on a square image it gives
us a circle okay
so that's that we have a circle now
let's finish up our h1 how do we get it
to have this underline or over line
actually that's what that is
and also notice it's all uppercase and
here it's lowercase or it's mixed case
whatever you only called that and if we
actually inspect the solution website if
you look at the HTML it's not all in
caps so that's done through CSS so how
do we do that if we go back to my editor
I'm going to go into the h1 styles and
instead of color purple we'll delete
that let's start by adding in a property
called text transform and setting it to
uppercase this will take the text in
there and upper case at all and while
I'm here I'm also going to add a border
and the syntax our border looks like
this we have five pixels or however many
pixels wide we want the border and then
a style we want it to be solid or dashed
I pretty much only use solid but you
could make a dotted border if you wanted
to and if I just do this it's going to
use the color of the h1
fresh which is that purplish color and
it uses that by default I could also
specify a color like what would dark
green something easy to tell refresh and
it uses green but if I don't specify
anything it just uses the color that's
already there but we don't want to
border all the way around
we just want border top save and refresh
that gives us this top border now as far
as the positioning of everything why
this is all left and not in the middle
how do we change that it's kind of a lot
of work CSS positioning is notoriously a
pain so there's entire courses actually
on that there are crash courses that are
much longer than this solely focused
around positioning and layout and how do
you get elements to go where you want
them to go without too much pain so what
I'm gonna do to kind of skip over that
it's just give you a couple lines of
code to add that I'm not gonna go into a
ton of detail on I apologize I hate
doing this but it will make our life a
lot easier and make this look a lot
nicer it's just a couple of lines what
I'm going to do is actually go back to
my index take all of this and wrap it in
a new tag called a div tag and a div
actually instead of a div let's do a
section a section tag this is just an
arbitrary wrapper for other HTML that
allows me to group it together and do
something with it so I'm gonna indent it
all you don't have to indent it it's
just a matter of style making it look
nicer to humans a section tag that's
what I've done and I'm going to give
this an attribute called container ID as
the name of the attribute I'm gonna set
it to container this is just optional
but it's because I want to show you how
to use an ID an ID allows us to give a
name a label to an element that I could
refer to in my CSS so instead of typing
section if I'm going to style that that
will style all sections it only happens
that we have one but if we had more than
one all of them would be styled but if I
reference container and I have to use
this symbol that's what means it's an ID
and then the name of the ID container
whatever I put in here
only applies to that one element if I
move this ID to the h1 then the Styles
apply to this h1 if I move it to the
button they apply to that button so in
here I'm just gonna set a couple
properties I'm going to fast forward and
I'm back now so this code like I said
we're not going over in detail but it
serves to Center the content vertically
and horizontally these two lines are
responsible for that it uses something
called flexbox whoops which we I'm
establishing that here and here I'm
telling it how much space to consider
the playing field so it's using a
hundred percent of that height and
centering centering itself vertically in
that hundred percent but that's all
leave it at and if we refresh the page
take a look at that we're now centered
vertically and horizontally so I'm feel
bad about having to do that but like I
said we could spend forever just talking
about how that works it's pretty
complicated compared to things like
color so next up I'm gonna make this
bigger because if we look at my version
significantly bigger to do that we can
use a property called font size so back
here for h1 I'm going to add font size
and there's a lot of Units we can use
I'm gonna stick with what most people
are familiar with px pixels another
common unit are called EMS but I'm gonna
stick with pixels because this is a
crash course we don't have time for that
save refresh the page there we go so
we're getting a lot closer
let's start by tackling the button so
the button is a pain and the reason it's
a pain is that there's a bunch of
built-in default styles that make it
look like this and we have to override a
lot of properties and we have to tell it
for example to remove this ugly outline
that we get so there's a couple of
things we just have to do and we'll
begin by selecting button and where
should we start let's set the background
color so we've already worked with that
and the background color should be that
salmony color so I'll just copy that and
paste then let's change the font size to
be 14 pixels and let's also change the
text
on property so it's aligned to the
center and if I look at it now okay not
much better I'm going to make this
bigger you can see that background is
now that salmon color we still have this
hideous outline and a border so I'm
going to go back and I'm going to
override the border and I'm gonna make
it one pixel solid and I'm gonna use the
same purple color we used for our text
copy that down there one pixel solid
purple only one semicolon needed okay so
it changes that and now I'm just gonna
run through a couple of other properties
I'm going to give it a text transform
again make it all uppercase you could
just make your HTML uppercase but this
is nice if you want to do something
stylistically but you don't to impact
the HTML and I also just think it's kind
of cool to show you I'm going to now
change text decoration to be Nunn and
outline to be none and that will take
care of a lot of it so now notice we
don't when I click on it we actually
don't get any feedback that I'm clicking
on it we will fix that by adding a
little hover effect in just a bit but
this is getting closer to take care of
the size of the button to make the
button larger to add the spacing here
and then also spacing afterwards before
and after I'm going to just skip through
these two properties very quickly
there's one called margin I'm just going
to type this here this is one that
you'll have to bear with me I'm going to
just kind of blow through it another one
is called padding all that I'll say is
these both impact spacing this is the
space between the element and the border
so on the inside of that wall the border
this is the space on the outside between
other elements and i refresh the page
you can see now that it has has some
space around the button so that's the
padding here in between the text and the
border and then we have space before and
after and that's the margin and that's
all I'll say about it because there's
more to talk about there for another
video okay next let's actually get this
hovering effect to work it's supposed to
work like this where I hover over it and
it turns purple
and it's really easy to do that we
select button separately : hover and
whatever styles I put here will only be
applied when the button is hovered over
so what we want to do is make the
background color purple so instead of
this pink I'm going to use this and then
we want to make the regular color the
font color salmon so we're going to
basically invert it and if i refresh
there we go
but you'll notice there's a difference
this takes longer I set the time to be a
third of a second I believe 0.3 seconds
this is happening instantaneously to add
that little time delay in what we can do
is go in here and add a property called
transition and transition there's
there's a lot to talk about with that
the simplest thing we can do is just
type a number like if I'd do 3 s for 3
seconds this says any change to the
button whatever it is background color
size font should take 3 seconds that's
too long for us but just to show you it
now takes 3 seconds I'm going to change
it to somewhere around 0.3 seconds and
we get it just nicer effect I'm also
going to add in an underline
text-decoration:underline
and I'm going to space out the letters a
bit more using letter spacing so this is
not in the hover section this is just on
the button in general and I'm going to
do like 4 pixels between the letters so
if you look at them now and then I
refresh they're spaced out more and
there's this little underline that we
get when I hover awesome so looking at
the two the only remaining differences
are if i zoom way in this text is still
black when it stopped being hovered so I
need to change that color and the font
size is slightly off on the paragraph it
is larger if i zoom out it's hard to
tell but it's a little bit larger so on
the button I'm going to add in color and
set that s where I already did that
hmm well color now is going to be that
purple color and then we're not styling
the paragraph anywhere so down here
we'll just do P and then set the font
size to be 20 pixels refresh there we go
there's our website at least
stylistically it's done so this was a
whirlwind I want to be clear that we
covered a lot and there's no way if
you're brand new to CSS that most of
this would sink in the key takeaways are
one the fact that CSS styles HTML
elements so there has to be an element
there we then select types of elements
or a particular element using an ID and
then in the brackets we use these pairs
where we set a property and then a
corresponding value font should be
source code Pro font weight should be
200 text transform is uppercase there's
just tons and tons of properties we can
use we use a lot of them here but we
barely scratched the surface so if you
do feel overwhelmed just keep in mind
that the point of this course is to just
expose you to all of this if you had a
typo if you know it's going too fast for
you at any point I just recommend you
explore the code download the solution
and try changing numbers see what
happens if you do a smaller border
radius or you change the font weight oh
the colors of any of that stuff alright
next we're going to talk about
