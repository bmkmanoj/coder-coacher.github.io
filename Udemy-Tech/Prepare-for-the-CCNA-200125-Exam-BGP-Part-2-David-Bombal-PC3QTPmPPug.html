you troubleshoot CCNA scenarios in
preparation for the CCNA exam in a
previous vlog we configured to this
topology which consists of two
autonomous systems sixty-five thousand
and one and sixty-five thousand and two
this is a troubleshooting vlog we've
been told for that rather one is not
able to ping rather fall and we can see
that in the output here pings are
failing so let's do a trace route 215 1
1 2 it doesn't look like the traffic is
going anywhere
in other words it doesn't look like it's
leaving the local router we don't see a
response from right at - as an example
so let's investigate show IP rot the
routing table does include a BGP route
but it doesn't include the 15 Network
show IP BGP the 15 network is also not
found in the BGP routing table but show
IP BGP summary as an example does show
us that we have a established connection
to router to the state of blank here
indicates that the connection - Radha -
is established son Radha - we could do
something similar show IP BGP 15 Network
is not found in router to either let's
check on route of 3 show IP BGP so the
15 network is found in the BGP routing
table of router 3 it's been advertised
by 15 that 1.1.2 which is route of four
and it's being advertised by the local
router
so router 3 has added that route to the
BGP routing table but for some reason
it's not being advertised to route it -
so I'm rather to show IP BGP summary can
you see a problem
notice this neighbor relationship is
idle so that relationship from Radha to
to router 3 is idle that means that no
rods will be established the neighbor
relationship has to be established we
can see something similar on Radha 3 no
neighbor relationship is established
between Radha - and router 310 Radha 3
ping Radha - yes it can ping Radha - so
we have IP connectivity
let's check the configuration of the
neighbor statements so show run pipe
begin or section BGP and I'll do it here
as well so show run pipe section BGP so
there's the configuration of both
routers can you spot - the problem this
allows us to see that there's a problem
in the configuration and if we do the
command show IP BGP neighbor that should
also show you where the problem is so
notice here BGP neighbor 8.8.8.8
autonomous system 65,000 and - internal
link that's incorrect
Radha - is in a separate autonomous
system - router 3 right at Tuesday
Ptolemy's system is sixty five thousand
and one not sixty-five thousand and two
so this configuration is incorrect
seconf t Radha BGP 65,000 and - no
neighbour
8.8.8.8
88.1 remote autonomous system 65,000 and
one let's see if that solve problem show
IP BGP summary still Idol but BGP
relationships do take time to establish
there you can see it's now established
and we've received two prefixes from
router to show IP BGP neighbor that
looks good this is what we want to see
so on Radha one show IP BGP we are now
learning about Network 15 1 1 0
shall I be wrought that's now in the IP
writing-table ping 15 dat 1.1.2
ping now succeeds tres 15 one one two
tres succeeds we are going to router to
router 3 and write a 4 as expected
now are purposely disabled logging what
you would see on a real router is a
warning message so I turned off logging
so let's put that back log in console
and on write a to log in console and
I'll set to the configuration back to
what it was in other words I'll break it
again just so that you can see what
would happen in a real device if logging
was enabled so no neighbor a today -
today did one notice now we see a lot of
logging messages a today today - one
remote autonomous system and it was set
incorrectly before to this value so
that's what it was like when we started
and noticed suddenly we're getting
messages like this bgp message dump
unsupported or malformed message
received from a today - today - one we
get a hexadecimal representation of the
autonomous system number
so we told that there's a problem with
the neighbor on this side we see that
there was a notification received and
the neighbor relationship was reset if
you see hexadecimal messages like this
it means that there's an autonomous
system number mismatch that's
hexadecimal so you could convert it to
work out what the autonomous number is
set to but that's not required for the
CCNA course
so what we'll do here is do show run
pipe section BGP you set it back to what
it should be
so rather BGP sixty-five thousand and
two neighbor or rather no neighbor
8.8.8.8
eight today dot one remote autonomous
system sixty-five thousand and one so
hopefully now the neighbor relationship
should go up and there you go
it has show IP BGP summary state is
established to rats have been received
show IP PGP neighbor
we can confirm that it's established
using show IP BGP neighbor and there you
go show IP route 50 network has been
learnt paying fifteen one one two that
works and on router for paying seventeen
dot one dot one dot one that works so
that's an example of troubleshooting BGP
where there's been a miss configuration
of the neighbor relationships in BGP
remember just because I want to be your
neighbor doesn't mean that you want to
be my neighbor both sides have to agree
to a neighbor relationship and both
sides have to be configured correctly
with the correct IP addresses and
correct autonomous system numbers if you
