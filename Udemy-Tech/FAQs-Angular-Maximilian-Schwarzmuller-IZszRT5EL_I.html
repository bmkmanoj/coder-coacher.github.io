dive into some common angular questions
now to be honest these are just a
questions that came into my mind when I
thought about which questions I see a
lot if you got our questions please
share them in the comments of the video
I probably won't be able to answer them
all there but I will note them and I
might do another video of this kind at
the future and with that let's just get
started and see which questions I got
let's start with one thing that
sometimes leads to a lot of confusion
the angular version jungle we got
angular 2 4 5 6 soon at least so what
are all these versions about well let's
have a look in the past we had angular 1
it was released in 2010 and it was not
the first JavaScript framework
manipulating the Dom but it still
started a little bit of a revolution you
could say it suddenly allowed people to
create single page applications
it made controlling the DOM and
dynamically rendering content there so
much easier and it still also had issues
performance could become an issue in
bigger apps and this was one of the
major reasons why the team decided to do
a complete rewrite of angular and
release angular 2 in 2016 now the road
to angular 2 was pretty long a lot of
versions were released in between a lot
of beta versions but in the end we had a
brand new framework that still allows us
to create engaging user experiences in
the browser but with a different focus
angular 2 and all the words thereafter
focus on creating single page
applications and they are highly
component driven so like and react and
so on you build components so the key
takeaway here is that angular 2 has
nothing in common with angular 1 it's a
complete rewrite and it inherits some
concepts but the majority of things you
use an angular q is brand you or works
totally different than it did in angular
1 now what about the other versions now
due to that difference in the
capabilities we nowadays typically refer
to angular 1 as angularjs that's the
name of the framework nowadays and
angular q and all versions thereafter
are simply referred to as angular just
angular speaking of that why do we have
more work than just angular q because
the angular team adopt
semantic versioning which means there
are major releases minor releases and
patch releases so maybe they're just
fixing some bugs maybe they're
introducing some major new features and
the word number indicates that the
important thing is angular free and four
and so on are not complete rewrites of
angular 2 speaking of that we never had
an angular free due to internal version
differences with the router and so on so
angular 4 was the next release and
thereafter we had 5 6 and so on now at
the point of time recording this angular
6 isn't out yet but new versions will
come out every few months due to that
semantic versioning and you can actually
see a schedule of past and future
angular versions on the official angular
github repository a link to that
schedule can be found in the video
description there you see the more
recent versions that were released in
the past and when we will see angular 6
and 7 approximately now again if you
look at these versions it looks like
everything you'll learn will be well
stuff you don't need once the new
version is out and that is not the case
the version upgrades are backward
compatible and thus far until angular 5
we had no upgrade that introduced any
major breaking changes at all and there
is a long term version support so a
version which will receive security
patches and so on even if it's a bit
older currently that's angular 4 so you
can find more information on that page
the key takeaway is angular 5 6 7 and so
on is the new normal 80 because it's not
a new framework every time it's just an
update just as we have react 16 17 15
and so on now that we understood the
different versions of angular let's have
a look at how we create angular projects
now chances are you already noticed and
I'm not going to show you the exact
steps here you might know that there is
the angular CLI you can use the question
is do I need the CLI do you need to see
why I get this question a lot people
especially people coming from jQuery or
angular
one are used to dropping the angular
import into their HTML files and
starting to use angular unfortunately
that does not work with angular 2 plus
one of the major reasons is that we use
typescript instead of vanilla JavaScript
so the language in which we write our
code doesn't run natively in the browser
obviously we need a compilation step in
between and whilst theoretically you
could do that compilation in the browser
it's not really recommended it's a big
performance hit we also have components
and templates that use the angular a
template language this also needs to be
compiled by angular so from JavaScript
to JavaScript but to a different
JavaScript which has a meaning to
angular and this could also happen the
browser but again for performance
reasons it's recommended to do this on
the client so in your on your
development machine actually and we also
probably want to employ some
optimizations like minifying our code
and so on this also should be done
during development or at the end of it
right before shipping the app to
production so whilst we do have all
these options of running the types of
compilation in the browser or running
the angular template compilation in the
browser this does not work so we want to
do it in the development setup in the
development workflow and the same is
true for bundling minifying implementing
lazy loading and stuff like that now for
that we use tools like web pack or
typescript of course also minification
optimization tools and babel possibly to
also transpile some features though here
we use typescript so probably not there
are more tools still included in all of
that for all the optimizations and all
these steps and you can set up such a
workflow on your own what you can't do
is just drop it into the browser and use
it without taking a huge performance set
at least but the easiest way really to
get around all of that is to use the CLI
this CLI gives you a really good and
flexible workflow you can eject from a
CLI project to get access to the under
web.config so it's not a lock-in but
starting with it creating projects with
it and using its capabilities really as
a good approach because the seal I team
which is part of the angular team kind
of is actively working on this Eli and
keeps on improving it to give you ever
better angular performance ever better
angular apps generated by this Eli so I
can only encourage you to use it you
might not find another github
boilerplate that is dead actively
developed now that we had a look at this
Eli let's say we opened angular in our
editor and let's say that editor is
Visual Studio code I often get asked
which extensions I can recommend for it
and I might not be the person with the
most extensions I am a fan of only using
up to you and for angular there really
is one major extension I wanna recommend
and that is the angular essentials
extension from John Papa this is a
extension that bundles a lot of other
extensions so if you go to the
extensions part of visuals to your code
and you open that extension you see the
average tensions it includes
and these extensions really make
developing angular apps much more fun
you get better auto completion you get
nice syntax highlighting all that fun
stuff with the installation of just that
single extension so definitely have a
look at that let's leave these set up
world and let's have a look at the real
development problems we face when
creating an angular app and debugging
angular apps tends to be one of the
hardest things from my experience so
from the questions I saw and one thing
that really isn't done correctly a lot
of the time unfortunately is reading the
error messages angular error messages
became a lot better and often they give
a clear hint about what it's wrong or at
least where you should look for an error
sometimes the error message gives an
incorrect error but still points at the
correct file and you find an average
syntax error that led to the inquiry
error message so read the error messages
and try to incorporate the information
you find in there let's have a look at a
few here are two error messages the
first one says uncaught error template
parse errors app product is not a known
element you often get that if you forget
to declare your custom components so if
you didn't add them to the declarations
array an app module make sure that you
check if that's the case if you did add
them to declarations and you use
multiple angular modules make sure that
they interact correctly with each other
that you don't use a component in a
module where this hasn't been added to
declarations that's not a common error
source so read these errors and then
dive into that part or into that file
it's pointing to here in this case to
the app product component which somehow
seems to be unknown check the selector
for typos maybe you have the wrong
selector set up in the component
decorator of the product component these
are the things you should have a look at
take these messages seriously and if you
can't find a solution Google them you
find a lot of github issue threats a lot
of Stack Overflow threats for all kinds
of common error messages besides reading
error messages correctly also use good
old console lock debugging it's not the
best debugging approach in the world and
it simply means that you put a bunch of
console locks into your code and you
lock different objects properties things
you want to have a look at you see them
in the JavaScript console in the browser
and see the values these properties and
so on hold at certain points in your app
this is not the best way to thoroughly
debug an app but to get a quick insight
into the state of something into the
state of your app at a given point this
is a good solution a better solution of
course is to use the source Maps the CLI
project gives you automatically source
maps are little files the Chrome or in
general the browser developer tools can
use two
create a bridge from the compiled and
optimized JavaScript code running in the
browser to your original files which are
of course easier to read for you so use
these source maps in conjunction with
the browser dev tools let me show you
how this works here is a broken angular
app and we got an error now let's have a
look at the source code from within the
dev tools we can simply click on sources
here and there in a seal I project which
creates these source Maps I was talking
about you should find that web pack
folder if you access it in the subfolder
in there you should find a folder which
in the end replicates your app structure
so where you find a source app folder
with your actual typescript files and
now in these files you can even set
breakpoints to stop at certain points of
time you get an insight at the value of
a certain property for example so this
is really something I can recommend
having a look at because this is a
powerful tool that allows you to take an
in-depth look at your app and
dynamically debug it with breakpoints
with all the features the developer
tools gives you in your typescript files
even though these are not the fast
running in the browser so this is really
powerful use these tools and you get
that for free in a CLI project you can
just dive into your source code like
this there also is an average rule
besides the already implemented browser
developer tools the browser's shipped
with and that's augury that's a Chrome
extension which you can install from the
Chrome extension store it's free of
course and this is a tool that gives you
detailed insight into your app at
runtime the difference to the browser
developer tools is that augur is aware
of the angular architecture and
therefore it gives you a good overview
over the different components in your
app something you don't see easily in
the browser because the rendered Dom
doesn't contain these it gives you
access that the properties of your
components the state of them it gives
you access to
injections happening in your app so a
detailed look at what's happening at
yura in your app at runtime being aware
of the angular concepts like services
like dependency injections on so
definitely have a look at this to you
access it from the developer tools
thereafter and you can simply analyze
your page with it as you do with the
normal developer tools the ones
implemented in the browser so you do
with that but augury offers some extra
features that are tailored for angular
and if you're using ng rx you should
also have a look at the redux dev tools
which you can connect to and grx you can
find instructions on that on the ng RX
documentation and this allows you to
have a look into your ng rx store so
these are the things I want to bring to
your attention to dive deeper into these
are a lot of great tools that help you
debug your angular apps okay let's leave
the world of errors and let's have a
look at something else I get asked a lot
how can I pass data from component H
component B so here's a concrete set up
with AB component a products component
and a product component now one easy way
to pass data around is by property
binding with that input and so on you
pass data from app component to product
component and maybe then data from
products to product component property
binding is only possible from parent to
child component so only one level at a
time there for reaching out from app
component to product component is not
possible if you wanted to do that you
would use a service instead a service in
between possibly or typically to be
honest with the rxjs
subject which is like an observable but
one where you can emit events on your
own with next so where you can emit an
event let's say from the app component
and where you then subscribe in some
other place of your app and that place
could also be a service by the way or
something like that now here it would be
the product component and all of a
sudden we have a connection from app
component to product component through
the service and the subject and there's
all the works the other way around we
can omit to our
steam vents to pay us data up from a
child to a parent component but emitting
an event from product component to app
component directly it's not possible but
again we can use a service with a
subject to emit an event and listen to
it in an average component so this is
how we can communicate between
components and pass data around now
important if you're using rxjs subjects
don't forget to unsubscribe in the
components where you do subscribe in ng
ondestroy
to make sure you are not running into
memory leaks so you need to store that
subscription you're creating with the
SUBSCRIBE method in some property and
unsubscribe from that in the ng
ondestroy lifecycle hook and let me all
that there is one other way of
communicating and passing data around
and that is using ng rx which is
basically a Redux implementation for
angular apps you want to use angular
with a server-side language because
angular runs in the browser so a lot of
the logic you want to execute can't be
executed there because it needs to run
on a server for security reasons for
performance reasons or because you can't
perform that action browser like
accessing files or because you want to
store data in a server-side database now
I often get asked can I use angular with
PHP with lera well which is a PHP
framework with node with Ruby with
anything and the answer is yes you can
angular in the end creates the client
side app a single page application
running in the browser it doesn't care
about your server because it doesn't run
there so you can build your server side
back and with any language and framework
you want angular is only go to creating
SPS so it only creates that it only runs
that and your server-side back-end now
needs to be a restful api so not a
back-end where you render dues like with
layer welds plate templating engine
you're not doing that angular is
responsible for the front-end you're
back in as a restful service sitting
there providing API endpoints to which
angular can send requests through its
HTTP client
where it also of course receives
responses and on the server you can then
implement any logic including a database
if you want that you want you
communicate to angular through the
restful api another question I get a lot
is can I use read acts and I already
kind of answered this early in this
video yes you can with ng rx now react
solves one problem that we have a lot of
components communicating with each other
and which with services and we get a lot
of complex interactions that become hard
to maintain especially in bigger apps of
course Redux
solves this by offering us a redox store
so one central place in the app where
our data is stored and where we can
connect our different parts of the app
to so components can then receive data
from the store and dispatch actions to
the store and we have a clear flow of
data and a central place where
everything gets stored and that is Redux
and we can use it an angular since Redux
isn't tied to react you could implement
Redux just like that and angular or you
use a specific implementation of it
called ng rx now this is not a must as I
said you can implement the normal Redux
your on your own but you can also use ng
rx to get an approach that nicely fits
into the angular world and follows many
of the concepts angular already follows
so ng rx is something you want to Google
and you want to learn if you want to
implement Redux in your angular apps
speaking of state I also see the
question my state is lost after i
refresh the page and with that people
mean that unlike on traditional web apps
where you often have sessions to manage
the users state on the server and
therefore if the user refreshes the page
he's still locked in and so on and
client side app this is not the case if
you refresh your angular app it really
resets it doesn't keep the old state
because no server is involved you might
have that restful api you are sending
data to but that is a stateless server
it doesn't store anything and
session information from your client so
you have two ways of storing state
across page reloads then you can work
with local storage which is a
client-side storage of storage in the
browser or with a server-side database
you're still not going to be using
sessions then but you can't persist some
general user data there of course like
the orders of a user stuff like that for
a session like approaches you would have
a look at local storage though so local
storage runs on a client so it's not
fully under your control with that I
mean that if the user clears the cache
manually and installs the browser or
something like that this is of course
gone but the same is true for cookies I
guess since they're all living on a
client it's accessible by JavaScript
only so there's a good and a bad thing
bad thing is if your page is too
vulnerable to cross-site scripting
attacks by default angular should give
you a good protection against that
though if it is vulnerable then people
can access your local storage and
possibly extract JSON web tokens from
there on the other hand it's not
vulnerable to CSRF attacks for example
so that is the upside of that it's a
simple key value store that's all
important to keep in mind that means
that well you can't store complex data
in there you can't store images in there
really just simple data but for a
keeping track of a user session for
example of JSON web token and so on this
is perfect now the server-side database
is better for data that needs to be
under your control like the user itself
the user data you store stuff like that
it is accessible from the server only so
the client can't access it which of
course is a extra security layer and of
course you can use any database you want
and you can store whichever data and
data types you want therefore and this
is how you persist state or how you
store data there is no session you do
use these two things you can also use
cookies I should add but you don't use
sessions that's the key takeaway there
is no session stored on the
and no session keys stored in a cookie
on the client can I host my angular app
on Hiroko and so on that's another
question I see a lot let's understand
how hosting angular application works if
we use the CLI or any other build
process in the end once we're done we're
going to build our project which means
we generate a bunch of build artifacts
which is the index.html file and a lot
of JavaScript files typically the
bundled and optimized JavaScript files
that make up our app so these are the
build artifacts we might of course also
have some style files these need to be
shipped to a server and these are just
static files if you have a look at that
there's no server-side code there's no
PHP file the JavaScript files are not
going to contain any node.js code so
there's no need to execute code on a
server and therefore a static host like
AWS s free or firebase hosting is all
you need a static host is basically a
file storage that also can accept HTTP
requests and return your files but where
you don't run any server-side code so
can you host your app on hiroko yes you
can but since hiroko essentially
requires you to create app with some
server-side language you create a node
JSF just to serve the index.html file in
the end and the same might be true for
other languages so that might be
overkill Google for static web hosts
instead to find fitting hosts for
angular apps speaking of deployment
another question I see a lot is my
routes don't work after deployment so
here's the setup
we got the user you and the server you
enter a URL in the browser and your
angular app loads a page with your
angular app loads I should say you then
navigate to the products page there by
clicking on a link and that page loads
this is done through the angular router
because there you register the different
pages and since you only have one
real page the index.html file it's not
really loading a new file from the
server angular just rear Enders your
page to give you the illusion of loading
a new page and it can do that because it
essentially listens to the clicks on
your links when you use the router link
directive and well triggers the angular
router your server doesn't have any
routes if you refresh the page now you
get a 404 error because if you refresh
the page the angular router has no
chance of taking over because refreshing
means you send a new request to the
server and since you have no routes
there except for the default route which
returns the index.html file well you get
an error the solution is you need to
always load the index.html file so on
your server you need to define the
index.html file as your 404 error
document this then allows the router of
angular to take over and handle that
request and possibly find the route and
then render the correct page and if you
want to have a 404 error page for routes
you don't handle in the angular app ever
you would need to set it up in angular
still here's another question I get a
lot everyone can see my code it's true
everyone can see your code if you go
into the browser and open an angular app
and you go to that sources tab as I
showed you earlier in this video well
you can inspect the code and everyone
can do that you can do that for other
apps and other people can do it for your
app you can't protect against that
JavaScript runs in the browser it's not
compiled not precompiled so it's visible
to everyone and you can't do anything
about that the only thing you can do is
be aware of that and don't put sensible
information in there make sure you only
have code and the information in that
javascript file that doesn't really
matter if other people can read it you
can make it harder for people to read it
but you can't prevent it I also often
see the question how you can use
third-party CSS live
like bootstrap and angular apps and
there are two major approaches the first
one is simple you throw a link ref in
your index.html file ever pointing to a
local file you download it or to a file
hosted on some CDN the second possible
approach is to ever download the CSS
file the CSS library file you want to
use or use npm install' library to
install it and then add an entry to the
Styles array in the angular CLI dot JSON
file and that entry simply needs to be
the path seen from the source folder on
so not from the root folder but from the
source folder of your app on to that
file you downloaded or you installed
this is how simple you can add a CSS
library and the same for third-party
JavaScript libraries you have three
possibilities here you can put a script
source import in index.html and you can
also point to some CDN here you can use
NPM install or download the file and add
an entry to the scripts array or you do
the same but directly import it into
your typescript files by adding an
import statement at the top you can of
course import our typescript files and
you do that all the time in angular apps
well turns out you can also just import
our JavaScript files so that is a
perfectly fine alternative then you
don't have to add an entry to scripts to
the scripts array in the angular CLI
JSON file because if you just add an
import statement in one of your
typescript files in the end this import
javascript file will be included in the
final bundle so then you got it in your
application too one important note
though since you're using typescript and
angular there are JavaScript packages
that might be unknown to typescript
because they don't ship with a so called
types declaration file a file that
basically translates the JavaScript
functionalities to typescript if your
downloaded library doesn't have such a
file
you have to add something to the source
typing start DTS file you should find in
your angular projects or which you can
create if you don't have it and there
you add that declare module and then
your library name line here and
thereafter when importing it in our
JavaScript files types should understand
the features of that library you need to
add an import statement and though with
the scripts array approach this will not
work there you wouldn't stand need to
add declare war and then any object you
use from a library off type any at the
top of the types could file where you
want to use it let me show you an
example here's a very simple project I
created and now in there I will install
a new library with the npm install' and
I will install lodash which is a library
providing a couple of utility functions
to JavaScript I'll add - they're safe to
download and install it and also add an
entry in the package JSON file now once
this is finished let's go to node
modules and let's have a look at what we
got so here's low - and if we open it we
see a bunch of JavaScript files in there
because it's shipped in a way that we
can import just what we need and we
don't have to import all the files
one thing that's missing though or
should be missing at least is such a DTS
file so what can we now do how can we
use lo - for lo - and for a lot of
JavaScript libraries to be honest a good
approach would be the following one
let's say I want to use it here in the
constructor of our app component there I
will create a new array one two three
and I want to shuffle that and lo - has
a function for that so normally I can
use the lo - symbol the underscore and
call shuffle and pass my array and I
could output the result of that
operation now if I do that and I run ng
surf we already can see it here in the
file that this underscore isn't
recognized typescript doesn't know and
therefore during building it gives me an
error it shows me that it con can't find
that name now we can import lo - so we
can import lo - like this and this would
be the correct import statement but
still it would fail now what I said is
that you can now declare a var
underscore so the symbol you're going to
use and off type any so that you're
allowed to call anything in that types
could file and now the error is gone
because now we're telling typescript
it's okay I know that this symbol is
available and you don't need to care
about what I can do with it and now if
we go back to our running application
and I reload the page we see the
shuffled array so we're using lo - here
we're importing it like this and we add
a declare war and the alternative I
mentioned would be to go to the Taipings
TTS file and add declare module lo -
like this
that it should also work if I save this
and here in the app component Allah
removed the declare of our low - thing
and now I can import underscore from low
- so this is now an alternative and with
that it still works well here it now
gives us a shuffled result and this is
another way of doing this you're
basically using that import statement
where I say I'm importing a specific
symbol from that file so these are two
common approaches you use for using Java
Script packages or files libraries a lot
of libraries already ship with these DTS
files though and have es6 imports and
exports so there you just import
something from that library and you
don't need to declare the module you can
basically find it out by checking out
the github repositories of whichever
