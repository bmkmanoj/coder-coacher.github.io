creator of one of the most popular
Android n Java developer courses on
udemy so in this video I'm going to give
you a free preview of a lesson from my
android angel developer course on udemy
calm in this lesson I'll show you how to
set up Android studio and build your
very first Android application alright
so let's get to it so let's go back here
and click on our hello first look and
see how many things we can change
you know property panel here let's go
ahead and click view all properties so
we can have more properties than the
ones we were shown so one of the things
you can do there's a lot of things you
can do can scroll up and see many many
and see other properties let's say if we
want to change the color we can actually
search because as you can see there's a
lot of properties here we can search say
color for instance it tells you here
text color if we want to change that
click on here
and to the left here this resources
window opens up in to the left you have
draw a cow lure ID string and styles of
course one color you can click on that
and you can use that for instance the
moment you click on this then you have
this color accent palette that shows
here which means you can click anywhere
to change the color to pick the color
you want
okay and you notice also we have here
this hexadecimal hex code color number
that we can use so if we want to for
instance we already know what hex a hex
code color we want to use for our
application for the text we can just
copy and paste it here and you should
reflect ok let's say we want this here
if we say ok and you can see that the
color has changed let me zoom in a
little bit more there we go right you
can see the color has changed
we save this and give it a run we should
see there we go the color has changed to
a darker red I would say or pink all
right so there's a lot of things you can
do so click again and of course you can
see here we can change the text what it
says here a little world you can go
ahead and say just hello save that and
you should see it says hello okay so a
lot of things you can do but of course
you can do the same as I showed you from
the text view here let's keep on design
here like what if we wanted to change
the button then so we click on the
button of course we are under progress
if you are not seeing that remember you
can go down here and see view all
properties click on that and you will
have all of this okay see you have the
text we've sin can change the background
color as well so if you go like here
color and so you want to give this
background color say okay and look at
that now we have this bluish background
color if you want to go back and change
click on that we can give it a gray
color like that right so there's a lot
of things you can do it you can click
here to to directly go to the color okay
and there we go about this color here a
very bright orange there it is there's a
lot of things we can do with our
properties here that we have and we'll
dive into this more as we progress in
our studies here I just wanted to show
you things that he can do with our
property here and next thing I'd like to
show you is how to use the text editor
here to change things
and notice how amazing this is we
changed certain colors and right away in
our text view here we see to the left we
actually have the scholar see what it
says text color here we've changed it to
color accent which is the darker pink
okay and you see here my button we
change to this
orange color here as well the beauty of
having this option of using the text or
the XML the the pure XML code to change
thing is that we have more power to
customise our user interface not to say
that we can't do here but there will be
times when we just want to write some
code in here okay let's understand a
little bit more of what this XML file
how is it constructed so at the top here
would have XML it would have version and
encoding so this is something that comes
obviously with XML in this format okay
we don't have to to think too much of it
okay because this is all generated for
us okay but then we have this Android
support constraint constraint layout so
this is the opening parent tag so this
means that whatever if you close this
look you don't see anything that means
this is the parent tag okay so
everything textview and buttons and
image view everything is inside of our
parent tag here so this parent tag here
with all these properties these are
properties you say layout width layout
hide correspond to these screen here in
which we have all these widgets that we
put okay so let's say if we want to
change the color so just type color
change the background color say
background and you can go ahead and
let's change to color accent like that
so it's gonna be the same color as this
textview
save this in fact we don't even have to
save we'll look at here look at that so
our all the whole background of our
application now is as the same color as
the text layer of obviously you can't
see it so now we have to change this
here to something else let's change this
and we'll dive more into this at a later
time and say this at color let's say
primary primary dark
save this if you go here you should see
our hello is now a different color now
showing you the power that you are also
given here because you are able to
change things
writing code as opposed to having to go
to design and having to do that of
course it's easier to do in design mode
but it's always nice to know that we
have other options out of things that we
can do in code here using the textview
here
okay the text tab perfect so I'll see
