creator of nodejs for beginners
of course I'd udemy.com where I show you
how to create a content management
system very similar to WordPress here
are the links below you can find it at
you to me that come and you can also
find it on my blog slash you to me and
that would take you to my profile so in
this most serious what I want to do is I
want to show you a little taste of what
we have in the course I'm gonna show you
what no J is this I'm gonna show you how
to download and install it and even play
around with it
so if you guys are really excited I am
too let's go ahead and learn so nodejs
from scratch and let's have some fun so
before we start with nodejs installing
and doing a whole bunch of other cool
things it's better that we understand
exactly what it is okay now you can go
through to their website here and ojs
that org and read and you know and once
you read you're gonna see that it is a
run time that you use javascript on and
this run time does a lot of other things
so it says here no js' is a JavaScript
runtime build in google's chrome v8
JavaScript engine
it uses an event-driven non-blocking i/o
model that makes lightweight and
phishing nodejs package echo system ever
ever ever got that's a lot of
mumbo-jumbo so i'm gonna give you my
explanation here no js' okay is a
program that allows us to use javascript
in the server now javascript originally
cannot do a lot of things like for
example javascript originally cannot
handle files cannot do anything in your
computer that has to do with files it
cannot communicate with databases it
cannot do a server-side stuff and this
is why no js' is allowing javascript to
do but a lot more than that okay now how
is it doing this well is is using this
program right here to do a lot of its
magic this program the v8 JavaScript
engine is a program that the browser
user
okay that Google Chrome uses for their
browser if you go here behind the scenes
well not behind the scenes because it is
outside you can see that the VA is built
using C++ C++ is very powerful is a very
powerful software language and it allows
us to do a lot of different things so
Naja yes found a way or the creator of
no Jay has found a way to use C++ right
to give JavaScript the ability to do a
lot of cool things okay so this is just
a program nodejs
is just a program that or an environment
right a runtime environment where you
type in your JavaScript or you execute
JavaScript then no Jake grabs that
JavaScript uses C++ to translate it into
doing like you know let's say
communicating with files or
communicating with databases okay so you
write a JavaScript then it goes behind
the scenes and use the C++ to do things
that's it no more overthinking it but
another cool thing about nodejs
is that it makes things a lot faster and
they're our last util write javascript
in the backend like a server and in the
front end so for those of you that like
JavaScript developers this is a dream
technology you should be learning this
so now that I'm done with my explanation
let's continue with the course and on
the next lectures what I want to do is I
want to download and installed nodejs on
a Mac and a Windows system so and I'm
going to create separate lectures for
that so I hope you guys are ready so
let's do this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
