ahead and show you how you can anonymize
yourselves by using the Tor network and
in all likelihood I will also show you
how to actually set up the tor nodes
yourselves so that you know what the
person on the other side can actually
see but it's not quite as simple with
the Tor as it is with proxies first of
all because you are never going through
a single hop in the Tor network like you
are doing so with a proxy well but aprox
you can choose whether you wished a
single hop or whether you wish multiple
hops to occur or whatever but if you are
attempting to basically access at the to
access the internet through tor some
website I don't know it's a YouTube you
will go to an entry node to entry guard
then you will go through the middle
somewhere and then you will go through
the exit node so at bare minimum you
will always go through three nodes which
each each node will be able to only
decrypt a portion of the of the traffic
with the exit node decrypting the last
portion and actually going somewhere so
in the Tor network the entry point
actually sees who is using it and the
exit point sees where the traffic is
going but you at the end the exit node
cannot know does not know who is making
the request and the entry node does not
know what the content of the request
actually is it just knows who is making
it anyway
let's go ahead and set this up so what
I'm going to show you now is how to use
a tor browser and not how to use a tor
as a service towards the service I do
believe that in all likelihood I'll show
that in some later on so I just type
oops just type in DNF install tor
browser is it spelled that way no how
about this
no okay no big deal DNF search tour grab
that roy browser and it's to a browser
launcher okay let's just go ahead and
copy that
the enough install and it's already
installed so there is nothing to do now
keynote here do not I mean do not run
the tor browser as route in fact you
shouldn't run any browser as route
that's universally that's universally a
stupid thing to do and you really
shouldn't run it as route I mean you can
run it for some testing purposes or
whatever but generally as in 99% of the
time that is an extremely bad idea I've
actually seen on the net a lot of
tutorials with Kali Linux and a lot of
people seem to be running tour as route
and are showing other people to run
instructing other people to run to tour
in any other browser as route not
actually explaining the consequences of
doing so if your browser by any chance
it gets exploited by anything that
certain exploit will have root
privileges on your system which will be
hillarious
so yeah just kind of don't do it and
down below it's a normal user so tor
browser like this no tor browser
launcher you're killing me here
okay so LS been grep - right tor it's to
our browsers launcher
I miss spelling this tor browser
launcher there we go so it by the way if
one of your executives programs like
this don't work take a look in the bin
take a look in the bin directory like I
did I listed everything in the bin
directory and then I grep the one that
big that contained the word toward ok
let's go ahead and launch the tor
browser says here connecting to the tor
network and it's establishing the series
of nodes and it opens up and pops like
this if you use full screen it's gonna
give you a warning that the device is
might actually that these sites could
actually determine the monitor size
which in turn can be used to track you
etcetera but that's not that big of a
deal just saying you have no script here
enabled so that's gonna block some of
the JavaScript depending on how it is
configured now what can you do with the
tor browser well let me go ahead and
show you I'm gonna go ahead and display
in parallel well for one thing you can
browse the dot Onion domains which you
cannot actually access from the regular
net no way you can do that so let me go
ahead and type in here what is my IP and
let me go ahead and type in down below
what is my IP ok no no I don't want to
open up a site doesn't really matter so
here it says like some IP that belongs
to me and the other one is
god-knows-where so I wonder what
anonymous proxy where would they were
where did I actually exit which exit
node did I use it would seem that
have the sight seems to be broken okay
warning to you a lot of sites some of
the sites won't actually work properly
with with with the tor browser so keep
that in mind okay so I got a I got a
disabled a lot of things in order to be
able to load this but a lot a lot of
things just a few things I guess but ah
come on I almost had it
okay there we go so your IP address is
something here and the hostname is
apparently this so that's the hostname
of the door exit node I guess
organization is that browsers recognized
ah there we go
so I'm exiting somewhere in Garden City
in United States in the state of New
York I can assure you that at the moment
I am nothing and there I'm very far from
at em across the Atlantic in Europe so
my IP address has completely changed
which is convenient and by the way
during the time that you were browsing
the net this IP address can actually
change oh my god it just has anyway the
IP address can change it can go back and
forth you could have one and then you
can have another and then you can go
back to that one and it is very likely
that it will actually change because
there are multiple exit nodes and you
will be using multiple exit nodes
because well you won't be using them
simultaneously but you will be jumping
from one to the other and depending on
the load there are load balancers in
place so depending on the load and the
nodes you will be going back and forth
between the nodes so yeah our IP address
will be in a constant state of flux
which it tributes a great deal to your
anonymity
now before I used to show people the
basically you just press control B to
get the bookmarks but I vac
really it actually comes bookmarked here
okay so the hidden wiki website URL it's
something like this blah blah blah blah
onion these domains they will have
random strings and they're completely
random strikes and it says dot onion I
wonder what would actually happen if I
was to generate a tumblr of these random
strings and just try to open each and
every one of them just see and explore
it and actually that would be a that
would be a good project maybe I will do
it that doesn't matter the hidden wiki
you have a certain set of websites which
are published here which are on hidden
net and you have all sorts of things I
would advise you never to buy anything
here never to post any sort of personal
information on any of these sites just
just a friendly advice and but you care
what I would I what I like the most
about the about hidden wiki are the
links to certain forums and you get some
really nice forums here that you can get
a lot of answers from technical
technical things that some of them which
are not published Internet or on the
regular network some of the answers
which we won't actually get on the
regular net because people won't tell
you etc you also have a lot of bad
things like the drug market and stuff
like that but that's completely
irrelevant and besides the point
anyway I advise you never to actually
run your credit card you definitely
actually definitely don't use your
credit card here for God's sakes that's
such a bad idea
and don't I would advise you not to
actually register any sort of personal
information but I generally use tor to
actually I mean to when you want to be
hidden or when you want to bypass
certain regulations of the country you
would be able to use it and then go out
on
net but also visit the hidden the the
dot onion domains which you cannot
access on a regular basis but it all
comes down to trust whether you trust
the people running the tor nodes anyway
I'm gonna go ahead and bid you farewell
here and hope to see you in the
follow-up or the next tutorial whatever
that might be welcome back everybody so
today I'm gonna go ahead and show you
how you can set up your own tor relay
now why should you do why should you do
this well aside from the fact that it's
not a bad idea that we all chip into the
trip into the Tor network and expand it
because the bigger it is the safer it is
how you should know how to do this and
you should be aware through this of
potential dangers so what are the
dangers
Thor will protect your information in
terms of encryption it will protect your
information in terms of that no single
node will be able to decrypt everything
but multiple nodes can decrypt
everything all the nodes in one circuit
if you have all the keys you can decrypt
the traffic like no problems now suppose
somebody because your when you're using
tor you will use at bare minimum three
relays so if you use the first one that
would be the entry the guard relay and
then you will use the middle node and
then you will use the exit node so a
bare minimum bare minimum at all times
you will be using three of them now
suppose that somebody that one person
owns all three they will be able to
decrypt or everything that you do
basically they would know who you are
they would know your IP address and they
would know which sites where it is that
you are going so tor does not protect
against these sort of passive attacks
and anyone can set up a tour really any
one as long as you have internet
connection and running PC you can set up
a tour really I mean the amount of
resources that I have on the cloud is
hilarious it's like one CPU and 512
megabytes of RAM and it
still runs like a charm so now you now I
wish to tell you something and if you
it's because I don't want to trick you
into anything or just give you false
information that I'm going to show you
some incredible things here I am just
gonna go ahead and show you how to set
up a tour note I will not show you how
to decrypt the information or how to set
up all three of them and then wait for
somebody to get caught in the circuit
where you can decrypt their all of their
traffic why will I not do this why won't
I show you because it can't be done
because it's purely theoretical no it
has been done people have been doing it
and I suspect that people are doing it
even now the reason why I won't show it
to you is due to the lifecycle of a new
relay so if you go under the assumption
that a new relay is reliable and then it
has a good amount of bandwidth it will
go through four phases so the first
phase will go from day 0 to day 3 where
it will be word will get almost no usage
and then you will get the remote
measurement phase which goes from day 3
- day 8 where the load will gradually
start to increase and then you will get
the guard phase which is they ate day 68
where load will be fluctuating and the
steady state guard phase as it is called
of their website it goes from 68 plus
days onwards now for me to create a
demonstration for you on how you can
decrypt the tor traffic from all three
relays I would need to wait for 68 days
plus and maybe not even then maybe even
more for me to actually have a guard and
a middle and an exit relay because you
can only advertise yourself as a as a
certain relay but it is the authorities
which actually will assign you a role so
but you do have a choice whether you
want to be an exit or a middle relay but
if you're in the middle
if you have good bandwidth if you are if
you are stable etc they can assign a
guard flag to you so you would you so
your node would be used as an entry
point as well the entry point knows the
IP address of the person you of the
person using the Tor the middle node
knows the IP address of the entry point
and the exit node knows the destination
so no single node has all the
information but if you have all the
nodes that you can have all the
information the reason that I can't
actually demonstrate it to you it's
because it's gonna take me like at least
a hundred days not even sixty eight but
at least a hundred days for it all to
start working not due to any technical
reasons but just due to the lifecycle of
a new relay which has been predefined by
tor and I pressed wouldn't decrypt
anybody else's traffic aside from my own
anyway let me go ahead and show you how
you can set up a tour relay you already
know how to use Wireshark you already
know how to set up a server and how to
set up a Wireshark for remote capture so
if you know that you can wait for C it
is possible for you to wait for 68 days
and then get it all going keep in mind
that you need to follow and respect the
policies of your cloud providers so I
got a come to a website from the Tor
project that's right here and this is
the this is the address so HTTP colon
slash slash
TR AC dot or project org slash project
slash door slash wiki / dark slash good
bad ISPs and down below you have an
entire range of ISPs and their policies
with regard tor nodes from based upon
based upon country so country ISP and
you got you can list through this site
and find the ISP providers which will
which will be willing to host your tor
nodes for a very low price and where you
most likely won't be held accountable
for literally everything I on the other
hand I'm hosting it on digital ocean
where anything that happens from this IP
I am the
who is responsible basically the hammer
comes the hound on me so yeah anyway let
me go ahead and show you how to host a
tor node it's very simple
they've made the process hilariously
simple so let me just go ahead and do AB
- get install VI m hopefully it's
already installed because this is a new
droplet sorry about that and I'm going
to go ahead and type in me I am slash
Etsy sources.list person cert go down to
the bottom and further on down to the
bottom and I'm gonna go ahead and now
add the repositories let me just see if
they are in my in my notes so look I am
hosting a Debian server because I
usually tend to use a Debian before you
add the repos you should be a before you
add the repos I mean it should be aware
of this because I'm using Debian I can
type in LSB underscore release - a and
this is gonna give me a listing of my
system so I'm using a Debian gnu/linux
8.5 Jesse Jesse is the unstable version
so if you are using a Jesse or any other
I would strongly advise you to go to
this website again on the Tor project so
it's double double double your project
org slash Docs slash Debian dot HTML en
for English but look it's a very simple
site so okay yeah app - get install tour
we're gonna get to that but you need to
add the repositories here and you select
your you select your distribution here
so Debian staple Jesse and what would
you like to do tour from source or tour
just select
tour version yes I would like to have
the stable version I'm not gonna go for
the experimental this version actually
applies to the tour not to the operating
system and then it's gonna tell you
actually what you need to do and in
order for you to actually conduct the
installation and updates so basically
just need to add these following entries
and GPG keys and you can basically just
install it from the from the from the
from those wrappers without any problems
of whatsoever so I am gonna go ahead and
copy paste these repositories and a few
other commands here so just as before
I'm just gonna go into the sources list
and go down to the bottom I'm just gonna
go ahead and add these two but this is
how you would be able to determine which
refuge you require for which destroy
because not all repositories are the
same for all the distributions let's go
ahead and write quit now I'm just gonna
go ahead and copy paste the GPG okay
thank you very much okay another command
g/kg export that's all fine and dandy
and done and I'll just type in AB - get
update let that finish through excellent
now we're just gonna do app - get
install tor
I'm connect to lazy to type this in and
this one as well so let this go
packaging processing processing triggers
okay it's done all it's done fine and
dandy and we don't actually need to do
anything else there so when the store is
installed it's most likely going to
start immediately so let's go ahead and
type in
servus store status and it's running so
let's go ahead and stop it so stop let's
make sure that it's not actually running
while we are
while we are messing around with it
let's type in VI m / let's see door do
or RC and if you don't know if you're
using some other operating system on the
clock in the cloud somewhere something
like that if you're not using Debian you
can just type in update DB update DB is
universal for Linux distributions if I'm
not mistaken and then type in locate -
itor RC and there we go so we will find
the torque config file there's just type
in VI am / @c Torchio r RC press ENTER
and I'm just gonna go ahead and there
are entries which we can uncomment here
and take a look at them if you wish but
I'm just going to skip all of that
because they're commented out anyway and
I'm going to go ahead and insert a
following set of commands so it's going
to be a R 4 9 0 0 1 so this is going to
be our portage we're going to be using a
address so this is your public IP
address let me just go ahead and let me
just go ahead and login to the server
via another SSH connection oh is this
the IP no oh god which one is it this
one and you might notice that I'm
logging in as root I've shown you how
not to log in as root so hopefully you
know oh this is the wrong one god 59 dot
1 5 5.1 3 4 okay there we go
I have config it doesn't matter for me
if I'm logging in as route because this
is just for a couple of hours anyway so
this is the IP address from the you type
in I've configured and you find your
interface and then you find the IP
address I could have just read it from
here but I want to how to get it so you
type in the address there then you type
in nick name
my nickname is gonna be hey there
nicknames are arbitrary so you can type
in pretty much whatever you would like I
don't think that there are any specific
restrictions and then you have the relay
limit really bandwidth rate which is
basically the limit and bursts okay so
now we need to go ahead and configure
these two you can configure them to any
number that you want but of course you
cannot exceed what you don't have so if
you have for example 120 megabits of
bandwidth you can assign a certain
amount of those you can assign 20
megabits or whatever it doesn't matter
I'm just gonna go ahead and say 100 Kb
so you can assign something else it
doesn't matter for burst I'm gonna go
ahead and type in KB so it will allow
bursts up to basically 200 kilobytes a
second which translates into some 1600
kilobits per second and we're good not
gonna configure this one as an exit so
exit policy actually I really don't want
to miss type this because this could be
a really bad idea to misspell this I
mean just go ahead and do this so exit
policy is reject bandwidth settings you
can just configure here in accordance
which we need so you can just change
these door nodes are not picked at
random they're picked by the greatest
ability and the most bandwidth that is
available so keep that in mind
because if you are creating a net within
the tour to basically D anonymize a
certain set of users the more nodes you
have the bigger the net and the greater
your ability is to actually capture more
users the greater the chance although
I'm not actually telling you to do this
or encouraging you to do this this is
universally stupid I personally wouldn't
do this I'm just trying to educate you
on the possible dangers of the tour and
what the tour protects you from and what
and what it does not protect you from
okay anyway now that that is done we can
service start tour oh oh right service
store start I'm just used to using
systems CTL and now we're gonna need to
type in app - get install ufw if you
don't have it installed already I mean
and it's going to be ufw allow nine zero
zero one ufw allow SSH don't forget to
allow SSH if you forget about it you
will be done for and then type in you fw
enable yes firewall is active and
enabled on system startup so that's nice
and type in tail did I start to work no
did I
it's the tour up Oh
service state a store god I'm so used to
using systemctl tour status okay it's
running and let's go ahead and type in
tail - f for log door this is to confirm
that it's actually working
okay so ninety okay door has
successfully opened a circuit looks like
client functionality is working self
testing indicates your
or our port is reachable from outside
excellent publishing server descriptor
performing bandwidth self-test done
fantastic this is what we were looking
for and our node is from this point
onwards functional by type in and map
one 39.5 will the port register as open
via nmap but one three four let's go
ahead and do a checkup
I'm running a little bit short in terms
of time yeah there we go
it does say nine zero zero one TCP state
open door Oh our fort later on I will in
one more short tutorial I will show you
how can you actually verify that you
have incoming connections and that
somebody is actually using it if you're
running a middle node if as long as
you're not running an exit node it
doesn't matter
you're not visible to the outside world
almost at all the Tor network here
within the Tor network and you can post
the Tor middle-middle relays pretty much
anywhere the exit ones are the problem
anyway bid you farewell and hope to see
you in the follow up okay so let's just
do a quick roundup I just need to do app
- yeah install the shark I do believe
that I have described this procedure in
detail it's already installed here and
then we're gonna go ahead and run T
shark - I and Y interfaces eth0 yours
might be something different just type
in I have config to see which one is it
and then we're gonna insert our custom
filters so we don't want to be looking
on TCP port 22 we don't really care so
just go ahead and press Enter because
for 28 to TCP that's basically us our
SSH connection and that's not something
that we really care about so this is my
IP address of the server and this is
like something I don't know okay so
let's let's go ahead and have fun let's
see what is out there for us so who is
this happy
and if it's a tor relay or Thor Thor
with you or something like that
half a hash double - okay so this is God
knows what that's fine let's see
121 probably something from tor I
actually have no idea who is person
octave a pleb ah Wow
I have technical contact ovh I don't
know I guess this is in that range okay
didn't really get much from there I have
no idea what that is I could find out
through an extensive investigation but I
really won't am looking for something
completely different uh this one this
one no this is not gonna happen so let's
let's I'm just looking for Thor
authority because that's the one that I
would I like to get acquainted with to
show you that we are actually being
probed should have probably set the port
but not this one because there are some
connections here which have nothing to
do with us that somebody foreign is
simply probing us and all these servers
are being probed continuously it's
hilarious
just how many scans they get per a day
oh god where is it one of them it has to
be like one of them how do I feel lucky
that's what I should be asking myself
4639 okay what is this have I check this
one before
yep this is problem loading the page
okay let's see about this one this looks
like it might be it how it looks like
why it looks like it might be I don't
know because I've seen a lot of these
addresses before ah there we go
it is so one 93.1 III two four four two
four four this is Tour Authority so we
are actually being probed and we are
communicating with the Tor network now I
could run this through the I could pull
the information from the server and push
it into my Wireshark GUI interface here
on the client machine and get it more
detailed output with all the data etc
but there really is no point it's
encrypted anyway so nothing I can really
extract from it but hey we are
communicating with the Tor network the
packets are coming through we are
getting the traffic you can inspect your
traffic a little bit better if you just
run this through a GUI and that applies
some filters on the client machine etc
but I just wanted to prove that we are
actual that we do have a running and a
fully functional tor node now for the
for the exit node if you want to do that
I'm not going to do that now but just
need to basically I mean you don't need
to do much really you can insert an
entire series of custom predefined rules
which port you allow which ports you do
not allow but the general thing which
you can do and do a wild card it's
basically just instead of reject eyepin
accept meaning that anything goes
anything flies this is the universally
opened exit node but
all jokes aside I'm gonna reject so I'm
not gonna actually allow this to be an
exit note but that's what we really need
to do just change that exit policy to
accept and reset the tour and that's it
okay so I'm gonna put you farewell here
as somebody's at the door but we are
done anyway this is how you set it or
note up have fun
