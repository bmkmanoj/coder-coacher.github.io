easy to build a healing based Internet
of Things application is the helium
element and the helium atom I'll start
with the element the human element is
this white box that works as a rail town
it comes in two different versions that
one that I have here allows me to
connect the helium into my wired
Ethernet network which is great if your
application is say based on a factory or
a home which if we do have access to a
wired Ethernet network but if the
application doesn't have access to the
net networking then you can get the
version of the element with cellular
networking so then you can build to say
applications that are based out in the
fields agricultural applications or
mobile applications and things of that
sort I don't know exactly what the range
of each element is and how far the
signal can reach but looking at the the
combination that helium provides one
element is sufficient for a small office
building if you have something larger
like perhaps are a large factory floor
then two of them should be able to cover
that distance within that enclosed area
and if you go out in the open of course
the range increases dramatically so
these devices come with two antennas so
they communicate in two different
frequencies they've got the 2.4
gigahertz and the 915 megahertz there's
a second antenna or 868 mega Hertz
depending on whether you are in the US
or Europe or other parts of the world so
depending we buy the device from you'll
get the antennas to match the location
now my version of the element as I said
has got the Internet connectivity option
so all you've got to do in order to get
it plugged in is to take your and then
in cable the chips in the books plug it
into the other net port and the other
and safer compare these around
the other end would go to an available
port on your router or switch I just
plugged it right here why'd you do that
just plug in power and the device will
begin to communicate with your network
and will try to contact hello I'm going
to show you in the next lecture how to
connect and have the configure you'll
dashboard your helium - points of that
you can actually see this device in your
dashboard right now it's just going to
try and connect the Internet and
virtually that led will turn and
indicate that it's connected there you
go green light all good so I can put
this aside now and have a look at the
other so the atom that I've got here
comes connected to a shield adapter that
fits on the other unit owner like that
if you are targeting raspberry PI's and
you still have the Adam device in the
middle but you can also purchase an
appropriate hat adapter that will fit
onto your oz berry pie so then you can
use it with your ass berry pie and
there's also provision for embed devices
but in this demonstration of course
we'll be working with the Arduino in
terms of communication between the Adam
device and the other you know this is
done in a serial way using the serial
interface on the adapter you've got a
bunch of headers here and depending on
which headers you just use a jumper wire
on you can select which serial port on
your idea you know you can use or you
want to use
my examples I have configured the atom
to communicate with me at my Arduino
using software serial and you can see
here just zoom in actually like that I
can give you a better look so you can
see here that the transmit pin is
connected to the other node digital pin
7 and that the received pin on the atom
is connected to the other unit digital
pin number 8 so is my other you know
digital pins 7 and 8 will be used as
software serial by my atoms at that
there they know in the other communicate
using software serial and all of the
other pins on the Arduino are available
so that you can use that to connect
sensors actuators all other devices as
you see fit as plenty of pins left to
use so you've got to do is to connect
the plug a shield onto your I don't know
oops hang on fix the Arduino hit up
there that got out of alignment
alright try again
and there you go already next thing is
to just plug it in the blue and the red
LEDs of the album indicate
communications so communications between
the Adam device and the element they
will try to connect they're not really
configured yet so this Adam module
doesn't really know that it needs to
talk to the element module first this is
something that I need to configure in
the helium dashboard which I'll show you
how to do that in the next lecture but
you can see now that the the atom so the
red LED is blinking the atom is trying
to communicate with the helium Network
so and that's just happened by me
providing power that's all in the next
few lectures what I'll do first is to
show you how to configure your element
and your atom using the dashboard the
helium dashboard then I'm going to run a
couple of example sketches that come
with the library that supports do you
know helium applications and then I'm
going to walk you through a little
environmental IOT application that I
built it just uses a couple of sensors
dht22
bmp180 and an LED and although you can
breadboard this hardware in my case I
decided to put it on a prototyping
shield just to keep things a little tidy
and also because I wanted to leave this
application running for a few days just
to become really comfortable with it and
its reliability
before these lectures actually I had
this application with a shield on top of
the atom for about a week and things are
running really really smoothly so let's
move on to the next lecture where I'll
take you to the helium website and show
you a few really quick things about the
hardware and then get into the dashboard
and
figure the element and Alton thanks for
watching if you'd like to learn more
check out my adrenal step-by-step
getting started and Audrina step-by-step
getting serious courses on udemy they
are I help you develop basic and more
advanced adrenal skills including how to
write your own programs how to use all
sorts of sensors and actuators and how
to create your own gadgets it may also
be interested in my project courses
where you get deep into the development
of wheeled robots remote-control cars
and drones please use the coupon code in
the description below this video to get
a YouTube exclusive discount to my
courses see you there okay take a minute
to graphically explain what the helium
Network looks like and what is the
infrastructure that helium gives you
know to build your Internet of Things
applications and hopefully develop an
understanding of what happens when a
helium atom connects to an element and
then the element connects to the rest of
the internet and then to your
application so let's begin with the
access point this is the helium element
just put it right in the middle so
helium element then wirelessly your
element connects with a bunch of atoms
so let's use red for them
and each one of those circles represents
about them and you can have a lot of
them so each one is a helium atom each
atom wirelessly communicates two ways
and explain what it means with the
element that's all he does choices
within range and an album will be able
to communicate with the element
once the element gets various Donna says
a sensor that are sent by the atom then
it will relay it on to hit him and
network I use black for that so here's a
little cloud and this is the helium
Network and the hidden network is where
that that eventually will aggregate for
from as many elements as you may have
remember that if you are running a large
IOT application then you could
potentially have more than one elements
just put one more here for example
here's another element and this element
will have its own helium's
atoms helium atoms communicating with it
and that also sent its data
the same helium Network somehow this
could be a nether net connection or it
could be a cellular connection it
doesn't really matter
now once the data gets into the helium
Network then through the helium
dashboard you can choose what it did
with it so for example you may decide to
forward the data to an MK TP transport
application which is a very popular way
to do such thing in Internet of Things
application but this is a topic that I'm
not going to cover in this set of
lectures at all and I think that you can
do yes you can send your data to your
own app as you say to your M here this
is actually what I'm going to show you
in my case I've got a very simple web
app built using Rudy
very simple to use the programming
language and that application is running
on a host called Heroku and he simply
logs the data that my helium atom says
my element or another thing that you can
do is you can for what your data to
other Internet of Things systems or
products that are running on the
internet so for example you can choose
to forward your data to a services such
as you eat your IO and then from there
you can create your own dashboards some
lots of options that the thing that
helium network does for you is to make
this part of the infrastructure almost
plug-and-play for you so that then you
only have to worry about building the
custom components a custom part of the
application that make your application
unique and special actually executes the
functions that you want to execute you
can avoid having to worry about all the
transport issues the other thing that I
want to mention before we move on here
is the second direction of your data
from your network to the helium element
and then to your atoms suppose we all
understand the left are from right to
left direction of data you've got
sensors on your atoms so let's say at
the edge distance R here
it's matara for readings from the sensor
and then it will forward it towards the
left ventually it ends up into your
application for further processing but
left to right is what we call a mass
with a configuration or configuration
over the air type of operation which
allows you to make a small change of
particular variables inside your helium
Network and then that change can be
pushed towards the atoms and then
reconfigure your application as it is in
the field without you having to get your
your gadgets are distributed in the
field into your lab for reprogramming so
what could this configuration be for
example in the example that I'm going to
show you
I've got my helium atom connected to a
couple of sensors and I want to get it
to send readings from the sensors to my
Ruby web application every say 10
seconds during testing but at some point
I may want to change that at negative 5
minutes
so with this capability to push
configuration changes to the albums from
the Hinnom network what I can do is to
make the change here on my helium
dashboard and that will automatically
get pushed to my atom the local variable
that controls how often my Arduino
should report its sensor data to the
helium network will be updated
automatically as part of this process
and that is just a super easy way to
change the configuration of my history
of my iot distributed appliances over
the air without them having to be
recalled into a lab and reprogrammed
manually and that's one of the core
features of a really good IOT Internet
of Things application let's go ahead and
configure our element and atom devices
so that they are recognized by my
account on the helium dashboard what of
course at the moment is the element
plugged into my router via the ethernet
cable and also I have the atom which is
just powered via the Adina so the atom
shield is plugged into Maya do you know
and then I've just applied power to do
Deena so you can see that there is
activity the radically D is linking and
that means that the atom is trying to
find a an element nearby we're going to
move on to the helium website so you can
go to helium calm and you can have a
look around here a couple of quick
things that you can look at is the
information provided about the atom
module and a element access
you can see some more information about
these devices but the interesting of
course is in the dashboard itself so you
can go create a free account for the
dashboard and that's what mine looks
like
so I've got my atom and elements
reporting data for the last few days it
shows you this location by the way is
not correct so the geolocation is not
correct but it's closer still in Sidney
I've got my atom configured here and
I've got the element also configured we
go there's my element I'm training to
those menus in a minute let's go to the
channels and I've got a few channels
here configured as I was playing around
with them of course an MQTT I've got a
couple of Heroku web apps because I was
trying a couple of different ways of
sending data Jason and the CSV and I'll
be showing you the CSV option and
explain why I decided to use CSV instead
of Jason for formatting my data
transmissions I was also playing around
with tweet tweet dot IO a really nice
IOT online service that I should
probably create a different lecture
about it's quite a few things to explore
there and I'm also going to show you how
to use request bin to send your data
they are if you don't want to get into
the trouble of using my Hiroko web app
although I'll be giving you the code so
you can configure it in any way that you
like it's all free stuff so let's go to
the atom and drill in just so that you
can get a sense of what is happening so
you can see that the dashboard gives you
a view of the packets that are arriving
from the atom in real time because
nothing is arriving at the moment
because I haven't configured it yet but
earlier that I was playing around I was
able to send a little bit of text to the
dashboard from the atoms and the
debugger here the debug log will show
you that string of text that as it as it
arrives and there's just a bunch of
numbers of court the temperature the
first set got the humidity and this is
the altitude and I've also got the
device ID here coming through - and
these are the configuration variables
that I was telling you about earlier in
the previous lecture so I can configure
variables called keys here with a
specific value and if I decide to change
that value to something else and update
they can think then this change will be
pushed to the atom and to the other you
know so that I can make a change to the
local configuration online application
every time that I do such a thing then
the optimal report back the latest value
that it has received from the helium
network just to confirm that a change
was actually made so the last change
that actually did make was the location
I changed the idea of the location from
two to one
updated they can think that change was
pushed to the autumn and then the atom
sent back the location value that it
last received again that is to make sure
that the atom has the latest
configuration and an event look things
that so in this case the event look
indicates the fact that he sent to a
HTTP request was done by and then I've
got the event log here also for
debugging a view of the data use very
nimble
kind of applications here I'm just
sending three numbers really in a string
of text that contains it is 21
characters or not so it's a very
lightweight application
it can drill into my elements list and
you can see here what's happening with
the element again you get the packets so
these are the package that I received
from all of the atoms that happen to be
connected to the environment not just
the second element just not just a
single element and the location again
kind of incorrect but still the same
city
you can Outlook you can connect a atom
device to a element device remember that
you can have a list of multiple atoms
here connected to a single element and
an event look and finally with the
channels let's drill into my active
Channel Erica with AB C's ray and you
can see a similar kind of interface here
nice thing is that depending on the
channel that you choose the dashboard
also gives you sample code that you can
just copy and paste and the code that
I'll be showing you pretty much is based
on what a copied out of the example code
for my specific channel the other thing
that really changes in here is the name
of the channel for some way yeah you can
somewhere here right here actually is
the name of the channel to which we want
to get our element to connect to and
send data to and the event look so if
you're starting from scratch totally
from scratch then what you want to do is
the first add an atom to your dashboard
and then an element so let's go for the
atom first you can give you atom
whatever name you like so I can say
example button then it's asking for the
last four digits of the MAC address of
the atom that you want to connect and
the HDD identifier
so to get that you need a really strong
vision or good classes or perhaps a
magnifying glass because the last four
digits of the MAC address are right here
in tiny script so you need to get this
the last four digits of the MAC address
copied into the black field now for the
edge V then you can see there's a
barcode here right on the module HVB
below it and these are the four
characters that you need to copy over to
the hvv fields so I won't do it now
because there's going to be a conflict
between my device and the new device
that I'm demonstrating how to connect
once you have those bits of information
copied into the two fields you can click
on activate at them and then your atom
will be activated okay so that's how you
connect an atom let's move on to the
element so click on element and you can
see the same kind of interface here can
give your element a new name example
element and then on the element at the
back you can find the MAC address right
there there's a MAC address again tiny
script you need to get the last four
numbers or digits the last four
characters and copy them over to the Mac
field and the HPV is also under the bar
code there's HPV and there are four
characters here as well just be very
careful because the script is so tiny I
made mistakes in copying them over so
that program that obviously caused for
the connection to fail if you are having
failed attempt to connect your element
or your atom to your dashboard just
double check that you've got the right
characters of these labels on the
devices so once you have
the right characters copied into the two
fields click on activate element and the
element will activate the last thing
then is to create a channel in order for
the data to move let's go back to my
drawing now you need to create a channel
because what you have achieved so far is
to connect the atoms and the element to
your helium network if you don't do
anything else then that data will just
stay in the helium network and you won't
be able to do anything with them if you
want to get your data out of the network
and into some other application like
tweet IO for example all your
application then you need to create
channels these lines these arrows
pointing your application are what the
channels are all about so what we'll do
in the next lecture is we'll create a
very very simple channel that simply
gets the data from your atom and through
your element into the head of network
and then it pushes it through a HTTP
POST request to a request then so then
you'll be able to see your data
appearing outside the helium Network
which is the beginning of starting to
build your own web application
