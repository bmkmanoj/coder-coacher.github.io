out of four of my HTML CSS and
JavaScript crash course so this is the
video where we finally dive into code
and we type some stuff from scratch
remember this is our goal here to make
this salmon-colored website that has
photos of my cat all circular photos
done with CSS the photos themselves are
actually squares I can click and we get
some new content loaded with JavaScript
whenever I click and then it loops back
through the same set of photos so we're
gonna begin with writing the HTML in
this video before we can do any of that
though I'm gonna get you set up with a
place to write the HTML so you have a
lot of options you could use any old
text editor if you are on a Mac you can
use TextEdit on a PC if you wanted to
you can use notepad you can download any
sort of text editor the one that I
recommend and the one I'll be using is
called sublime text the link is in the
description it's free and it's showing
download for Mac on my computer because
it knows that I have a Mac but you can
also download it download it for PC for
Windows and for Linux as well as OSX so
if you'd like go ahead and download this
the other option I'll show you is code
pen so code pen I saw I showed in the
last video it's a online editor it's not
really a place for serious development
it's not where most people would create
full applications but it's a place to
share things and very quickly type code
so if you go to code pen com the link is
also in the description go to create new
pen the instructions I'll give you is
that in this video all the code you type
will go over here in the HTML tab all
the CSS from the next video we'll go
here and all the JavaScript will go here
overall it will be a better experience
if you follow along with sublime text
but if for some reason you're unable to
download it or you're not in a situation
where you can install software on your
machine then you could use code pen
instead okay the next order of business
is to get you the starter code so every
video the next three videos at least
will have a starter code and then also a
solution or final version of our app as
we go through each video
this is what the starter code looks like
for this video you can use the download
link to get it there are three files one
for HTML one for JavaScript and one for
CSS and you'll notice they all have
different file extensions and then
there's a folder called images and this
just has six images of my cat so we're
going to use those to make the site once
you have these downloaded we're going to
start with index.html in this video you
have a couple of ways of opening it in
sublime on a Mac you can right click go
to open with sublime text if you just
double click it will open it in your
browser and try and show you the web
page the rendered HTML but we're trying
to edit it so open with sublime text or
you can click and drag it down to the
sublime text icon and your doc on a Mac
or in sublime text you can go file open
and then navigate to it however you end
up opening it in sublime you should see
this what we have here is called HTML
boilerplate so anytime you make a new
HTML application it always has this and
we're not going to spend much time going
into the details of every line because
it's there every single time I'm gonna
focus on the exciting stuff but just so
you know if you type the word HTML
inside of a dot HTML file in sublime and
you hit tab it automatically fills this
entire thing out for you because that's
how commonly used it is same thing in
code pen actually HTML tab okay so this
is our structure that every HTML
application we create every HTML file
needs to follow and it's up to us to
fill in the blanks and the first easiest
thing we could fill in is right here a
title for our web page this is not going
to be a title that's rendered on the
page itself it's what we'll see in the
tab of the browser of each window this
is sublime but let's type my cat or you
can choose whatever you'd like and we
save the file command S on a Mac then
I'm going to go back and open this file
up so I'm going to double click and this
is what I get an empty page but if I
look at the tab it says my cat and if I
right click and I click on inspect or
view page source let me make this larger
for you you can
this is our file this is the underlying
HTML and this is what it resulted in my
cat all right now let's actually work on
the contents of our application so what
we have here is just a couple of items
there's this big text up top that says
this is my new cat we're not worrying
about styling just the actual structure
then there's a photo then we have a
button and then we have a little bit of
text down here and other than that
there's nothing else the rest is style
and JavaScript so back in sublime let's
start with that text at the top that
just says this is my new cat okay so if
I just do this we're not going to get
anything great if i refresh the page in
my browser this is what I see now this
is my new cat but it's not big so to
make it big there's a couple of options
in the tag we're going to use is called
the h1 tag so all the tags as you can
see the existing ones that we're not
going to talk about they all follow the
same syntax or we have this bracket and
then the name of the tag and the closing
bracket and most of them have an opening
and a closing bracket or the trailing
tag or the closing tag has that slash
but not every tag does as you can see
this doctype tag doesn't and we'll see
in a minute that the image tag doesn't
either
so these tags if you didn't watch the
first video I recommend you do that but
they serve to encode structure they
surround our information and say what
this is how it should be treated by the
browser so if I put this is my new cat
inside that h1 this tells my browser
please make this a header there are six
levels of headers by the way so I will
duplicate this I use command shift D and
I made this one an h2 just by changing
that number if I go back make sure you
save and you refresh you can see I now
have two headers one that's large and
another that's slightly less large but
they're still bigger than what they were
before
so that's h1 and h2 like I said it goes
down to h6 for the smallest header okay
so I'll get rid of this extra header
let's skip over the image for now it's
the hardest one if you will it's not
that bad but let's actually work on the
button so there is a tag called
button and it works just the same way
where we have an opening and a closing
and if you get tired of typing that you
can see actually sublime auto-completed
that for me as soon as I did that slash
you can also just type button and hit
tab and that's one of the main reasons
people like working with editors like
sublime I said this gets really tiresome
to type all over and over and over ok so
inside this button we just specify the
text we want to show up I think I had
get next photo you can put whatever
you'd like here but whatever we put here
will show up in the button so if I save
and refresh there we go we have a button
and it doesn't do anything but it is a
button ok
next let's add the text below and that
text we could just put it as just plain
text like this
she current I think I said she currently
has no name please help me name her this
is not a great idea if we go back and we
look at it you'll see first of all it's
on the same - that button and if I
right-click on it and I go to inspect in
Google Chrome at least I'll make this
larger I actually have this little
inspector that lets me explore the
elements and I can open and close them
so we have the head with a title then
inside the body we have a button but
then after that there's just this block
of text with no tags or elements inside
of it instead of doing this we want to
wrap this content in something it just
should be like a paragraph of text and
fortunately there's a paragraph tag it's
just called the P tag so I'll do the
same thing and move my text in between
those two brackets and what this will do
is not only wrap it in a paragraph tag
but by making it a paragraph it actually
adds space afterwards and if I save and
refresh it now is on its own line just
by me wrapping it in a paragraph
and it's as simple as that so finally
let's actually add the image tag so
image is a little bit different first of
all the tag name is IMG like this oMG
and if you just type image and sublime
and hit tab you'll see it doesn't give
you the closing tag like if I do a P and
hit tab it gives me opening and closing
image is what's known as a self closing
tag it does not have there's no text
that we provide there's nothing in the
middle so instead it's a single tag but
there's this attribute called source SRC
and we're not going to dive into
attributes very much but certain tags
have attributes additional information
you can add and this one for an image is
really important because this is where
we specify what image to show you could
put any link to any image that you want
in here but I'm gonna work with these
images that I provided and if we go back
to the starter code we're working in
this file index.html the images are in a
folder called IMG s images and inside
you can see there's six we'll just pick
one I like this one kittie underscore
bed dot jpg so we have to remember that
we have to type that name exactly and
also we need to type the images folder
because we're here we have to access
through the images folder to this file
and the way we do that is by typing
images slash kitty bed dot jpg so if we
had another folder that they were inside
of called cat we would do that if they
were in the same folder as my HTML file
I don't need the image part their images
but they are in that folder and this is
just going to give us a single image so
I'm gonna save go back here and refresh
and there we go
this massive photo look at that face
what a cutie pie so grumpy this is the
image and that's all that HTML is going
to do for us is just put the image as it
is it's a big photo that I gave you and
it just makes it take up as much space
as it needs to so in the next video
we'll learn how to wrangle it how to
control the size as well as things like
color
how this button looks you know all the
style information is coming up next when
we talk about CSS but this is all of the
base elements if you look at the page we
have everything we have this header up
top we have the image tag we have the
button they all look different and we
have the paragraph of text so before I
go if you're curious about HTML tags
I've only shown you what a couple four
or five plus the boilerplate that we
didn't really talk about but on this
page that I've also linked to it's
called mdn Mozilla developer Network the
HTML elements reference you can see
every element that there is so you can
learn about the HTML element or the
title element which we filled in the
title element defines a title of a
document shown in the browser's title
bar or on each pages tab and they show
you an example and that's a very simple
one but there's a bunch more if you
wanted to learn more about headers you
can read here the main thing I just
wanted to show you is how many tags
there are so there are a lot of them I'd
say there's a subset of like 20 to 30
that are used all the time and then
there's a couple that I just have never
had to use ever that always surprised me
when I remember they exist so that's all
I'll do for new elements this is just a
crash course but just know that you can
see all of them here in a reference one
last thing before I wrap up here up top
I had this comment and I explained
comments in the last video briefly if I
type command slash on that line or ctrl
slash on a PC it is no longer commented
out and this is invalid HTML if I
comment it out though it's totally fine
so you can get rid of this line you can
add your own comments wherever you'd
like and to do that let's say if you
wanted to explain what source is you can
type a note I like to type command slash
first which gives me the comments or you
could type this manually I cannot
remember the last time I typed that
myself I always just type command slash
and then add a note I could do something
like this source is an attribute
specifies which image to show just a
note there's no functionality it's not
rendered it's purely for other
developers or yourself to just
understand what's happening
to write a note like this okay so in
this video we saw how to write some
basic HTML we saw a couple tags we
didn't go into the details of the
boilerplate here if you type HTML again
just remember every document you work in
with HTML will always have this and you
write the bulk of your tags inside the
body that's everything that shows up on
the page alright next we'll work on
adding some style</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
