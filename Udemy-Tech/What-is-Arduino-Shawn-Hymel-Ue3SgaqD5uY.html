hardware platform as well as software
that helps people make digital devices
but I didn't go into much detail before
we start playing I'd like to give you a
brief history of how Arduino came to be
this is a microcontroller which is like
a very small very low-power computer
most microcontrollers have a CPU RAM and
long term storage just like your
computer but where your laptop might
have 8 gigabytes of RAM this thing only
has 2 kilobytes of RAM which is not much
memory that means most microcontrollers
are good at running one program at a
time and not much else that being said
most microcontrollers are fairly
inexpensive much cheaper than full
computers as some can be had for a few
cents the other thing that makes
microcontrollers unique is their general
purpose input output or GPIO pins we can
use these pins to control other
electronics or circuitry from our
program see if you can find some home
appliances near you you'll probably find
some with a digital interface like this
microwave oven there is a good chance
that there is a microcontroller in there
that accepts user input controls the
cavity magnetron the part that generates
microwaves to cook your food and
displays the time remaining modern cars
often contain dozens of microcontrollers
working in tandem to control functions
like air to fuel ratio the radio
interface and lighting take a look
around you and pay attention next time
you go out can you identify some things
that probably have microcontrollers in
them when I was first learning how to
use microcontrollers this is often what
my projects looked like in fact this is
a picture of a Simon Says type game I
made as part of a group project for
school the mess of wires made it
difficult to debug and sending a program
to the microcontroller often involved
custom cables that never quite worked
right just to get a light to blink you
would need to download a multiple
gigabyte integrated development
environment or IDE and spend hours
configuring it to compile and upload to
your exact micro control
needless to say this process was an
absolute pain but in 2003 had a nun know
about a gun a grad student at the
interaction design institute fa a--
put together a framework for programming
microcontrollers known as wiring for his
thesis the software for wiring was based
on the processing framework which was
developed in 2001 as an open-source
cross-platform development environment
for teaching the fundamentals of
programming to the electronic arts and
digital design communities as you can
see the IDE for wiring looked very
similar to processing the wiring project
also included special firmware and tools
to make uploading programs to a select
set of microcontrollers much easier than
traditional methods hadn't and Oda's
einde several boards that combined a
microcontroller with the necessary
supporting circuitry to be easily
programmed by wiring he even worked with
several companies to have some of the
board's mass-produced
later in 2003 Massimo Banzi David MELAS
and David Cote ayahs forked the
open-source wiring software and renamed
it Arduino the name Arduino comes from a
bar in umeå Italy where some of the
project founders would often meet the
Arduino team went on to produce several
boards that contained microcontrollers
that can easily be programmed by the
arduino ide similar to how wiring worked
Arduino board and IDE development
continues to this day and programming a
microcontroller is as easy as plugging
in a USB cable and writing a few lines
of code many other companies including
Adafruit Industries and spark phone
electronics make and sell boards that
are compatible with the Arduino IDE
however we'll be focusing on the Arduino
Uno in this class as it is considered to
be the most popular Arduino starter
board and easy to use by learning how to
use Arduino you'll be able to add
electronic control to many projects like
this Arduino controlled automated
watering system now that you know a
little bit about the history of Arduino
let's start making something thanks for
watching if you'd like to learn more
check out my Arduino fundamentals course
on udemy in it I'll show you the basics
of C and C++ programming how to build
circuits and how to make things like
robots and
connected sensors if you use the coupon
in the description you'll get a YouTube
exclusive discount for the class see you
there
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
