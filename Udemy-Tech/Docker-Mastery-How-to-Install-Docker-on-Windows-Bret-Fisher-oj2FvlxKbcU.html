want to get docker working so let's get
you to it
in this lecture you're gonna learn the
two types of containers that can now run
on Windows you're gonna get through
which docker Edition you want to install
but based on your version of Windows and
your edition of Windows you're also
going to learn the difference between
Windows 10 and Server 2016 and how the
desktop and server treat docker a little
bit differently and then the next
lecture is going to get to installing it
there are two types of containers now on
Windows which is really cool we have the
options now for Linux containers or up
until recently we just call them
containers because that was the only
type of container we had now we have
Windows containers now this course by
default is actually going to talk about
Linux containers because we've had those
for four plus years and that's
everything that we all know about
containers was Linux based it was only
until late 2016 that Microsoft really
formalized the concept of a Windows
container and made it usable and they're
rapidly innovating so it's pretty
exciting space but most of the concepts
are the same you're gonna use them the
same way you're gonna manage them the
same way it just matters that binaries
that are running inside them you know
sequel Exe versus my sequel on Linux or
something so we're gonna talk in this
course about containers when I say that
I really mean Linux containers when I
talk about specifically on Windows
containers I will say Windows containers
so that we're clear okay and the best
version of docker on Windows is docker
for Windows that's actually in addition
of docker and it's got a whole install
that we're seeing a moment and it's
really great on Windows 10 it only works
on Pro and enterprise unfortunately if
you have the home version of Windows 10
or an older version of Windows it's not
gonna work in those cases you're going
to use the doctor toolbox which was the
only option we had until a year ago so
it's still a great option it's still
updated it's still
supported it's just not gonna have all
the nice cool features that docker for
Windows has because Windows 10 has new
innovations in it using hyper-v that we
just don't get in those old versions
unfortunately of Windows now with Server
2016 it does support Windows containers
we won't go a whole lot into that into
this course because that's still really
new stuff and they're making major
changes even just three or four months
ago they added a whole new networking
feature set to it so it's a rapidly
evolving ecosystem I will continue to
update this course and any other courses
with all that stuff as well and just as
an example of what that's like is we had
in the spring not only this new
networking overlay networking that
you'll get into later in the course but
we also have native Linux containers
that we haven't even seen yet but
Windows announced it add docker con and
that basically is some feature we're
gonna see in the near future that
supposedly will have Windows
intelligently and automatically figuring
out when you want to run a container
whether it should be on Linux or Windows
and then do that for you
today we have to manually specify there
supposedly gonna make some new feature
in the future that works on that that's
something that nobody else is doing no
other platform is doing that so it's
pretty cool to be on Windows it's just
evolving rapidly so be prepared so if
you're on Windows 10 Pro and enterprise
you're one of the lucky few that get to
actually run docker for Windows and you
can get that from stored at docker comm
it's actually got more features than if
you just installed Linux in a Linux VM
on your machine so if you're tempted to
just say screw it I'm just gonna install
Linux VM and I'm gonna install Linux on
it well that would work like a server in
the cloud like a Linux production server
might but the docker for Windows and the
docker toolboxes are really helping you
develop and test stuff locally so it
does things like map drives from your
host operating system into the container
and we'll get to that stuff later
but it's worth trying okay before you go
that other route and the background
docker for Windows is actually using
hyper-v which uses a tiny little Linux
VM for the Linux containers
so if you're on windows 10 pro or
enterprise right now and you have
VirtualBox or VMware they may not work
with hyper-v I know VirtualBox and
hyper-v don't play well together so you
may have to google around the internet
for solutions on trying to get those to
work right if you want to use both
personally I just decided to shift
everything in the hyper-v once docker
shifted into hyper beam it is PowerShell
native which means in this course if
you're on Ducker
for Windows I expect you to be using
PowerShell and I will show you commands
on how to do that
you can get other shells to work if
you're a zelda ninja and you like bash
or you like the old command prompt
that's fine
on docker for Windows seven eight and
ten home we're going to use the dr.
toolbox which is not as fancy as a
docker for Windows but it's still great
still works fine you could use it
everyday like others you're going to
download that at store docker comm and
it does run a tiny little Linux VM in
the background and it uses VirtualBox
and it uses a command line called docker
machine to manage that VirtualBox and
you'll see that later in the course as
well if you just want to learn how
docker machine works right now you can
actually just go google it and it'll
give you great instructions on how you
use docker machine command line to
create VMs and destroy them you can
actually create multiple dr. machines if
you wanted now in this machine that it
comes by default with a toolbox it comes
with a bash shell called the docker
QuickStart terminal I believe is what
it's called and that's what I expect you
to use in this course that's the one
that's going to work the best it's going
to auto start things and make sure
everything is working correctly if
you're more savvy and you wanting to get
into other options for shells I might
give you some tips along the way but I
can't really support every shell and
every possible configuration for your
environment so I'm going to focus on how
docker provides it out-of-the-box note
that those versions of Windows that
we're talking about right now do not
support the windows containers they only
support the Linux containers in that
small little VM and lastly just a note
about Windows Server 2016 as it is a
part of this core
and it supports windows native
containers so it it runs a windows
binary out of the box without hyper-v or
anything installed in a docker container
which is pretty cool
it does also support docker for Windows
but docker for Windows is really a
toolkit for local development and
testing it's not meant as a production
tool so the only reason I would tell you
to do this is if you had Windows Server
installed on your local machine as a
replacement for Windows 10 right some
developers do that they develop locally
on Windows Server because that's the
platform they use in production and they
like to develop on there that platform
so if you're doing that totally install
docker for Windows it'll give you a
better experience but if you're in
production don't do that you really want
to run docker windows containers
natively on Server 2016 and if you're
gonna do Linux containers you run those
natively on Linux not on docker for
Windows in production the previous
versions of Windows don't really support
anything with docker unless you're
talking about a previous version of
Windows that's running hyper-v and
that's running on your bare metal and
then you just run a Linux VM of course
you can do that you can do that anywhere
anywhere you can run a VM you can put
Linux on it and that can run docker so
that one is definitely still on the
table if that's the way you want to go
but in this course I'm not going to
expect you to be developing and testing
on Server 2016 I'll assume that you're
on Windows 10 or Ubuntu or Mac or
something
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
