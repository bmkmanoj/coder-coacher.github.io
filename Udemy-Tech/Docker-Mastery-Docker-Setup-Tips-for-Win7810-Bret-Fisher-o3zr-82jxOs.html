toolbox installed that means you're
using Windows 10 home or one of the
older versions of Windows like seven
eight or eight one and even though the
toolbox is legacy it still got some
pretty cool features so in this lecture
we're gonna actually download install it
then we're going to clone my github repo
then we're going to start the QuickStart
terminal and that is actually the
command-line interface that docker gives
you for the toolbox and then we're gonna
maybe tweak some of the VM settings or
at least show you how to do that and
finally getting a code editor and seeing
how we might change the shell out so
maybe you can use a different shell
instead of the default command prompt
that comes with Windows alright as you
can see I'm on a Windows 8 machine
actually 8.1 and I'm actually already on
store.com and like all the other
editions of docker this is where you get
it
so for windows were under docker seee
and then we scroll down till we find
windows now for the toolbox it's not the
default options so if you notice up here
at the top it talks about that it needs
Windows Professional 10 or enterprise
and then there's four previous versions
get dock or toolbox so let's click on
that and that will take us to a previous
site where you could actually get stuff
from docker which was on the docker comm
site and this is where the toolbox is
living for now eventually it may go and
live in the store but you just download
the one for Windows it's the same one
for all versions of Windows and I happen
to already have that downloaded so right
here just run that install and it'll
walk you through the setup now I
recommend you do a full install here so
on all the options you want checked and
in my case I actually already have it
installed so it didn't check them all by
default but for years it should have
them all checked you want VirtualBox
because that's how it's going to run the
Linux VM in the background that's
actually going to run
for us and the gate for windows allows
us to actually have a bash prompt that
will make it seem a little bit more like
Linux or Mac when we're using docker so
let's say now that I've finished my
docker install and I'm going to
double-click the docker QuickStart and
that will automatically kick off the
initialization process and what that
looks like is that you'll see that it's
running something called the pre create
checks and it's actually creating a
VirtualBox VM and it's using a boot to
docker ISO to do that which is a very
small version of Linux then you see that
it's provisioning from networking now
it's probably gonna prompt you a couple
times for permissions that's totally
normal that's a VirtualBox thing but
eventually it'll get down to where you
see that the mobi in ASCII format and
that's a signal that it's working and
you'll see that it's giving me a default
machine IP of 192 168 men I'm not a
hundred
and remember that this is in the
resource lecture earlier in this section
now I'm gonna clone this but I want to
clone it in desktop if you've never used
github before then you can use a GUI and
that's probably one of the easiest ways
if you're not used to get up if you know
github then you get you got your own way
to do it but here what I can do is I can
actually use the github GUI to download
and clone my repo so I'm going to
install that alright and then I'm
actually going to put all of my code in
a directory called code so I'm going to
make a directory
so you'll see on my machine that I
actually put all of my software code
inside a directory called code on
underneath my user so that's where I'm
going to clone this from github at so
I'm just gonna log in as me okay now
that I have github installed one of the
ways I can clone it is from the website
I can copy the URL and then go back over
to desktop and say clone a repository
copy that in and then remember I wanted
that this is not going to be under
documents it's gonna be under code
that's where I put my stuff so clone now
the advantage of doing it this way
instead of downloading the zip is that
you can come in here and update it
because I do update this repo when
there's fixes or changes in docker which
happens pre pretty much every month so
now if I do adder in here you can see
that I'm in the Ducker that you to me
doctor mastery directory and there we go
the last thing I just want to point out
is you'll need a code editor of some
sort it's not that great to use notepad
even though it does work so I recommend
Visual Studio code it's a free editor
from Microsoft and you can get it over
just by googling Visual Studio code and
it's free to download runs on Mac
Windows and Linux and actually it's
running on the Atom platform if you've
ever played with atom which is another
editor from github but this one actually
has a nice add-on for docker and a lot
of other nice features that I think
really are great out of the box so
download that you might see me use a
couple times during the course and there
you go
what's happening in the background here
is VirtualBox is actually running
silently and you don't see the GUI
necessarily but it doesn't mean it's not
running it's actually sitting here
running what was automatically created
which was a default machine so this is
actually just a regular VM running Linux
even though it is a small and limited
version of Linux that docker installed
you can change the properties of it
especially when it comes to the hardware
so I can't change anything right now
because it's running so I could do a
shutdown here and then once it's
shutdown I could actually go in and
change settings like how many CPUs it
has access to or how much RAM it has
access to and that's really just
depended upon your system and how many
resources you have so for example by
default it gives it a gig of ram and a
single processor maybe I want to bump it
up to two and maybe I want to give it
two gigs of rams so I can just bump that
up something like that
and then click OK and then I could start
it from here but we also can control it
for something called docker machine and
there will be a later lecture on what
docker machine can do but fundamentally
docker machine creates VMs either in the
cloud or on your local machine that run
docker if I just do a docker machine LS
here you'll see that it sees the machine
that it's automatically created and the
first machine it creates it always
creates as default and I could actually
start it with Ducker machine start and
you'll see that it'll actually kick it
off here and so I don't ever really need
to use Oracle VM VirtualBox manager I
don't actually have to play with that at
all unless I want to change the hardware
settings so now why that's starting and
getting its IP again so that we can mess
with it I wanted to talk a little bit
about this Quick Start terminal so this
is actually the default way you need to
run this at least once because then it's
going to automatically create that
development default machine it's
automatically going to set it up and do
the networking for you but after that
you don't have to use it you can as long
as you can get the docker machine from
somewhere you can run docker machine in
the dock or command line
if you're a little bit more savvy user
and you want to do a custom command line
or a custom shell and terminal you can
try commander CMD er net and it really
just changes the GUI and the
functionality run that GUI it's still
inside it running powershell or command
prompts or bash but it does give you a
lot of features around the GUI i
recommend downloading and extracting the
full version and when you do that make
sure that you right click on the zip
file and go into properties and unblock
it because once you unzip it it doesn't
actually have an installer you just need
to unzip it and once you unzip it it
won't run without a bunch of warnings
and problems unless you unlock it first
because it it considers that a security
feature in Windows you've probably run
into that before so extract all that you
can extract it right into your downloads
folder that's what I do and then inside
commander you'll see something called
commander if you simply run that by
default it'll give you a command prompt
a cmd.exe and you'll see that you have
some cool options here where I can
actually run a PowerShell prompt if I
want I can run multiple tabs and a lot
of other nice features where I can
actually expand it and shrink it at will
and that's great but how do we get
docker running in that well it's not
that hard it just takes a few extra
steps so you can see over here that I
have docker machine LS and that shows me
that I have one machine with docker
running and as you'll learn in future
lectures in the next section I can do a
docker version that will tell me the
docker version of both my client and the
server running in the background but
over here I can do docker machine and I
can do docker version but you'll notice
that it says it can't connect a server
and that's a common problem on Windows
or on the toolbox specifically and what
that means is is that docker isn't
actually running in Windows it's running
in the VM and so my client my little
commandline docker right here can't talk
to that unless I tell it where to go and
that's one of the things this nice
little GUI over here does that I need to
set up over here and the way we do that
is with docker machine so if I just do a
docker machine LS again you see that has
the one machine there and if I do a
docker machine help I get lots of help
right get lots of information and one of
the things I can do here is I can type
docker machine env defaults because
remember that's the name of the default
machine and that will actually get me
some variables that I can then copy and
paste into my hosts but it actually
tells me down here at the bottom that if
I just do this it should work so let me
copy and paste that and now what should
happen if I do a darker version I get
back both the client and the server now
if you're savvy enough with Commander
you can actually have it do that stuff
automatically on startup I'll leave that
to you otherwise just know that you can
use the docker machine env default to
get the commands you need in order to
tell docker how to find the server and
then once it can find it you can do all
the docker commands that come in two
later lectures in this lecture you learn
how to get the docker toolbox on older
versions of windows and I just want to
give you a couple extra tips and
summarize some of the things we talked
about real quick the docker QuickStart
terminal is how you start it so memory
need to run that once in order for it to
automatically create the default machine
and get everything set up you can still
actually use docker machine after that
to manipulate that docker machine in the
background but that actually defaults to
the bash shell and auto creates
everything for you do note that during
this course we're going to talk about
something called a bind mount and that's
where it connects source files that
you've downloaded on your Windows
machine into the docker Linux machine
okay and that's known as a bind mount
that actually works with the toolbox but
it's
only gonna work for code that you store
it inside the users directory so make
sure that you went wherever you get
whenever you get downloads of code you
actually make sure that they're in your
user profile and not somewhere else on a
different drive letter unfortunately
different Drive letters and different
paths will not work with the toolbox
they have to be in your user profile
this also is a good thing that you don't
use for databases so I don't recommend
that you do a bind mount and again we'll
explain the details of that later but
that you do it by and mount for
databases it's really just for code
because windows file systems are quite
different than Linux file systems and
they don't always work well together
when they're sharing and again remember
that you can always use docker machine
to actually recreate that Linux VM that
it created for you the default one right
or additional ones and the great editor
that I recommend is visual studio code
in this course and that if you would
like a shell replacement you might want
to consider a commander and you can get
that at CMD II Arnett
