details of the exam requirements I want
to give you this overview of Microsoft
Azure now if you've got a lot of
experience in Microsoft Azure and you've
been working with it for months or for
years this might be a little bit of
repetitive thing to you and you're
certainly free to skip this video and
move on to the next video but if you
don't have a lot of background with
Azure you just want to find out how it
is or if you just want to refresher on
some of these concepts stick around
because this is the video where I'm
going to try to just go through this at
a very high level now Microsoft Azure
has this a bit of an interesting free
offer if you don't have an azure account
I go to Google and and look up as your
free offer and I come up with this link
it's a sure Microsoft com
Sashi and - us slash free now each
country has a slightly different free
offer so the u.s. offer is $200 US
credit to your account the Canadian
offer is actually two hundred and fifty
dollars Canadian credit different
countries are recei in different
currencies and have a slightly different
offer so this is the u.s. offer so the
way that the free offer works for Asia
is you get a batch of money virtual
money essentially at for the first month
that you use it and so this case you
have two hundred credit and you have 30
days to use it and then after the 30
days the credit goes away okay so if
you're going to take this course you're
going to use the free account to study
as soon as you create this account that
clock starts ticking and you're going to
want to start to get into it pretty
deeply in the first 30 days now with
that two hundred dollars you can use it
to create virtual machines you can use
it to spin up web apps and use any of
those services that microsoft offers
that they charge for as soon as it
reaches the 200 dollar limit all of
these things will automatically shut
themselves down and you will you know
basically run out of the free money now
after that first month there is a full
12 months of free access to some of the
popular products so this is very much
similar to
Amazon AWS frites here we're for one
year you get access to a very basic VM
and you know very basic EBS etc so in
the azure model you get a similar thing
where you get 12 months access to their
what uncle popular products after the 12
months you're gonna have to start to pay
to use these resources now Microsoft
does have some all as free resources not
every resource within the cloud Azure
cloud cost money there is like a free
web app tier example so you can you can
look at this and if you need to create
an account especially for studying you
could come here use an email address
sign up and create an account so once
you've gone through the registration
process and you created an account I
believe a credit card is required then
you're gonna have to sign into the
account this is the brand new Azure
sign-in experience I'm gonna close that
because I don't want to go back to the
old one I have an account here it's got
score so that look calm and I use a
password manager so I don't have to
remember all these passwords so I'm
gonna sign in and we can see here the
typical sign-in process you get the
azure logo and very quickly you get to
what's called a dashboard now the
dashboard is customizable you can have
you can use edit dashboard and you can
start to close up some of these boxes if
you start creating cloud resources like
virtual machines and web apps you can
actually put them onto your dashboard
for easy access and easy monitoring you
can also have more than one dashboards
so this I only have one dashboard in
this account but you can then create
another dashboard in if you have
different views and different purposes
for looking at the way applications are
set up then you can just have multiple
dashboards and it's like flipping
between you know your screens on a
desktop essentially now this is sort of
the default view okay as you create some
resources that will automatically add
tiles to your homepage the most
important in tile on this homepage right
now as you can see is how much I've
spent this month so there was a point in
time where I hadn't spent
thing I spun up I remember it was to
test the two instances of a web app to
see what the kind of charges are and so
I very quickly was getting into a
charged situation then I turned it off
and so I haven't had any resources
charged against me for almost a couple
weeks so you don't want to get this
number especially when you're just
learning and it's on a your own account
or the company's not paying for it you
got to keep very close attention on your
resources this is one tip for it
studying is that make always make sure
that you're aware of which resources
cost money and when you're done with
them shut them down as quickly as
possible
Microsoft charges by the minute okay in
terms of their their charges and so if
you do use your resource for 45 minutes
you're gonna get 45 minutes worth of
cost better to do that than to leave it
running overnight and forget about it
and come in with a $20 charge all right
now this isn't going to be the case when
you have that $200 free account because
the resources will automatically shut
themselves off when you reached your
limit once you get past that page ago
consumption you got to keep a close eye
on this now we're not in this course
we're gonna get into all of the relevant
sections that are relevant for this exam
from like app services virtual machines
databases networks etc okay we won't do
that at this time but this is the
overview when you want to create a
resource the most convenient way to do
it is this new
menu on the Left you'll see the
marketplace and then you can you know
see the compute resources networking
resources storage resources or you can
just a search and this search will be
performed return you some results and
you can see which ones that you want
okay
so again once we get into this course
you're going to become very familiar
with this now it's important to know
that Microsoft Azure is a huge market
with thousands of products between
Microsoft's products and third-party
products there are literally more than a
thousand products ok so if I say see all
I'm going to be given an overwhelming
number of products we go into
Microsoft's website here we can see
Microsoft's official products these are
the things that are built in to Azure
and these are the things that well a lot
of them will likely be on this test and
like it said the rest of the course will
be spent going through these ok but I'll
scroll through them and I don't want you
to be overwhelmed but there is a lot and
like I said we'll talk about the ones
that are relevant later in this course
so in the next video we'll talk about
some basic cloud and Azure concepts at a
high level before we dive into the
details of the actual requirements of
the test
