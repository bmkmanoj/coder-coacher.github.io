talk about the game mind that you need
for learning to code and this is
actually the game mind that you need for
being successful in life and I'm gonna
teach you how to tell the future how to
predict the future in this video and
it's not earth shattering it's not you
know mind blowing it's common sense and
when you hear it you'll be like oh yeah
that's common sense but it's also not
common practice and it's not commonly
thought about and so that's what you're
gonna learn this video you're gonna
learn what it takes to be successful and
I really like this in this class and in
life and I really like this idea of the
game mind because you know I've done
I've done different sports in my life
and no matter what sport you're doing
the most important thing you can learn
from your coach is how to have the right
mentality for that sport for that game
and so if you have the right mentality
that is going to make the difference
between winning and losing between
succeeding and feeling between living
and dying you got to have the right
attitude in life and I used to be a
skeptic and I used to be a cynic and I
used to think it was kind of cool to be
cynical and you know and to kind of like
whatever you know and to kind of like
look at the negative and talk about how
the system is screwed like that used to
be me and I've really learned through
undeniable practice in my life how
important it is to have a positive
perspective like come hell or high water
this is gonna happen ain't nothing gonna
stop us and I'm gonna fight and I'm
gonna fight and I'm gonna fight until I
get to where I want to be and that's
winning and I like it like you got to
have that positive perspective and if
you don't have that positive perspective
if you're like well bah it might work
out you know like if you're eat your
that's that's gonna that's gonna defeat
you before you even step on the grass
and so you got to have that spirit of
fight in you you got to have it and it's
something you can choose and you just
cultivate that choice so you know it's
like what way do I want to see the world
and you cultivate that which is
and you don't cultivate that which is
unskillful so those unskillful thoughts
those doubts those uncertainties those
bah humbug eat or thoughts man you just
kind of let them slide by and just don't
water them and don't give them any
attention and the positive thoughts you
want to wake up listen to a podcast
which has positive enthusiasm while
you're like driving to work or why eyes
get in this recording environment set up
I was listening to this great you know
podcast about Bitcoin and crypto
currencies like just kind of feeding
your mind positive things and and so
that's that's one of the important
things so you want to have a great
positive attitude and I'll give you an
example this right here okay so Will
Smith who's an actor in case you don't
know he's done well he's been in many
Hollywood blockbusters but his his
perspective is that am I not this is a
quote from him I might not be the
smartest guy in the world I might not be
the hardest I might not be the
best-looking guy in the world but I'm
the hardest-working guy and if you put
me on a treadmill next to some other guy
one of two things is gonna happen you
say who could go the longest you put us
on a treadmill one of two things is
gonna happen either that guy is gonna
step off the treadmill or I'm gonna die
I think that's a super-high level of
commitment and alright and there's
another speech which kind of speaks to
this just having the right game mind and
it's Al Pacino's speech in any given
Sunday and so you could just YouTube
that alp any giving Sunday Al Pacino
pregame speech the life is a game of
inches right and you have to be willing
to fight for those inches and so having
that right attitude that's the first
thing that's the game mind that you got
to bring to all life so have that right
attitude that fight attitude that
positive attitude like and you know you
you go for it you just go for it
and through the process you end up
somewhere but you're not going to end up
somewhere if you just sit on the couch
eating Fritos drinking coke and watching
TV I get up exercise eat well have fun
learn stuff work hard play hard like
enjoy it
so that's that's the first first lesson
for succeeding when it comes to learning
programming and also
learning succeeding in life the next
thing to know is that you need to have
grit
you need to have grit and so this is a
proven scientifically proven they've
researched it and there's this woman
Angela Duckworth and she's studied like
what does it take to make people
successful and you could YouTube her
talk and it's a TED talk and it's grit
the power of passion and perseverance
but the thing that makes students
successful it's not intelligence it's
not where you come from it's not how
much money you have it's not whether or
not your parents are educated the thing
that makes students successful and you
want to learn programming your student
the thing that makes students successful
is grit it's time on task its
persistence and we know this already we
know this from life you want to learn
how to play basketball
beyond shoe hoops every day and then
over time you're gonna get better
you want to learn how to do anything
that's what you got to do every day you
put in some time you put in that
practice you have grit and persistence
and over time you're gonna get better
whatever it is you want to do you can do
it learn to play the guitar learn to
water-ski to surf get into shape learn
to program whatever it is grit and
persistence so we're learning some stuff
positive attitude game mind that fight
you know like you're gonna do it
cultivating the positive that's the
first thing second thing is persistence
and grit and just stick with it and do
it every day so in my life the way I I
practice that is if I want to do
something I will allocate time to that
thing every day like I'm gonna learn new
things about programming two hours every
day I'm gonna work at programming come
hell or high water I do my two hours
every day and if I miss it one day for
some reason I'm gonna do four hours the
next day look at that level of
commitment every day two hours and if I
miss it next day four hours like every
day I'm taking two hours towards my goal
and overtime man I'm gonna get there I'm
gonna get there come hell or high water
you know at that level persistence
commitment fight positive attitude it's
gonna happen so that's the second thing
that's really important and then the
third thing which is really important
and it's kind of a culmination of those
previous two is just telling the future
and here's how you can tell the future
you can tell the future by looking very
closely at the seeds that you're
plantain today because if you plant the
right seeds today or whatever seeds
you're planted a that's gonna be the
crop that you harvest tomorrow so just
plant the right seeds plant the right
seeds every day and tend that garden of
life cultivate that garden of life you
know pull out the things which are
unskillful those naysayer thoughts the
bah humbug thoughts and plant the things
which are skillful a good diet your
brain your body runs on the fuel that
you put into it the food don't eat crap
put in high-octane fuel so to speak put
in things very nutritious great meat
great food eat love it enjoy it but eat
things that were around a hundred years
ago don't eat processed food right and
and you know that's planning a good seed
exercise every day your brain runs
better when you've exercised you have
more blood more oxygen going to your
brain scientifically proven right plant
that seed allocate time every day
towards moving towards the thing that
you want to accomplish great seed to
plant right you plant those seat like
don't smoke too much dope or drink too
much weed right that's you know like you
know maybe a little bit like to chill
out whatever your life is but you know
stay on point if you're under 25 the
research shows you shouldn't smoke weed
it screws up your brain you could google
it but but you want to stay on point you
want to stay on point and not cultivate
that which is unskillful cultivate the
skillful don't cultivate the unskillful
so that's how you tell the future that's
how you predict the future you look at
the seeds that you're planned today and
that's gonna be the crop that you
harvest tomorrow and you just keep doing
it and if you do that you're gonna
succeed and it might take two years or
five years or ten years or 50 years but
eventually you're gonna be a powerhouse
you're gonna be a master you're gonna be
making things happen you will have
financial rewards you will brought
wonderous benefit to other people's
lives and all you have to do is have
that positive attitude you have to have
that spirit of willing to do it getting
up off the couch and fight and every day
and you need to have grit and
persistence to focus on that which is
important and do it on a daily basis and
then and then you just you know it's
need to have a good time also have fun
so that's a that's what I
share with my students at the University
in college when we start a class and
that's the game mind you got to have the
right game mentality for the game and
that's how you succeed how you will
succeed in learning to program and also
how you succeed in life
so I share that with you because people
shared it with me and it tremendously
helped me in my life it made a
difference I went from not being very
extraordinary as a student to getting
straight A's and graduating at the top
of my classes the dean's medalist and
and so it's made a difference in my life
I mean you know this beautiful place
that I lived that beautiful car back
there you know all of it and I know that
it'll make a difference in your life so
I'm excited you're here I'm excited to
teach you see some things about
programming and we're going to get
started with that in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
