into the clips uh what I'd like to do is
to continue to use the same project as
before
JSP demo
and what I want to do is move down to
the web content directory and create a
new file so we're actually gonna create
a new file for that HTML form so I'll
just do a right-click I'll say new file
the name of this file I'll call it
student form dot HTML
and once we're happy with the name we
can go ahead and click the finish button
all right so let's go ahead and expand
the window here I'll set up my basic
HTML tags
and then I'll set up a header for the
title of this form
and then we just go ahead and set up
some body tags here real quick
and then we can start building our form
so I hear I'll say form action equals
Student Response dot JSP so that's the
JSP file we're gonna send the data to we
haven't created the file yet we'll
create it next but that's the actual
file that will send the data to
now I need to simply go through and
create some form fields so I'll set up
the form field for first name
so the input type is text and the name
is equal to first name
and again that's the exact same name
we're gonna use on the server side and
our JSP when we read the form data
some line breaks here
similar thing here for last name so
input type equals text name equals last
name
I'll just do a quick copy/paste here on
the line breaks
and then the finally to wrap it all up
I'll set up my submit button so I'll say
input type equals submit
in value equals submit so the value of
submit that's the actual label that
you'll see on the submit button
oh and I noticed I have a typo on line
17 I spelled the input' type submit' I
misspelled that one so let me fix that
with an eye okay good now we're good to
go
female form has the first-name lastname
and the submit button
okay so now let's go ahead and create
the GSP page that'll process this so our
Student Response JSP so new file
and I'll call it student response dot
JSP that's the same name that I refer to
in the HTML form
those Student Response jasp and once
you're happy with this name you can go
and click the finish button okay great
so let's go ahead and set up our basic
tags again and set up our student
confirmation
and then take care of the body alright
so now this is where we need to start
reading some of the form data
so first off I'll say the student is
confirmed and then I want to display
their first name and their last name so
I'll make use that shortcut notation the
dollar sign curly brace for RAM that
first name so it's the same name from
the HTML form and in paramus name so
basically here we'll have first name
space last name for that student once
they're registered
program so I'll move over to student
formed at HTML I'll do a right-click and
I'll say run as now choose run on server
okay great so here's our form we can go
ahead and enter some information here so
for the first name I'll say John last
name of DOE and once I'm happy with that
I'll hit the submit button
okay great so here's our confirmation
page the student is confirmed John Doe
so that's the result of us reading the
form data that the user entered on their
HTML form so this all looks really good
so good job so we were successful in
reading HTML form data with the JSP page
