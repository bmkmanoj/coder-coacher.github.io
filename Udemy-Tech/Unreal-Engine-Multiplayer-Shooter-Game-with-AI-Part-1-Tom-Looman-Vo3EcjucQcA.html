course on C++ in Unreal Engine 4 so
please enroll today and let's start
making games for unmentioned 4 together
in this lecture we'll be starting to
create our very first weapon now we
start off by adding a new C++ class and
we derive it from actor and that's
because it will be an object that we
have in our hands and it will be visible
in the world so we'll call this s weapon
and we will make sure that it is in the
public in the private folder structure
and then we'll create the class okay
when that's done compiling it we'll put
out put us back into visual studio so
let's get started by doing some initial
setup and any header file we know we
want to create a skeletal mesh that will
represent a visual elemental for our
weapon so let's get started by adding a
new skeletal mesh component and call
this weapon or let you call this mesh
component as usual we definitely want to
expose this so we can do some editing
and do the visual setup of the asana or
the content assignment so we want to be
is to be visible anywhere blueprint read
only
and the category will be components
because it is a component and we want to
afford to Claire this class you skeletal
skeletal mesh component there we go
okay now let's dive back into the CPP
file and create an instance of this
component is create default sub object
make sure we specify the type point and
we will give it a name simply mash up
very simple and we want this to be the
root component so anything else we'll
attach to our mesh components all right
that should be it for now
so we'll just do so I'll just compile
this okay and when that is done we dive
back into the editor and let's open up
our test map and one thing I would like
to do is do a few things in blueprint
from now so one thing or the all the
first thing I would like to do is to
create our create a weapon of a weapon
blueprint of our weapon that we just
created so let's search for s weapon and
call this our rifle logical this BP
rifle okay now let's quickly open this
and we can see that our route is in the
dimension bottom that we created and we
don't have anything yet to assign here
except for a character which is not what
we want right now so just as a
placeholder we can show engine content
and we can use one of the engine engine
meshes so let's set up the skeletal cube
now what I'd like to do is to just
assign the rifle to our player pong
we open up is up in for a beloved editor
and we're going to be using the begin
play so when the game starts we want to
spawn our weapon and then attach it to
the hands of the character so let's
spawn actor from class and we'll select
weapon which will be actually we will
need to search for rifle because that's
what we call the blueprint and the span
spawn transformation doesn't really
matter because we'll just attach and
snap it to the target to our character
anyway we want to always spawn because
if you spotted at 0 it might collide
with something and then it might fail to
spawn so I just always spawn ignore
collisions and the return value will be
the instance of our rifle so what we
want to do is use this and say attach to
component and now the parent will be our
mesh our character so we'll connect that
and then one thing we need to do is we
need to specify a socket but first let's
just say snap the targets snap the
target and it snap to target and then
finally the final thing we need to do is
find the socket name so if you were to
select this and then press the search
that will show it in the content browser
and then finally we open up the skeleton
not here we have all of our bones and
one thing we need to do is we need to
add a socket so we can attach our weapon
somewhere so let's quickly search for
hand now I'll use the right hand maybe
actually let's see if there's a better
one no so that's ok let's use the hand
and we right-click
and then we add a socket and we call
this weapon socket okay that's it for
now so let's go back into the pleura
bond and we just call this weapon socket
I know we complete or compile I'm sorry
okay so let's see what happens okay yeah
there we go we have a cube which will be
our weapon in the hand then it we press
f8 so we edge echt out of our character
can sort of like see that it is attached
let's slow this down a little bit
it is attached to the hand socket
already hand bone of our character so it
moves as if the arm okay so we got at
least some of the basics done and the
next lecture will be importing our
weapon mesh and we'll be starting to
implement some of the firing logic
hi in this lecture we'll be importing
some weapon assets these weapon assets
are available from the unity page so
make sure you download the weapon meshes
back before continuing this lecture once
you've downloaded that pack we can go
into the project right-click on the
content and say show and Explorer now
this will open up a window for you
we're inside of the content and if you
have the weapon ashes pack downloaded
and unzipped you should see this weapons
folder with all of these u.s. it files
now us at finals are already imported I
got these met these assets from a
different project and that means you
can't drag and drop them into the Condor
browser like that instead we will just
be dragging and dropping it into this
content folder so let's copy the content
like so and then head back into our
unreal project and this may take a
little bit of time before it shows up
what we should see now is a few files so
let's open up these and it will do some
shader compilation in the background
let's close these other files for now so
we're we have the first weapon and then
we have another weapon a launcher that
we will be using later on for one of our
challenges and we have a bunch of files
no extra files because there's skeletal
meshes they have their own skeleton and
crosshair folder ok so now we're ready
to assign and replace the cube that we
assigned in our previous lecture with an
actual nicer looking mesh so let's
assign the skeletal mesh hit compile
and if we play we should see it is being
attached however one thing you might
immediately notice should immediately
notice is that it's aiming straight
through our character now we can quickly
fix this by going into our Karen
so let's find this skeleton there we go
open up that mannequin skeleton and as
you might remember we created this
weapon socket now it's hard to see
exactly if this would if our weapon
would fit properly so what we're going
to do is we're going to right click and
say a preview mesh and we'll search for
rifle now this will add a the mesh as
our preview not now we can see that it
is indeed not really looking so
brilliant actually let's just go and
select local space so it's a little
easier to adjust these axes and we just
rotate this 90 degrees now that looks a
little better actually let's slow that
down that looks slightly better just as
a quick fix
we will let's select it again and let's
disable the translation because that is
way too big
and let's reset this so let's just move
this to be a little closer so that looks
a lot better let's save this go back
into our test map and quickly play to
see the result now that already looks
much better
let's f8 to eject and I would say this
is just about fine I would just move it
a little bit backwards like that and a
little down you can see it has already
updated okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
