TBS certifications in this lesson I want
to talk to you about what the ATS
certifications are what they consist of
and why they're so valuable why it's
important why you should think about
having a certification or obtaining a
certification here's a picture from the
AWS site discussing certifications and
you'll notice that it's got three
categories over here on the Left
architecting developing and operations
and that's the way it looks at and
breaks down at certifications and each
of these tracks has two levels an
associate level and a professional level
the associate level is a capable
professional who obtains a certification
then the professional is a more advanced
certification that really represents a
deep dive into the services that are
called upon for that certification so
there's three and then there's specialty
certifications that AWS is building out
and we've got a couple listed here
networking specialty and a big data
specialty and I expect there'll be more
specialties coming forward but this is
the current set up and we'll see about
where this goes in the future but
certainly this reflects the
certification world as it stands at this
moment and you'll notice on the
architecting side we're now discussing
the aid of your certified Solutions
Architect
associate certification that's what this
course focuses on Solutions Architect
associate they describe as this exam
test your technical expertise in
designing and deploying scalable highly
available and fault-tolerant systems on
AWS this is for anyone with one or more
years of hands-on experience designing
distributed applications and systems on
the 80 Bayers platform so they sort of
look at this as somebody who has a year
or so experience at musn is experienced
technical professional has some level of
expertise around technology and the
focus is about designing and deploying
the applications the systems on AWS it's
not per se about how to do
development but more about how do you
ensure that applications that run on AWS
take advantage of the right services
that you understand what those services
offer and that you can build resilient
and fault-tolerant systems that's what
the Solutions Architect associate
certification focuses on what about the
value of certifications and how much is
this particular certification these
certified Solutions Architect associate
certificate certification work worth
what does it command in the marketplace
well here's an article from CIO which is
a long-established very reputable outlet
IT outlet since the most valuable cloud
computing certifications today this is
an article that came out mid-2017
top cloud server occasions you'll notice
that the very first one listed AWS
certified Solutions Architect and this
reflects its capability its demand
Forbes read an article and by Luis
Columbus who as a fellow that I know and
very well respected well regarded as an
analyst in the space and he didn't
announce this an organization had done a
study of certifications the 15 top
paying IP certifications in 2016 the AWS
certified solutions architect leads at
125 K the most valuable IT certification
skills is from his article involved
creating apps on AWS and managing costs
certified solution architects are
required to have expertise in cost
analysis demonstrating the ability to
orchestrate AWS advanced cost management
and control features also covers ingress
and egress of data to and from AWS just
to emphasize this survey looked over all
the certification in the industry and
identified the top paying IT
certifications and the number-one top
paying certification was a certified
Solutions Architect so you're in the
right place if you're interested in
making a good salary
from a certification what's in the
current certification well this is as it
stands and I want to make you aware
there now have a beta test out I'll be
talking about that in just a couple of
minutes but the current test as it
stands is multiple choice and multiple
answer questions really it's they pose
questions and they provide multiple
answers that you have to choose from
there's 80 minutes to complete the exam
it's available in a large number of
languages there's a practice exam that
you can take that cost $20 and the
registration for the certification exam
is 150
there's no prerequisites you don't have
to have a different certification to be
able to go through this one but they
recommend these workshops that you can
take these courses there's full details
in an exam blueprint which will be
talked about in just a moment and
they'll provide your sample questions
well here is a blueprint for the current
certification test and you'll notice
it's got four what they call domains
which are basically topic areas that the
certification exam looks at number one
domain is designing highly available
cost efficient fault tolerant scalable
systems which emphasizes the discussion
that we saw from that slide a couple of
minutes ago that talked about the survey
and what those what the certification
covered well this is the documentation
on it it does cover those things and
that counts for 60% of the examination
so out of that number of questions 60%
of them will focus on this topic
implementation and deployment 10% data
security 20% of troubleshooting is 10
percent of course adding up to hundred
percent and you can find a very full
description of this of this
certification blueprint at this location
where I've got right down here or you
can do a search for it and it'll come up
however they do have a beta that they're
coming out with and I want to talk about
what it covers because it's somewhat
different it uses the same domain
terminology but you can see that it's
actually not as heavily weighted in any
one direction so it's got five domains
design resilient architectures which is
probably analogous to the
number one domain for the previous one
but instead of 60% this is just over a
third 34% Divine Design sorry
define performance architectures 24%
nearly a quarter is about how do you
make up architectures that perform well
specify secure applications at
architectures about a quarter of 26%
design cost optimized architectures
about 10% and then operationally
excellent architectures 6% again adding
up to a hundred percent and here is the
blueprint of the beta certification that
you can go to allocate or you could do a
search for it so it's a somewhat
different certification bit broad
arranged and bit less heavily skewed
toward any one particular topic let's
compare the two where they stand
so the current test you get 80 minutes
for the beta test you get 150 minutes
for and by the way the beta is now
available you can go and take it today
so 80 minutes for 150 minutes and it's
not really clear why you would need so
much more time but they do provide it
and my speculation is it's not that the
questions are so much harder there's
some more so many more questions it's
more that they want to make sure that
people have enough time to go through it
so that they can improve on the quality
of the beta part of what they're doing
now is in is evaluating it and making
sure that it's really a very valuable
certification test they're gonna provide
more time the past level the current
pass level is a little bit strange and
that they don't have a spent set number
of questions you have to be able to
answer correctly or a particular level
they tune it for every version of the
test every little tweak on the test but
it's around 65 to 70 percent if you
score at that level you'll probably pass
and certainly if you get to 70% or above
you'll pass the new beta test is much
more structure and at 70% on a point
scale may points go from a hundred to a
thousand if you get 70% so 700 you'll
pass
the number of questions current 60 so 60
and 80 minutes the beta it's 80 in 150
minutes one big change is the current
test you take the test you get the
results immediately the next day whereas
the beta take can take up to three
months and again my speculation is
they're looking at the kinds of answers
they get mapping them against the
questions and the way they think they
ask the questions to evaluate whether
their certification and the exam is
comprehensible not ambiguous questions
so forth and so on
so it can take up to three months for
you to get your results back but one
advantage is the cost currently is $150
for the current one but only 75 for the
beta so you might consider that a better
deal you can take it and when you pass
that beta certification it is considered
that you've got a certification for the
certified Solutions Architect
associate level so in other words it's
not a beta like it doesn't count it
counts if you pass it you'll get your
certification so you can decide which
one you want to take the only caveat is
if you take the beta you won't be
certified for up to three months if
you've got a current certification of
that same sort of that same
certification you're already a certified
Solutions Architect associate
you've got your current one that'll
carry over that three months but if
you're brand new it can take it up to
three months to get that certification
an obvious question is does this course
suffice for both the current and the
beta version of the certification and
the answer is yes this course will and
prepare you for either certification
either certification test so you should
rest easy you'll be able to pass either
one of them after you take this course
in summary the certified solutions
architects associate
documents you're eight of your skills so
if you pass it it says that you have all
of these skills it uses structure domain
knowledge and that's whether you use the
current one or the beta it is the
highest demand sort of certificate in
the world and in the industry and it's
the best paid surrogate so that you can
take advantage of it in terms of your
career
and obtaining one is really an
investment in future career many
companies when they're recruiting will
either explicitly ask for this or
consider it a strength of a candidate if
they have this certification so
something to consider
as you make it and look out of your
future look out over your career and
decide you know whether you should go
ahead and take the certification I would
highly recommend it
it's clearly a way to demonstrate your
skills and it's it can help
differentiate you from other candidates
with that we've reached the end of this
lesson when you're ready please go onto
the next one
hello and welcome to this lecture on how
to use AWS for innovation and revenue
and in this lesson what I want to
discuss is why people are adopting AWS
what's making it such a powerful trend
what value do people get from it and I
want to provide some examples of what
people are doing with it so you get a
sense of the power that AWS represents
well you might say well what is it it's
what it's Amazon Web Services here's
something from the Amazon pages the very
front page it says Amazon Web Services
AWS is a secure cloud services platform
offering compute power database storage
content delivery and other functionality
to help businesses scale and grow
explore how millions of customers are
currently leveraging AWS cloud products
and solutions to build sophisticated
applications with increased flexibility
scalability and reliability and really
the thing to take away from this is it's
a cloud services platform offering
compute power database storage content
delivery and delivery and other
functionality it has a tremendous amount
of services that it offers and those are
all done in a cloud basis so in other
words remote from wherever the user
happens to be located with that brief
introduction let's talk about what AWS
offers well people like it because
there's resource availability
availability it used to take days weeks
or months even to get resources
available for computing Amazon delivers
them in minutes that means customers can
sit down and get to work right away
so resource available
the service richness which we'll look at
in the next slide but basically there's
a huge number of services that can be
treated almost like a an erector set or
Tinkertoys or a lego that you can
assemble things applications from mixing
and matching choosing whichever services
makes sense for the application you're
building there's usage-based pricing
what does that mean that means you only
pay for what you use the way things used
to be you'd buy a computer you might buy
software for it and whether or not
you're getting value from it or not you
are still paying for it typically you to
pay for it upfront with usage-based
pricing you can essentially just start
up the resources on Amazon use them for
whatever length of time you want and you
only pay for what you use and when you
turn them off or turn them back to AWS
you stop paying and sort of
complementary to that is commitment free
when you use Amazon you do not make to
need to make any long-term commitment to
its resources you can say I want to use
a virtual machine for 10 minutes and
that's all you use and that's all you
pay for if you use it for a year you pay
for that but there's no commitment and
anytime you decide you're done you can
turn it off a walk away there's this
sort of notion of infant infinite
capacity now truthfully of course there
is no such thing as infinite in the
universe but a diversity group at UC
Berkeley did a study very early on about
cloud computing and they they used this
phrase the illusion of infinite capacity
meaning as much resources as you need
that cloud provider stands ready to
deliver them and Amazon does provide
some amazing level of resources there's
an ecosystem richness meaning that not
only does Amazon and its services are
available but that a whole range of
other providers make their services
available on AWS as well so you can find
billing software or ERP software CRM
software other kinds of components other
kind of functionality that are available
on that platform and you can use those
as part of your
leggo system as well and finally what I
call the innovation platform basically
companies take advantage of AWS to
create innovative new offerings and it's
really fostered a whole range of
applications and uses that people are
developing remarkable new offerings
let's go really quickly into the
services and here's a screenshot of its
splash page for all of its services you
see at the length top it says you see in
DBS services just look across this
there's must be 40 or 50 different
services all of them a Lego
a Lego that you can take and assemble to
what you want to do a very wide range of
services very rich we're gonna walk
through them so I'm not gonna go into
detail now but this gives you a sense of
the richness of services that people
leverage and treat AWS is an innovation
platform what are some examples well air
B&amp;amp;B air B&amp;amp;B has been on AWS since its
start and you can see the kind of
incredible growth that it's achieved and
what's been great for air B&amp;amp;B is they
were able to always turn to AWS and say
we need more resources we need more
capacity we need more capability and AWS
made it available and that's really
powered Airbnb growing as dramatically
as it has here's another example Netflix
in some senses Netflix is almost like
the quintessential example the canonical
example the poster child for AWS Netflix
originally started off it was just like
every other kind of company it had its
own data centers its own computers and
it was always running into problems
things weren't available things broke
down it when it was growing it couldn't
get the capacity on line fast enough and
so they explored using AWS and they
began to migrate all their systems to it
and in fact all of the video that you've
if you've ever used Netflix and stream
video you've used AWS and this gives you
an idea of the kind of growth
Netflix has achieved the left-most chart
shows its global audience you can see
how rapidly it's grown and it's kind of
accelerating now and they've always been
able to do that on AWS their earnings
and revenue here you can see their
revenue very steep growth all based on
resources they run in AWS and then of
course it's on the right-hand side this
is what's been good for Netflix in terms
of stock price Netflix owners been very
successful
Netflix runs a hundred percent of their
stuff in AWS and they do that despite
AWS Amazon running its own video service
that competes with Netflix Netflix has
evaluated the situation and said there
may be a competitive service but we get
good service from AWS they're always
ready to support us we don't have
another alternative that we can look at
that would provide as much functionality
we're happy to embrace a team us so that
gives you an example well your next
question might be well that's fine but
my business isn't anything like Airbnb
or Netflix I worked on a mainstream
enterprise well mainstream enterprises
are adopting Netflix's sorry database
just as well
here's Ge Ge founded in 1892 by Thomas
Edison its revenues huge company 124
billion dollars in 2017 and GE has made
a huge push into digital services
digital businesses particularly around
so-called Internet of Things so all of
their machinery all of their devices
they build they're starting to build
smarts in them that can throw off
metrics and so forth and they're
actually offering that platform to other
companies as an innovation platform
itself so that other companies that have
similar types businesses want to build
products that throw off metrics and so
forth can leverage the GE platform well
they were going down the road of
building their own platform running it
in their own data centers running on
their own infrastructure and over the
last few months they've had a rethink
and as you can see this leftmost
headline says shifting the strategy for
its 12 billion dollar of digital
business and the new GE chief confirms a
narrow or focus for the US
your cloud and what you see here is the
bottom is snippet from a article that
says it now plans to operate the
software and services its building which
is this predict system this platform
it's gonna offer to its to companies
like it are now going to write it in
Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure
to save money originally I melt who is
the old CEO had pushed for GE to build
his own datacenters facilities worldwide
and then a few weeks ago a new CEO said
this is crazy
Amazon and Microsoft has already built
at the basis of billions of dollars why
are we building our own datacenters when
they run them better than us so even
mainstream enterprises the the biggest
of the big the oldest of the old are
embracing AWS Amazon itself uses AWS
this is basis on Amazon Prime day July
11th 2017 and here's some numbers that
were called upon from AWS by Amazon on
that day it built 31,000 cloud formation
stacks cloud formation something we're
going to cover in the course is
basically a template to build a complex
application topology and the AWS prime
day required 31,000 of them EBS which is
elastic block storage another service
will cover of course transferred 50 to
petabytes of data and that's
transferring information like order
status or information about pricing
whatever it might be
52 petabytes a huge amount of data AWS
is written on top of api's everything in
the system runs on api's and amazon
services during Amazon Prime day made
419 million API calls
EBS IO request these are data transfer
requests into or out of the elastic
block storage 835 million of them and
then dynamodb which is a type of storage
type of database that AWS offers and we
come
three point four trillion DynamoDB costs
three point four trillion times Amazon
called in to the Amazon ecommerce system
called into AWS dynamodb the most
remarkable thing about this to my mind
isn't all of this incredible resource
usage which is very impressive
is what's most remarkable is no other
customer even noticed this
there was nobody calling up nope you
know Netflix didn't say gosh we can't
serve up any video Airbnb didn't say we
can't take any reservations nothing like
that this was a blip on the radar that
gives you an idea of the kind of scale
that amazon has and we're gonna talk
about that here just a sec here are some
numbers 14 that's the number of top CSPs
AWS has more capacity that Gartner which
is a large analyst firm did a study and
they said AWS has more capacity than the
next 14 competitors combined combined
that's how much capacity AWS has a
device has well over a million customers
there's a million different customers
using AWS services it has over three
million servers in its data centers that
are spread across the world every month
the marketplace partners you need to be
US and that's that rich ecosystem I was
talking about all of these other
services that are that are there every
month over 300 million hours of those
services gets run so in other words
people are taking advantage of those
services 300 million hours worth every
month and then 18 billion dollars is the
annual AWS revenue as of now and that's
growing by the way forty four percent a
year so huge growth rate associated with
that eighteen billion dollars that gives
you an idea of the kind of scale that
Amazon is operating at
this next chart is a little bit about
this revenant growth as I said you can
see how fast it's growing and it's
around the forty percent per year
year-over-year so q3 seventeen was four
point five seven that's about forty
forty two percent greater than q3 of
2016 and likewise enormous growth that
reflects how many people are adopting
AWS so in conclusion the way people are
leveraging Amazon for innovation and
revenue is because it's innovation
platform it enables of new things that
it really couldn't ever do before the
combination of service richness low cost
the enormous growth the availability of
resources means that it's used by every
size and type of business and it's
something that your company or you can
take advantage of as well in fact I use
AWS to run my own website and depend on
it every day to make my information my
posts my company information available
that's the end of this lesson when
you're ready you can go on to the next
one and learn about certifications hello
and welcome to this lesson this lesson
is about this course and in it I'm going
to describe how the course is made up
what portions it has and also I'm going
to cover all the sections in it so you
get an idea of what the content of the
course is how it will be organized and
what you can expect it to cover well in
terms of the course contents it very
much follows the udemy model there are
sections and sections are a major topic
area and it's aligned with the solution
architect associate certification
organization what does that mean well
that means that each section covers one
of the large portions of the solution
architect associate certification
occasionally there's more than one
section devoted to a topic because it's
large enough that it really can't be
covered in just one section each section
is set up as it says here is to set up
to be about ten lessons and some
sections required more than 10 lessons
some of the topics and so there might be
multiple sections devoted to a certain
topic so for example s3 covers a couple
of sections there are 18 sections in the
course and I'll describe them in the
next slide in terms of what the lessons
are well lessons are made up of slides
so there'll be some slide discussion
slide sharing but they'll also be follow
along exercises so I'll be demonstrating
how you do something in AWS and I'll ask
you to follow along as I go through it
so I'll go and do something at the AWS
management console like perhaps in s3
create a bucket and I'd like you to
follow along with that as well I'll tell
you when there follow along I'll ask you
to join me at the management console
that's your clue to go ahead and login
and follow what I do and do it yourself
there are hands-on activities so at the
end of a section I'll say okay now I'm
going to set a task or a an activity
I'll describe it I'll say this is what
your to do and then I'll pause the video
that I'm recording and I'll allow you to
go off and do that activity so you would
pause the video you'd go do the activity
and then you when you're done you'd
start the video up again and watch me
walk through it as well there are exam
tips in the section so here's what to
look for on the solution architects
associate certification exam here's the
kinds of questions you should be think
about for this particular topic from
this section and each lesson is around
10 minutes some may run longer but
around 10 minutes that way there's never
any sense of gosh is dragging on and
taking forever all right let's talk
about the actual sections here's a table
that contains them and you'll see
section 1 the introduction section 2
course setup there's an 80s overview and
then it gets into the meat and potatoes
of the abuse services so you can see
there's a couple of sections devoted to
object storage s3 glacier and cloud
front then there's another set
on the on-prem services and these are
services that AWS offers that are
actually installed in a user's data
center so kind of a little bit
unexpected or a little bit unusual
perhaps most people think of AWS is
being a cloud-based solution that's
located in database data centers but
there are some on premise services will
cover them I am which is identity
management and also this covers some
identity services that a DBS supports
that revolve around Federation with
external ID services or alternative ID
services running within AWS we then have
three full sections on EC to EC 2 is the
Elastic Compute cloud it is the core
computing capability within a DBMS it's
a very large part of it nearly
everyone's use and we're gonna cover
that in detail in three sections then we
have route 53 which is in abysus dns
service databases database offers a
number of database options these are
managed databases this isn't about how
you install a database of your own
choice on to an AWS ec2 instance this is
about the database services that Avis
offers VPC is the virtual private cloud
that is the core architectural construct
within which computing resources are
installed very important a very big part
of the exam we'll cover that in detail
in a section there are application
services that are services they can be
used as part of a diverse applications
system services this is a phrase that I
use in the official study guide they
refer to them as key services which I
find kind of confusing because a couple
of the services have the name key in
them so key services and then you're
gonna do individual key services
I think that's confusing I call it
system services but these are services
that aren't really devoted to developing
applications or writing applications but
they're about how do you manage your use
of AWS how do you manage things at the
account level we'll talk about systems
there's a course project a real hands-on
where you do a deep dive into building
an application in the 80s environment
and this is gonna be a fault-tolerant
WordPress site WordPress is an ideal
software product or software package to
use because it has very rich
functionality
it's very extensible it integrates well
with AWS and it integrates well to
explore a number of the different
capabilities within AWS that can
dynamically affect the way the
application is deployed and operating
we're gonna explore all of those very
exciting project I hope you'll enjoy it
the well architected framework is a set
of best practices that AWS proposes
around how to design and deploy
applications this is a really important
part you'll see in the section on the a
DBA certification exam that they've now
made the well architect framework a core
part of the new version of the exam that
they're creating the new version of
certification which is in beta right now
but I believe will become the default
way it's delivered or the new version
and cover that there's also a couple of
lessons in there about security and risk
and compliance which is another part of
the certification very important and
then the final section is about
preparing for the certification exam so
you'll leave the course ready to pass
the certification exam on your first try
that's a course overview now you know
what you're going to be seeing when you
take all of the lessons and when you're
ready let's go ahead and jump right into
it hello and welcome to this lesson it's
an activity to create a study plan a
study plan is a foundation of success
with this course and so I want to
encourage you to create one and I'm
gonna walk you to the process of how to
do so and I just said really a study
plan can help you succeed you know if
you don't have a destination any
direction will do so creating a plan on
where you want to go and how you get
there will focus your efforts and raise
your success rate
and a written plan is likely to do that
even more so so you can use the
downloadable study plan to map your
journey so I've created a document I'm
going to walk you through how to use it
and then I've created a blank one that
you can download and use for your own
study plan as an input you should accept
assess your skills and available time so
everyone who takes his course will have
some some experience some amount of
skills some more than others
and it's important to understand what
you bring to the table as you as you
start the course because if you are
quite new to technical work and quite
new to AWS you might have to perhaps
watch videos more than once which is a
great thing about this course because
you can go through them as many times
you need or you can stop them or back
them up and go through the material of a
particular section a particular part I
mean a second time but assess your
skills and the available time you know
if you are extremely busy you'll have
less time to devote if you're fitting
this in and you have a different kind of
a schedule maybe your student or work
part-time you might have more available
time that will enable you to accelerate
your progress and then I counsel people
to follow a sign field methodology you
might say what is the Seinfeld
methodology just wait and you'll find
out so here's a draft project plan you
could put together then I've put
together as a an example and this
follows about a 45 minute per day
commitment to the course and would get
you through about three lessons per day
with an average lesson being around 10
minutes and you can see that this has
you completing the course in 10 weeks
and this will take you from the very
beginning which is where we're at now
all the way through to the end and get
you prepared for this certification exam
now as you have more time you'll be able
to get through this more quickly and
you'll note that I've
put this forward as being six days with
one day completely off well if you
wanted to vote a seventh day to it you'd
be able to bring the termination date
closer and if you wanted to spend more
time and particularly if you're someone
who has a couple of days off each week a
weekend or something like that you could
probably devote more time on those days
and that would also bring the final date
forward but this is just an example of
how you go through it and what I would
encourage you to do is take the blank
one and put together your plan put
together what you think you will to get
through is it three lessons per day six
lessons per day whatever it might be
plan against that and you'll have a
complete you can look in the actual
listing of the course of the courses and
the videos to see how many lessons there
are per section so you'll get a sense of
how long it will take to get to a
section by how many lessons you will
only do per day let's talk about the
Seinfeld plan well when Jerry Seinfeld
wasn't a famous and highly successful
comedian with a long-running highly
successful TV series Berlin his career
he was starting out comedian he was you
know just beginning from scratch much
like all of you are starting this course
and the thing I've commuting needs to do
is create material create jokes create
funny situations and early in his career
like any comedians career you don't have
someone you can pay for that you don't
have enough money to be buying jokes or
anything like that you have to do it
yourself you have to write your own
material and what Jerry Seinfeld would
do is he made a commitment I'm gonna
write material every day and so he put a
calendar up and every day that he wrote
material he'd put an X through it and
then he'd get to a place where he was oh
I've got ten X's in a row that would be
an incentive to do the eleventh and the
twelfth he wouldn't want to break the
string and I would encourage you to do
that print out your study plan and go
ahead and every day that you
put go forth and do that day's
activities put an X through it and then
pretty soon you'll have something like
this a whole string of X's you'll say
gosh I'm making real progress I don't
want to break that string I'm gonna make
sure and that will provide maybe a
little bit more motivation a little bit
more commitment for that date so follow
the Seinfeld plan all right so what
should you do well download the blank
study plan is here is a course resource
estimate your skills and available time
as kind of an input but don't feel bound
by that you know if you say well gosh my
skills aren't as high as maybe I feel
that they should be or somebody else I
know don't worry about it a lot of this
and certainly the Seinfeld plan is
exercise commitment be motivated and
motivation can get you through an awful
lot and make up for weaknesses so s
tonight your skills in particular your
available time create a schedule make it
concrete in other words make it I'm
gonna get through this much on this day
this much on this day this much on the
next day and then start today I can't
have sighs enough just getting started
just getting that first X will put you
on the road to success all right with
that that brings us to the end of the
study plan I encourage you to go ahead
and download the blank one fill it out
and then get started with the next
lesson
