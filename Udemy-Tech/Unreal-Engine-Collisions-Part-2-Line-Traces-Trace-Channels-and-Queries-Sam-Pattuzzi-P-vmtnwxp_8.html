going to be looking at how we can make
collisions interact with the environment
allow us to query our environment around
us and figure out whether we can see an
object whether it's hidden behind
another whether it's hidden behind bush
for example brush brush what's the word
for that and whether we are able to
shoot at it most interestingly in our
example so how is that gonna work well
in our example we are going to be
putting together this little spaceship
here this spaceship dude who is going to
fire us when we come out into the open
so this is part two of my series on
unreal and collisions so we're going to
be looking at how these trace channels
work again it's going to be helpful if
you've watched part one and it will be
helpful if you've done some unreal
before but don't sweat it if you haven't
you can just follow along and see how
things are done in unreal if you're
interested so without further ado let's
dive right in so hopefully you'll
remember that this is where we left the
project we had a example map and this
blue block that we can shoot through and
this great block that we cannot shoot
through so what we want to do next is
add in a piece of enemy AI like we had
in the example project now typically the
way to do this in unreal is with the
type of blueprint called an AI
controller so let's go ahead and
navigate to a Content directory then to
twin-stick BP and then into the
blueprints directory there where we're
going to add a new blueprint for the
enemy AI and this enemy AI is going to
I'm going to click add new and I'm gonna
go to blueprint class and we have to
select under the all classes drop-down
we search for the AI controller class
it's not in the default classes select
the AI controller hit select and then we
can rename this blueprint I'm gonna call
it at the enemy AI controller that does
what it says on the tin kind of name now
what we can do with this AI controller
is we can go ahead and
open it up by default it opens up into a
separate window we can drag that tab and
dock it to the main window for us
automatically this is where we're going
to put the logic for our AI now let's
just check that this is working we can
go to our event graph tab in the central
section where we've got the main
blueprints for this AI controller we can
check it's working by going to my begin
play node pulling off a new node and
creating a print string node here which
is just gonna say hello that's fine as a
default go ahead and hit save and if we
go ahead and play well notice that that
string doesn't get printed on the screen
nor if you f8 out to get you out of your
control and out of the control of the
game go to the output log then you can
see the hello isn't printed in the
output log either so we can stop playing
the game with the stop button at the top
right and what is the problem well
there's no enemy AI for it to possess
yet so we need to go ahead and drop a
new enemy in to the scene where do we do
that well we can go back to our content
browser you can see we have a twin-stick
porn we can go and drag that twin-stick
porn somewhere into the scene and if we
go ahead and hit play now and f8 out go
to our output log hmm still nothing so
what's going on here well the porn needs
to know what its default AI is so we
need to go stop go to our content
browser and open up the twin-stick porn
blueprint as well this brings up a new
tab and what we can do here is in the
details pane at the right we can go down
to where we have the AI controller class
and by default this is an AI controller
but we want to change this to the AI
control that we've created the enemy AI
controller which if I save and compile
should show up in that list let's go
back to the list hmm yes there it is ai
control I probably just missed it the
first time so we're gonna go ahead and
save and compile that go back to the map
and hit play and this time you can see
it's printed on the screen in green text
I'm sorry in blue text for a very short
amount of time it says hello so the
enemy AI can
troller is being created and it's begin
play event is being cool so I'm gonna go
ahead and delete this print string node
because it's not actually serving as any
useful purpose and what we're gonna do
is instead on every tick I ever eat
every frame we are going to be checking
whether we can see or not see our AI and
then we'll print a message based on that
and I'm in a play so for checking this
line of sight we need a tool called line
tracing now what is line tracing exactly
I find the easiest way to think of it is
like a laser beam so imagine we have a
setup with a wall and an object hidden
behind the wall and we want to see
whether we from over here on the left
can see the object behind the wall you
can imagine that we just shoot a laser
beam and see whether we can see the
object now if we are able to pass
through this wall it doesn't block us
then we'll be able to see the object the
laser beam essentially goes through so
this is the case where the walls
response to this laser beam is an
overlap response also the same will
happen in the ignore case we don't get
events from these crises so they're
effectively the same but the difference
is when the walls response to the laser
beam is to block it because then we will
not see the object the line trace will
not reach its destination and that is
what we're interested in we want to be
able to get that kind of binary decision
whether we can see the object of whether
we can't see the object so we need to do
a line trace and fortunately blueprint
is very easy to discover how things work
you can just bring off a pin and then go
and search and we're going to look for
the words line trace now what we
actually want here is a line trace by
channel so channel is the thing that the
object chooses to respond to or not
respond to in fact we saw them in the
last lecture but we brushed over them
for the time being so let's go and have
another look if we go and have a look at
one of the obstacles in our scene so I'm
gonna have a look at obstacle 2 and if
we go down to its collision section it's
set to default so it's a little bit
tricky let's actually have a look
instead
at the permeable wall and we'll look at
its drop down now you can see here that
we had those object responses in the
matrix and we understand roughly how
those work but what about the tracer
responses now these are what are known
as trace channels and we can set up our
very own trace channel if we want to
we've got visibility we've got camera
but let's go and create a new one this
is the same way as you would create an
object type by the way we can go to
settings project settings and then we go
into collision just as before and you
can see that there are these two
different categories the objects
channels and the trace channels we're
going to go for a new trace Channel and
we're going to call this one let's see
shootable because it is the response to
a query of whether something is suitable
or not and we're going to just go with
the default response that any object
blocks this suitable Channel I'll go
ahead and accept that but obviously we
don't want just any object to block this
and we're going to come back to that in
just a second but first I'm going to
show you how we can set up the query so
we're going to go to the enemy AI
controller blueprint and you can see
there are a few input nodes that we need
into the line tracer by channel we need
a start location we need an end location
that's very much as we've seen on the
slides here the beginning of the laser
beam and the end of the laser beam in
this case the end of the laser beam
wants to be the thing that we want to
see if we can see it or not then we get
the trace channel here and then there's
some other stuff which we can safely
ignore there's things like actors to
ignore and so on and so forth whether to
ignore the current actor so if you hit
yourself it doesn't actually count that
sort of thing and then you'll see that
there are some output nodes and the
return value which is whether anything
was hit on the way or whether nothing
was hit which is going to be very
important to us we're going to want to
know that we're also going to want to
know we may want to know but we don't in
this case sometimes we want to know what
object it hit instead of getting to the
endpoint anyway let's move on so we want
to work out a start and an end well the
start position is just going to be the
position of the enemy
so in the enemy AI control the way to do
that is get hold of the pawn that we are
controlling so I'll right-click and
we're searching for the words kind of
controlled pawn so we've got a get
controlled pawn excellent that's what we
want
then from get control pawn we want to
get its location so let's have a look
for location I happen to know its
location not position that tends to help
the thing we're looking for is to get
actor location and you can see that it's
giving us the color coding to help out
it's yellow so it matches with that pin
because it's a position or a location in
unreal speak okay and now what do we
want to do we want to get the player
porn where we can get hold of the player
pawn in very much a similar way so we're
gonna do the player and I think it will
be let's say go up a little bit get
player pawn that's the one player index
we don't have a multiplayer game so
index 0 will be the first and only
player and then we can drag off there
and do the get actor location to get the
location of the player that the enemy is
going to shoot at and that's going to be
the end of the line trace okay so now
what we're going to do is drag off from
the execution pin and just do a little
bit of printing so see print string and
in fact we'll want to do this
differently depending on whether our
return value is true or false so we can
do that by dragging off there from the
return value and doing something called
a branch a branch basically goes two
ways with the execution flow depending
on truth or false values so let's go
through the branch after our line trace
by Channel and if it's true we are going
to print that something was hit like so
and if it's not true then we'll say
print clear line something like that so
we'll compile that save go back to my
map and hit play you can see that
something was hit something was hit
something was hit and that seems to be
all I'm seeing but that could be because
the local messages haven't cleared off
the screen yet but it isn't actually
what's going on here is something is
being hit so let's try and figure out
what exactly is being hit we can do this
by dragging our out hits in fact let's
do something clever let's right-click on
our hit we can do this smart strict
trick of the splitting the struct pin
which tells us what that pin was
actually composed of and we can get
let's see they're all prefixed without
we don't need to worry about that but
the hit actor that's interesting what
actor did we actually hit I'm going to
go and drag that into our print of in
the true case and we're going to see
what we actually are hitting mm-hmm so
that's interesting we're actually
hitting the floor now why is this if we
f8 out we will probably see why because
our enemy spaceship is somewhere
slightly underground so if I click on
the spaceship and drag them above the
floor then you see that we get a clear
line to the enemy so let's go ahead and
stop and you'll notice a spaceship gets
put back in its place let's bring them
both the ground so we can get a clear
line and go ahead and hit play ok so
we've got a clear line and if I go and
hide behind the obstacle it says
obstacle three is what's being hit by
hide behind obstacle one then obstacle
one is being hit and so on and so forth
so this is definitely working its line
tracing shooting the laser it's an
invisible laser we can't actually see it
but it tells us whether we've got a
clear line to the subject we want to
shoot at or not ok so this is looking
actually really good now I'm quite
pleased with the fact that we've got
some trigger colliders going in but we
do need to make it fire which is what we
promised at the beginning of the lecture
so that's what we're gonna do next is
going to actually make the firing
now this is going to use some
complicated blueprint nodes but mostly
you should be able to follow along don't
worry if they're things that you
wouldn't have thought of doing yourself
you can just follow along and see the
logic that I'm putting into place to
achieve this and we're also gonna need
to make sure that the trace visibility
is being reacted to in the correct way
as we saw the obstacle three the one
that should allow bullets through that
is permeable was blocking the line so
we're gonna need to fix that as well so
let's dive back in and make sure that's
all fixed so let's start off with making
it actually fire and then we'll see the
problem really very clearly so I'm gonna
go into the enemy AI controller and
instead of doing printing we're going to
want to do the firing instead so I'm
actually going to go ahead and create a
little function that makes it really
clear that what we're trying to do is
fire so in this case it's when there is
a clear line so from the false branch
we're going to go ahead and fire to do
this I'm going to create a new function
that's in the my blueprint tab over on
the Left go to plus on the function and
we're going to call it fire like so so
I'm gonna go back to the event graph
false I'm gonna drag off a pin and call
the fire function now we can do our
dirty work inside that okay so here we
are inside the fire function and from
here what I want to do is get hold of
the porn the porn that we're controlling
to call its fire function so to do that
we're going to again get the controlled
porn just like we did before so
controlled porn
get controlled porn and then we need to
this could be a porn of any type but we
know that this enemy AI controller is
only controlling pawns of type
twin-stick porn so we need to do
something called a cast don't worry too
much if you don't know what a cast is
and we're going to cast to a twin-stick
porn this just makes sure that we have a
pawn of type twin-stick porn which means
that we can interact with it as a
twin-stick porn if you look at the
twin-stick porn you can see that it has
a function called fire shot that's why
we need to cast we
to be able to call that fire shot
function okay so we're gonna call fire
shot there you go very very easy when
we've already done the cast if you try
doing that without the cast by the way
it really just would not work next up we
need a direction what's that direction
going to be well we've got a handy
little node that will give us the
direction from one location to another
and that is called get unit Direction
vector so let's right click and look for
get unit directions actor now don't
worry if you don't know what vectors are
they're basically a position and XYZ but
they can also be a direction so we are
going to do it from the location of our
current player and actually we've done
this before so we've got this get the
actor location of control porn we've got
the location of the player porn I'm
going to wrap these up into a little
function so I'm just going to select
these two nodes right click them
collapse into a function and I'm going
to call this our location like so I can
actually turn this into a node without
needing execution flow just by checking
off pure which is very neat because I
know I know it's pure because everything
inside was green didn't have an
execution flow so we don't need it now
let's do the same thing with the player
porn collapse to function
rename it to player location and also do
the same thing with checking of pure in
the detail pane okay
so now we can use those in our fire so
the from is going to be our location the
two is going to be player location like
so and that should just about do the
trick let's go ahead and hit play there
you go is firing it as but it stops
firing it as when we're behind the blue
obstacle which gives us a bit of an
advantage because we can now fire at the
enemy and that's not great okay so we
want to be able to own we want it to be
able to fire us when it is behind when
we are only hidden behind something that
is a permeable wall how do we do that we
go to a settings menu
to the project settings then we go to a
collision and we are going to look at
the preset for the permeable wall let's
go and find that preset I think it's
someone at the bottom scroll to the
bottom there's permeable wall and what
we want to do is choose the collision
response to that shootable trace type
and with a permeable wall as we know it
should be overlap or ignore so we're
going to go ahead and accept that change
to the preset gonna close down the
settings and hit play now so hopefully
now we shouldn't be able to hide behind
the wall sadly we still are the reason
being if we go to our enemy AR
controller we set up that trace channel
but in our event graph you'll notice
that we didn't change the trace Channel
that's still on the trace channel of
visibility if we go and select the
shootable trace Channel then it will use
the responses to that channel instead of
the visibility Channel we can go ahead
compile save go over and play and it's
not quite working
okay so let's debug this in the
following way we're going to go in to
the enemy AI controller and on the yes
branch of having hit something we're
going to do the printing again so we're
going to go and print out a string and
we're going to print out again what
actor have we hit so that we can figure
out why this is hitting something let's
go ahead and hit play and you'll notice
that it's saying it's hitting the
twin-stick porn number two okay so
that's a bit of a problem we've got that
it's hitting the porn itself now what's
the reason for this I thought we were
ignoring ourself we've got this checkbox
on line trace by channel and it seems to
be saying that we're ignoring ourselves
well yes we are we're ignoring the enemy
AI controller but we're not ignoring the
twin-stick pawn to actor so what we have
to do in this case is make sure that our
line trace simply ignores all porn types
that's going to be the easiest solution
you could do it another way you could
make sure that we ignore certain actors
but I'm gonna do it this way it's
simpler from where I'm standing anyway
so let's go to the project settings to
the collision section which we're now
familiar with and go into the presets
and find the presets for the porn now
with the presets for the porn we're
gonna go and find the shootable and you
can see the visibility trace had ignore
so we're gonna have ignore just like the
visibility trace go ahead and accept
that change and then we are going to be
hopefully golden let's go ahead and hit
play yes we're getting shot at which is
always a good thing and we are basically
constantly getting shots out which is
good even when we are behind of the blue
wall which is transparent essentially
for projectiles but when we behind
obstacle one we don't get shot at great
a little bit of tidy up now just to
remove that debugging print statements
which we don't need and at least not
when we're running the game so we can go
ahead and remove that and we are done
so congratulations we have figured out
triggers object systems all that crazy
stuff and how the collision system
interacts with those traces and we've
been able to obviously make some AI
shoot errors which has been really quite
cool in the next video we're going to be
learning how to hang little gameplay
events off things like collisions and
overlaps so that we could for example
trigger sound effects and basically
anything else that you'd ever want to
trigger in a game so bear with me for
that one and thumbs up if you like this
