about programming is you need to know
how computers work and we're gonna gain
a little bit of an understanding behind
how computers work and why you always
see zeros and ones when you see things
about technology and computer that's why
like what all those zeros ones represent
and so here's a some of the takeaways
that you're gonna get in this video here
you're gonna learn about circuits and
switches you're gonna learn about coding
schemes you're gonna learn about binary
digits which are also known as bits
you're gonna learn about 2 to the power
band you're gonna learn the five
generations of computer as Moore's Law
bits bytes kilobytes megabytes gigabytes
terabytes like how all those
measurements translate down to zeros and
ones or binary digits and you'll learn
what machine language is and so here is
the basics of how computers work so a
computer is basically like your porch
light on Halloween so your porch light
on Halloween it's a single light bulb
and it can store and convey two pieces
of information and those two pieces of
information are if the light is on in
America when we have Halloween
if the porch light is on it means come
trick-or-treat at this house and if the
porch light is off it means don't come
trick-or-treat at this house go away
excuse me and so those two those two
messages are stored and conveyed by a
single light bulb
well that light bulb is a circuit or a
switch right we could turn the switch on
the light is on we could turn the switch
or the circuit off the light is off and
so based upon a single circuit or switch
we were able to store and convey two
pieces of information and if it's on
come trick-or-treating if it's off go
away and so those those two pieces of
information that's known as a coding
scheme a coding scheme and so a circuit
or a switch in a certain state if it's
on it means one thing if it's off it
means something else that's basically
what a computer is right and instead of
just having a single circuit or switch a
single light bulb so to speak right it
might have 20 billion and so we could
arrange
those and different arrangements have on
or off so that's all computers ours like
a bunch of circuits and switches in an
on/off state and if we had you know this
arrangement of on/off it represents the
letter A maybe the coding scheme is B
that's being used as for text or if we
had this arrangement of on/off it
represents the color blue right and so
we could store all these pieces of
information just like we could store and
convey you know whether or not you could
trick-or-treat here or not
trick-or-treat here come trick-or-treat
it's on don't trick-or-treat here it's
off you know we could have like you know
series of circuit switches in some
arrangement of on/off and and that
represents you know the color blue and
the coding scheme would just say hey
when you're looking at these circuits in
an on/off state that's blue and when
you're looking at these circuits you
know that's the letter A and so we store
stuff and then we say this is stored as
a JPEG and image file or this is stored
as a text file so when you open it up
there's a certain way to read it and we
use different coding schemes to
interpret the arrangement of on/off
circuits and instead of saying on/off
all the time we say one means on and
zero means off so we could just write
zeros and ones instead of writing the
circuit is on the circuit is off you
could also say the circuit is open the
circuit is closed so it's all about
circuits just like a porch light on
Halloween and that's the fundamental
some how a computer works and so we'll
just kind of explore that here a little
bit and this is the presentation that I
give when I'm teaching at the college in
the university but you know first and
foremost computers run on electricity
electricity has two discrete States on
and off and if you have one light like
porch light on Halloween right you could
create a coding scheme and say hey if
the lights on come trick or treat or
come in if the lights off go away if you
have two lights you could convey four
messages they're both on they're both
off this one's on that one's off or vice
versa right so we could create a coding
scheme for that so if I took two porch
lights I can let everybody who's pass in
my house know if they knew my coding
scheme if there are my friends hey if my
circuit switches are in this arrangement
of
it means this or it means that and if
they had the coding scheme they would
know what was going on based upon the
arrangement of the circuit switches on
my porch right the two lights on or off
so if we had three right they could all
be off they could all be on or they
could be various combinations and so the
formula that we use there is two to the
power of n/2 because there's two states
on or off and to the power of n so if we
had three lights it'd be two to the
power of three two to the power of three
and that would be two times two times
two which is two four eight so we have
eight possibilities one two three four
five six seven eight if we had eight
light bulbs on this porch would be 2 to
the power of 8 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256
like those numbers start to sound like
computer numbers right like 2 4 8 16 32
64 128 256 512 1024 like those are
numbers you hear associate with
computers because it's binary it's 2 to
the power of n and so that's that's
basically how computers work and instead
of writing off and on we just write
zeros for off and one for on and we
could also instead of it being you know
kind of whimsical like bring pizza we
could also associate it with letters of
the alphabet like this arrangement of on
and off means this letter and so then we
could do like here's a little quiz for
you what is what are the zeros and ones
on the right spell and so there's my B
there's my a there's my D there's my see
there's my a there's my B bad cap it's
all I could come up with with the first
eight letters right so that's a that's
that's how computers work and computers
first stored so there's different
generations of computers when we talk
about computers and they first stored
those on off States with different
technology and so the first generation
computers used vacuum tubes to store an
on off state a vacuum tube could store a
single on/off state that was like in the
40s and the early 50s and the first
computer the ENIAC the UNIVAC had like
18,000 vacuum tubes so not that many
circuits which could be in an on/off
state and then transistors came along
and I'm just looking to see if I have a
picture I don't
transistors were a lot smaller here's
what a vacuum tube looks like vacuum
tube all right so those are those are
vacuum tubes and then transistors came
along and I'm gonna just compare that to
vacuum tube versus transistor so we
could see the difference and and so here
is like you know here is like oh that's
a really good one I like this old photo
here here's a vacuum tube and here is a
transistor right here's another one
vacuum vacuum tube and transistor like
significantly smaller more stable more
reliable runs cooler interestingly Grace
Hopper Grace Hopper you know she was one
of the original female programmers and
the Maas would fly into the computers
with vacuum tubes and then die and so
they'd have to go debug the computer and
pull the bugs out like that's where
debugging a computer came from that's
pretty cool so the first generations
vacuum tubes then transistors and then
we had integrated circuits and so
integrated circuits
you know they printed a silicon wafer
let's look at that they printed them on
silicon wafer chips and so here's a
image of that and the silicon wafer
chips if you look closely at that image
and let me just view more and get a
large one here tools size large I just
want a large awesome and you can see
here even in this one and in that one
each of these are broken into squares
right each of those little squares
they'd cut that out off the silicon
wafer and that would be one chip that
would be put into like you know some
hardware CPU or something like that and
so those silicon wafers have a bunch of
circuits which could be an on/off States
and that's the amazing accomplishment of
technology we went from vacuum tubes
which are pretty big to transistors
which are smaller to integrated circuits
or chips on silicon wafers which is
about the size of your thumbnail and on
that thumbnail you could store you know
and here's the list back in 1971 2300
circuits in an off state and you know in
2008
two billion and if we google current
current circuit circuit current silica
current integrated circuit circuit count
I don't know
integrated circuit integrated circuit
I'm just looking to see transistor count
this is what I'm looking for
so transistor count this one goes up to
2011 and it's 2.8 billion 2.6 billion
and I'm just looking for current current
counts yeah microprocessor 1974 and then
we're up to here in 2017 nineteen point
two billion so nineteen billion two
hundred million circuits little switches
little circuits that could be in an
on/off state on something the size of
your thumbnail roughly speaking that's
amazing
I was like amazing nineteen billion and
so with that we could store a lot of
on-off stuff like okay all these years
ones represent this color and we're
gonna store 50 million of those to
restore this image it's like okay cool
we could totally do that we've got a ton
of processing power available a ton of
circuits and switches that can be stored
into on/off state so that's how that's
how computers work that's the generation
of computers Moore's law is that the
processing power of technology doubles
every 18 months 18 to 20 months meaning
the transistor count doubles every 18 to
20 months there's Gordon Moore one of
the founders Intel Intel stands for
integrated Intel integrated electronics
not intelligence and there's a little
terminology disambiguation so you could
read that you know circuit switches
transistors and gate circuits in so you
could just read through that if you like
and there's that 2 to the N thing right
to the 1 2 to the 2 2 to 3 to the 4 and
a little problem if you want to try it
if you had 16 lights how many messages
can be stored you could pause this video
try 2 to the power of 16 it's going to
give you that and 2 to the power of 32
is gonna give you that
and a bit is a binary digit so binary by
bicycle biplane to binary 0 1 2 binary
right binary digit is abbreviated as a
bit so when you hear about bits you're
talking about those zeros and ones and
we can measure bits by having one bit or
8 bits it's called a byte or a thousand
and 24 to route it bytes as a kilobyte
but I just round that to a thousand but
technically it's a thousand 24 cuz
that's 2 times 2 times 2 times whatever
thousand 24 but a thousand bytes is a
kilobyte thousand kilobytes is a
megabyte a thousand megabytes is a
gigabyte a thousand gigabytes is a
terabyte and so now you could say oh I
have a terabyte drive and you know
exactly how many zeros and ones can be
stored on that drive you could kind of
just you know go back like if it's a you
know megabyte that stores a whole lot a
whole lot
so a megabyte let's do that one I just
didn't want to do the math I think it's
a million always associated million in
my head so terabyte is 1,024 times 1,024
times 1,024 1,024 times 8 and if it was
a gigabyte was 2 1 1 megabyte will do a
megabyte 1 megabyte is equal to 1024
kilobytes manna kilobyte is equal to
1,024 bytes and a byte is equal to that
so that would be a million because there
are there are your 6 zeros if we had 1
megabyte and a gigabyte would be a
billion zeroes and ones so and then a
terabyte would be a trillion so that's
how that's how we measure stuff all
right the last thing I'll show you is
this so you could pause and read that
right there and then the last thing
which is cool to know is the power
symbol actually represents a 0 and a 1
and the power symbol means you could
turn it on turn it off and you see that
power symbol there but the 0 and the 1
the 0 represents off the 1 represents on
so in the power symbol it's actually 0 1
meaning 0 off 1 on and that's what that
power symbol does is turn things on and
off so that's pretty cool about the
power symbol now it's a little bit about
how computers work I'm just giving like
the total introduction to programming
because you need to understand like
zeros and ones and that that translates
to circuits being in
on off state and that you have coding
schemes so when you have zeros and ones
that could represent a color or text
depending upon what coding scheme is
applied to that and and that's that's
the entire idea behind computers it's
like your porch light on Halloween
multiplied up many billions of times and
we could store a whole bunch of circuits
and on/off states and then just say hey
this storage of those on/off states
represents this stuff with that coding
scheme all right that's how computers
work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
