instructor for the ultimate AWS
solutions architect associate course on
udemy and I'm talking about the most
intriguing product announcements at the
recent AWS reinvent the big AWS
conference and the number two most
intriguing product announcement or
service announcement at Avis reinvent
2015 guard duty guard duty is a very
sophisticated machine learning backed
security offering here's the description
that database gives Amazon guard duties
have managed threat detection service
managed service we're seeing lots of
this as part of the emphasis of reinvent
a managed threat detection service that
continually monitors from malicious or
unauthorized behavior to help you
protect your AWS accounts and workloads
it monitors for activities such as
unusual API calls or potentially
unauthorized deployments that indicate a
possible account compromised guard duty
also detects potentially compromised
instances or reconnaissance by attackers
so it's a sort of a Swiss Army knife of
lots of different kinds of functionality
all devoted to do continuous monitoring
for malicious or unauthorized behavior
so it's an automated persistent service
it's always on it's always running it's
always checking it integrates threat
intelligence feeds so these are feeds
that come from external agencies that
say oh there's been this new kind of
attack or there's been this some kind of
virus has been and at least released
into the computing world guard duty
integrates these feeds and that makes
sure it's always up-to-date so it's
always ready to respond to the latest
kinds of threats it also uses machine
learning to detect anomalous account and
workload activity is the typical use
pattern for this
set of resources heavy use between 9:00
and noon every Monday and then not much
the rest of the work day of the week and
then all of a sudden something a lot of
processing starts happening Thursdays at
2:00 in the morning that's a red flag
and guard duty uses machine learning to
really understand the kinds of usage
patterns for applications and then
identify any anomalous patterns and then
it will set up a an alert or a trigger
to alert someone to respond to it
guard duty incorporates events from
cloud trail VPC flow logs and DNS logs
so basically it's tracking interactions
with resources in the account
environment to identify are there
anomalies and it does that violating at
these three things and it provides
centralized threat detection across all
accounts so it's even if you have
accounts that have very different user
identities or very different payment
mechanisms or very different
applications kind of things you can say
I've got these eight accounts or 20 or
100 I want you to run across all of them
and alert me to any anomalous behavior
or anything that crosses the threat
intelligence that I'm aware of guard
duty is really interesting the machine
learning being married as security is
the latest trend in security it's a
really big deal and guard duty is
therefore the number two most intriguing
product announcement at reinvent
