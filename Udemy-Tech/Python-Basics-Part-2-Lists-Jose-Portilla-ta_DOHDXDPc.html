now it's time to discuss Python lists
lists are ordered sequences that can
hold a variety of object types they use
the same square bracket notation that
we've seen earlier and commas to
separate out objects in a list here we
can see an example of a list of integers
lists support indexing and slicing and
lists can be nested and also have a
variety of useful methods that can be
called off of them let's explore all
these concepts by opening a jupiter
notebook
let's start off by making an example
list we'll say my list and create an
example list of integers something you
want to avoid doing as we've mentioned
the past and choosing variable names is
if you choose the variable name at list
you notice that it's actually
highlighted that means it's a pre
built-in keyword and you don't want to
use that if you accidentally already did
some sort of assignment like list is 1 2
3 what you should do is go to kernel and
then hit restart then make sure you
delete or comment out that line
continuing on notice that we have my
list now here I have a list of integers
but I can also create a list of strings
such as a another string triple-b
another string just a bunch of random
letters or characters and then we see my
list is there as well and also note that
we can have mixed datatypes
so I can have integers floats and then
strings as well all mixed up here and
the list has no problem with that
now let's discuss quickly indexing and
slicing it basically works the exact
same way as in a string well create a
brand new list and we'll have this be a
list of letters we'll say a b c and d
and then if i check out my list i have
the list of letters imagine I wanted to
grab the first item in my list
that's the string a so I can say my list
0 and then that's a if I want to grab a
B and C well let's think about this
I want to grab 0 1 2 and then up to but
not including 3 which means I start at 0
and then go up 2 and don't include 3 and
then I have a list so notice here it
returns back the list subsection now I
want to quickly make a note here that
Python has built-in functions we just
saw that list was actually pre built
into Python as a essentially special
keyword that we're going to use later on
you can use it to transform things into
lists there's a really useful built-in
function called L e n for length and
this allows you to return back the
lengths of objects so if you pass in a
string into this so hello
it's going to return back how many
characters are in that string and
likewise if you pass in a list of this
say my list it's going to return back
how many objects are in that list so you
should also be careful of not wanting to
overwrite Elian with some other
functionality or some other variable now
let's go ahead and move on to discuss
useful list methods we just saw that
strings had methods such as upper and
lower and split and we saw that split
created that list and we've learned a
little bit more about lists so far I
want to discuss methods that can be
called off of a list object to do this
we'll say my list is equal to one two
three and one really useful method is
appending to a list and appending to a
list allows us to add something on to
the end of a list we can say my list dot
a pen and you should be able to tab
autocomplete this if you're not able to
tab autocomplete it it's probably
because you actually haven't ran the
cell that defined my list yet and then a
pen just allows you to append another
item to the end of a list so right now
my list is one two three let's go ahead
and append four to it and then I can
check that my list is now one two three
four if I want to remove an item from
the end of my list I can use the pop
method I will say pop make sure to do
open closed parentheses if you don't
again you just get the report back of
what it is open close parenthesis run
that and notice it returns back the last
item of my list which happens to be four
and this is an in-place method meaning
it actually affects the current variable
in place so if I take a look at my list
again it no longer has that four okay
let's go ahead and append four again one
more time we'll say my list append four
and then we see my list imagine that I
wanted to remove not the last item in my
list but the first item of my list how
can I do that
well pop takes in parameters and later
on we'll see that many methods actually
take in parameters in order to adjust
what the methods going to do
we'll say my list dot pop and I can do
shift-tab
to see the documentation string of this
method and it says back l dot pop and
it's going to remove and return the item
at the index meaning that I can actually
provide an index location to this pop
argument so by default the index is
negative 1 meaning it returns back the
very last item of the list but if you
want to grab the first item you could
say 0 4 index 0 and it pops off the
first item of that list so now that I
see my list I see 2 3 4 and I remove
that first item let's do my list is
equal to 1 2 3 4 one more time here to
show my list again notice that my list
pop is actually returning back this
either first items second item or
whatever you happen to put for the index
if actually wanted to save that item as
a variable what I can do is say my first
item is equal to let's put in some
underscores for snake casing here my
first item is equal to my list dot pop 0
so what is happening here is we're
popping off the first elements in that
list and then we're actually saving it
to my first item so my list no longer
has that number 1 instead we've been
able to save it as my first item this
general idea of methods returning things
are operating in place is sometimes a
little confusing for new recruits and it
takes a little while to build some sort
of intuition about what's going on with
a method and I want to show you a couple
more examples to get an idea of methods
that sometimes don't return anything or
operate in place so let's go ahead and
say my list again is equal to we're
going to say 1 2 3 4 5 ok I have my list
and if I do dot and then hit tab I
notice there is a lot of methods here
I'm going to use the reverse method now
so this method interestingly enough
doesn't
actually return anything instead it
operates in place so if I take a look at
my list now it's been reversed what I
cannot do is something like this
result is equal to my list reverse
because my list thought reverse is
occurring in place
it means it's affecting the actual
variable my list and it's not actually
returning anything so if I take a look
at results I don't get anything back it
basically does not return anything and
this idea of returning something is
going to come into play when we learn
how to build out our own functions so
keep that idea of returning something or
not returning something in the back of
your mind for when we cover functions
we're actually going to use they return
keyword but for now just keep a general
idea that some functions or some methods
won't return anything and others will
affect the variable in place another
very similar method to reverse is
sorting so if I say my list is equal to
and let's put in a bunch of kind of
random unsorted numbers here I can
actually say my list dot and then say
sort and nothing's returned here meaning
my list has been sorted in place so the
methods we've gone over so far is
sorting a list reversing a list popping
an item off of a list and this is
something where we do return an object
and then we have appending to a list
nothing's returned here we just add on
an object to the very end now if we want
to not put in an object at the very end
but actually insert it to a special
location we can use the dot insert
method for that so we'll create one last
list here for our example 1 2 3 and
instead of appending to the very end I
want to insert it as the first item that
is index 0 then I can say inserts and
the first argument is the index position
of where you want to insert this I will
insert this at 0 that is the first item
and then let's make it really obvious by
saying new and then now if I check my
list I see new 1 2 3 ok so you have
insert with the capability of
inserting this item at any location
finally the last topic I want to cover
is nested lists and that's just the idea
that a list can hold not just the
variable objects that we've seen before
like floats numbers or strings it can
actually hold in other lists so I can
say let's get a couple empty cells here
a new list equal to 1 comma 2 comma and
then I can insert another sub list here
a whoops b/c so now notice that I have a
list inside of another list and the type
of this is still a list so imagine I
wanted to grab the letter A from this
list how would actually do that well I
will need to check out my list and index
out this nested list so that is at 0 1
index 2 so let's grab that and now I've
been able to retrieve that list itself
and then actually off of this I can
perform another set of index calls to
grab the first item here which is a at
index 0 and then I can grab the string a
having more than one level of a nested
list is not really that common it's
sometimes pretty common to see objects
nested one level in such as a list
inside of another list it's pretty
uncommon to see a list inside of a list
inside of a list etc just because it
gets so hard and tricky to retrieve
things okay that's it for this lesson
we'll see you at the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
