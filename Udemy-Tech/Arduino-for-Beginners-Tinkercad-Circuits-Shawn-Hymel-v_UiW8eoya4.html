for a class is to have the instructor
tell you that you need to buy a whole
bunch of supplemental material this
being a hardware class having Hardware
in hand is the best but in lieu of
having to spend extra hard-earned cash
there is an alternative open a browser
and head to Tinkercad dot-com Tinkercad
is a free tool for creating 3d models
and it also contains an Arduino and
electronics simulator that lets you
virtually construct circuits and program
an Arduino in your web browser if you're
interested in taking this class without
having to buy hardware then I recommend
signing up for an account on Tinkercad
once you have signed in to your account
click circuits on the left of the page
and click create new circuit you'll be
presented with nothing and a list of
components search for breadboard and
drag it onto the prototyping area click
components and you can drag other
electrical components and snap them into
the breadboard like this LED and
resistor don't worry we'll go over the
specifics of using breadboards and
resistors later in the course search for
Arduino and draggin Arduino Uno r3 -
just below the breadboard
if you click on any of the holes on the
Arduino or breadboard you can create
electrical connections which mimic
connecting the holes with wires with a
wire selected you can change its color
to help you identify them when things
start to get messy and complicated if
you click on the code editor button you
can edit code that gets uploaded to the
Arduino press upload and run to send the
program to the Arduino and start the
simulator you can see that the virtual
circuit behaves in much the same way a
real circuit would you'll notice that
you can't make changes to the circuit or
code while the simulator is running so
you'll need to press stop simulation in
order to make edits on the right you can
click serial monitor to get a virtual
console which we will use throughout the
course to help with debugging there are
a few times we'll need to use two
arduino x' later in the class so stop
the simulator click components search
for arduino and drag a second arduino to
the work area click
code editor on the left side of the
editor you'll see a number followed by
Arduino Uno r3 in parentheses click it
to drop down a list of available arduino
to program click to Arduino Uno r3 to
write code for the second Arduino now
when you click upload and run the code
for the first Arduino will run on the
first and the code we write for the
second Arduino will run on the second
this lets us write different programs
for different arduino z' in the same
simulation click the Tinkercad logo to
return to your list of projects click
the gear icon on your project to edit
its properties such as the name and
license you can also make it public so
that other people can find and clone
your project click tinker this to return
to the project editor you'll be able to
complete most of the assignments and
projects in this class with just a
simulator I'll let you know if you need
real hardware for something that being
said it's still fun to play with the
simulator when you don't want to build
real Hardware thanks for watching if
you'd like to learn more check out my
Arduino fundamentals course on udemy in
it I'll show you the basics of C and C++
programming how to build circuits and
how to make things like robots and
internet connected sensors if you use
the coupon in the description you'll get
a YouTube exclusive discount for the
class see you there
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
