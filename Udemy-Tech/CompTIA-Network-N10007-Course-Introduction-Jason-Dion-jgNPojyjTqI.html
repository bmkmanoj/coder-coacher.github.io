complete course in this course we're
gonna teach you everything you need to
know to take and pass the CompTIA
Network+ exam we're going to cover all
five domains including networking
concepts infrastructure network
operations network security and network
troubleshooting in tools we're gonna
take you from zero knowledge to a
passing knowledge across all of these
domains as you progress through the
course we're gonna build upon each
section to give you more and more
knowledge as we move through the domains
we're gonna start out slow and then
we're gonna pick up speed as we go
through I recommend having a pen and
paper with you so you can take down some
notes there are a lot of times in the
video where I'm gonna say I recommend
you write this down this is going to be
important take a note of this and when I
say those things you should be adding it
to your notes by the time you're done
with this course your notes should only
be about five or six pages long with all
of those things that I've told you and
those are the key critical pieces that
you really need to know to pass the exam
come test day and that's the stuff you
definitely need to commit to memory now
in addition to those notes I've put
checkpoints along the way with different
quizzes along the way and a final
practice exam at the end when you take
that practice exam and you're scoring
85% or higher you're ready to go sit for
the real Network+ exam so with that said

learning what exactly is the Network+
exam and how is it going to look on test
day
