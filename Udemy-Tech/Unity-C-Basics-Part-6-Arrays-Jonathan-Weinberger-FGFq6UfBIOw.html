to be the last tutorial for the
fundamentals and today we're going to
cover arrays so after this video I'm
going to release a and you'll find it in
the next video I'm going to release a
practical video of the fundamentals of
programming and it's gonna create it's
going to be basically creating real
world applications using what we've
learned in the past videos after this
one we're moving on to an intermediate
series so let's get started with arrays
so arrays what's an array an array is a
variable that allows you to store
multiple values okay so for instance I'm
gonna go in here we're gonna create a
new C sharp script whoops not a
JavaScript don't ever use JavaScript by
the way it's awful
in case someone asks why I'm against
JavaScript if you use JavaScript which
is known as unity script you're
restricting yourself to just this engine
so for instance you can't get a real job
or anything like that if you're using
unity script it's not a real language
alright so we have here array example
alright so an array is a variable that
allows you to store multiple multiple
values inside of one variable so for
instance say I had say I was creating a
quiz calculator right and I need quiz
grades I've three quiz grades all right
so I would have the variable for three
quizzes so I have public public ain't
quiz one and then I would have another
guy a Republican quiz two and then
public in quiz three and if I wanted to
I can give them values I could say one
got a fifty got a hundred and one got
seventy all right now what I did here
was these are all the same data type and
three different variables instead say I
had twenty students instead of having to
write out 20 different variables and
take up 20 lines of code here I can just
create an array that's gonna store all
the quiz grades so how do you declare an
array
well there are two ways to declare them
and technically there's three and the
reason why I say technically is because
there is a unity way to declare them and
I'll discuss the pros and cons of doing
that when I show you so the first way to
declare an array is the way I always
recommend doing it and the way you do
that is you give it a bit some still a
variable save you so you have your
public or private reference and then the
data type the array is and it's gonna be
an int because it's quiz grades right
now what you do is you put these square
brackets this symbolises that it's an
array so I'm gonna say int and then the
square brackets for an array and then
give it a name so I'm gonna go ahead and
say quizzes all right now here's how you
declare it you assign it and you use the
open closing brackets and what goes
inside here are your values so for
instance quiz one was fifty and then the
next value you separate them by a comma
is a hundred and then seventy so what I
can do here is I'm gonna go and delete
these variables so I have an array of
quiz grades here and the first value
which is element zero is 50 then you
have element one which is 100 and
element two which is 70 all right if we
save this and go into unity here all
right you'll see here that we have a
drop down here which signifies it's an
array and the size is 3 an element 0 is
50 element 1 is 100 element 2 is 70 all
right now there's another way to declare
the arrays what if I didn't know what
their grades were right now or I want to
enter them in a different way so instead
of doing it this way I could have done
this I can create an array still I can
say here public int or say I don't know
the values but I know the size of the
array so I could say public int and then
you have quizzes equals and then you use
the new keyword and then the datatype of
your array and it should fill it in for
you if you have your intelligence on so
you do new int and then you specify how
many quiz grades do I want to enter
let's say five grades and then you end
it with a semicolon now what this does
is it creates an array that's the size
of five so if I go back to unity here
you're gonna see here
that the quizzes hasn't updated yet one
second let me reset the script okay
there we go so reset it so we have five
cruise grades and then here's the third
way to declare an array you can actually
do the values right here in the
inspector I can put 60 50 40 whatever
okay now here's the problem with this I
never recommend doing this for instance
why wouldn't you ever do this for
instance if you're creating an RPG game
and you have a bunch of items you and
you give them item IDs you might have a
hundred items and it might be really
really convenient to enter them this way
the problem with this is how do you
export that data what if you move to a
database you don't have it hard-coded in
it's in unity or better yet what happens
if you're making your game you don't
save your scene and unity crashes well
guess what these values are gone and you
have to re-enter all of them so if you
have a hundred items thousand items
you're screwed now when you're getting
into them many items it's better Tavia
to use a different solution like xml
files or a database driven inventory
system now but if you're not going to do
that I always recommend to clone your
race the way I showed you in the first
example which is this one here now there
is another way to do it through script
using this method and it's how it's
basically grabbing each element so for
instance if I want the first quiz grade
I can access the first quiz grade in
that array like so I can say quizzes the
array brackets and then you'll see here
it says index what element in the array
do you want you have five elements so I
want the first one which is zero
all right numbers start at zero so I can
say quiz zero equals 50 and that's how
you declare it and void start you have
to use void start forgetting to close
this way if I put it up here it won't
even give me any intelligence or tooltip
because it can't be done you can't
declare it array like that so if I save
this let's go to unity here reset the
script you're gonna see it here there's
a five or actually ones like oh right
it's in start so once I run the game
there you go so element zero is 50 all
right so that's the way you can declare
an array like I said guys I recommend
doing it this way it's much better an
array can be any type of data
could be int could be a flow a string it
could be game objects if I wanted to
access elements 70 here
that's the third element all right so
it's the third element however numbers
start at zero so it's zero one two so if
I wanted to print out that element I
would say debug log and then quizzes and
then what element do I want to print out
one print out that 70 so it's zero one
two it's the third element which is -
all right numbers start at zero
always remember that with arrays so if
we go ahead and run that all right there
you go it's gonna print out zero and the
reason why is because it's zero here
over red and I think that's commented
out oh it's not all right my unity just
didn't update so let me reset the script
oh hi there yes here's the values I'm
gonna go ahead and run it and there you
go so it says 70 all right so like I
said you can do multiple different data
types if I want to do strings a string
array of names for instance I could say
public strings the array brackets equals
open closing brackets with a semicolon
and then I separate them my name so if I
want five names or three names I'm gonna
go ahead and say John and then comma
I'll say Julie comma and then we'll say
mark alright so I have three names in
the array and I'm good
and it looks like I have an area there
and I'm not really sure why uh let's
find out oh never mind I guess it just
wanted me to hit save okay let's make
sure it's knows oh there is an error
okay it's a parsing error
I don't see what I did wrong let me see
here we have quizzes we have strange oh
right okay so check this out guys what I
forget here every variable has three
required components with an optional
fourth every variable needs a name so
missing names and there we go all right
and if I wanted to print out these names
with the quizzes it's very very simple
all I would do is I would say debug log
I would say names so I'm gonna say names
and then the first element alright and
then I could say on the next one debug
log I want to print out the quiz grid
that goes with it so I'm gonna say
quizzes in the first element which is
zero and that's gonna print out John
fifty if I run this all right there you
go Johnny fifty all right so I hope you
guys are pretty comfortable with how to
declare an array and what they're used
for it
a case that I can think of off the back
is for inventory items you can use an
array to store game objects of items
that you have you can use it for your
inventory size also one thing to note
about arrays is that arrays are arrays
are not dynamic and now what does that
mean that means you can't extend the
size so this is three the length of this
array is three you have three elements
here you can't decide later on that it
wants to be five in your game you only
have three spaces of memory okay you
predefined three spaces of memory right
here if you decide later on in your game
that hey I want four spaces you can't
use an array you have to actually make
new memory manually like this and then
put a zero there or something or
whatever you want that value to be in
the intermediate series I'll cover list
and the list will allow you to create a
dynamic array which means you can add
memory at runtime and you can remove
memory at runtime you don't rely on the
array when you declare an array you're
taking up that memory and it's staying
there so there are situations where a
list is better than an array and
typically in my opinion I would use a
list for items versus an array because
you might not need to have a predefined
set
of items like taking up memory that
you're not using but that's a that's a
yeah that's one for another day so if
you guys want an assignment on a raise
go ahead and create an array of Ages go
and create an array of names go and
create an array of game objects and
print out their names all right and if
you not sure how to do that I will get
you started on the array and you can
figure out how to print the name so you
can say public game objects and array of
game objects and then we'll say my
objects and then you can for for unity
types you have to do it the inspector
way so that's the only time I'm really I
guess it's okay to do that but basically
gonna say my objects like that and then
go to unity here and you can drag to it
you'll see here my objects you can drag
three objects so you can go ahead and
create three objects drag them there and
then go ahead and using a for loop go
ahead and print out the names if you
can't solve that exercise go ahead and
watch the practical which will show you
how to use arrays and for loops together
with switch statements if statements and
variables alright guys thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
