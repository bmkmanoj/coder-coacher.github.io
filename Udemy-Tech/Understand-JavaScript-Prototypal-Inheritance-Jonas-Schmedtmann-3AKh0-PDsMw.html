teacher at udemy.com and this is a free
preview of my best-selling complete
JavaScript course so in this video you
will learn and finally understand how
prototypal inheritance works in
JavaScript it's not an easy subject I
must warn you but by the end of the
video it will all make sense to you in
this lecture we will take a closer look
at objects in JavaScript we will talk
about object-oriented programming in
general inheritance and how JavaScript
handles objects and inheritance through
prototypes this is probably one of the
most important lectures in this course
if you really want to understand
JavaScript so there's a saying in
JavaScript which says that everything is
an object and while this is almost
correct it is not 100% correct though
because in JavaScript we have two big
types of values primitives and objects
and primitives are all the values that
have one of the data types that we
talked about in the intro lectures so
numbers strings boolean's undefined and
null values all of these are primitives
and everything else are object and
that's why in JavaScript we say that
everything is an object and in fact even
simple things like functions arrays or
dates are all objects in JavaScript and
that's because in JavaScript objects are
not just for storing a bunch of data
like we have been doing but for really
complex things under the surface so we
have been using objects all along just
without knowing it so always remember
that almost everything is an object in
JavaScript because it's one of the
fundamental things that makes JavaScript
so unique and different from other
popular programming languages all right
so now that we know how important object
in JavaScript let's look at
object-oriented programming so in very
simple terms object-oriented programming
makes heavy use of objects properties
and methods and these objects interact
with one another to form complex
applications we use objects to store
data structure our code and keep our
code clean so far we have only created
simple objects holding some data
I remember the John object from the
intellectuals and if we had created
other persons back then we would simply
have written them one by one like Mark J
in etc right but there is a better way
imagine something like a blueprint from
which we can generate as many objects as
we want and we can do that in JavaScript
and right here is an example of that
this is a special person object that we
can basically use as a blueprint to
create a lot of person objects in other
programming languages this is many times
called a class but in JavaScript we like
to call it a constructor or prototype so
based on this constructor we can create
as many instances as we want so here are
our Jane mark and John objects once
again but these were created from the
person constructor so they are
effectively person instances and now
their name here of birth and job
variables are defined and they all have
access to the calculate age method so
again the constructor acts like a
blueprint and is used to create
instances which of course are also
objects we will of course do all of this
with code over the next lectures this is
just to give you a very brief overview
and now let's take this even one step
further with inheritance in simple terms
inheritance is when one object is based
on another object it's when one object
gets access to
objects properties and methods so very
simple
back to our persons example imagine that
we also wanted to have an athlete's
constructor
besides the person constructor with a
couple of different properties and
methods now an athlete is also a person
right there are just some particular
properties and methods for an athlete
like for example how many participation
in Olympics they have or how many medals
they have won so when we define the
blueprint so the constructor for an
athlete then why repeat the same stuff
that we have in our person constructor
an athlete also has a name year of birth
and job right so what we can do is to
use inheritance we make the athlete
object inherit the properties and
methods from the person object so then
the athlete not only as access to its
own properties and methods but also the
ones from the person object really cool
right
this allows us to write less code and
make more logical programs so this is a
broad overview of how inheritance works
in theory and in all programming
languages that have object-oriented
futures so let's now see how Java Script
in particular handles inheritance with
our person and John examples JavaScript
is a prototype based language which
means that inheritance works by using
something called prototypes in practice
that means that each and every
JavaScript object has a prototype
property which makes inheritance
possible in JavaScript so again
inheritance is made possible through the
prototype property that every object has
now all of this may look a bit confusing
at first sight but don't worry because
we will do everything in code later as
well but before doing that it's super
important that we get at least a visual
overview of what happens behind the
scenes all right now
how does inheritance actually work to
better understand this let's go back to
our person example where the person
object is the constructor and John is
one of the instances now if we want John
to inherit a method or a property from
the person object we have to add that
method or property to the person's
prototype property just like we see it
here so in this example we have to
calculate H method in a person's
prototype property and therefore John
inherits the method and can then call it
and any other object created by the
person constructor would inherit this
method as well so again the prototype
property of an object is where we put
methods and properties that we want
other objects to inherit what is really
important to note here is that the
person's prototype is not the prototype
of the person itself but of all
instances that are created through the
person blueprint like for example John
so in other words the person's prototype
property is the prototype of John and
that's not even all because the person
object itself is an instance of an even
bigger constructor which is the object
object yeah that sounds a bit crazy but
this is actually how it works each and
every object that we ever create is an
instance of the object constructor which
has a bunch of methods in its prototype
property and as you can guess the person
object inherits these methods and can
call them plus the done object also
inherits these methods and can also use
them and with that we have actually
explained the prototype chain so the
prototype chain is what makes all this
inheritance possible and here is how it
works when we try to access a certain
method or property on an object Java
Script will first try to find that
method
on that exact object but if it cannot
find it it will look in the objects
prototype which is the prototype
property of its parent so it moves up in
a prototype chain if the method is still
not there this continues until there is
normal prototype to look at which is
null now it's the only one that has no
prototype and is therefore the final
link in a prototype chain and in this
case undefined is returned this is the
reason why for example the John object
could call the has owned property method
that is stored in the object prototype
property and since this is also crazy
important I even took the time to write
down a summary for you about the most
important things about prototypes so
that you can copy it if you want so here
it goes
every javascript object has a prototype
property which makes inheritance
possible in JavaScript the prototype
property of an object is where we put
methods and properties that we want
other objects to inherit the
constructors prototype property is not
the prototype of the constructor itself
but it's the prototype of all instances
that are created through it when a
certain method or property is called to
search starts in the object itself and
if it cannot be found there the search
moves up onto the object prototype this
continues until the method is found and
this is the prototype chain all right so
this is it about objects inheritance and
prototypes in JavaScript let's now
finally write some code to use the
concept that we talked about in the last
lecture and I will start by opening up
the starter project that you can
download for this section and once again
it's on our desktop already so I just
need to open it and here we have the
HTML file where
connects with our script and here's just
the empty file alright so this lecture
will be about creating objects using the
function constructor so I'm just writing
it here to structure our code better so
I'm going to start by writing or a
well-known John object right so John
with the name of John of course in the
year of birth and then our job so this
is the way that we have been writing
objects using the object literal right
and I imagine that we wanted to create a
lot of objects with different names and
ages and jobs
so as we learned in the last lecture we
can use some kind of blueprint for this
right so in JavaScript there are a
couple of different ways that to create
objects but probably the most popular
way is using something called a function
constructor and this is a very common
JavaScript pattern and the pattern is
something like a standard way that we
have to solve a problem always in the
same way so the function constructor is
a pattern for like writing a blueprint
such as we have been talking before so
the name function constructor implies
that we're going to use a function here
right and we want this constructor to be
called person so we create a function
called person and the usual convention
in JavaScript is that we always write
function constructors where a capital
letter here right so person is with a
capital P okay and we always do this for
function constructors all right so
function and the parameters for this
function constructors will be the
variables that we want to set in our
object so in this case it's going to be
named
year of birth and the job and now I'm
just going to show you how this is done
and I will explain to you why this works
just in a second okay so what we do is
to attach these variables so these
arguments to the disk variable of this
functions execution context so just like
this so this dot name and remember that
this variable is simply an object as
well so we can do it like this so this
name will be named which means the one
that we get here as an input for the
function so this dot name will be equal
to name which is the parameter of the
function and then the same thing for the
other two so this dot here of birth will
be equal to year of birth and then this
that job will be the job that we pass
into the function and that's it this is
the function constructor and again I
will explain to you why this works in a
second all right now that we have this
function constructor in place we can
then use it to create a John object so
let's create some space here and then
bar John we call new and this is the new
operator new person and then we pass our
arguments into the function so we
already know our arguments so 1990 and
then the job teacher so this is how we
create new objects using the constructor
function and this is called
instantiation because these objects here
are instances of the person object as we
learned in the last lecture alright and
as promised I'm now going to explain you
how all of this works so first in order
to understand how this works we need to
first understand what the new operator
does so when we use the new upper
first a brand new empty object is
created
alright so an empty object this is
important then after that the
constructor function which in this case
is person right um it's called with the
arguments that we specified okay
so first an empty object is created and
then the function is caught so as we
already know calling a function creates
a new execution context that also has a
disabled right now we know that in a
regular function call that this variable
points to the global object right but if
we now look at our function constructor
here then having the disabled pointing
at the global object wouldn't be so
useful right because like this we would
simply set all these properties on the
global object and that's of course not
what we want and that's why the new
operator takes care of this and it makes
it so that the disabled of the function
points to the empty object that was
created in the beginning by the new
operator remember that so again what the
new operator does is to point to this
variable not to the global object but to
this new empty object that was created
in the beginning when we used this
operator so then after that when we set
a name here and in job properties to
this then that's the same as setting
them right on our new empty object okay
and finally if the constructor function
does not return anything and as you can
see here that is clearly the case then
the result is simply the object that was
created in the first step so this new
empty object here and this empty object
which was created here now has the
properties that we defined so the name
year of birth and job in this case okay
and then finally all of this is simply
assigned to the John variable and just
like this we created an object called
John simply by called a function
constructor so again or a new operator
here first creates an empty object then
it called
or function with this variable not
pointing to the global object but to the
new object that was created here and
then when this code here runs to this
variable is no longer the global
variable and so these are all set on the
new object which is then in the end
assigned to this variable so I hope that
makes sense
so let's now add inheritance to the game
and for that we are going to bring back
or calculate age function so that's now
supposed that we wanted to add a method
to our objects and that sounds easy
right we could just add it to our
function constructor like we would do
with a normal object so just like this
so this dot calculate eight simply a
function which locks to the console th
so 2016 we already noticed by now - this
dot year of birth right and now we can
actually use this and it should of
course work so John calculate eight and
that's now open this and that's not what
I wanted so so here we are and in a
console and what's this year now it's
nothing special so now it's alright so
26 is or expected outcome here so
everything works just fine so let's now
create a couple of more objects here for
more people so word Jane is also a new
person and is going to work the exact
same way right so now I say Jane was
born in 1969 let's say and she's a
designer and we'll also create mark
so a new person called mark obviously he
was born in 1948 and he is retired so if
I now run this then each of the object
that is now created has to calculate age
method attached to them right because
it's right here in a constructor
function or the function constructor of
all of these three objects right so
again each of these objects now has the
method now in this case it's just one
function with one line of code so this
is no big deal but now imagine that we
had 20 functions in each object and that
each of them would like have 100 lines
of code now that would not be very
efficient because then we would have
three copies of the exact same thing
right and that is exactly why we use
inheritance in the exact same way that
we have learned in the last lecture so
what exactly did we learn in the last
lecture so we've learned that we have to
add all the methods and properties that
we want to be inherited into the
Constructors prototype property and it
sounds difficult but it's really not so
let's just do this just creating some
space here and I will actually do it
here so all we have to do is to say
person not prototype because as I was
saying it's simply a property so all we
have to do is to use the dot and then
prototype and then we can add or
function there
so calculate 8 and then our function and
I can actually copy it from here because
it's the exact same code ok and now I'm
going to remove it from here so right
now if I reload this effectively none of
the objects have the calculate age
method really attached to them but still
they are going to be able to use it they
will have access to it because it's in
their prototype right so let's prove
that
so I'm going to put all of these
together and then call these methods on
all of them so calculate H or Jane and
also for mark calculate H and if I now
reload this here is the result so all
the three ages for all the three people
so again the method is not anymore in
the constructor right but we can still
use it and that's because it's in the
prototype property of our function
constructor so inheritance actually
works and this is inheritance in
practice so this is really great right
this is so powerful you just really
understood how this works and how it
works behind the scenes so you cannot
just use it you can also understand why
this works and this is really extremely
powerful and it's really great for you
so attaching methods to the constructor
functions prototype property is
something that is really really common
to use we can of course also add
properties instead of methods but that's
not really common but I still want to
show it to you okay
so such as we did with the method here
we can do the same with properties so
once again person that prototype and now
we can say for example a last name
property and we can say that they should
all be called Smith right because as we
know this will be inherited for all of
them and once again I want to prove that
to you so that's console.log this
property so first for john dot last name
and then for the other two so console
dot log Jane dot last name and then mark
dot last name so let's see what happens
okay so all of them are called Smith so
once again this property is not directly
in the object right but we have access
to it because it's in the prototype
property of the Franklin constructor so
all John Jane and Mark inherit this
property so once more we proved that
inheritance really works and this is a
really big deal so if you understood
this lecture and the last one then you
are well on your way to become a really
great JavaScript developer what I want
you to do now is to create your own type
of objects to play around with
constructors and prototypes a bit and
this way you can consolidate what you
just learned here the JavaScript console
in our browsers is a very powerful tool
to inspect objects and the prototype
chain
so let's now quickly see how we can do
that in practice so I'm first going to
show you how we can inspect the object
that we just created in the last lecture
right here in the console because the
console is not just to log some stuff
here into our console like we've been
doing but also to do more powerful stuff
like inspecting objects so let's first
clear this all right and now we simply
have to write the name of her object so
you see this is a person object and then
our name year of birth and job but now
if we hit this little arrow here then we
get a lot of additional information
about object all right
so first here we can see all the
properties that we added to this object
so the job the name and the year of
birth that we associated to this very
particular object so everything is
correct here right
now down here we have something called
the proto and this is in fact the
prototype of the John object which is
and I'm sure you remember this
the prototype property of the person
constructor so let's take a look at that
okay so here we have the calculate age
method that we add it to our prototype
here right so here we set person
prototype calculate age and so we can
see the calculate age method here in the
proto which again is John's prototype
and therefore it's the prototype
property of the person function
constructor and we also have the last
name property that we also add it so
let's also quickly take a look at person
dot prototype okay and let's get some
more space here for our console so we
see that this is in fact the exact same
thing right this and this here it looks
the exact same way and just to prove you
that John's prototype is in fact the
prototype property of the person I can
actually do it like this so proto and
then let's see what this comparison
operator now is going to give us okay
true so all this means is that in fact
the prototype of John is the prototype
property of the person function
constructor but I'm sure that you notice
already by now so let's go back to our
John object here and actually I'm going
to clear this and write it again alright
so this is the proto now if we look at
the prototype of John we see that
there's also a prototype here right so
let's open that and here we see that
this is the prototype property of the
object constructor so as I said right in
the first lecture about the prototype
chain
all of the objects are actually
instances of the object object right so
let me open this again okay and so here
we have a bunch of methods that are I'm
associated to the prototype property of
the object function constructor so again
this one here is the prototype property
of the person function constructor and
this here is the prototype property of
the object function constructor and
that's because the person function
constructor is in fact an instance of
the object function constructor right
and that's why we can see this whole
prototype chain here right so as I said
this console here is really useful to
visualize this prototype chain and all
of the prototypes that are in it
so as we already know we have now access
to this methods here right and that's
right to our John object so thanks to
the prototype chain on John we can use
these exact methods that are here and
now I'm going to use the has owned
property method just to show it to you
because it can be useful sometimes so we
can use this method to ask basically if
an object has a property or not so we
can do john dot has own property and
then job for example and this is true
because this object has a property
called job right now if we try this with
the last name property
then is going to give us false and that
is because this is not John's own
property so this method only looks for
own properties this is a property that
we inherited from the prototype it's not
really John's own property and that's
why this gives false in this method can
sometimes be quite useful and now
there's another operator that I want to
show you and this one is called instance
off so I'm going to say John instance of
person and this is also like a question
because it will also give us true or
false and in this case you can probably
guess that it's going to give us true so
John is of course an instance of person
because we created it through the person
function constructor and this one can
also be useful sometimes ok and with
this we inspected or John object and the
prototype chain that we just created now
there's only one more thing that I want
to show you and that is to prove you
again that almost everything is an
object so let me create an array here
just like this just a very simple one
and let's now get some information about
it
so if we just hit X not a lot is going
to happen we cannot inspect this object
right now so we need to use console dot
info and now we will be able to look
inside of this object and this is what
we see so we see the elements and then
we also see this length property here
right and do you remember this length
property we use it all the time for
example in our loops right and so now
you know where this actually comes from
it used to look a bit like magic right
but of course it's not so it's always
stored right here in this array instance
and that's why it can very simply use
this property so something like this so
X dot length
is three simply because this is stored
right into this array object all right
and it gets even better because down
here we can also see the prototype of
this array which of course is the array
function constructor so this is another
function constructor that is built right
into JavaScript and allows us to simply
build a race and here in its prototype
property we can see all of these methods
that we have already used before like
pop and push here right or we used and
shift as well so all these methods are
right here in a prototype property after
array and that's why we can use them so
that you never wonder why we could
simply call the push method or something
like this on all of our arrays so now
you know it's because of the prototype
chain so all the arrays that we ever
create will always have access to these
methods because they are stored in their
prototype and that is how useful
inheritance really is so I hope things
are really starting to make sense for
you now so let's now move on in this
lecture we will talk about another way
that we can create objects that inherit
from a prototype and that's the object
dot create method so we have seen the
function constructor pattern to create
objects from a blueprint in the last two
lectures but there are more ways to
create objects and inheritance so let's
talk about the object create method now
and let's first comment out this code
here okay
so this is object but create alright so
with the object dot create method things
work a bit different in this case where
we first define an object that will act
as the prototype and then create a new
object based on that very prototype so
let's do that right now and we're going
to recreate the person example that we
used for the function constructor
lecture so first we have to write the
prototype as a simple object and I'm
going to call it person proto so person
proto and now you see we no longer use
the capital P in the beginning because
it's not a function constructor and what
I want in a prototype such as before is
to calculate age method so we already
know the why and how inheritance work
now we're just doing it in a different
way instead of using Frank tree
constructors we will do it the object
dot create way so it's simply a
different way
alright so calculate age and function
and again I'm going to console.log it
2016 - this third year of birth
now there is no year of birth here
anywhere but we're going to take care of
that later
okay and now let's create John again so
we simply say object not create and then
we simply pass it the object that we
defined to be the prototype object which
will be person proto okay so let's see
this in the console all right and I'm
not gonna console lock this so I will
just do it the way we did before in the
last lecture so John and here is the
object and now it's empty there's
nothing here right but we still have the
prototype and this already has our
calculate H function so this looks a
little bit like before doesn't it now we
just have to fill this John object here
with our data so we can simply do it the
old way right so John that name is John
John not here of birth it's 1990 and
John that job is teacher and if I reload
this now and say John then here we have
our object and it looks a lot like it
did before where define a constructor
right so we have our data here the job
name in here and then the prototype
which contains or calculate H function
however it was not ideal the way that we
had to fill this year right so the
object that we created was empty and
then we had to fill it here and with the
data so this time we're going to do it a
different way because the object dot
create accepts second parameter so let's
now do that for another person so Jane
object dot create
and of course the prototype is again
person proto but then we can pass a
second argument which is an object
specifying the data that we want to have
in the object so name and now we cannot
simply put the name here but we have to
do it in this rather strange way like
this we have to say value and then we
can say Jane okay so this looks a bit
strange but it's actually how it works
so there's no way around doing it like
this so a year of birth and then again
value in 1969 attend a job and once
again value and then designer okay and
let's now reload this and join again and
Jane so both share the same prototype as
you can see here because both have to
calculate each method and then they have
both their own type of data in there
okay so let's think about this again the
difference between object create and a
function constructor pattern is that
object dot create builds an object that
inherits directly from the one that we
passed into the first argument while on
the other hand the function constructor
the newly created object inherits from
the constructors prototype property
right so that's the big difference and I
hope this makes sense to you actually
one of the biggest benefits of object
create is that it allows us to implement
a really complex inheritance structures
in an easier way than function
constructors because it allows us to
directly specify which objects should be
a a prototype all right so function
constructors and object create will be
the most common ways of creating objects
that you will find the most when you
like the
looking for tutorials on the web and
that's why I showed you both in this
course alright and that's it
