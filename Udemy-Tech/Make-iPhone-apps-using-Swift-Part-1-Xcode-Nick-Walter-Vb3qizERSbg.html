name's Nick and I'm gonna teach you
everything you need to get started hello
and welcome to the section I'm calling
the fundamentals this section is about
teaching you the basics and giving you a
nice foundation that we can build on for
the rest of this course so what are we
gonna learn we're gonna learn more about
Xcode sort of see the ins and outs of
how to use this program to both learn
Swift and to make apps speaking of Swift
we're gonna dive in and learn the basics
of Swift if you've never done any sort
of programming at all don't worry I'm
starting from scratch there and we're
just gonna kind of make some building
blocks and you know as the course goes
on that we make more and more apps
you're gonna learn more and more pieces
of Swift you're gonna feel great by the
end of this course we're also gonna
learn how to make an iPhone app we're
gonna make a very basic and simple
iPhone app that will use some of the
principles we learned with Swift so like
I said all very basic and intro stuff
but I want to give you a nice foundation
to build on and let's go ahead and start
by learning about Xcode so I'm gonna go
ahead and move myself to the corner of
the screen here yep here I come down
here let's fire up Xcode you can do this
through your Launchpad I prefer to do
the command spacebar and just type in
Xcode so I can pull it up there now when
you get this welcome screen with Xcode
there's basically two places you can go
you can either create a playground or
you can start a new Xcode project so a
playground is a place to sort of test
things out see what happens that's why
it's called the playground you can sort
of see how things work without any real
consequences consequences it's gonna be
our place that we're gonna go to to
learn Swift now the other option is an
Xcode project and a project is where you
create an app so whether that's an
iPhone app Apple TV app Apple watch app
Mac app and Apple ecosystem just blown
up there's all these different apps that
we can make whatever it is you're gonna
do that with an Xcode project so if you
want to make an iPhone app create an
Xcode project if you just want to mess
around and learn some stuff with Swift
you want to use a playground so let's go
ahead and look at playgrounds first I'm
just gonna go ahead and click here is it
gonna prompt you as to what sort of
playground you want to use so you can
use playgrounds to sort of you know
begin seeing how you would work with a
game
or with a map stuff like that you can do
it with you know the TV and the Mac but
we want I owe s blank this is sort of
the starting point here so if you just
go ahead and hit next it's gonna ask you
where you want to save this this is just
gonna be a file anywhere you want on
your computer I'm gonna throw a mine on
the desktop and keep the name my
playground but you could name it
whatever you want
so you'll see when I do that I get this
little file on desktop it says my
playground playground if you're
wondering my text is a lot bigger
probably than what you'll see on your
computer if you want to ever change the
font size color any of that stuff you
can go up here to Xcode preferences and
change what it is so under fonts and
colors you can go to for example default
is the one that you'll usually see
there's presentation I made presentation
too to just bump it up that much more so
that you'd be able to clearly see my
code you know and there's all sorts of
different you know options here I know
when I program for fun I'm a big fan of
dusk midnight a little bit too black for
me but dusk just right like just it's
good on the eyes I think for you know if
you're kind of coding late at night or
whatever so anyways yeah that's small
tangent but I just wanted to show you
what that was but again here inside of
this playground this is where you can
write some code see what happens when
you do that we're not gonna dive into
that in this lecture but I just wanted
you to see where this was so I'm gonna
go ahead and click out that and I'm
gonna tap on Xcode again that brings up
this Welcome menu and this time I'm
gonna start a new Xcode project so when
you do this it's gonna say hey what do
you want to create under iOS we could
make a single view app which is
essentially like a blank starter app we
can make a game augmented reality app
document based app just so many
different things here down here you've
got the sticker pack app if you want to
make one of those for iMessage you could
do like I said the Apple watch app TV
Mac cross-platform I think you can do a
game inside of there but anyways for
most of the projects that we're working
on this course we want an iOS single
view app it's essentially a blank slate
for us to start with so I'm gonna go
ahead and hit next on this then when you
create your project Xcode needs to know
a few details so for example wants to
know what's the name of your project and
you kind of want to think about this
when you created it
takes a little bit of work if you wanted
to change your project name so I it's
best to just kind of set it right the
first time so for us I'm gonna be
calling our project Swift fund because
you know we're just kind of messing
around a swift so I'm just gonna call
this Swift fun and you know maybe I put
too much emphasis on it for example your
project name doesn't have to match the
name of your app so for example when
your app goes on somebody's phone if you
know you can change what that names
gonna be and that's not hard at all but
I'm all I'm saying is you don't want to
name your project like Swift fun and
then you're like oh now I want to call
it Swift is cool or something like that
because it's gonna take all this effort
to go and change that so anyways do that
for team you don't need to have anything
selected their organization name just
put your name here or if you have some
company that you're doing this under put
that company name there it's all that
really does is at the top of the files
that says hey this was created by Nick
Walter and my case for example for the
organization identifier this is so that
eventually when you submit to the App
Store that this app is uniquely
identified to you now I wouldn't really
worry about the specifics of this too
much the idea is basically if you have a
website do the name of your website in
Reverse so I have zappy code comm so I
have comm dot b code right pretty
straightforward if you don't have a
website or you're not sure where this is
gonna be this is really easy to change
later so I wouldn't worry about this
just go ahead and just say something
like your first name so if your first
name is mark and then your last name is
Jones or something like that just do
like Mark Jones or whatever and again
you can always change that for language
we do want to use Swift like I said
earlier objective-c was the previous
programming language and it's not as
easy as Swift as I'm a big big fan of
Swift so make sure you have Swift
selected here and then there's some
other options like use court data
include unit tests UI tests for our
simple app that we're making we don't
need any of these things so leave all
those things unchecked ok then we're
gonna hit next it's going to ask us
where would we like to save our project
we're gonna I'm gonna go ahead and just
put it on the desktop one thing I would
like to note is the source control says
would you like to create a get repo for
this on your Mac you can decide whether
or not you
- we're going to be talking about github
in the section after this so you can
sort of make that decision later if you
like like - it's not really important
now but I usually leave this check so
I'd probably recommend that so I'm gonna
go ahead and hit create and you can see
it put this folder here on my desktop
now I do think it's kind of interesting
to see what's inside of an app if you
open up this folder it's got an Xcode
project file this is the file you would
double click to open this so for example
if I close out of this Xcode window here
I double click this Xcode project boom
it opens up the same thing that we had
before then inside of the Swift fun
folder there's another folder called
Swift fun and these are all the files
that make up our app so you can see
there's kind of some foreign-looking
names by the end of this course you're
gonna know all about all these but you
know there's the app delegate the view
controller info dot P list all this
stuff but yeah those are kind of the
basics and you'll notice these things
that are here they match up with with
what you see over here on the left side
so you can see that those are all sort
of together there all right so with this
this is where you can come and sort of
work with your code so for example if
you click on this view controller dot
Swift this is where you could edit the
code inside of here and like up at the
top because I had you know my name Nick
Walter it says copyright Nick Walter up
at the top you can always change this if
you want you to say whatever so don't
really stress too much about that but
yeah you can come this is where we're
gonna be writing our code this main dot
storyboard this is where we're gonna
work on the visual parts of our code so
in here we can do like some
drag-and-drop stuff for example I could
you know drag out like a text field out
here or like a slider and stuff I'm
gonna go into this later but I just want
you to kind of see the basics of what we
have alright so there you have it our
little mini tour of Xcode in the next
lecture we're gonna start learning about
Swift and once we have a little bit of
information with Swift we'll come back
to this Xcode project that we created
and start using the things that we
learned Hey thanks for watching what are
you going to make leave a comment below
and let me know and if you want to learn
even more I have a full 16 our iOS
course that I created just for beginners
where I'll show you how to make a ton of
different apps including a snapchat
clone
c'mon go clone and the talk boy it's
usually 200 bucks but if you use the
link below you'll get a YouTube
