level design in particular how you can
up your game in terms of creating great
levels for your players and I've plucked
a bunch of examples from our RPG course
we've got on udemy so feel free to check
that out if you want more depth of what
I'm talking about in this video the
first thing that you really need to be
connected with when you're making levels
is player choice
not just any old player choice but
meaningful informed player choice and I
talked about this in a bunch of my
videos it's important that you give the
player the feeling that they're in
control
and this is the same with levels how do
you do that well you can do that in
anywhere in in in any way at any time
anywhere okay so for example if you've
got a straight-up
linear level where the player runs from
A to B maybe it's an RPG and and you
don't have any branches in your worlds
like any choices they can go left or
right they're just straight through the
world okay that's fine with your
environment what you can do as the
players running along you put an NPC on
the side of the road with a speech
bubble above their head there's a choice
what do I do as a player do I go over to
the NPC and talk to them or I do not now
if you put that NPC right in the middle
of the road and said you have to talk to
them no matter what that removes some of
the feeling of choice I had as a player
I've got to talk to him and it's gonna
be an unskipable cutscenesthat's nice
kappa get them to talk to this NPC or
else things won't work my story depends
on it I'd say how can you make your
story so it doesn't depend on it so you
give the player this choice that doesn't
break the game if they don't take that
choice okay it's a very simple example
to kick it up one notch and say how do
we do that with our environment you can
say okay we've got this same I'm running
along a path and now I can choose to go
to the left or go to the right if
there's no clues for the player I can
just go left or right and whatever it's
trees that way and trees that way then
it doesn't feel like an informed choice
and the player doesn't feel as excited
about it but if you have a sign that
says guess
destruction that way and certain peril
this way I mean it's kind of saying the
same thing but it's a little bit funny a
little bit interesting and the player
might look at that and say hmm what does
that mean or better still you might say
tons of loot and and cash this way and
you might say huge adventure awaits this
way and so the player can look at that
and they can put it through their own
mental model of what sounds more
interesting and then maybe even deeper
than that you could have signs or you
could show different terrain so this way
looks more swampy and perhaps the
players already fought swamp monsters
and you can see a swamp that way and
over this way maybe it is lush forest
and maybe they went through the forest
and nearly got decapitated by some huge
bear that was in the forest so then
they're starting to anchor oh if I go
that way it's gonna be more of those
little swamp donkeys that I had to fight
in the past if I go this way it's gonna
be
that more of those bears what do I want
to do and then on top of that maybe
you've just given the player some sort
of huge axe that has a plus when used in
swamps so the more bits of little bits
of information you can give to the
player the better those moments will be
and if you think about that that's not
really level design is it it's just I go
left or do I go right our mental model
of level design is these complex worlds
with with paths and chambers and crazy
stuff going on like I think a lot of
people a lot of us and led to believe
that level design needs to be complex or
needs to be deep or needs to be tricky
it's actually kind of the opposite the
simpler you can make your levels the
better they will be and you know the
great games out there don't necessarily
have intricate level moments intricate
level layout intricate design and
philosophy it's compelling it's
compelling to go left and compelling to
go right that's good level design if I'm
running along and I go up on top of a
hill and then I can see some information
down below I can see certain types of
monsters and then as I round the hill
those monsters are they're ready and
waiting for me because I saw that
information I can be ready for that and
I can make a choice about how I fight
those monsters when I come around
the hill so remember that to give the
player bits of information that are
useful and meaningful and then to give
them choice and between two to five
choices I talked about in some of my
other videos that's a good amount of
choice to give it to players two to five
choices so those really are the
fundamentals of level design let me show
you a couple of more specific techniques
of how you can lay things out in your
level to see if this is useful for you
guys this is a part that's straight from
our RPG course where we can look at a
hub-and-spoke model if you see in the
middle of the screen there we've got a
and that a is referring to the the hub
and these outside areas BCDE F are the
spokes so I have to run out to be do
some fights go on a quest do some stuff
then run back to a run out to sea and
come back if you want to give the player
a choice you can say hey you need to
defeat BCDE F do it in whatever order
you want and that's cool this is the hub
and spoke model often in the middle at a
I just put my laser pointer on here
there we go off in the middle of a
that's where you have the shops or the
inventory or you can sell things this
could be a town and then you have to go
out to other town and come back and a
new town sometimes this will be locked
so C will be locked until you complete B
so it's a gated progress literally from
BCDE F okay and as I'm saying with
choice if you give the player you could
go to B or C and then once you defeat
one of those you could go to C or D is
more meaningful I think than just saying
it has to be B then has to be C then it
has to be D it's the hub in the spoke
model and we're going to build on this
I'm going to show you some cool stuff
how you can build on that this is the
hub and spoke and shortcuts model so it
can be a little bit tedious to have to
run out to B and then run back to a
again out to sea and run back to a again
so you can have a shortcuts mechanism
where you run down to this area or go
over to this other place on the map if
you've got a map based level and then
once you've defeated that you can run
through this interesting area to get to
C and then run through this part that
you've never done before back to a and
then you can do the same with E and F
and maybe D is just a little dead-end
you go in and out just to create some
variety so it doesn't look too
obvious and then we've got the loop you
guys will played games which is a loop
this is nice in terms of level
construction because I can make one
level that is kind of a square type
level and have the player go in a very
linear fashion through that level here's
the one path you have to go through this
path go through this path you know from
B all the way back to a and we cover all
of that territory but it's because I've
I've built this stuff in the middle I
can see that stuff in the middle when
I'm on the south side and I can also see
it when I'm on the north side up here so
I can get a little bit of reuse without
literally making the player go straight
back through the same area that's a loop
other reason I'm showing you this loop
because we can combine all these
together to create a hub and loops
mechanism and this is one that I really
like and this I think is a great
technique if you're making an RPG
whether it's a first person RPG or
whether it's a third person
Diablo style RPG then you have your hub
in the middle the player runs around to
be back to a runs around to look around
to see and back to a and round 2d and
back to a this is a really nice way to
reuse this part in the middle to have
some continuity of story some characters
that the player keeps coming back to but
also to have these cool parts of your
level that engulf - and have some new
adventures it's a very efficient way to
use your terrain without literally
making making people go in and out and
you can get a lot of great reuse of your
assets I think so that's just a few of
the actual literal level layouts that
you can use that I wanted to show to you
guys and using those combined with what
we're talking about choices and giving
the player the information and then
giving them a feedback on what happened
with the choice they made in their level
are really the core building blocks of
creating great levels in your games so I
hope this has been useful for you guys
as always I love to hear from you thanks
for watching and I look forward to
seeing you in one of our courses</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
