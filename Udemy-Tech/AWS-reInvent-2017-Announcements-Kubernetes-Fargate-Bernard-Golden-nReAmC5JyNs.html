for the ultimate AWS certified Solutions
Architect associate course and in this
video which is a one of a series of
videos I want to talk about the best
announcements at AWS reinvent 2017 and
reinvent is the yearly conference that a
experts on and it's really kind of an
extravaganza where they lots of hoopla
lots of attendees there's 43,000 people
at it this particular last one and I
want to talk about the five best or the
five coolest most intriguing product
announcements at reinvent 2017 and there
were a lot of announcements well number
five in my view kubernetes and Fargate
well what is kubernetes well kubernetes
is a what's called a container
orchestration solution so containers are
a sort of an emerging or even emerged
way of providing processing capabilities
and unlike virtual machines you have you
can put code into a single operating
system and partition it and separate it
and make it so that they're not gonna
interfere with one another by putting
them putting the code and the supporting
libraries in the containers the very
effective very flexible and very fast
well kubernetes is a probably the
leading container orchestration solution
in the marketplace it's been out a few
maybe two years two and a half years
something like that originally sort of
incubated by Google they've now turned
it over to a to a foundation that
monitored the managers and handles all
of the development and so forth and so
it's it's open source and it's a system
for automating deployment scaling and
management of containerized applications
so a lot of container applications won't
just be one container it might be five
or ten or 20 or 100 and those have all
be got to be connected coordinated
if something fails something then you
need to have a restart a lot of
challenges in managing these complex
multi container applications low
kubernetes that's what it's good at it
groups containers that make up an
application to logical units for easy
management discovery so you can have a
let's say a login capability an
application and you might have three or
four containers that provide that or you
might have containers that one is the
interface where people interact so
that'd be a web kind of thing then you
have a secondary one that might do some
kind of partitioning of the data might
be some validation or scrubbing you
might have a third one that actually
does the retrieval or insertion and they
ought to be coordinated and kubernetes
lets you define a service that says this
is my user identity login service with
these different containers and I want to
manage it as a single one and make sure
that if the low gets very heavy on that
another set of those three will be X
will be brought up so I have more
capacity and if they're and if the
volume drops I want all three of those
I want that set of all three to be
terminated so it's a way to coordinate
all these things and make them easier to
use for real-world applications as I
said it's the de facto standard for
container orchestration and database has
had its own solution called elastic
container service which did something
analogous but was a to be a specific
kubernetes as I said was in committed by
Google but is now really supported by
Google Microsoft and now a double yes as
well as all across the industry so it's
kind of an emerging defacto standards
AWS announced in community service code
eks and Riaan met it's now in preview so
it's not fully available it's not fully
available in all regions it's not really
available for production use but you can
request access to it so forth so that's
kubernetes AWS has career service
because a containers are such a powerful
trend in the industry and because
kubernetes is the de facto standard it's
really important that
support it and that's why it's one of
the top five for the conference
well what about far key well far it is
an interesting kind of notion and it's
basically another level of abstraction
around container orchestration so even
with that container orchestration of
curette ease you still have to manage
the cluster you have to manage all the
servers that all those containers are
deployed into you have to manage scaling
up the infrastructure or scaling it down
if you need more capability within the
within the or plus the kubernetes
cluster etc well Fargate is a technology
for Amazon ECS and eks that allows you
you meanings allows the user to run
containers without having to manage
servers or clusters excuse me with a
tibias Fargate you no longer have to
provision configure and scale clusters
of virtual machines to run containers so
this is a kind of a continuation of a
trend across a lot of different
capabilities that any of us is pursuing
where it's making it simpler to run the
kinds of capabilities of what the
service does so it's gotten RDS which is
a managed database service you don't
have to worry about spinning up
instances installing the database
software making sure it's patched making
sure that you put it into a larger
instance if if you need more scale no it
has a managed capability it will be
coming back to manage databases later in
this series of the best announcements
but a base is pursuing this it has the
elastic MapReduce the same kind of
concept gets you out of the heavy
lifting of managing infrastructure it
allows you to you to focus more on the
capabilities of the service
well Fargate is the same thing applied
to ECS the elastic container service
which is the AWS specific service or eks
which is the managed kubernetes terse
Fargate is a way to avoid all the heavy
lifting of being able to have kubernetes
running it will manage deploying it
making sure that the cluster is big
enough growing it shrinking it as needed
so you no longer have to provision
configure and scale clusters of virtual
machines to run containers so what you
do is you package the application you
define the application in containers you
specify how much sea
pee-yew and memory you want for each of
those containers you define the way it's
going to connect by a networking and
then set policy I am policies that say
this container can receive connections
from these other containers or this port
will be open or these ports will be open
you define all of that in a declarative
fashion and then Fargate implements it
and enforces it AWS will then take that
definition and deploy it into a managed
service server environment so you have
to worry about any infrastructure are
there enough virtual machines are they
all available it might even crash you
don't worry about any of that if our
gate manages the infrastructure and
scaling so if a lot of demand comes on
to your application and you need more of
those kubernetes services or ECS
capabilities it will automatically grow
the infrastructure pool without you
having to think about it worry about it
even be aware that it's happening it
avoids the need for monitoring and
managing server fleets so you don't have
to you know what's going on is anything
crashed or there no it's this is no
Fargate does that and the pricing is
based on per second it's per second
pricing based on how many virtual CPUs
you're using for your far gate overall
pool and how many gigabytes of memory
you want associate with those that's all
there is to it so it's really simplifies
this
I mean kubernetes is very powerful
people love it but it's kind of
challenging it's kind of a science
project to operate properly Fargate
abstracts all that you just say here's
my servers here's my containers here's
how much memory and CPU I want them to
have you figure out how to run them so
if there's enough capacity and
capability and that it stays up and
running so that's why kubernetes and
Fargate are my number five choice for
the most intriguing announcements in AWS
reinvent 2017
