really short video today we're gonna be
going over logic operators and basically
the logic operators on what gives your
programs logic so for instance if I
wanted to compare two numbers like if a
is greater than B then do something
an E and logic operator which is the
greater than sign in vice-versa
less then we have compare I believe I
have here all the operators you guys
hopefully you guys can see my screen but
we have all the operators that we can
use and they're quite a bit and we're
gonna cover today just the basic ones
but basically you have your typical
arithmetic so for instance we'll have
here say we had two variables a and B
okay so we have public and a public and
B now if I wanted to check if the head
is greater than B how do I do that well
we need to use our logical operator if a
is greater than B then we could say
debug log a is greater than B now using
the same example I could also say if
they're equal to each other if it's
greater than or equal to by just adding
an equal to I can check if they equal
each other if I could I could check if a
equals B by doing two equal signs all
right the two equal sound stands for
compare so I'm comparing those two
values do they equal each other one
equal sign is for a sign you don't
anytime you're in an if statement use
two equal signs I can check if it's less
then I can check if it's less than equal
to I can check if a does not equal B by
using an exclamation point in an equal
sign I can even check the value of this
I could check to see if a plus B equals
12
if a plus B equals 12 or if a minus B
equals 12 all right I can say debug that
log whatever so you have all your
arithmetic operations you can also say
if a multiplied by B or a divided by B
so you have a ton of operators I can
help you with your projects
I'd get to know them if you're not
familiar with PEMDAS which is the basic
basic arithmetic on how stuff works it's
the order of operations so things are
calculated in that order so for instance
if I needed to calculate the average of
a B and send me out here
see how would I do that I would
calculate it by saying I'd have a very
more to hold the average right so I
would go ahead and say average equals a
plus B plus C and then divide by three
now the problem with doing this okay the
problem of doing this is that basic
arithmetic says division before addition
so what's gonna happen is C divides by
three and then a and B get calculated
that's not how you calculate the average
you add them up and then divide by three
so what you can do is you can put it in
parentheses and whatever's in
parentheses will get calculated first
then once that's finished calculating it
will divide by three and that will give
you the average all right so that's just
a little heads up on basic operators I
hope you learn something hopefully not
too much but I'll post in the
description a link to the MSDN where you
can view all the operators and how they
can help you in your projects let me
know what you guys do with this and feel
free to yeah make sure you guys are
following me on Facebook and Twitter
digital gaming institute comm has the
links links in the description and I'll
see you guys in the next video for
switch statements</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
