teacher at udemy.com in my beginner
html5 and css3 course which includes
premium support I get a ton of questions
from my students so I decided to create
this video where I reply to the top 5
questions that I get all the time from
students so the first one and this is an
absolute classic is hey Jonas what's the
difference between classes and ID's and
it's a very simple question but for
beginners it's crucial that they
understand the difference so basically
we use IDs and classes to give HTML
element names so we can then select them
in CSS in order to style them so to use
an ID we use the ID attribute in HTML
and the hash symbol to select the
element by ID in our CSS code just like
you can see in this example here
now to use a class we use the class
attribute in HTML and select the element
in CSS using the dot selector but now
what's actually the difference between
them well each ID can only exist once in
the HTML document
meaning that IDs are unique technically
you could actually give two elements the
same ID but that would be invalid HTML
ok so that wouldn't really be perfect so
again you can use each ID name only once
on your HTML page now that has some
serious implications for reusability
like imagine you start using an ID for
elements you think you're only gonna
need once on your page but then later
you actually want to reuse the element
and then you would have to go back and
change everything from id'd class and
that would be terrible right so in
modern HTML and CSS development we
actually only ever use classes because
that makes our code more reusable and
more portable so next question now
although I explain this topic in my
courses I still get this important
question all the time what's the
difference between block level
inline-block and inline elements so
let's clear up this question once and
for all
okay so let's start with the block level
box or element and we can actually say
both now first off the type of a box is
always defined by the display property
so in the case of the block level
element the display property is usually
set to block but please note that the
values flex for flex box layouts list
item in table also produce block level
boxes now all HTML elements have a
default display property and elements
such as paragraphs or divs which are
usually formatted visually as blocks
have the display property set to block
by default we can always of course
change this property manually which can
be very useful in some cases okay so
being a block level box this box will
always occupy as much space as possible
which is usually 100% of its parent
width and therefore create line breaks
after and before it meaning that blocks
are formatted vertically one after the
other now about inline boxes they are
basically the opposite of block level
boxes because their content is
distributed in lines meaning that an
inline box only occupies the space that
its content actually needs therefore
they also don't cause line breaks after
or before them but instead they just sit
inside their block level parent element
now about the box model things work a
bit different with inline boxes first
the height and width property do not
apply here which means that we cannot
use these properties and second we can
only specify horizontal pairings and
margins on inline elements so only on
the left and on the right side that's
the way the box model works on inline
elements so of course this has some
serious limitations in order to overcome
them there is another type of box and
that's the inline block box now inline
block boxes are technically also inline
boxes but which simply work as a block
level box on the inside so since they
are technically inline elements they
also only use
their content space in cause no line
breaks but since they work as a block
level box on the inside the box model
applies to them just like in a regular
block level boxes and this can be
extremely handy sometimes
now all we need to do in order to set an
element to an inline block is to set its
display property to inline block and
that's it so all of that may sound a bit
confusing but if you try it out in code
like you can do in one of my courses
then it will all make sense all right
number three why do we have to clear
floats and how do we do it and what's
the clear fix class for so first things
first when we have a certain element in
which all the child elements are floated
then we say that the height of the
parent element collapses leaving it with
a height of zero pixels as you can see
this is exactly what happens in the
example here where the gray parent
element is much smaller than its
children which is usually not the case
of course so this is because of us not
clearing the floats and of course this
comes with a lot of problems and
therefore in a situation like this we
have to clear the floats in order to
make it look more like this and this is
how it should be right now we clear
these floats usually with something
called a clear fix a clear fix can be a
class in CSS that we then add to all
parent elements that have all their
child elements floated so in our example
here the section on the right side has
the clear fix on it and therefore it
will have its float cleared now this
clear fix class might look a bit scary
and it's not 100% required to understand
it in order to use it but anyway what
happens basically is that the clear fix
class places a pseudo element after the
element that it's used on and that
pseudo element has the clear property on
it
clearing both the left and the right
floats okay so you can just use this
clear fix class on all your elements
which have all of their children floated
the next question is this one hey Jonas
what's the difference
between the body selector and the
universal selector and that's actually a
great question so maybe you have seen
some code like this where some global
properties are specified in a universal
selector and some other global
properties are specified in a body
selector so I called all of these
properties global properties because
these are basically styles that we want
to apply everywhere on the page but why
then did we specify them in different
selectors and what's the difference
between them well first off with the
universal selector we simply select
every single element on the page and
make the Styles apply to them in this
case margin padding and box sizing and
so then all the elements will have these
declarations now some people still say
that the universal selector is not
efficient but don't worry about that
because that's no longer relevant in
modern web development alright and now
about the body selector and here things
work a bit different so we put styles on
the body selector because it is the
parent element of all the other elements
on our page right and by putting these
Styles here some of them will get
inherited to the child elements through
a CSS mechanism called inheritance now
not all of the CSS properties are
actually inherited and the ones that are
are usually related to font and text and
that's why we see properties such as
line hate font weight phone family in
color on the body selector other
properties like margins and padding's
are not inherited to child elements and
so we have to put these in a universal
selector so that we can still have them
applied to all of our elements alright
so again inheritance allow some specific
properties to basically be passed from
parent to children and by putting these
styles in the body element we make use
of inheritance instead of just putting
all of them in the universal selector
does that make sense now if you actually
want to learn exactly how inheritance
works behind the scenes you can just
check out my advanced CSS course on
udemy com
all right and now the last question that
I get asked all the time how do I Center
a block element both vertically and
horizontally inside another element and
this one is actually pretty simple all
you need is this simple trick we set the
top and left properties to 50% and then
we translate the element back minus 50%
in both directions
does that sound confusing then let me
explain why this works using this
example here only in the vertical
direction but it works the exact same
way in both directions so first we move
the element down 50% by setting the top
property to 50% and these 50% are
actually 50% of the parent elements
height and this is very important so
that is the first step then by using
transform set to translate minus 50% we
move the element back up again by
exactly 50% of its own height so this
time it's not the parent site but the
own elements height okay and with that
the element will stay exactly in the
vertical center and again it works the
exact same way for horizontal centering
so this is a very nice trick to Center
block elements inside of each other and
it's not too complex so you can easily
use it whenever you need it now of
course there are other more modern ways
of doing this
like with flexbox or CSS grid but it's
always good to know the fundamentals of
CSS and that you can easily do it
without the cutting-edge technologies
all right and that's it for my top 5
questions I hope you learned something
new about HTML and CSS in this video but
of course there's so much more to learn
and that's why I published a beginner
