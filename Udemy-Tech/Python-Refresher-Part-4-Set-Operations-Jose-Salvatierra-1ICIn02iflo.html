looking just as a few things that we can
do with lists tuples and cents the first
thing that we can do with a list that we
cannot do with a tuple is to increase
its size so we can I'm gonna just remove
a few elements from these things so
they're a bit easier to understand so we
can do something like grades dot append
a hundred
and what that will do if it will add an
item at the end that's what append means
so when we print grades out which I will
do now I'm going to first clear this
though I'm gonna run the program it's
gonna print grades and I'm sure that you
know what is gonna come out remember
we've got the list with three elements
and then we're adding one at the end
so what comes out is the ordered list
lists are always ordered in the order
that we put elements in so it's not an
ascending order if we change this 450
and we run this again the 50 is still at
the end so it's not ascending order it's
just the order that it was created in so
in this case 77 80 90 and then 50 at the
end
the topple however you cannot do this so
you cannot
increase the size of the top
but what we can do however is to change
the tupple entirely we can say tuple
grades is topple grades plus
100 and notice that this is some very
specific syntax I'm using here and I'm
gonna show you exactly what that is what
I'm saying is couple grades is a box is
a box that currently has this double but
now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say
double grades is a box and as a box that
has this value
notice that the fact that I'm using
tuple grades to assign to topple grades
isn't a problem in Python all that this
will do is it will evaluate the right
site first and then it will put it into
this box so all I will do is it will say
what's topple grades oh that's this
tuple here 77 80 90 and it's gonna add
another tuple to it which is a hundred
notice how there has to be a comma at
the end if there is no comma this is not
a tuple this is a number with a pair of
useless brackets around it so you must
have the comma there if you only have
one element if you have two elements
then you always have the comma there of
course because you need to separate the
elements somehow okay so make sure to
keep the comma and then we're gonna run
this and you can know what's gonna come
out
and it is as you would expect we've not
changed the topple the topple is still
77 1890 what we've done is we have
calculated what it would be to add two
tuples and we've put that in the
variable so we've not actually changed
this double we've only calculated a new
tuple okay
so that is all good but what do I mean
with change the tupple well there is a
few things that we can do I'm gonna
delete that line and I'm gonna say print
and grades zero notice now we've got
some square brackets there and inside it
we've got zero this grades variable is
our list and we know that there is no
value zero in this list so what do you
think this is going to do when we run it
will it give us an error will it print
something out
well let's find out okay so 77 comes out
there is no error and that's because
this zero here is not meaning one of
these values its meaning the position of
the value we always start counting from
zero so grades 0 is the first element
graded to 1 would be the second element
greats 2 would be the third element and
so on so this is index 0 in X 1 and X 2
and obviously because this is a list and
we can change lists we can also say in
crates 0 is 60 and then we can assign a
value to this specific specific element
so I'm gonna see if that and run it
again and what do you think is gonna
come out now we've probably changed
element number zero and now we've
printing the crates after it so what do
you think is going to be printed out
as you would expect the 60 80 90 because
the list has changed we've changed the
zeroth element first element and we've
made his 60 instead of 77
now I'm gonna copy these tuple grades
and paste it in here and what do you
think is gonna happen when we run this
knowing that a tuple is immutable and
you cannot change it
and this is what we get we get a
traceback just a list of what went wrong
and this says that it went wrong in our
file line six and the line that failed
is toppled raids zero equals sixty this
equal sign is called assignment and
that's when we assign a value sixty in
this case to something in this case
tuple grades zero so the error we get is
a type error that it says a couple
object
not support item assignment you cannot
assign things
why because assignment will most likely
change things and you cannot change
things because this is a tuple and
tuples are immutable so this fails
because we cannot change the values in a
table
finally the Saba look at set grades
this is a bit of a funny one because we
know that sets are not immutable so we
should be able to change it but we also
know they are unordered
so if they don't have an order which
element is element number zero is it 77
is it 80 is it 90 is it any of them
so what do you think will happen when we
run the file now
the same thing because it's unordered it
doesn't make sense to access a specific
element because their element may not be
the same every time so we get
essentially the same error a set object
does not support item assignment
however we can add things to a set we
can do that with the add method so we
can say scent underscore grades dot add
and then I added a sixty to it
and as you can see that puts the 60 in
there in the set somewhere and of course
if we run this twice this still only
appears once we don't get an error we
just get nothing because the 60 was
already there when we added it so it
only appears once
okay so this is a few things that you
can do with lists tuples and sets and
we've also looked at exactly what
immutable means and also some things
that you cannot do with tuples and sets
and we've also looked at how to append
elements to a list and that's just doing
grades dot append and then we can append
another element to the list in the next
video we're going to look at some more
advanced than specific set operations
that we can use and they have a very
very particular set of use cases or
scenarios that we may want to use them
in computer science on a software
element so pay attention and ask you in
the very next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
