video I'm going to give you a free
preview of a lesson from my wordpress
for beginners course on udemy calm in
this lesson I'll show you how to edit a
wordpress website page and change the
site title of your WordPress website
in this lesson we're going to transform
this homepage to look something like
this
yes it's simple and we're gonna build on
from here to make it even better later
on but what we need to do is learn how
to change the title of the website up
here
from what it was set at when we actually
created our website and you might have
already created it with the right title
but we're going to learn how to change
that and then we're going to learn how
to customize our homepage to look
something like this with some titles and
image and things like removing the page
header which is right here or the page
title then also removing this page
sidebar right here which we probably
don't want in our home page unless we're
creating a website where the home page
is a blog theme or a blog designed home
page with a list of articles and the
sidebar but for most websites you want a
clean with no sidebar homepage the first
thing we'll do is change the site title
right here so there's a couple of
different ways to do that within this
theme in general what you'll do is
actually go under settings to general
settings here you see the site title and
the tagline let me also show you where
you can edit it under appearance if we
go to customize this brings up a lot of
different theme options so under this
customize menu you can see that there's
this site identity option and here we
have these same things the site title
and the tagline so here I can change to
editor designs and then we also want to
change the tagline because this is
something that the search engines such
as Google will look at in display when
your site appears in the search so we
don't want it to just say just another
WordPress site will want to use our
tagline now this is something that you
want to think of you want to make it
keyword friendly you want to make sure
that it's catchy and it shows some sort
of benefit so that when someone is
actually searching for your website they
see your title and they perhaps see your
tagline and it really makes them want to
click on your website so let me just say
something really quick something like
clean simple
and DIY woodworking projects for
beginners so that's what my website is
going to be about so now if I save and
publish and then refresh what happens is
the site title changes and so now if I
go to this home page which is our home
page and refresh we now have the ebon or
designs title at the top now one thing I
didn't mention is that this is our home
page this home page that I created right
now is just a demo page that I created
it's an extra page so now let's go ahead
and see where that page is so to edit
the home page what you'll have to do is
go to pages and all pages and here you
can see that we have the home page the
front page which we had created and set
as the front page and then this is just
a separate page that I added that you
don't have to do I would just edit the
home page if you want so go ahead and
click Edit home page so now we have our
home page editor and like I mentioned
earlier we have this text editor box and
this is where we add text we add content
to our page so for example we can type
in some words so maybe simple clean DIY
I believe that's what I had said before
simple modern DIY so that could be our
top text now if I want to see what this
looks like on the actual page I can
click this preview changes button this
is this opens up a preview window of our
changes right here so now you can see
this text simple modern DIY I'm gonna go
out and close down this preview window
so now we can just kind of compare these
two pages the demo that I created and
the one we're working on right now so
the first thing I want to do is actually
get rid of this sidebar that's what this
is called
it has different things like here we
have recent post recent comments
archives categories these are called
widgets and we're going to learn how to
edit the widgets later on this sidebar
is something that you can add
to many different pages and it stays the
same for all of the pages and you can
edit this sidebar and the content of the
sidebar and what's in it and it will
change for all of the pages making it
really easy to change what your sidebar
looks like across your entire site so to
get rid of that sidebar there is
typically on most themes an option for
layout now this might appear down here
below the text editor or the content
editor and that's why I appears for this
theme you have a default template a
right sidebar left sidebar a no sidebar
and a full width template so if I change
to the left sidebar let me just do that
and then say preview changes little
sidebar goes to the left if I choose no
sidebar what happens is there's no
sidebar but the width of this content
box is kind of skinny compared to this
one where the width of this content box
is the entire width of the site well at
least the menus of the site so we want
to change this to actually full width
okay so that makes this the full width
of the site okay so now let's go ahead
and add our next text and I can just
type it out or since I already have it I
can copy and paste it so let me put this
text underneath this top text now if I
hit preview changes and look at this the
text at the top simple modern DIY is the
same size as the bottom text so to make
this top text larger in WordPress when
you first install WordPress you have a
few different options for sizes and this
is under this paragraph heading option
drop down menu so if I choose one of
these different heading options it
becomes a different size and width or
boldness so if I preview the changes now
we have simple modern DIY and then in
the bold text but it's a different color
so we're gonna learn how to change that
color in just a minute but let's Center
this text so let's select all of this
text and use this align Center option so
on this top menu we have bolding our
text italicizing we can create bulleted
lists numbered lists we can do a
blockquote which basically indents
whatever we select and highlight and
choose blockquote we can left center or
right justify a line rather and then we
can edit and remove links or hyperlinks
if we want to link out to a separate
page or a separate website there's a
read more tag which we'll get into and
then there's a more options with this
toggle toolbar option which allows more
things like strike throughs horizontal
lines changing the text color clearing
any formatting increasing the
indentation undoing all of those kinds
of things that you want in your typical
text editor one other thing you'll
notice is that we have two tabs visual
and text if you do know HTML you can
actually edit your website using HTML
and we might have to do this for a few
things in the future
and you can see that there's these HTML
tags basically saying that the text
within here simple modern DIY is a
heading 1 style
that's what that h1 represents right
there but for those of us who are
beginners we don't need to do that we
can just use the visual editor okay so
now we have our text if we preview the
changes now it's centered let's add a
photo so to add a photo I'm just going
to return create a new space and then
click this add Media button you can see
that I already added this photo right
here if I want to add a new photo I can
click this upload files select files and
then go to my folder where I have my
images and you can upload images from
wherever but I have an images folder
that I put together for this website so
this is the photo that I uploaded before
I already uploaded it but I just want to
show you that I can upload another image
say this one this is a bath ladder and
now it's uploaded to the website over
here on the right hand side we have the
URL of this photo so if you want to go
directly to this photo file on the
internet you can go to this link we have
a title for this actual photo you can
add captions and alternative text and a
description if you want as well the
alternative text is what appears to the
viewer if they for some reason there's
an issue with loading your image so if
you want you can take this bathroom
title and it's
good idea for search engine optimization
and just for usability to have
alternative text for your images and
then you have your alignment so if you
want to Center it right justify left
justify or if you want to link it to a
custom URL say you have a picture and
you want to link it to a blog article or
another page you can do that then you
have size and we can choose for specific
options thumbnail medium large or the
full size I'm just going to select large
and we can edit this later on too so let
me just say insert into page to see what
this looks like so now we have this
image in our page and if we preview
changes we'll see that this image is on
our page it's a little too big though so
let me go ahead and decrease the size
there's different ways to decrease the
size if I click on this image you see
that we get these little tools on the
corners of this image where I can grab
and literally just shrink the size if we
have a specific size that we want you
can see the numbers appear say we want
this to be 350 pixels wide we can just
see that and edit it that way or we can
go into the Edit menu so click the photo
then click Edit and now you see these
display settings where there's a custom
size option so if I change the width say
I want it to be 300 it's automatically
going to change the height so that it
has the same aspect ratio and it doesn't
get squished here you can also link it
to a custom URL if you want say I want
it just to point back to our home page
we can do that that doesn't really make
much sense it might not be good to link
this to anything unless you do want it
to link out to another page so if we
click update now it's decreased in size
now if I click preview changes we have
this small image right here say I want
to actually edit it and add a caption so
if I add a caption let's just say
bathroom ladder I want to show you what
this looks like so if I add a caption
say update for some reason it went to
the no alignment so let's just select
the photo and Center it now has this
couch
bathroom ladder and if I preview the
changes let's see what it looks like on
this page so now on this page it creates
this sort of outlined box around the
photo with the caption I don't really
like that and I don't really use
captions on my photos much but you might
like that option so I'm just going to go
back edit delete the caption click
update so now we have our website it's
getting closer to what we want it to
look like here we have this image here
we have the text it's a little bit more
spaced out it's a different color and
the other difference is we don't have
this home title page text right here so
first let's just space out this text
here basically what I did was a simple
space between these simple modern DIY so
I put nine spaces in between each one
one two three four five six seven eight
nine and then there was one extra so now
if we preview this it'll look better up
we got to add one more now let's change
this photo so I'm just going to click
this photo remove it go back add media
and now we already have our two files
uploaded so I can select files that I've
previously uploaded select it I'm just
going to use the large and insert into
page now we're getting closer okay so we
see our two pages so how do we get from
here to here first let's change the
color of this text now the color of your
heading text might change how you edit
it depending on your theme but in this
theme we're going to go to our customize
theme options I'm gonna open this up in
a new tab by ctrl or command clicking it
if you're on a Mac under the sparkling
options under typography we have the
heading color option these are the color
headings for all headings h1 to h6 those
are the levels remember we saw h1
heading 1 heading 6 this is just a
default color it's that red that we saw
here that's just the default for this
theme but say we want to change it to
blue we can just click this blue or we
can just pick a custom color
by moving it around maybe we want it to
be sort of a brown because this is
woodworking and we want it to look kind
of like wood something like that might
be kind of cool so if we save and
publish and then we refresh this page
both our page title heading and our
heading right here that we change this
text to changes to brown so now let's
remove this home page title this gets a
little bit advanced but I know you can
follow along removing this depends on
the theme as well and whenever you
download a theme or install a new theme
you might have to search do a little
google search yourself to see how you
remove the page title sometimes on the
Edit Page
page there is an option for removing the
page title and if you don't see all of
the page options or the edit options on
this page what you can do is click the
screen options button right here and
there are different options that aren't
appearing on this editor so say we want
to be able to edit the author and the
comments and maybe some custom fields
let's turn those on and then we can see
down below that we have discussions
authors if we have multiple authors we
can change the author of this page all
kinds of other stuff so these are more
editing options for this page this isn't
going to help us out with the page title
but in some themes that page title
option will appear under your screen
options I hope that makes sense so I'm
just going to turn off those options
right now because I like having a clean
editor so how do we get rid of this page
title so what I did was I searched for
remove page title and sparkling
WordPress and that's all I typed in and
this first option comes from color Lib I
might be short for color library this is
the creator of this WordPress theme and
they give custom CSS that you want to
add that will actually change the
display off so I took this code and what
I also do and this is a little tip for
you is I actually add this to a notebook
or to a Word document or to something so
that if I ever need to change this later
or add it again later I have it
so this is just a tip for you this might
happen with other CSS things as well so
let's go back to our website and where
we add this is under this customize page
where we were before and then under
other and this is where we can add
additional CSS CSS is basically code
that affects the appearance of our
website so I copied that code from that
website and if I paste it here it gets
rid of that page header so you can see
basically what this is saying is that
the page header we want the display to
turn off now I'm a beginner at CSS I'm a
beginner at HTML code but I was able to
figure this out
just by a simple google search and
searching around so if you're using a
different theme you might have to do a
little bit of research yourself so I'm
going to save and publish this now if I
go back to my home page that I've been
editing and refresh now we have our home
page with our title not really the title
of our website but these keywords a
little blurb about the website and our
image and the only difference from
before is the color of the text but now
we know how to go back and color that
text awesome thank you so much for
watching I hope this makes sense if you
have any questions please let me know
otherwise in the next lesson we're going
to be adding to this website and what
we're going to be doing is adding a menu
so this shows our home page our blog
page and perhaps even creating some more
pages that we'll be editing later on
