access the Salesforce administrator
certification exam guide so if you go to
certification salesforce.com it's here
that you'll go in order to download the
latest exam guide that's relevant to the
most current release cycle that sells
forces in at the time of whenever you're
wanting to study for the exam or
register for an exam and so if you click
on credentials or hover over it you see
the different links here for the
different study tracks that are
available for different certifications
and then you click on administrators
that brings you up to the Salesforce
administrator certifications page
there's two different options there's
the regular cells for certified
administrator which is what we're
talking about and as well there's an
advanced administrator certification
which I hold in which I plan to create a
course for but for now what we're
focused on is the certified
administrator certification so if you
click on see details you come to the
landing page with the credential
overview as well as more information on
the exam as far as the number of
questions the passing score the cost etc
the thing that I want to highlight
though is this link to the exam guide it
says for a full exam outline click here
for the exam guys if you click on that
that will open up the certified
administrator exam guide so for this
exam guide we're in the winter 18
release at the time of this recording
and this exam guide will give you some
helpful information around the exam what
I want to highlight is that a lot of
these things are repeat from the website
as far as the number of questions
there's an additional five unscored
questions in the exam nowadays as well
90 minute time frame passing score 65%
registration fee retake fee etcetera and
then here are the different knowledge
areas represented on the exam and their
corresponding lighting now Salesforce
recently in the past release cycle or
two updated this there used to be 15
knowledge areas they've convinced this
down to 12 what they did is they
combined a couple of the smaller
sections and combined them together so
now activity management collaboration
are together rather than separate and so
you will see that we've got different
waiting's for these diff
for knowledge areas and so whenever you
complete the exam or take the
certification test or if you take one of
my practice tests which have available
on udemy you'll receive section level
feedback is percentage scoring for each
knowledge area and so you notice here
that some of these sections have a
greater weighting than others and then
as well in the exam guide there's sample
exam questions now I'm going to be going
through and walking through each of
these sample exam questions and
explaining what is correct and incorrect
of why I'm going to sprinkle those in
throughout the administrator course this
is something that I'm adding in new to
the course I've started doing that in
some of my subsequent certification
courses and I've not done that in the
admin courses so I'm going to be
recording individual lectures for each
of these questions and going into more
detail on these sample exam questions
also I find that that's helpful for
preparing you for the exam and here's
the answers to the exam so the main
thing though and the main point is once
again the way that you get to this exam
guide and you'll want to reference this
throughout the course and as you prepare
for this certification is by going to
certification salesforce.com and looking
for this particular link for the exam
guide I'll link to this in the
description of this video and that'll
take you right to the exam guide as well
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
