regular expressions regular expressions
allow us to search for patterns in
Python strings and they can seem
incredibly intimidating at first due to
their strange syntax we're going to be
walking through the basics of regular
expressions and we will use them in
Django when we talk about URLs alright
let's get started
okay let's begin with the very basics of
regular expressions and we can start by
importing the r-e module for regular
expressions and one of the most common
use cases for the regular expression
module is to find patterns in text so
I'm going to create a list called
patterns and we'll say term 1 and term 2
so these are the patterns I'm going to
be looking for and then I'm going to
have some text to actually parse so I'll
say this is a string with term one but
not the other so now it has term 1
inside of it but it doesn't have the
actual other term and then what I'm
going to do is save for pattern in
patterns I'm going to say prints I'm
searching for and then I'm going to say
pattern so if we save and run this right
now it shouldn't be anything of much
consequence but let's make sure
everything's working so Python notes top
I hit enter it says I'm searching for
term 1 I'm searching for term 2 so let's
show you how you can use the regular
expressions module to actually make that
search so I'm first going to check if
there's a match so I call our e dot and
then the search function for that and it
takes two main parameters the pattern
and the string so it scans through the
string to find the pattern so the first
thing I'm going to do is say search pass
in the pattern I'm looking for and then
pass in the text I want to search for
and this returns true if it finds a
match so
we find the match we're going to say
match else will say prints no match save
this and now let's run the code and here
we can say when I search for term 1 I
find the match because it's inside that
text I'm searching for return to there
is no match it's not inside that text so
re dot search very simple function you
pass in the pattern you're looking for
in text you want to search and you get
back a boolean value indicating if it's
inside than that now often you don't
want the actual boolean value you want
the actual location and if we take a
closer look at this re that search will
notice that it doesn't actually return a
straight boolean value it's actually not
true or false it returns a special match
type it returns a match object and let
me show that to you by getting rid of
this now let's take this all out of that
if loop and instead of saying re search
I'm going to say match is equal to this
and let's take get rid of that : here
and then I'm going to say prints the
type of that match object save this run
our code again and whoops let's actually
say term 1 let's just do one of them
here so I don't need this patterns
anymore save this now let's run it and
look what we get here before we were
treating it as just a straight boolean
value but it's actually this special
regular expressions match object so what
does that actually mean well will this
match object returned by the search
method is more than just that boolean or
none it contains information about the
match so this object already contains
information about where the match starts
and where the match ends and I can grab
it just by saying this match thought
start close parenthesis and if I run
this I actually get back an integer
whoops that should have been outside of
this type save this and now run it again
now I can see it starts at index
position 22 within this string and to
prove that to you let's
this text just say term 1 so I would
expect the match to begin straight at
index 0 so if I run this code again I
get back the number 0 here which makes
sense because my match starts at 0 and
regular expressions also have the
ability to split a string on a
particular pattern so if I say something
like let's say split term so split term
is equal to we'll call it the @ symbol
maybe we want to split something I can
say that my phrase well I'll just say
email is equal to user at gmail.com and
then instead of re dot search I can say
re split and then grab the split term
and then pass in the email address and
let's just print that out and see what
we get
save that and comment that out and then
run our code and out here I get a split
on that @ symbol user and Gmail and
we've seen this before
this is actually built in already to
string so you could just say split as a
method off of this on the @ symbol but
it comes from the regular expression
library so just keep that in mind it's
already built into strings okay so we
learn how to find the match and we learn
how to do a split now a lot of times
there are more complicated patterns that
you're going to be looking for or maybe
you want to find all the instances of a
pattern and you can use re dot find all
to find all the instances of a pattern
in a string let me show you what I mean
by that I'm going to clear all this and
clear this as well and I will say re the
find all and note that Adam is actually
helping us here again it just takes a
pattern in a string and returns a list
of all non-overlapping matches in the
string so I say something like match and
then let's say test phrase match in
middle and I actually print the results
of this out so I can see it when I run
my code I will save this run Python oh
stop I
and here I can see it I get a list of
match and if I add match one more time
in there run this again I can see I get
a list of two matches so I could also
just check the length of find all okay
so we learned about the very basics of
regular expression library calls that
split that search call the match object
but what we're really going to be
spending the bulk of this lecture when
using regular expressions is what is
known as the meta character syntax and
if you've programmed with Perl before
this sort of syntax is going to be
familiar with you but probably for the
most of you it's going to seem really
strange at first but don't worry the
idea here is not to memorize everything
we show but just to be able to use it as
a reference come back to this lecture or
look up regular expression plus Python
on Google and be able to answer your own
questions but let's start off by
actually just showing an example in
order to show examples a multiple
examples at once actually we are going
to create a helper function and this
helper function is going to be called
multi re-find and what it does is it's
going to take in a list of patterns and
some phrase and then it's going to go
through those patterns so for Pat and
patterns what we're going to do say
prints searching for pattern and then
let's say dot format and I'll pass in
Pat there and then I'm going to print
our e find all of Pat in the phrase and
then I will print a new line because
we're going to do this multiple times so
let's save that and that's a function
we're going to be using often so let's
start off with repetition syntax and
there are five ways to express
repetition in a pattern a pattern
followed by the meta character asterisks
is repeated zero or more times so for
instance let's get a test phrase here
and this test phrase is going to be SDS
d dot dot SSS ddd SD
DD s DD DD and you can copy and paste
this from the notes so you don't have to
listen to me talk and then we have D a
bunch of s's three dots here and then s
and a bunch of these okay so the test
pattern that I'm first going to test out
here so test patterns again it's a list
and I'm going to say SD asterisks so
here's my test pattern and what this
stands for is I want to find an S
followed by zero or more DS and keep in
mind that kind of strange wording zero
or more DS so what we're going to do now
is call multi re fine with my test
patterns and I'm going to pass in my
test phrase let's save this and run this
and see what we get out so if I scroll
up here I pretty much get back every
instance of where there is an S I get SD
s SD DD etc which makes sense because
with when you're using the asterisks
this returns this pattern SD followed by
anything repeated zero or more times so
essentially you're kind of asking for
almost anything anything that starts
with an S at least so again the key
thing with this asterisks and let me
kind of separate it this out so we can
kind of get an idea here it's going to
be an S followed by zero or more DS and
the asterisks is attached to that D
there and later on we'll show you how to
attach it to more than one letter okay
so that's not very helpful to just
search for anywhere where there's an S
followed by zero or more DS so if we
want it by one or more these we put a
plus sign so if we look at the results
here this was zero or more DS which
basically asked for anywhere there's an
S now if I run it with one or more DS I
get back these values and this makes a
lot more sense here I get s where it's
followed by any count of these now if I
want it to be just zero or one time I
can input a question mark
I'm going to input a question mark here
save this run it again and now I get
back where it was either zero or one
time again not very helpful but it is
available to you that's the question
mark syntax you'll probably want to know
how do i define a specific count so
let's say I want to know when is it
followed by three DS where you use these
curly brackets passing the number you're
interested in and then run the code and
here I can see wherever it was followed
by 3ds which happened to be three
instances here the first one here second
one here third one here and then four
one over here if you want to specify two
numbers maybe you're looking for two or
three DS you can just pass in two comma
three and this run the code again and we
see here two or three DS in this case
there's no case so let's try to make
this one run this again and now I see
one or three DS great okay so so far
we've shown those special characters
what the asterisk stands for the plus
sign the question mark and then curly
brackets again an asterisks followed by
zero or more a plus sign followed by one
or more the question mark followed by
either 0 or 1 and then the curly
brackets where you can define the actual
number or pass in a list of numbers so
far if I show you what we've done like s
D plus that looks for s followed by one
or more at DS let's say I wanted to find
s followed by several letters or several
singular letters so I want to know where
S is followed by either S or D so again
not together but separate here so let me
know is basically what I'm asking here
where S is followed by one or more SS or
one or more DS so if I save this and run
this we're going to get back a lot of
results so here are all the cases where
the letter S is followed by either one
or more SS or one or more DS and this
makes sense as far as our result because
it basically shows you any statement
that started with an S so this statement
started if an S here start a finesse
here sort of an S here note that we
don't start with an S until we get to
the second letter so that gets SD s
here SSSs and then s DDD okay kind of
weird and confusing I know but again
we're looking more towards being able to
reference this instead of memorizing it
now I want to talk a little bit about
exclusion and we can use the caret
symbol for exclusion now let me show you
how we can do that so let's find the
test phrase that isn't so strange and do
something like this is a string
exclamation mark but it has punctuation
period how can we remove it question
mark
alright so often you're going to get a
string and you want to strip it of all
punctuation and the way we can do that
with regular expressions is by using the
caret symbol which I type like this that
caret symbol shift on 6 to exclude terms
and for example what we do is we end up
passing it inside of square brackets so
square brackets caret symbol and then
you pass in any symbols that you're
looking for so for instance we'll look
for an exclamation mark a period a
question mark and then we say plus
because we're looking for one or more
instances of that and that's the test
pattern okay so now if we run this I say
Python note stop I look at the result I
get back I essentially get back a list
so it's searching for the pattern here
but because it has this caret symbol
it's going to remove anywhere you can
essentially think of it as almost like a
multiple split call so here saying find
all but that special character the caret
lets it know that I want to essentially
remove all this and then later if I have
this list I could just join it all back
together or do whatever I wanted with
those strings inside there okay now
let's discuss a few more examples that
we probably won't run into during the
course but may be useful to actually see
one of those is a sequence of lowercase
characters you can just say lowercase a
dash lowercase Z and this will return
sequences of lowercase characters so if
I run this now we see the sequences of
all the lowercase characters so this you
see the capital T has been removed if I
want sequences of uppercase characters I
just capitalize a
through Z here run this and then I get
the capital letters and there's a lot
more you can do with this sequences of
lower and uppercase letters one
uppercase letter followed by lowercase
letters etc you can check out the notes
for all those patterns but we won't be
using these too often and then finally
you can use escape codes there's special
escape codes to find specific types of
patterns in your data such as digits non
digits whitespace and more and those are
indicated using a backslash so like I
mentioned the escapes are indicated by
prefixing the character with a backslash
unfortunately a backslash must itself be
escaped in a normal Python string so the
way we do that is by making it into a
literal value with the letter R and this
is where it kind of looks really weird
because it almost looks like it should
give an error but we type in our outside
of the string there then a backslash and
then the special code for the escape so
for instance D and then we can say plus
here and this is the kind of regular
expression that you look at it and it
almost looks like a different language
you think it's an error it's not going
to be Python but this will actually work
and this will return back a sequence of
digits so let me change the string
there's something more appropriate with
this is a string with numbers put in
some numbers there and a symbol and for
the symbol we can put something like
hash tag we will save that and then if I
run this code I get back the numbers so
a lowercase D is essentially a special
character code saying search for those
numbers or digits if I want non digits
that's a capital D run this and I get
back all the non digits if I want
sequence of whitespace
that's a lowercase s again all of these
with the escape backslash and the R and
then I get a list of all the whitespace
not super useful also I want to count
how much white space there is capital s
for the non white space so we can get
the idea that capital kind of goes with
non so this is all the non whitespace if
I want all the alphanumeric characters
those are
letters and numbers I can do a lowercase
W and that gives me back all the
alphanumeric if I want the non
alphanumeric that's gonna be something
like the hash tag I can do a capital W
and that gives me a bunch of blanks and
then I get the hash tag there so the
spaces are also non alphanumeric okay so
in conclusion by now you should have a
solid understanding of how to be able to
reference the regular expressions now
there are a ton of more special
character instances and if I say
something in the Django sections that we
haven't covered yet I'll be sure to kind
of give a little extra explanation of
what we're doing we won't do anything
super intensive regular expressions in
Django essentially we'll be just using
them with URLs to kind of figure out
okay am I going to calm slash admin or
slash views slash URL slash etc okay
hopefully you weren't super intimidated
by this and you got a little bit of a
good feel for what to expect when you're
viewing regular expressions again I
don't expect you to memorize any of this
thanks everyone and I'll see you at the
