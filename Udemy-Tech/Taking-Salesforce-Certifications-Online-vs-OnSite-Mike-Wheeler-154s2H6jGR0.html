between taking the exam online versus
on-site and so I'm inside of web
Assessor comm in my own web Assessor
account I've got a different
certification in view here and this is
for the certified community cloud
consultant I chose this because this is
a certification that I don't personally
hold I couldn't show the process of
registering for the platform app builder
exam because I've already passed that
certification a while back so you notice
whenever though you go to register for
an exam you can expand these options by
clicking the plus minus sign to reveal
the different options and there's two
primary things to note here there's the
on-site proctored or online proctored
choices and so it's really up to you
what you prefer as far as going to a
testing center or testing at home and so
if you choose to try and locate a
testing center the way that this works
and this is kind of confusing is let me
expand that again is that you click to
register for an on-site proctored choice
for the exam you try to register for and
then it's point in from my user account
the state of Tennessee that's where I'm
located and you can filter by city as
well and here's the available testing
centers and so let's say that for
instance if I wanted to test on-site in
Nashville for example I would select
this particular location in Nashville
and you can view a map of these
different locations as well and then you
click select
now this next screen it shows you the
available testing times for the center
that you selected these will vary by
location this gives you the address here
and then you can page through the
calendar here and this reveals to me
that this particular location which this
is actually Goodwill Industries of
Middle Tennessee I know a few people in
my area that have gone there to test and
it looks like they do their tests on
Tuesdays and so with the holiday on the
first it looks like they're not doing
any testing on that particular Tuesday
and so this really varies by your
location and it depends on what days and
times you have available so if you want
to go inside
you just select a date that you want to
do and then once you've selected a day
here's the available time
that are available some of these slots
may be already registered by other test
takers and so several years ago when I
took the initial developer 401
certification exam there was nothing in
Nashville available and I actually drove
to Bowling Green Kentucky because I was
the nearest testing center that had
times available for me so you do want to
schedule your tests in advance and then
as well some things to bear in mind
whenever you go on side I'm gonna cancel
out of this though is that they don't
allow you to have anything on you when
you're taking the exam so they'll take
and lock up like your purse or wallet
cell phone etc and at least when I went
for my initial exam on site they allowed
me a couple of pieces of paper and a
pencil and that was it so for example
here's another certification that I
don't currently have and so going back
to this if you do a on-site proctored
once again I'm going to that sort of
option and show you that you may be able
to find other locations that have more
availability for testing the one that I
happen to look at just had Tuesdays and
so let me just pick one in New York
let's pick the Brooklyn College Office
of testing and select and so the main
thing to point out here is that you have
to select a testing location before you
can see availability in here none of
these are active and so it looks like
there's not much available in that
location so you really want to narrow
down your selection on side and if
that's not an option you may have to
just resort or you may prefer to do an
online certification and so with that
let me show you what that looks like and
we looked at this a little bit
previously but you simply select the
date that you wish to take the exam and
this would be the online proctored
experience and so it's good idea to
select your time zone so that they know
what you're dealing with and then you
see that these different dates that are
blocked off or available so it looks
like January 1st is blocked off it's a
Sunday and it's a holiday on Monday for
example to do online Proctor's from 6:00
a.m. until 11:45 p.m. so there's a lot
of availability there and another thing
that I want to point out is how to test
your equipment if you're doing online
proctored exam
you have to have a webcam and and let me
pull up the information on that and I'll
share this link with you as well in the
resources section of this lecture okay
so I found the online proctoring guides
for both Windows and Mac and these are
linked somewhere and web Assessor I
never can find it and I think those
don't really reveal themselves until
you've registered for the exam and this
is something that will be helpful to you
guys if you're wanting to take your test
at home or remotely and so these online
proctoring guides just really depends on
if you're using a Windows or Macintosh
machine and so you can use a laptop to
take your test or a desktop type of
computer and then you've got to have an
external video camera and that's because
the camera needs to be placed at like
roughly a 90 degree angle to one side to
where they can see your head and your
computer screen in your hands and your
surroundings and so in these proctoring
guys it goes through some of the system
requirements and I'll leave that to you
for you to review as it corresponds to
your own operating system gives you some
helpful tips on preparing for your
online proctored exam and then verifying
the technical requirements and then you
know some of this may be a little
extreme there's also a link in here
somewhere for testing your equipment
here it is this criterion online comm /
the port I'll make this link available
as well in the resources section so if
you click on this this takes you to a
screen on Criterion where you can
actually test your gear very helpful so
just to review that I clicked on the
online proctoring learn more link and
that takes you to this page to where you
can get started to test your webcam
microphone and speed check this would be
for your internet speed which is not
really high levels speed required but
here's some helpful videos as well to
show you like the angling of your camera
placement I'll leave that to you to
review that but that is very helpful and
then taking your enrollment photos so I
encourage you to go through this take
these steps 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 I'll link to these
as well in the resources section and
then getting started for this test here
you can allow this website to check your
gear you can close that and select allow
and here I am recording live this is
pretty cool actually
to get to see my surroundings and so
when you're ready to begin your test you
just click begin test and this is
exciting I might edit some of this out
so one thing to note is this is testing
my webcam that's attached to my laptop
you will need to test your external
webcam the one that you place to the
side so then the test runs and then it
measures your download speed and your
upload speed you notice I'm a Comcast
cable internet subscriber I'm suffering
on Comcast if only I had Google Fiber
available in my area but I digress
upload speed is quicker than download
speed what's up with that
I mean seriously so you get your results
and then there's details on what the
requirements are and so it's just 1
megabyte upload and download supposedly
as always needed although I've had
issues with the speed being too slow
when it was actually faster than that so
your results may vary I'm gonna close
this out or go back actually to get
myself off the screen basically but
there's also on here information on the
testing center as well which is helpful
you want to explore and so the
proctoring guide as well I'm in the
Windows proctoring guide now we were in
the Mac one earlier and this may vary a
little bit as far as software it looks
like Windows 10 is not supported or
compatible and then details around the
video webcam and then once again here's
the same link for testing your equipment
and then as well another step in this is
that you need to install the Sentinel
secure software they change this all the
time and so even if you've previously
tested it's always a good idea to go in
and install the latest software and so
this guide will run you through that as
well
it takes you to the process of creating
your biometric profile these are all
things that you need to do when you test
remotely online proctored if that's your
option and so this is all in an attempt
to make sure that you are who you say
you are and not cheating during the exam
as well or having someone else sit for
the exam for you for instance and so go
through the appropriate proctoring guide
if you want to do online and be sure and
check out the resources section of this
particular lecture and there's a lot
there for you and then one final thing
that I wanted to point out as well these
are some other common things that pop up
trying to do online proctoring as you
may need to like do rescheduling of your
test or cancel a test or that sort of
scenario and so if you click on the help
link once you're logged in to web
Assessor it takes you to this page here
with some answers to some commonly asked
questions there's also support phone
numbers email support numbers etc and so
if you run into any issues when you're
trying to either register for the exam
or take the test or trying to even
launch the test and you have some
technical issue and trust me you will
have a technical issue if you try to do
this online it just is inevitable as if
you don't have enough to keep in your
mind and to keep track of and worry
about you will be tested with technical
difficulties and so just be prepared for
that
and you'll get through it and here's
some helpful phone numbers and email
addresses etc to get you through that so
with that said it's up to you to decide
if you want to go online or on-site to
take your test but do get that exam
scheduled once you feel like you're
properly prepared and ready and in the
next lecture we're going to talk about
test taking strategies I have passed a
lot of these tests and I filled some
tests as well and I've got useful tips
and advice for you on how to approach
the actual test taking experience in
order to maximize your odds of passing
the first time and then even what to do
if you fell as far as what to do after
taking the test to improve your odds of
passing the second attempt if that ends
up happening and so stay tuned as we
talk about test taking strategies in the
next lecture
