here in this video you're going to learn
all about the basics of angular 4 which
in the end is just the latest version of
angular 2 now this video is actually
taken from my complete guide to angular
a more than 16 hours long five-star
rated udemy course where I deeply dive
into angular 4 now if you feel like you
want to learn more about angular after
finishing this video you're of course
invited to join this course you'll find
a link for huge discount in the video
description
but even if you decide not to join this
event you should walk you through the
basics I'm just mentioning the course
because from time to time I will say we
will learn this later or you can find us
attached to this lecture and both won't
work here in this video
I can't attach files to a YouTube video
but you won't need to download anything
everything you will need for this video
is the project setup which I will
explain in this video with that enjoy it
and hopefully you'll learn a lot about
angular
welcome to my complete guide on angular
is so great to have you on board in this
course you're going to learn what
angular is and how you can use it to
build awesome front-end web applications
with it very reactive web applications
with great user experiences for that
throughout this course you're going to
learn all the individual building blocks
which make up angular before we then
also dive into the more advanced
features and we're going to build a
project throughout the course putting
all these things you'll learn in theory
kind of in which you practice throughout
the course into the perspective of a
real project so that you can see how you
would apply them there and that you can
see how you build up a real web
applications with the things you learn
here so with that I'd say let's dive
into it and let's dive into the most
important question first what is angular
angler is a framework which allows you
to create reactive single-page
applications a nice sentence but what
exactly does it mean a single-page
application is an application like this
the project we're going to bow
throughout the course you can navigate
around there and in the URL you can see
that we seem to with a different pages
but in the end our page never changes
it's only one HTML file and a bunch of
JavaScript code we got from the server
and everything which you see here every
change is rendered in the browser now
why is that awesome because it gives the
user a very reactive user experience
javascript is much faster than having to
reach out to a server for every page
change and for every new piece of data
you want to display and therefore this
approach allows you to create web
applications which look and feel almost
like mobile applications very fast
everything happens instantly and if you
do need some data from a server you
simply load it in the background so that
the user never leaves this experience of
having a reactive web application to use
so every click I do here simply changes
this one single page we're using this
one HTML page and how is it done well
JavaScript changes the Dom changes
whatever is displayed here changes the
HTML code during runtime so to say that
is why you never see that refresh icon
on the top left spin because we're only
changing the currently loaded page and
you can even see that if you inspect the
source code of a page like this that is
the HTML file and as you can see it
doesn't seem to contain the content you
are seeing on this page we only have one
single HTML element which doesn't seem
to be a built-in one a native one but
that's angular doing its shop and
throughout the course you're going to
learn what exactly happens here and how
angular does test job
so that is what anger does for you it
allows you to create very reactive
single page applications re-rendering
parts of the Dom to update the page but
you might also have heard that there is
angular 1 anger 2 and Engler 4 and what
do all these versions mean well angler 1
was the first angular version it was
released a couple of years ago and
became very popular because it allowed
us for almost the first time to create
web applications like the ones shown in
the last video to create these great
user experiences with JavaScript angular
2 was a complete rewrite of angular 1
and was released in the last year it's
an awesome framework and that's the
future of angular but it doesn't have
much in common with angular 1 so simply
forget everything you know about angular
1 or if you haven't learned it already
don't learn it at all
angular 2 or just angular how it is
called now is the future and it is that
renaming of angular 2 to just angler
which explains what angular 4 is it's
simply the next version and version free
was simply skipped queue to some
internal reasons so that simply it's the
next version of angular 2 you could say
and therefore also the future of angular
but unlike angular 2 was for angular 1
angle of 4 is not a complete rewrite of
angular 2 and this whole course of
course is updated to the latest angular
version
now that we learned what angular is
let's mold our first angular application
since this is the best way of finding
out how it works now throughout this
whole course I'm going to use the
angular CLI command line interface this
is simply a toolset which makes creating
managing and building your angular
applications very simple it quickly
creates new angular projects and then
you have some commands you can use to
build that project for production and so
on why do I use the CLI and not just
import the angular framework in an
existing index.html page because angular
is a very futuristic framework and
therefore it uses features like
typescript which is a superset of
JavaScript which needs to be compiled
before it runs in the browser so it has
some extra steps we have to take into
account during development and doing
that manually can really be a pain
that's why this Eli is really an awesome
solution will be used in this course
later in the course though I do have a
section where I do explain how you could
build your own project from scratch but
even then it will be more than just
importing a script file so for TC live
what we need is node J s node J s is a
server-side language and no worry we're
not going to write any server-side code
we simply need no chairs because this
Eli needs it behind the scenes that does
some things with it to build our project
and to manage our dependencies the
packages we use like the angular
framework itself and it also spins up a
little development server which will
host our app on our local machine making
it easy for us to test it so make sure
to download the latest version of
node.js here simply download it and go
through the installer should be very
straightforward and once you are done go
back to this page and here you basically
see all the instructions we're going to
run through in the next seconds together
so we will need to open a terminal
window on Linux and Mac or simply -
command line on Windows and once you did
this like this we simply run the
following command to install the seal I
after you install node.js that's
important on your machine npm that's the
node package manager
which was installed together with no
chairs and one of the main reasons why
we had to install no chairs to begin
with install then - chief were global to
install it globally on your machine at
angular seal I at angular seal I simply
as deep package we're using the seal I
itself now on Linux and Mac you may need
to put a sudo in front of that on
windows that will not be required and
then maybe after being prompted for the
password this will run for the
installation and download the seal I on
your machine and install it if you're
encountering any problems during that
check out the lecture after this one
where I will do some troubleshooting
highlight some common problems and how
you may debug that and get this to run
correctly if then it still won't work
open a Q&amp;amp;A thread and I'm happy to help
well I'll be back once this finished so
the CLI installation successfully
finished for me here the next step is to
create a new angular project with it
for this you should navigate in the
terminal here into the folder where you
want to create a project so with the CD
command now I already am in the folder I
want to create it and then the command
to create a new angular project is to
run ng that command is available since
we installed the angular CLI so ng will
refer to that CLI new to create a new
project and then your project name I'll
simply name it my first app of course
choose any name you like here that will
also be the folder name off the folder
which gets created where this project
will be stored then simply hit enter to
create this new application and now this
will take a couple of seconds it will
basically install all the required
dependencies for example the angular
framework itself and it will inform you
once it's finished so I'll be back once
this is done the creation of the project
finished for me and now I can navigate
into this newly created folder with CD
my first app and here we can run this
project with ng serve what this will do
is it will build all our source code as
angular uses typescript which needs to
be compiled to JavaScript more on this
in a later lecture and then it will spin
up a little development server running
at this address here where we can see
our running app why do we need a server
and don't simply double-click the
index.html file well due to the nature
how England works it loads a lot of
resources dynamically once it runs and
we can only simulate how it would really
look like on a real server if we use the
HTTP protocol which we don't use when
double-clicking on a file so with that
since we know that it will run at
localhost 4200 we can simply visit this
page by entering it in our browser and
we should see app works which basically
some dummy text created by this Eli
showing us that it indeed works that is
how we can set it up in the next lecture
let's edit this app and dive into it and
see what this Eli exactly did create for
us
I hope the project we created in the
last lecture in a webstorm di de I'm
going to use throughout this course now
webstorm is only one option and a ver
great options as editors to work in this
course would be Microsoft Visual Studio
code or editors like sublime text or the
atom editor you can simply download them
all these options are available for free
and would allow you to follow along just
like I do here now in this project you
see a couple of folders and files were
created and that might look intimidating
at the beginning but most of the files
you see here are only required for
configuring the project and the default
configuration should be absolutely fine
the e2e folder will be required for
end-to-end testing something I won't
dive into right now and in the source
folder that is where you create your
project now here we find even more files
but again all these files here don't
really have to be touched here you can
simply again do some specific
configuration for your project also
something you probably won't need and
most importantly the index.html file is
the single page our app is going to
serve but you don't need to change
anything here we're going to write all
our code in the app folder the assets
folder could be used to store some
static assets in your application like
images and the environments folder can
be used for environment variables if
that's something which doesn't tell you
anything you probably don't need it here
and these are really just features you
have available since the CLI is there to
help you with both simple projects when
you just get started or build real big
enterprise level applications once you
get a little bit more experience so it's
the app folder which is important for us
now and if we go back to the page we
created we see app works here now app
works that is something we also find if
we have a look at this app component dot
TS file dot TS for typescript and again
we're going to dive deeper into this and
see how exactly all these files here
works together right at the start of the
next section in the course which we will
reach shortly if we have a look at this
file though we see app works here and
even if you don't fully
and the rest of this file this seems to
be what we see on the page so if we
change this to does this change question
mark and we get save with and that's
important and she serves still running
because that process needs to be running
all the time since it will watch your
files for changes and automatically
recompile them and reload your project
in the browser you should see does this
change in the browser without reloading
it since this ng serve window did this
for you
so dad seems to be the place where we
can make a change and this HTML page
here probably also has something to do
with it because even though the text
isn't to be found here instead it is
strange double curly braces fing here we
clearly see the h1 tag here and if we go
back to our application to me this
really looks like a heading style with
h1 tag and we can confirm this if we
inspect that indeed Rome developer tools
this is a h1 element containing the
dusties change text so that seems to be
what angular does for us and as a side
note this all shows you how angular
changes your HTML code to Dom at runtime
because if you have a look at the page
source so what was downloaded from this
development server spun up through ng
serve use use that here we don't have a
h1 tag anywhere we simply have to add
root element here something to which I
will come back shortly
which seems to be responsible for
loading our app which Danone term seems
to replace this content in the page with
the content we defined here in this app
component HTML file and that is indeed
the case in angular we use components to
build our web application and the app
component is the one component with
which we start which defines what we see
at the page we load at the first time
now let's change more about this page
and I'm going to use some feature in
which we are going to dive deeper into
later in the course but let's say we
want to add an input here type text to
allow the user to enter some text and
then we simply want to output this right
below the input now with normal
JavaScript you would
have to manually set up a listener to
any changes of the input value get this
value and then somehow get access to
this paragraph and output it their
angular makes this really simple all you
have to do here is add square brackets
with parentheses inside of them and then
ngmodel in between and again we're going
to learn what exactly that means it's an
angular command I can tell you that much
and then we can bind to name let's say
so put name between double quotation
marks dad sets up cue web binding and it
allows us to bind to a property of our
app component type script file which is
connected to the HTML file you could say
the HTML is what you see and the types
could file is your business logic so
here we could remove this title property
in this class classes are a typescript
feature you might know them from our
object orientated languages and here we
can now add a name property which we
initially set to an empty string let's
say so name here and name and the HTML
file now we set up a connection and as
mentioned before we're going to have a
closer look at this connection later now
let's use the syntax we saw before with
the double curly braces which seems to
simply output something to the template
and let's put name in between here to
referencing to this same property if we
now save this and again with ng serve
still running it will automatically
recognize this change and recompile the
code and we go back to our application
we now see this input field and nothing
else but watch what happens if I type my
name here if I enter max you see it
appear right below this input field and
it updates with every keystroke and if
we inspect us here we see it here on the
right and there you can also see how
that gets changed dynamically and this
is exactly why you use frameworks like
angular with only two lines here and one
line here you get something which would
require more lines in vanilla JavaScript
and more importantly which is managed
for you so this connection we
up here with ngmodel is now always
managed by angular and even if you
change some other code that is something
which will always update dynamically and
even if you were to change name
somewhere else let's say you add another
input on another component which we're
going to add later it would still update
this name here if you setup the right
connection and this is really what makes
angular awesome it allows you to create
very reactive applications which updated
Omri actively on every keystroke for
example with just--all some lines of
code here now let's see what this course
offers you before we then dive deeper
into it and fully understand what we
just did here
what does this course offer you we're
just getting started and we just built
and edited our first angular application
but of course we didn't fully understand
what we did there so that's why in the
next lecture we're going to dive into
the basics of angular what are
components what did we do there with
this two-way data-binding and how does
that all work this section will answer
it and we'll take a very detailed look
at it and we'll also explain how all
these files you saw in your project are
connected to each other well then we're
going to have a look at components and
data binding two important key features
and we actually saw both already in our
first application angular apps are built
up from components and data binding is
simply how you output data in your Dom
in the end or as we will also learn
react to user events angular has another
key feature directives ng model which we
used with two-way data-binding
actually is such a directive and you
will learn more about the built-in
directives in this section and also very
important build your own directives nice
little helpers instructions you can
place in your templates in your HTML
code which will then do something at
runtime depending on the commands you
wrote and they're well and after having
a look at this we're going to learn more
about services and dependency injection
a core feature of angular which makes it
really easy for you to have your
different pieces in your app communicate
with each other
to centralize code and really to manage
the state of your application once we're
finished with that it's time to have a
look at the routing because thus far we
will only have been on one page well
we're always on one page since it's a
single page application but to the user
it really looked like one page with
routing we introduced the management of
different URLs so that to the user it
looks like we're switching pages even
though technically we will still remain
on that single page sounds great it is
and routing shows you how it works then
it's time to have a look at observables
something which will make more sense
once you've been to the routing section
it is a concept allowing you to work
with asynchronous code angular embraces
it it's really powerful and this section
explains how it works
then we'll have a look at forms because
handling forms handling user input is a
key task of almost any application and
this section takes a very close look at
it after we're done with forms we're
going to have a look at pipes another
nice feature which makes it easy for you
to transform the output so what you
display on the template at runtime
well we're nearing the end but not
before having a look at HTTP what if you
need to reach out to a web server what
if you need to store some data in a
database angular can't connect to a
database directly but it can connect to
a server which is able to nt HTTP
section shows just that thereafter we'll
have a look at authentication
what does authentication mean in an
angular application how does it worry
and once we're added let's simply
implement it in an application then
we're going to have a look at some
optimizations we can put into place and
how we can manage different modules in
our application something you will
really understand once we are at this
point and then we're going to deploy an
application learn how we can get our
angular application from our local
machine to a place in the Internet where
we can view it and if that's not enough
for you we're also going to have a look
at animations and testing angular
applications and besides that throughout
the whole course we're going to pull a
real project putting all these things
you learn in the individual sections
into practice and therefore seeing how
they are used in a real project so with
that I feel very confident you're going
to be an angular master after finishing
this course and I can't wait to start
this journey together with you
no worries we're about to get started
soon but I did mention that we're going
to use typescript in this course we
already did use it when we changed the
first app what is typescript typescript
really is just a superset to JavaScript
it offers more features than vanilla
JavaScript like classes interfaces and
very important which gives it the name
types strong typing so you define in
typescript if a certain variable is a
number a string or something else you
don't do this in vanilla JavaScript
there you have dynamic typing you can
have a string variable and then you
assign a number and that's totally fine
that won't work in typescript it will
give you an error and therefore it
allows you to write much more robust
code which gets checked at the time you
write it and not just at the time you
run it a great enhancement
however typescript doesn't run in the
browser so it is compiled to JavaScript
in the end and this compilation is
handled by the CLI one of the reasons
why we need the CLI why we need a
project management tool like the CLI now
this compilation is really fast and
therefore in the end in the browser
javascript is going to run we're not
writing the angular app in JavaScript
though because was technically possible
that won't be much fun a lot of the
features really only exist in typescript
and angular is meant to be used together
with typescript that being said you
don't have to learn typescript for this
course you should be able to pick it up
along the way and I do have a whole
section giving you a brief introduction
into typescript at the end of this
course so feel free to jump ahead there
go through that section right now if you
feel like you need it or throughout the
course if you feel like you need some
deeper dive into some of the features
you see there and you should be fine you
should be able to follow along just fine
of course if you feel like it feel free
to pick up an average course or tutorial
focused on typescript so that you have
something to look at if something is
unclear in this course generally though
typescript is an addition to JavaScript
not a complete replacement so a lot of
the commands will look really familiar
Peralta's course I'm often going to
start with a brand-new project and you
can basically generate this project with
ng new however there are two things I
will have in this project first of all I
will probably have an empty HTML file if
not I'm going to provide a starter
project in the respective course section
and here I will also remove that
property in the app component types good
file and additionally and that's
important I'm going to use bootstrap
this CSS framework to have some nice
styling out of the box now in general to
add frameworks like this in a SIL I
project you can import the import in the
index.html file so add the link here to
the CDN for example or to a local file
but there is a more elegant way you can
install it with NPM this node package
manager we have on our machine since we
installed nodejs you can simply open up
a terminal and here you can now run in
this project folder that's important
navigate into this folder and PM install
- - save - mark it as a production
dependency bootstrap this will now
download it and put it into this project
folder and then you are able to easily
import it there how do you import it
there in a CLI project you simply open
the angular CLI JSON file this
configures your project and there you
will have this Styles array it allows
you to define some imports of global
style sheets which will apply to your
whole application it already references
these Styles dot CSS file here so that
is a nice follower you can add your
global Styles your own styles and now
we're just going to add a reference
there to the bootstrap folder and to the
bootstrap CSS file we just downloaded to
do this we need to reference this node
modules folder which in the end holds
all these third-party packages our
project users and to go there we need to
go up one level because this has to be
seen relative on from the index.html
file which is a new source folder now
we're on the root folder then we visit
node modules then we can go to bootstrap
and you can find this folder in this
node modules folder if you look for it
by the way don't be worried about all
these packages here they won't be needed
- deployed once you ship your app to a
server most of them are only required
for development and the end everything
will be bundled into one single file by
the CLI so we have bootstrap this folder
here then there it will be did this
folder CSS and there you should find a
bootstrap dot min dot CSS file and that
is the default setup I'm going to use
Fratus project so if you now run ng surf
and again this is just a normal terminal
window and then keep ng surf running of
course whilst you're working on your
project you should see that now we have
an empty page basically since I deleted
everything else and we do but you should
also see that bootstrap is getting
imported and you can't help by having a
look at the head section these styles
here here bootstrap was indeed added so
that is the default starting project
with which I'm going to start a lot
throughout the course you can set it up
right now and simply save it so that you
can easily copy it for the individual
sections or you create it like this
whenever I start with a fresh new
project again in some sections I'm also
going to provide a starter project and
with dead let's finally dive into and
let's learn how all these files are
connected and how we can build awesome
angular applications
so now that we get started with this
course and with angular and our project
we're going to use in this course it's
time to dive deeper into angular to
understand what it really does what
happens behind the scenes how an angular
app gets started in the first place and
which base building blocks it offers us
how we can build angular apps and which
features we may use for this by the end
of the section you will understand how
you can build your basic angular
application what it then does and what
you need to change to reach a different
result
so with this let's dive into it and
let's start by having a look what
actually happens when we visit this page
in the browser when we reload this page
how does angular get started what do we
actually see here besides nothing
because there is more to this page than
it might look like
CEL Dez's the page as we see it right
now in the project we created at the end
of the last section a empty page here
angular the complete guide we reach it
at localhost 4200 this is where our
development server hosted by the C lie
or spun up by the CLI will host our
angular application now the content we
see here can be changed by going to the
app component HTML file in our app
folder and in here we can output some
text let's say I'm in the app component
here in an H Freitag a normal HTML tag
therefore if we save this we will see it
here and it automatically has the
bootstrap text style and so on because
we added bootstrap at the end of the
last section to you but less it might
seem kind of obvious that did we see it
here it is also kind of strange how does
our browser or how does the server
hosting our app know that it should
render the content of app component HTML
here you could argue it's the only
component we have right now and we will
take a closer look at component soon but
that is not the reason and actually this
is not the file served by the server
instead the index.html file here is
served by the server and remember that I
told you that angular is a framework
which allows you to create single page
application this is the single page
which is served the index.html file now
if we have a look at this file we see
this is a normal HTML file we define the
title we could see on the tab in the
browser here and the body of this file
is very interesting here we get this app
root thing with loading dot dot dot in
between now clearly we don't see it
loading dot dot dot here so somehow this
index.html file seems to have changed
and did a brute here of course is not a
default HTML element instead of this one
of our own components we will soon dive
into how we create our own components
but the seal I created one for us the
root component of our application the
component which will tie together our
whole application in the end and all the
files in the app folder here which have
component in their name so these files
are related to this component I will go
into more detail about these files in
one of the next lectures for now let's
take a closer look at the app component
dot T has filed a typescript file here
here you can see that we have this add
component decorator this seems to be
important but more importantly right now
you see there we have this select or
property which assigns a string as a
value and this string holds app root
now this clearly is the same text as in
our index.html file and this actually is
the information angular needed to be
able to replace this part here in this
index.html file with the template of
this component the component having this
selector and the template of this
component simply is the content here in
this app component HTML file now whilst
I will dive deeper into how to create
components and how to configure them
this is what basically happens at the
startup though the missing information
is how is angular triggered how is it
kicked off to actually run over our body
here of this index.html file and the
answer is in the final index.html file
getting served in the browser and we can
verify this by inspecting the source
code here we get a couple of script
imports at the end these are injected by
this CLI automatically so that is why we
don't see it here in the raw index.html
file here we don't have any script
imports but whenever it is ng serve
process rebuilds our project it will
create bundles JavaScript script bundles
and automatically add the write imports
in the index.html file a little
convenience functionality for us so in
the final file these script imports here
are present and these script imports
will contain our own code too
so these script files are therefore
executed and they are actually the first
code to be executed and that is just
something you have to keep in mind is
the code we write on our main dot TS
file that is why it's called main this
is the first code which gets executed
let's have a closer look at it then here
you see that we get a couple of imp
words then we check if we are in
production mode or not you basically
turn off some warning messages I can
tell you that but most importantly here
this line this now bootstraps starts our
angular application by passing a app
module
Tudor's method and app module refers to
this file here now if we have a look at
this file here we actually see that
somehow we kind of like with the
component have two strange at thing here
I will dive into this in a couple of
lectures too but most importantly for
now here we get this bootstrap array
which basically lists all the components
which should be known to angular at the
point of time it analyzes our index.html
file and here the circle closes because
here we reference our app component so
angular gets started this main dot ts
file gets started
there we bootstrap an angular
application and we pass this module as
an argument in this module we tell
angular hey there is this app component
which you should know when you try to
start yourself an angular now analyzes
the app component reads the set up we
pass here and therefore knows this
selector a bruit and now angular is able
to handle app root in the index.html
file and it knows all right this is the
selector I know you told me that I
should know it because it was listed in
this bootstrap array in the app module
this component so now I know that here I
should insert the app component and the
app component happens to have some HTML
code a template attached to it which is
this a tree attack
and this is how the angular application
starts here this is why we see what we
see now that was a load of information
regarding the app startup but it's key
to understand how to starts with this
information we can now proceed and dive
deeper into how components actually work
what they are how we can create our own
ones and what does app module here does
in detail so let's move on
in the last lecture we had a closer look
at what happens at the point of time we
wizard localhost 4200 here in the
browser we understood that the
index.html file is served that it will
contain a bunch of scripts here which
can execute it which then basically
start the angular app the angular app
gets the important information that it
should know the app component that it
should analyze it with that information
the angular code is able to parse this
here this app root component here
understand it and insert our angular
application at this point and that is
why we don't see loading dot dot dot
which would still be in the source code
of this page as you can see but instead
why we see this because angular
overrides this at run time because there
as well what it does what what its job
is so now that we had a close look at
this startup process let's have a closer
look at this component or add components
in general components are a key feature
in angular you build your whole
application by composing it from a
couple of components which you create on
your own now we do start with this app
component the root component you should
say which holds our and our entire
application basically in the end so this
root component this app component will
be the component where we later nest or
add our other components to so to this
template as HTML file off the app
component this is where we will layer
add our other components typically we
might have a web page like this with
header with home and users than a main
area and a sidebar maybe now if we have
a look this would be a fitting component
the header and maybe also the items on
the header could be their own component
could be you don't have to
you will learn throughout the course how
I approach the splitting app of an
application into separate components we
also have of course our main area and a
sidebar here as components and data
stick or idea behind angular build
component
each component has its own template its
own HTML code may be its own styling and
more importantly also its own business
logic and this is the great benefit it
allows you to split up your complex
application your complex webpage into
reusable parts you may use a component
more than once and that allows you to
easily replicate that business logic
replicate that styling or in general
make a finely controlled piece in your
application without having to crunch
everything into one single script file
one single HTML file instead it's very
easy to update very easy to exchange and
again reusable so let's have a closer
look at how we actually create a
component and what does add component
thing does in the next lecture
components are important
that is why we start with one with the
app component it on the one hand is a
normal angular component but on the
other end it's also kind of special
because it serves as our root component
it's in the N listed here in the app
module in this bootstrap array which
tells angular haters a special component
you should bootstrap the whole
application with that component being
the root component so all our components
we create will not be added to the
index.html file their selectors will not
be added here their selectors will be
added to the app component HTML file
because this is now the well root
component of our app where we add the
other parts enough talking about adding
components let's add one let's say we
want to output some information about a
server we're building a back-end for our
server management application and we
want to output some server information
so I will store this in a new folder
which is a subfolder of the app folder
because generally in an angular CLI
project all your app related content
will go into this app folder I will name
it server because it will hold my server
component and this is a good practice
having the folder name equal your
component name and each component
typically should have its own folder
though it's not a hard rule but
generally it makes sense so here in the
server folder I will add my server
component now a good naming convention
is to have servers or the name of your
component first then a dot and then
component we will later learn that there
are other building blocks in an angular
application too so by using file names
like this it's very easy to see what's
inside the file and very important don't
forget to add dot TS so for typescript
because this is what we will write this
component in so now we got an empty file
for our new component how do we create a
component now first of all a component
simply is just a class a typescript
class so that angular is able to
instantiate it to create objects based
on the blueprint we set up here you
could say
so let's export this class so that we
can use it outside of this file tube
because as I mentioned the four we're
going to use our component in the app
component for example to add it there so
we will add a class here and this class
should now be named server component
again the naming convention here have
the name of the component first server
and then also the description component
because later we will also learn about
other parts which might then be named
differently in the angular app this is
our class and right now it's a normal
typescript class nothing special about
it we can't use it like this angular
doesn't have all the information it
requires so we should add something to
it which tells angular that this is not
only a normal typescript class but
instead something special a component we
do this by adding a special decorator
decorators are a type good feature which
allow you to enhance your classes for
example enhance elements you use in your
code it's not restricted to classes but
here we will use a class decorator
it's the component decorator and
decorators are always attached by adding
an add sign in front of them now this
component decorator is not something
type struc knows from the start so we
have to import it we have to add an
import and this import now needs to give
us access to components so we need to
import component between curly braces
because from the file we're going to
import this we could import other parts
too so we have to specifically pick the
component by using this syntax and then
it's from and now the package where we
import component from is at angular core
now angular ships with a couple of
packages where it basically groups its
functionalities and the core package as
the name implies gives us access to some
of the core functionalities of angular
so with that we import that component
nowadays add component decorator is
known to typescript so when it parses
this file and compile it to JavaScript
that is able to understand it now we
need to pass a javascript object
component decorator to configure it
because without any configuration it's
still not that valuable to angular but
here we can set up some important
information which will be stored as
metadata for this class in the
background then which will tell angler
what to do with this class and one
important information piece is the
selector so basically the HTML tag by
which you're able to use this component
later in your average component
templates we will see this in action
soon the selector should be a string and
here you may set up any name you want
but you should make sure that it is a
unique selector that you don't
accidentally override a default HTML
element or something like this so
typically you prefix it with a p' - and
then a fitting name like server because
it's a server component this is my own
selector by which I can now later use
this component in my other components
HTML files so if that set up the other
important piece we need to have is the
template and here let's reference
another external file I'll come back to
another alternative today soon and this
external file of course needs to be
created so in the same folder I will
trade a server dot component and now dot
HTML file this will hold the template
the HTML code of my component here so
here I can now basically add any content
I want like for example the server
component to start simple and back to
the types could file I can now point to
this HTML file we need a relative path
for this in the end this will all get
bundled by web pack so we need to tell
it where to find the HTML file well and
relative to the typescript file the puff
simply is dot slash server dot component
dot HTML like this this is pointing to
this file with this we created our first
component now to use it we need to dive
into app module and understand what this
does because we need to change something
here
to use our own component let's do this
in the next lecture
in the last lecture we created our own
component the server component here it's
almost ready to be used but to use it we
need to change something about our app
module what is air marshal angular uses
components to build web pages and uses
modules to basically bundle different
pieces for example components of your
app in Q packages now this is kind of an
advanced feature but later in the course
I will have a whole section about
modules for the majority of this course
we will only use the app module which is
absolutely fine for a lot of projects
only in bigger projects you might think
about splitting up your app into
multiple modules but what does this app
watch will do what is a module then well
it's a as a set bundle of
functionalities of our app and it
basically gives angular the information
which features does my app have and use
as you can see it also is just an empty
typescript class like our component and
asked component we transform it into
something else by adding a decorator
here it's the ng module decorator which
is also imported from add angular core
now in there we see four properties we
set up on the object we pass to ng
module declarations imports providers
and bootstrap we had a look at bootstrap
this was responsible for telling angular
hey which component should you be aware
of at the point of time the whole
application starts so which component
should you basically recognized in the
index.html file and that was the app
component now I already mentioned that
we won't add any more component
selectors to the index.html file that's
just not how it works
therefore we won't touch the bootstrap
array still we added a new component to
angular and this new component had now
has to be registered here in the module
so that angular knows that this
component exists because and this is
important by default angular will not
scan all your files here so if you don't
tell it that these server component
exists it doesn't know it just creating
the file is not enough that is why we
have to register it here in the ng
module to tell angular hey part of this
module and therefore right here of our
whole app since we only have this module
is this server component we do register
new components in this declarations
array we already registered the app
component here because even though it's
also used in bootstrap it also is a part
of our app now we also need to add the
server component here adding it like
this is not enough though because now
angular would kind of know that this is
part of the app but typescript wouldn't
know where to find this type where to
find the server component so when we try
to bundle our code we would get an error
but you can actually see if you save
this triggering the recompilation you
see that we get an error in the terminal
down there that it can't find server
component because and this is not
angular this is typescript it doesn't
know where this file is where to find
this class so we need to add import at
the top manually pointing to this so we
add server component here as a import
from dot slash server and then here in
the server component and you omit the
dot es you don't add dot TS to your
import it's just server component so the
file name without the extension the
extension is added by web pack which
bundles our project automatically so
with this and it's just so important
this is not angular this is a typescript
feature
now typescript knows where to find this
therefore everything can be bundled so
therefore now angular when it runs knows
that we have a server component and that
it is part of our app and with this we
can now finally use our component we
will do this in the next lecture but
maybe you're also wondering what imports
and providers does here in the app
module I'll come back to providers later
and you service a section imports simply
allows us to add some other modules to
this much
because I told you you can split up your
app into multiple modules and then you
can import these modules to basically
make this module a bit leaner and
outsource some stuff into another module
now I told you that we are going to use
one module so what are we importing here
some modules built into angular because
angular itself is split up into modules
so the browser module for example gives
us all the base functionality we need to
start our app and forms an HTTP module
data something I'll come back to in
defaults or HTTP section of the course
so with this the basics about this
module should be clear again we'll dive
deeper into this later in the course we
also register our own component let's
now use it in the next lecture
with our component registered let's use
it
so we have our selector here app server
now I told you we are not going to add
it to the index.html file there it
wouldn't work instead let's go to the
app component HTML file
the only other HTML file we have right
now where we could add it and here I'll
add a horizontal line and below this
I'll add my app server element here and
the shortcut I used here is just a
little plug-in called Emmet available
for many ideas and editors which gives
you a quicker way of writing HTML so
here app server is our own selector our
own element kind of we created if we now
save this it should successfully
recompile and if we have a look at our
running application you see the server
component here our own component being
added here so datas how you can use your
components then with their selector
after adding them to AB module and then
well displaying them on the page
in the last lectures we learned a lot
including the creation of a new
component by hand now there also is an
alternative to trading it manually when
using this Eli you can open a new
terminal window or command line leave
the ng serve window running that's
important don't close it and in this new
window we can use some steel I command
to also create a new component let's say
we want to have our single server
component here in an our components are
nested into an average component service
multiple servers component we can create
this manually by adding a service folder
with our component or we used to see ly
with ng and there we have a generate
command which allows us to generate some
elements some elements supported by
angular one such element is a component
so we can create a new component with ng
generate component and then passing the
name service like this you can also use
a shortcut and instead of ng generate
component you could say ng g c which
does the same so if you hit enter what
this will do is it will give you a new
folder in your app folder with the name
of your component servers and in there
you basically find the same files as we
had for the app component HTML CSS TS
enters spec file which basically is used
for testing now I will remove this will
later have a section about testing and
we'll have a look at the styling later
too for now let's say it is in this
service component that we want to output
our single server well we already have
this decorator at the selector app
server so in this template of the
service component we can overwrite the
default text with app server and maybe
simply replicate this so that we have
two components because remember
components are reusable we can use the
same component as often as we want by
simply using it
electorate softness we want so now we
have two servers here and with this in
our service component you need to make
sure that you also update the app module
now this seal I should do this
automatically which is why you already
find the import anti declaration in this
file but make sure you really do have it
here with this we can go to our service
component types good file to check the
selector which is app - service and then
we can go to our app HTML or app
component HTML file and update the
selector to use this new component
instead of the old one with this if we
now saved us and go back to our
application it looks almost the same as
before we see our single server
component twice but if we inspect the
code here in the developer tools of
Chrome for example you see that we have
this outer app servers component this
newly created component and in between
we have two single app server components
and this is how you can nest components
and how you can create new components
with the CLI and also how you can use
components more than once a very
important information to really
understand how to use components and how
to build your app with components now
before we dive a little bit deeper into
how we can style our components and
improve them I want you to practice the
things you learned thus far let's do
this in the next assignment so with that
we learned a couple of important things
about how to create components manually
or with the CLI how we can nest them
into each other that we can use
component selectors in any other
template of any other component and how
we can replicate components by simply
using them well multiple times using
their selectors multiple times let's
dive into how we can actually style them
what we can do regarding the style and
the template of components
thus far we always use the external
template file and we haven't done
anything regarding the styling of
components time to change both now
instead of using an external template
file you can also use an inline template
which means you define the HTML code in
the typescript code sounds strange well
it's possible we can do this by simply
going to our service component here for
example and right now we point to this
HTML file here now we can change
template URL to template one of the two
has to be present over a link to
external template or just template to
define it in this file
but each component needs to have a
template this is the one property you
have to have at all times so with that
now I change to template now we can
write our template code here so here we
could now replicate app server like this
maybe twice we have to make sure that we
don't wrap this line because this is not
supported in a default typescript string
and if I now save this we see the same
result as before so it looks like
nothing changed and that is good in this
case because we try to make it look like
this but actually we did change the way
we set up our template here now we're
defining the HTML code in this same file
and actually if you want to write
multi-line strings here what you
probably want if you add more HTML code
to it you can switch from a normal
string with single quotation marks to
using backticks
you use JavaScript template expressions
to be able to write multi-line strings
in between there now so now between the
opening and closing backtick you may
actually wrap the line and now write
your HTML code like this what should you
use should you use this approach here of
using template or an external file it
depends if you have not that much code
not that much age
Mallicoat using an inline template like
this might be fine then you have all the
logic in a typescript code and that is
absolutely okay but as soon as you have
let's say more than three lines of code
in the HTML part here in the template
using an external file is a good idea to
make it easier to follow and easier to
understand it is important though to
keep in mind that you can use this
approach that you can inline your
templates and very important that you
need to have at least a template in a
component you can omit the selector you
will later in the routing section learn
a different way of loading components
without using their selector and you
don't have to add styles but templates
have to be present so that were
templates now let's have a look at these
Styles in the next lecture
we understood the templates are
important and that we can either use
them in line here or point to an
external file what about styles we also
have this style URLs property here and
we have these CSS files what can we do
with those let's go back to our app
component for this here we got a h3 tag
and a horizontal line and if we have a
look at our application it's not that
pretty right
the I'm in the app component texture or
all the text actually is sitting right
on the edge here not super pretty now
since we use bootstrap of course we can
use some bootstrap classes to enhance
this so we could add a div with a
container class around it then add a
road and this is just using the CSS
framework bootstrap so these are some
CSS classes provided by the framework
nothing angular specific and then we
could add a column here access 12 to
have one column on all device widths now
if we add this we added some styling
some normal CSS styling nothing angular
specific and our app looks a little bit
nicer now this is great but we can also
use some tools given to us by angular
let's say this I'm in the app component
heading here we want to change its style
maybe we want to give to some blue color
we can do this by going to the app
component CSS file which defines the
styling for this component and now we
can use or write normal CSS code so
overwrite the style of the h3 tag and
set its color to some blue
so maybe judah's dark blue here if we
now save this and we have a look at our
application you see it's dark blue now
this is how you can use this style file
this CSS file referenced in the app
component here to define the styles for
a component now just like we were able
to choose between
external file and inline code for the
template we can do the same for the
styling you notice that style URLs is an
array here whereas template URL wasn't
it is this because we could reference
multiple external style sheets here so
you could add pointers to other style
sheets but besides that I'm going to
comment this out you can also set up
another property which is just Styles
this also takes an array but now it
takes an array of strings where you
define the style in this string so now
in this file here I'm going to use
backticks again to be able to write a
multi-line expression here and then we
could set up a tree here and to really
show you that this is different I will
set a color cue now let's not say dark
blue but you Dodger blue and if I now
save this and we go back to the
application you see the blue updated
because now the inline style is taking
over I commented out the other one just
like with the template you have to
decide which one to use you can't
combine stall URLs and styles but both
important here has to be an array that's
the different to template you must only
have one template you may have multiple
style files or style definitions and you
can choose between inline and external
file the rules are basically the same as
for the template if you have more code
in there using an external file is a
good idea if it's a short style
definition like this why don't you just
put it into T types could fall this is
how you can work with templates and
styles
now are you already a component ninja we
learned a lot about components about the
templates options we have there and
about the styles I want to focus on the
last property we see in this component
decorator for now the selector I already
mentioned that this has to be a unique
selector so that you don't override
accidentally an already existing element
or maybe a component made available by a
number of third-party package you use in
your project there's one other piece of
information about the selector though
you don't have to use this type of
selector right now our selector is the
same selector as we use it in CSS for
selecting an element so we have app
servers here as an element and this is
recognized by angular because the
selector which shows is app servers and
this basically just looks how you select
elements in CSS right we select the h3
element by just typing a tree here we
select the app servers element by just
typing app service here so that actually
works like a CSS selector and therefore
you are not limited to selecting by
element you could put this into square
brackets to use the attribute selector
so in CSS you can select elements by
attribute by enclosing that attribute in
square brackets and now if you save this
you would see that our app actually is
broken because if we have a look at the
error message app servers is an unknown
element because now our code angular
doesn't recognize app servers anymore
because we changed the selector to be an
attribute so to make this work again we
would have to comment this out or remove
it and maybe add a div or any other
element a normal HTML element which has
an app servers attribute now
with this custom attribute added now now
the app works again because now angular
selects the element by attribute and not
by the element itself because we changed
this selector a Navarrete --av is to
select by and I'm just going to comment
this out so that the code is still there
for reference to select by class so with
a dot at the beginning app servers again
just like in CSS so here we can now
select by class so let's add a new div
here which has a CSS class of app
servers which we of course could now
also style but besides that it's also
recognized by angular as a selector
which is why we still see the app now
these are all options you have as a
sidenote selecting by ID won't work
that's not supported by angular and all
those pseudo selectors like hover and so
on also don't work and you typically use
the element style here app servers for
components we will soon learn about
directives another feature where this is
different but for components you
typically create your own elements and
therefore you don't use that style and
you don't use the attribute style
instead you use app servers like element
but it is important to understand that
you are not limited to this and there
might be use cases where you want to use
a different selector
in our little basic first application
we're working on where we added a couple
of components we covered a lot of key
aspects of a basic angular app how it
starts and how to use components the
base building block of any angular app
but thus far we only output static
content the server component here that's
not super interesting we did even more
than that in the first section of this
course so let's change this to output
some data which is kind of dynamic at
least which is not hard-coded into the
template time for some data binding what
is data binding you could basically
translate data binding with
communication communication between your
typescript code of your component your
business logic and the template so what
the user sees because you might have
some result in your typescript code
because you fetched something from a
server or finished some calculation
which you want to display to the user
and the only thing the user sees is the
template so we need some kind of
communication between both pieces to be
able to really well do something in our
app that is where data binding comes
into play because it is responsible for
this communication we get different ways
of communication now for example we want
to output data from our typescript code
in the HTML code in the template we can
use string interpolation for this you
saw this in the first section of the
course it's the syntax with the double
curly braces and then some property name
or some expression in between or
property binding we'll have a closer
look at all these forms of course in the
next lecture so we will learn what this
then is and how it works to send text
base it uses these strange square
brackets around HTML attributes but
again I will come back to this sometimes
though the our direction is interesting
to you if the user clicks a button you
can kind of think of the user clicking
this button on the template because
again the template is the thing with
which the user interacts which he sees
and where he is also able to click
buttons so if we click a button we maybe
want to trigger something in our
typescript code so now we need the
average
rection and we can get this our
direction we can react to user events
with event binding so we can bind to for
example a click event to execute some
code whenever it occurs and we also have
one additional form of data binding
where we combine both directions two-way
data binding where we are able to react
events and output something at the same
time might not be super clear how this
works but thatÃ­s what we will now have a
detailed look at all four forms in the
next lectures
let's start by having a closer look at
string interpolation here in the server
component I don't want you output this
here in the HT molecule like this I
don't want you hard cut the output here
it would be realistic that our server
component contains information about a
specific server so maybe here in the
template file we want to output server
with ID and then some dynamic ID here is
and then the status like offline so we
have two dynamic fields here now it what
makes sense to kind of derive them in
typescript code in a real app that might
be derived from HTTP request you make to
some back-end or some calculation for
now I will hard-coded in here so we
might have a server ID and I will assign
a value of let's say 10 so a number and
I might also have a server status which
is a string off line so two different
types a string and a number and they
were not necessary you could also be
very explicit by assigning the type with
type scripts feature here of adding a
call and after the property name and
then the type it will infer it
automatically those so this is not
required I'm just doing this here for
demo purposes so now I want you output
these two properties in my template and
to get this connection we need to add up
data binding because you learned it's
all about the communication between your
types good code and template so string
interpolation is a typically use case
here or typical solution for this task
here instead of the placeholder I use my
double curly braces opening and closing
this is the string interpolation syntax
and in between these double curly braces
you can now write a typescript
expression so the easiest expression is
to simply reference a property like the
server ID and this is a common use case
that you only output
a property here or the value of the
property however it's not the only use
case you could also for example here for
server simply hard-code a string in
there any expression which can be
resolved to a string in the end that's
the only condition for a string
interpolation syntax here so whatever
you have between the curly braces in the
end that somehow has to return a string
so you could also call a method here
which returns a string in the end the
only avarice friction is you can't write
multi-line expressions here you can't
write block expressions in here so you
can't add a if or a for control
structure in here you could use a
ternary expression though so this is
what you can do now let's also replace
the last placeholder and here I will
again just reference a property the
server status now this is string
interpolation in usage and you see that
we have an expression which is a string
itself and then two other expressions
which simply point to properties and
again you could also call a method here
which returns a string now interesting
the server ID is not a string but a
number and I just said that string
interpolation has to resolve cue a
string in the end has to get a string in
the end so let's see if this works
if we save this with ng surf still
running let's also change app server
back to app servers to make this work
again we see server with ID 10 is
offline we see it twice because we
repeat this component and each component
of course has the same content but we
see that string interpolation is working
and that it especially is also working
here for our number so ID 10 that is not
an issue that is working fine because a
number can be easily converted into a
string so yes you have to get a string
in the end or something which can be
converted to a string to really be
correct here this is how you can use
string interpolation and now to really
completely example let's say the
server's status here is somehow returned
in a method get' server status could be
the method name this is how you define a
method in typescript so you might know
this kind of method definition from
other languages and here we simply
return this server status so we return
the property here we could of course
have accessed as its directly as we
already did but just to demonstrate that
you can call a method Here I am calling
a method get' server status of course
leads to the same output because again
all this method does is it returns us a
string in the end or something which can
be converted to a string that is string
interpolation in action
in the last lecture we had a look at
string interpolation which is a great
tool for outputting data in a template
now when I have a look at property
binding now one important information
right away there are a lot of times
where you can either use property
binding or string interpolation and I
will show what I mean in a second let's
go to our service component where you
manage all the servers and I want to
allow the user to add new service at
least soon I want to allow that so we
will need a button where I say add
server on it and I will just add some
CSS classes button and button primary to
make this button look nice this is all
using normal bootstrap CSS classes
though nothing to do with angular and
you reflect this change in my service
component here I also want to comment
out the inline template and point to the
external template again so template URL
should point to my servers component dot
HTML file like this so now with this if
I saved as we see that button here right
now it does make any sense that I'm able
to click this button because it doesn't
do anything we haven't learned to react
to a button click yet so I will add a
new property in my typescript code here
which I'll name allow new server and set
it to false so now this is all the
number property holding a boolean value
to true or false in this case false
because I don't want to allow the user
to create a new server and you could
again imagine that there's a somehow
derived dynamically we will soon work
with some dynamic data so in the HTML
file here I now want to disable the
button and as you probably know there is
a disabled attribute you can add like
this if we now save this the button is
disabled I can't click it that's nice
but that's hard-coded into HTML now
maybe this allow a new server code here
changes however maybe it's not set to
disk all the time
so then we wouldn't be able to react to
this and I can actually demonstrate this
why for now in the constructor which is
simply a method X
cuter at the point of time this
component is created by angular by their
calling set timeout a normal JavaScript
function and here I define after which
period of time or after how many
milliseconds something should happen so
after 2,000 milliseconds which are two
seconds I want to execute a function and
here I'm using an es six arrow function
this syntax might look strange it's
almost the same as function like this
with the dibs on difference when it
comes to handling the this keyword but
in the end here you pass the arguments
and here you have the function body more
importantly in here I can set allow a
new server and now this would not work
in the average syntax because this would
then be referring to something else can
set it to true so after two seconds this
will be switched to true and since we
hard-coded this of course this doesn't
affect our button here at all it stays
disabled so I want to bind it Q allow a
new server so now to make this disabled
functional T dynamic we can point to it
by enclosing it in square brackets
square brackets indicate to angular that
we're using property binding that we
want to dynamically bind some property
and disabled the HTML attribute in the
end a normal HTML only sets a specific
property on the underlying Dom element
you might know that each HTML element
you use is parsed by the browser and
kind of translate it into an element on
the document object model this is
totally unrelated to angular and
therefore we have an element in this Dom
and this element has a couple of
properties a lot of these can't even be
set through attributes on the HTML
element well one of the properties is
the disabled property and you can set it
through the disabled attribute but here
we're not using the disabled attribute
anymore with these square brackets we
are directly binding to this native
disabled property this HTML element has
so now we can set this equal to and now
between the quotation mark
here an expression which for this
property resolves to a boolean but for
our properties and our type might be
required because again you can bind to a
lot of properties basically to all the
HTML element properties the soon learn
that there are also other properties you
can bind to so for now I can simply pass
a low news server here my property name
because this will resolve to true or
false exactly the value D disabled T
property needs because it has to decide
whoever it should be disabled or not so
now with that if we reverse this also by
adding exclamation mark we made sure
that this is only disabled if this is
false
so if we if allow new server is not true
otherwise you would do exactly the
opposite so now with the exclamation
mark if we go back to the app you see
it's disabled but after two seconds let
me reload this it becomes enabled
because now we're binding to this
disabled property this native element
property we're binding this to our own
typescript property here and the
convenient thing is and this is what
angular is all about that this will
update dynamically so once allow a new
server changes this has changed in the
Dom so now the button gets enabled one
of the main reasons why you use angular
it makes it very easy for you to
interact with your Dom to change some
things there at runtime like we do here
that is property binding in place now as
I mentioned besides binding to HTML
element properties like we do here you
can also bind to our properties for
example of directives something we
haven't learned about yet and your own
components something I will also show
you later so there's this property
binding before moving on to the other
two forms of data binding let's find out
where you could actually use string
interpolation instead of property
binding
in the last lecture we learned about
property binding now if we have the use
case that we also want to output the
current value of allow new server we
could of course use string interpolation
to simply output allow a new server and
a boolean can also be cast into a string
so now we see falls here and after two
seconds you see this change to true
because we change it in the code nice
now this is one of the cases here where
you can easily use property binding
instead of string interpolation so you
could simply bind to a property of this
element the inner text property and set
this equal to allow a new server now I
can remove the string interpolation here
inside of the tags and whilst the might
look empty now while we set the inner
texts we get the same behavior as before
because the inner text property of a
element is just what's between the
opening and closing tag so in this case
we were able to easily replace string
interpolation with property binding so
when should you use which of the two
well basically if you want to output
something in your template print some
text to it use string interpolation if
you want to change some property be that
of a HTML element or as you later learn
of a directive or a component typically
use property binding that is how you can
differentiate it and you will get a
feeling for this once you work your way
through the course project and so on
so destice one important note I want to
make is don't mix property binding and
string interpolation you might notice
that here we have disabled equals and
then we have quotation marks and then
directly our property name there are no
curly braces between these current
quotation marks and there shouldn't be
because that will break the app this
will not work between the quotation
marks off property binding you can and
you must already write typescript code
so to say a typescript expression which
will return the value this property
expects so for disabled some expression
which returns true or false so just like
with string interpolation
you may also call a method there but you
must not add curly braces in there once
it might look we simply use a HTML
attribute there we aren't this whole
syntax here is a syntax recognized by
angular so this is why between the
quotation marks you can already and you
have already you have to write
typescript code because again this whole
expression is evaluated by angular
mixing in string interpolation will
break it string interpolation only works
in a normal template not within another
expression of that template not within
property binding or something like this
with that enough about property binding
and generally about outputting data in
the template let's see how we can react
to events
in last lectures we learned a lot about
how we can use property binding and
string interpolation to output data in
the template
let's now react to events for example we
have a button here and after two seconds
this button is enabled so would be nice
if we could do something once we click
the button now I will soon show you how
we can actually add a new server how we
can add a new replication of our server
selector of our server component here
for now what I want to do is I want you
output something I will remove this text
here and instead here I want you output
the value of a property I'll create this
property and again you may ignore ng on
in it for now I will come back to this I
will name it server creation status and
initially I will say that you know
server was created like this now this
property can be output wire string
interpolation server creation status and
I just told you I don't want to continue
outputting data we want to listen to
events so I promised it will do it I
will add another method below here and I
will name this method on create server D
on at the beginning to kind of make
clear that this will be triggered from
within my template you don't have to
name it on something but it kind of
makes it easier to understand who will
call this method well the user will
basically by doing something some event
will call it that is what I want to
symbolize with that so in here I will
set these server creation status to
server was created so the missing piece
of course is to call this method and now
here is where event binding comes into
play we want to listen to this click
event here and typically you have to on
click attribute on the HTML element
where you can now execute some
JavaScript code we won't use that with
angular though here we have the syntax
angular offers us event binding which
uses parenthesis like property binding
used square brackets for events
parentheses are the signal that we're
using event binding
and here we have to specify the name of
the event between the parentheses for
example click and you can basically bind
to all the events made available by the
HTML attribute you're placing this on so
if you have on click on Mouse enter you
could bind to click mouse enter without
the on at the beginning so we bind to
the click event and now between the
quotation marks we put the code we want
to execute once this event occurs now
oftentimes you will call a method here
so let's do this let's point to the
method we want to execute which is on
create server with parentheses so this
method will now get executed whenever we
click the button as a side note you
don't have to execute a method here you
could also put the code you want to
execute right between the quotation
marks oftentimes this is not very good
because you want to execute more code if
some event happens but if all you want
to do is set some boolean property to
true for example well you can definitely
do this in line the template as a
general rule though you shouldn't put
too much logic into your templates
though so now we're binding the click
event and we execute the oncreate server
method when it occurs so let's see this
in action in our application let's
reload the page the button gets enabled
and now watch this part here if I click
the button it changes to server was
created because we are triggering our
own method here and this is how simple
event binding works use parentheses the
event name in between and then between
the quotation marks the code you want to
execute when this event occurs
in the last lecture we had a look at
event binding now before focusing on
two-way binding and explaining what this
is there's one other important thing you
need to know about event binding let's
say before this button we also have a
label server name and then more
importantly we have an input which we
maybe give bootstrap class of form
control here I want to allow the user to
enter the name of the server which
should get created so here we could
listen to the input event
this is a normal Dom event provided by
the input element which is far than ever
the user types and here we could execute
on update server name because it will be
fired on every keystroke so let's add
this method to our component here and
now I somehow want to output what the
user entered right now what the value of
this field is now we can do this by
passing dollar sign event here and
dollar sign event super important is
kind of a reserved variable name you can
use in the template when using event
binding for this event so only between
these quotation marks here dollar sign
event will simply be the data emitted
with that event so input and click our
default events provided by the Dom you
could say and they ship as some data
when they are fired the click event
gives us an object which for example
holds two coordinates where we clicked
and the input event also gives us some
data some information about the event
now we can capture this data with dollar
sign event passed as an argument to the
method we're calling or used anywhere
between these quotation marks in the
code we're executing dollar sign event
something to keep in mind reserve the
word which gives us access to the event
data so now we pass this to on update
server name so here we know we will
receive this event and this will be of
type any for now so now let's simply log
it to the console so that we can see it
in this debug log if we do this and I
now type something here watch the
console on the right
a couple of outputs were written there
for to be precise because I typed four
characters did four keystrokes so the
input event was fired four times and if
we have a look at this event we got a
couple of information here for example
the target and the target simply is the
HTML element on which this event
occurred so here on the target since
this is an input element if we scroll
down we also got the value test and this
is what the user entered so what we can
do now in our typescript code is we can
set a server name property which is an
empty string by default and then here an
on update server name instead of logging
it we could say this server name and we
just learned that on the event which is
of type event as we now also saw here we
have a target and on the target we have
a value now this is only available
because the target is of type input
element though this is why my ID doesn't
like it we can explicitly inform it
about the type in typescript by adding
HTML input element here in front of it
like this and again this is just needed
to inform typescript that we know that
the type off the HTML element of this
event will be an HTML input element we
do this explicit casting with this
syntax with the opening and closing tag
of T smaller and greater than sign and
to type in between so with that we
assign this value to our server name
what we can now do is in the HTML file
here we can output this for now so a
string interpolation we could output the
server name below the input if we save
doesn't go back to this application and
I type test server here you see this
dynamically updates below the input this
is how you can use this dollar sign
event object to fetch the event data now
with that let's move on
to two-way data-binding to kind of
finish this little example up here for
now
in the last lectures we learned a lot
about event binding and property binding
now let's combine both to two-way
binding we learned that we can get the
event data like this for example there
is another approach to though if I copy
this and uncomment it out and now I
replace this input event you have
something else you'll find that we have
an even easier way of binding to some
data with two-way data-binding
we combine property and event binding we
use it therefore by combining the Sun
taxes square brackets and within these
parentheses now here we have to use a
special directive and we will learn more
about directives in a second ng model
now we can set this equal to some
property defined in our typescript code
so to the server name for example this
setup will do the following it will
trigger on the input event and update
the value off server name in our
component automatically on the other
hand since it is two-way binding it will
also update the value of the input
element if we change server name
somewhere else and I can demonstrate
this by going back to the typescript
code and setting server name to test
server here initially so before it was
an empty string now it isn't anymore
with this if we go back to the running
application you see that the input is
pre-populated with that now if for demo
purposes I comment in the other input
which does not use two-way binding you
see that this input is empty because
again it's not using two-way binding now
if I type something here you see it
updates the property name and hence it
updates it there where we used string
interpolation and the other input but if
I type here it's not getting changed in
the first input because again we're not
using two-way binding there this is what
two-way data-binding is a very simple
way of binding in both directions and
for example of
reacting to changes in well the input
value here so we'll comment out the
first approach I will leave the method
in here though even though we're not
calling it anymore but with that you now
also had a look at two-way binding a
nice and easy way of reacting to events
in both directions
now let's find you now wrap here a
little bit more and let's then move on
to directives and our core feature of
angular
she'll with all four forms of
data-binding cupboard now let's finish
our little demo app for now we get the
server name and this is life updated
whilst we type due to to a data binding
in place here I will comment out this
server name here instead I want to
display the server name once we clicked
this ad server button so once we create
the server we should not only say server
was created but also name is and then
simply add this server name like this so
now with this in place we're now using
the data we're changing through joy a
data binding or if we chose to do so
through one-way data binding if we use
the other approach which is currently
commented out and with this in place now
you can see that if I change the server
name like this and click Add server we
see server was created name is test
server to with that we're using all four
forms of data binding together with a
Java event pointing to listen to the
click string interpolation to output the
data here property binding to enable
this button in the first place after two
seconds and two-way binding to fetch our
input data so with that we're pretty
advanced into the basics of angular we
use components we know how they work in
general we use how to communicate with
our templates from our typescript code
and in the Avro direction now there's
one more basic feature we have to cover
to really be able to build first little
applications before we then can dive
deeper into the individual building
blocks so let's have a look at this next
feature soon directives before that time
to practice data binding though
we're almost done with the basics about
angular we learned a lot about
components the basic building block of
any angular app about how it starts the
app how we can communicate with our
templates in our components so that we
can output data or react to events now
there is one other key building block
you probably use an any angular app you
build directives what our directives
directives our instructions in the DOM
and we actually already used directives
without knowing it
components are kind of such instructions
in the Dom once we place the selector of
our component somewhere in our templates
at this point of time we're instructing
angular to add the content of our
component template and business logic in
our types of code in this place where we
use the selector this was our
instruction angular please add our
component in this place and indeed
components our directives but directives
with a template
there are also directives without a
template so an example would be the app
turned green directive which would be a
custom directive we could build we
typically add directives with attribute
selector but technically the selector of
a directive can be configured just like
the selector for component so you could
also use CSS classes or the element
style but again typically you use the
attribute style and on this paragraph
this directive might simply color the
text green you could say so angular
would find this instruction here we
would have defined our directive with
the directive decorator to inform
angular that this class holds a
directive and there we might have the
logic to turn the screen now we will
learn how to write our own directives in
the section focused on directives in
this course but there are a couple of
built in directives which are really
useful let's take a closer look at how
we use them and what they do for us in
the next lectures
in the example application we built thus
far we haven't used any directives
besides components which are directives
that's important but we haven't used any
other directives no built-in directives
now let's say one thing we want to do is
we only want to show this server was
created text here there's no need to
have this no server laws create a text
to be displayed so it would be nice if
we could conditionally show this message
and for that we need some help we can
use a directive shipping with angular
the ng-if directive now it works like a
if statement and to be precise it works
like this in our service component here
where we output these server creation
status I will comment this out so that
we can still reference this code but now
I will add a new paragraph where I
simply say server was created server
name is bind my server name now if this
in place it will still work but now we
always see with every keystroke how we
changed this server name not really what
I want instead I want to output it as
soon as we click this button here so
what I can do is I can add a directive
here and as I said typically directives
are added by using an attribute selector
and pretty much all the built-in
directives use that selector ng-if does
and then ng-if is added by adding a
start this is important and gee if the
star is required because ng if is a
structural directive which means it
changes the structure of our Dom it
either adds
this element or it doesn't add it so
that's just some extra information for
angular the directive itself is just ng
if but the star is required without it
it will not work correctly so ng is and
then we can set up our condition here
between the quotation marks for ng if
this has to be any expression returning
true or false
deciding whoever this should be
added or not so here it would make sense
to add a new property which we name
server created and set it to false and
we set this to true once the button is
clicked so here in oncreate server which
is triggered when the button is clicked
here we set server created equal to true
like that now with this we can go back
to our template and simply bind ngf to
server created and again this could also
call a method which returns true or
false or directly perform the check
between the quotation marks anything
which returns true or false now if this
if we save this what you see is that
there is no text but if I name this test
server - and click the button now the
text is added here and the interesting
thing is if I reload the app and we
inspect our Dom here you see here that's
our app server component below that
above that is the button but if I click
this button a new element was entered
here the paragraph and here you see kind
of the hook which angular created to
know where this should be entered but
the important thing is it's really added
or removed to or from the Dom it's not
there all the time it's not hidden it's
just not there which is super important
to understand
so that's ng if again the start at the
beginning indicates that this is a
structural directive really changing the
Dom as you just saw
in the last lecture we had a look at the
basic ng of syntax and that's the syntax
you're going to use most of the time
there is one alternative to it though
sometimes you have not only the if
condition but also a else condition so
here we might want to say server was
created server name is something with ng
if but we could also add a else block
where we don't want to say no server was
created now we deleted that exact text
for the reason that we don't want to see
it but imagine that we do want to show
that alternative so no server was
created it could be the text here and
now we want to show this paragraph only
if Angie if is not true or this
condition server created is not true we
can achieve this by placing a local
reference on this element here and local
reference is something I will dive
deeper into in the understanding
components and data binding section of
course for now let's think of it as a
marker so I will name this no server any
name you like same just no server with a
capital S and now we need to change the
paragraph here to ng template that is a
component a directive shipping with
angular which you can use to mark places
in the Dom and now I will add the
paragraph back in this template with the
text in between like this so now
basically detects you want your output
and now with ng template with the local
reference this marker on it we mark a
certain spot in the template which we
want to show conditionally now to show
it conditionally we simply enhance ng F
by also adding else and then no server
so this marker replaced on ng template
and that's all the syntax we need if we
save this you see no server was created
and as soon as I click here that gets
replaced web server was created so that
is ng if-else a nice little addition in
a use case where you have well an Al's
condition of course the alternative
would always be to simply use ng if with
reversed check so with exclamation mark
server created but that here is an
average alternative now I'm going to
delete it you will find an article after
the section here though where you can
find this code again in case you're
interested and we will also use this
code in the course project we're going
to build I just wanted to highlight that
this option exists using ng of like this
however is the case you will see most
often now let's continue
in the last lecture we saw ng-if super
useful directive and ngf was a
structural directive the other type of
directives are attribute directives
which are called like this because they
really just look like normal HTML
attributes without a star basically
let's add one on the server component
here we output the server status right
and the service status always is offline
let's mix this up let's say we want to
dynamically create this so add the
constructor which is such just a
built-in method each typescript class
has which is called once this component
is created and here I will set the
service status to a random value I will
use the math.random function and this
gives us a random number between 0 and 1
a floating point number and if as this
is greater than 0.5 I want to set the
status to online otherwise I will set it
to offline so if that we shouldn't get
the same status all the time and now
let's check this we see indeed online
and offline that's lucky could have of
course also been both offline since we
have a 50% chance now we have two
different statuses here and now let's
say we want to change the color of the
the background color of this component
depending on the service status for this
we can use another directive on this
wrapping paragraph here I can add it and
it's called ng style now that's a
built-in directive you can recognize
this on the ng at the beginning an ng
style that's the directive is pretty
useless like this we need to give it
some configuration to do something that
is why we will use property binding on
this directive and it's super important
to understand that these square brackets
here are not part of the directive name
the directive name is just ng style the
square brackets indicate that we want to
bind to some property on this directive
and this property name happens
also bng style we will see this in
practice on our own directives in the
directive section later but super
important to understand that property
binding is not the same as a directive
it's totally different we are binding to
a property of the directive this ng
style property expects to get a
JavaScript object and here we define key
value pairs of the style name as the key
and the value of the style as their well
well you so for example we could find
background color and if you want to use
this notation with the - you have to
wrap it in single quotation marks to
make it a valid JavaScript property name
or you use the camelcase notation
background color like this and then you
could set this to red but I don't want
to set it to red I want to set it to
something depending on the server status
so here we could simply call a method
get color so that is really mixing now
all the things and make it clear that
between the quotation marks we are
executing types of code years therefore
we can of course call a method now get
color is a method we can adhere and get
color should now let's say return green
if the status is online and read
otherwise so I will return something
first I check the server status so this
server status and if this is equal to
online using a ternary expression here I
will return green
otherwise I will return red so get color
we will return green or red and this is
then assigned as the background color
with ng style if we now save this let's
have a look at the result we see indeed
the running server has a green
background and the offline server has a
red one so that is working ng style
allows us to dynamically update that if
I reload you see now Bofur on offline so
both are red now and that is the big
advantage of ng style it allows you to
dine
chemically update the styles and of
course if the server's status here did
change over time it would update the
styling respectively
so this binding we set up here still is
working if the service status here which
is responsible for choosing the right
color changes it updates the style so
that's an G style an attribute directive
added like an attribute and in this case
all the using property binding to
configure it
we saw examples for ng style and ng F
now something related to ng style is ng
class now we learned that ng style
allows us to dynamically assign a style
now I will also add ng class here and
wear ng style allowed us to change the
CSS style itself ng class allows us to
dynamically add or remove CSS classes so
let's create such a class and for this I
will first of all add my Styles here and
I will use backticks to write as over
multiple lines and I will give this a
class name of online in which case I
want to color the text white so that's
all I want to do because I think it's
kind of hard to read the black text on
the green background so back here ng
class also this is the directive also
only works as intended
when using property binding so let's
wrap it in square brackets too and here
we also need to pass a JavaScript object
and that's just the case for this
property of this directive here of
course each property you bind to may
take a different value like disabled
which took true or false so here it's a
JavaScript object and ferengi classes
object works like this we also have key
value pairs the keys are the CSS class
names and the values are the conditions
determining whether this class should be
attached or not so here we have the
online class you could also wrap this in
single quotation marks if you had a
class name with a dash inside of it or
something like this and here well I'm
going to attach this only if the server
is online so only if server status
equals online online here is a string
between single quotation marks now of
course you could also outsource this in
a method you call this service status
equals online check but here I will
write it in line so if this is on line
we should attach the CSS class on line
two is paragraph otherwise it should not
get attached let's view this in a
running application Bo
are offline so none of the two should
have the online CSS class added to it
and indeed I can't find the class on any
of the two
now let's reload and hope that some of
them is offline or online excuse me both
are so let's check it now we see the
online class has been added actually to
both of them because this is how ng
class works it only adds a CSS class if
a certain condition is true and that's
an example for an average built-in
directive and now a built-in attribute
directive
with all these directives learned let's
now have a look at the last built-in
directive for now important one though
it's sad that we can click the ad server
button but we don't actually add service
to our list here right there's list
doesn't grow this list is totally static
we can change this with the ng 4
directive so let's have a look at how it
works
in our service component here we right
now manually add our app server
component twice it would be nicer to
have an array of service which adds
dynamically so in this service component
here I'll add a new property servers and
this is an array and here I could have
my test server and my test server to
maybe and when we trade a new server
here I actually want to access this
array of servers and push a new server
on it and this should of course use the
server name I setup now with this I have
an array of service it would now be
great if we could replicate the app
server component as often as needed to
have a server for each element in the
array so - initially and then a new one
for each server we add we can do this
I'll get rid of the second app server
here and on the first one I will place
another directive with a star because
this is now also a structural directive
changing the dom itself it's the ng 4
directive the ng 4 base syntax looks
like this we define a temporary variable
for inside a loop with let give it any
name you like like server for example
and then off servers service here is the
property we defined in the typescript
file and this will now loop through all
elements in this array and assigned
individual L
to this dynamic server variable so
that's just like you might know this
Lube from a normal well JavaScript code
the for off loop this server variable
can now be used in the template but here
we don't really need it to be honest
we will soon learn in the next course
section how we can pass data to our own
components to output it there so for now
we won't need that but one thing we
should see is that if I save this and we
go back to our application we still see
two because we start with two but if I
add more servers you see our list grows
and we can click this as often as we
want of course the content of the
individual server is still static
because we can't pass the data like the
server name to that component but that
is something we will learn in the next
course section when we dive deeper into
components and we will learn how we can
treat our own properties on components
we can then set from outside a feature
which would be great to have here so
let's dive into this in the next course
section before doing so though let's
practice the things we learned in the
last lectures and then let's also set up
our course project before we then dive
deeper into components and data binding
again so see you there
awesome you made it to the end of the
video which probably means you liked it
and hopefully means you'll learn a lot
about angular for now if you want to
dive deeper as mentioned at the start of
this video feel free to join my full
guide on angular which you can find on
udemy a link with the huge discount as
mentioned can be found in the video
description would be great seeing there
and whatever your decision is hopefully
see you in future videos bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=6a809dda-347a-4187-8a86-91faf94575da"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
