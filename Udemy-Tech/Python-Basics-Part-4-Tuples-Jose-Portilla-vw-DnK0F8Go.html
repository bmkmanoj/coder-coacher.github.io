discussed how you can store Python data
objects using a list or a dictionary now
let's learn about tuples tuples are
actually very similar to a list they're
ordered sequences of objects just like a
list
however there's two key differences one
is that they use a slightly different
syntax than the list they use
parentheses instead of square brackets
here you can see an example of a tuple
we call this variable might tuple and
it's equal to in parentheses 1 comma 2
comma 3 so very similar to lists and
syntax except for using parentheses
instead of square brackets the other
major difference and this is the most
fundamental one is that tuples are what
we call immutable so mutability refers
to the ability to change or alter comes
from the word mutate or mutation once
you've assigned an object to a position
in a tuple you cannot reassign it in a
list you could do this reassignment
however in a tuple you cannot let's
explore how to work with tuples in
python by loading up a jupiter notebook
let's begin by creating an example tuple
we'll say my tuple is equal to and it's
going to be really similar to a list
except now we're using parentheses here
we'll say 1 comma 2 comma 3 and if I
check the type of this object my tuple
it returns back that it's a tuple type
and just like a list you can also use
mixed data types so we could say T is
another tuple where we have a string
mixed in with an integer mixed in with a
float and tuple doesn't mind and you can
use indexing or slicing just like you
would have a list so if I wanted that
letter a I could just use that bracket
notation just like we use the full list
however the key difference here is the
immutability of a tuple so I'm going to
create my list
1 2 3 let's check the type of my list to
confirm that it in fact is a list so it
is and then we still have my original
tuple 1 2 3 1 is the list
1 is a tuple so let's imagine that I
wanted to reassign the first item in my
list so that is the item at index
location 0 to be something new well I
can easily do that by saying my list at
0 is equal to new and then if I check
out my list now I have new comma 2 comma
3 if I try to do the same thing with
that tuple object that created I'm going
to get an error and if I say new here
it's going to say type error the tuple
object does not support item assignment
and that means that I can't add in or
replace the objects that are already
inside that tuple you'll also notice
that once I've created that tuple and I
check out the available methods
it's just counts an index there's no way
I can append something else that's new
it'll say hey tuple has no object or the
tuple object has no attribute append so
that means that there's really only two
methods you can do with a tuple and that
is indexing and counting so I will
create a tuple object a b c and let's
say a again
so I have a B C and a if I wanted to
find out the first occurrence of B I can
say T index pass and B and it will
return back the index location of the
first time B occurs inside this tuple if
I wanted to count how many times in
object occurs inside this tuple I can
say T and then use the count method and
ask it how many times there's a string a
show up in this tuple and it returns
back that it shows up twice now you may
be wondering why would you ever use
tuples since they have this immutability
aspect to them you should use a tuple
for collections or sequences that
shouldn't be changed things like the
dates of the year or user information
where you want the order to remain the
same and let's actually show you an
example of this recall that we were
creating a dictionary so I say a has the
value 1 and B key is gonna have the
value 2 so I have this dictionary when I
called the items of my dictionary I got
back this list or a sort of brackets of
tuples and the reason we're using tuples
here is because this allows me to know
whenever the method or whatever code
that is behind the scenes of this items
called is using tuples because it knows
that this order can't be switched around
so you're using tuples when you want to
make sure that you don't have any
changes occurring so this is basically
almost like a slight security feature of
your data type in the sense that you're
not going to be able to accidentally
reindex something and then reassign it
here I know that the first item this
tuple is going to be the key and the
second item of the tuple is going to be
the value associated with it and there's
lots of built-in functions and methods
in Python that return lists of tuple
items as we've seen here and later on
when we discuss for loops we'll see how
we can use something called tuple and a
packing to work with these functions and
methods that return back list of tuple
objects for now just keep in mind that
tuples the main difference here is that
syntax wise you're constructing them
with a parenthesis and that they do not
support item reassignment they're
immutable objects I'll see you at the
next
